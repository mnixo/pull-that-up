is looking to go to war everybody else is looking to kill them everybody else is looking to take most people in this world just want to get by they want to be healthy they want to have children and have those children be happy and I want to get through the day they want to get through the fucking day they are led by people who are profiting off of the drama and I really nice a one thing this is why this podcast is so important and not to be melodramatic use to go back to the the success of this podcast and the success of Vice and all the stuff is that it's because all of the other shit out there is bullshit this is the whole thing is what happens in mainstream media and and the news cycle is crap and what's happening here and the reason why you have so many people listening to you and supporting you and the reason why vice is growing so rapidly is because we're just regular dudes we're regular guys it's like you know we like we like MMA we like fighting we like having a few drinks you're you yeah and you go out there in the world and you say hold on a second where's the fucking rationality here why do these fuckers have nuclear weapons why the fuck is this happening why are is the fucking world sinking and we're not doing something about I don't understand I'm not like I'm not Jesus on the cross I'm not I'm not trying to be that guy well I'm just going out in the world and going holy fuck and when I say and what's my reason when I say it's the end of the world is because I went to Kashmir I went to the Indian side of Kashmir the Indian said if we have another Mumbai attack we will attack back that then I went to Pakistan I was like why are you still sending these you're training the ISI in the military why are you still sending these guys in India they've said that if you still if you send them in again they're going to attack you and they're like yes because we're going to win you're like nobody is going to fucking win you're going to nuke eat you you're all going to die and the thing is is I keep saying there and it's the same thing in China it's the same thing even the funny shit that we do is like it's the absurdity of the modern condition it's the world has become insane and I'm saying where all the adults say but where's the rationality where is this like we're two regular guys and and by the way we're just sitting here in a with a beautiful oak table having a few drinks Dave Eiland know we're in different day when so many people are resonating with us we're just two dudes talking at but the thing is as so many people you know resonate resident resident why because everyone just coming out of the pond going hold on a second hold on a second what the fuck's going on what if it we're all rational people we're all smart people we all have the internet we fuckin see all this shit's goin on what the fuck's going on and I think that the answers are terrifying because you know what nobody has an answer oh wow it's just this this this this it's not really going to happen because it's that and you know it's just this guy doing this sound like Bryan Callen ha ha ha but pitching for Fox News but the thing is is it's not true liked originally the New York Times says to refuted that uh yeah but it's not true like there is no rationality the answer is more terrifying than the question well jeez why aren't they fuck why do they have nukes because we gave them cuz we're crazy because we're crazy because we so ration I had money they didn't nukes we had no right needed money boom chakalaka boom correct you know what to stay scary real the real scary story is Canada had this thing to can do reactor the failsafe reactor the most safe reactor on earth fucking beautiful reactor the Titanic and Canada is like oh we're the largest donator of corn a dime Canadian by the way I love Kevin we're the largest foreign I said Canadian of fourth donators of foreign aid and then we gave the the reactors to Pakistan and we said now whatever you do don't do anything bad with it and they said oh of course not and you're sitting there going what the fuck what the fuck were you fucking thinking Canada giving them fucking reactors what the fuck were you thinking that's so silly the reactor thing is a real freak out to me and I talked about in my act like deep thing I don't know if I'm allowed to swear by the way what are you talking about I don't know here what's the matter oh you want a cigarette shut it shut it nuts will say that shit I didn't know I didn't know what you're saying I didn't know there's a bad thing that somebody won't not want you to indulge let's be real here I don't know come come on Shane Smith you know I love you like a brother tell me what's going on who doesn't want you indulge you got an issue mrs. mrs. Shayne Skov as perhaps doesn't want he'll be tired cancer or bullets this cigarettes is the last thing she should worry about this dude's going to the Congo in his underwear all right he I'm sorry y'all go you should worry have you gone did you go to the kinda yeah yeah see that's where I draw though I've been to Goma and it's uh right now it's it's it's going fucking crazy the only way I would go to the Congo is if someone absolutely showed me we're going to find apes I could see one of those ages giant we're still working on it's a real animal bro it's a real animal yeah that's something you don't have that's not like a sasquatch eh you did I ever tell you about the David Choe and the dinosaurs yes I watched that episode went they believe there's a brontosaurus in the Congo Hey look there's alligators yeah okay we have we need to wrap our heads around the idea that alligators fucking survived that one alligator but you know I'm reading this Chris Ryan book sex at dawn fascinating fascinating book and he talks about the name you Katan and that what what the name came from is the one of the American or one of the Christopher Columbus's settlers you don't have to worry about waiting for I grew up in comedy clubs and pool halls let that shit go don't worry about it he he asked them what is the name of your land and the the guy said something like well you know in you know whatever the Mayan tongue is and so they said Yucatan okay you could talk that was like it's close - turns out when scholars reviewed what the actual original word was I guess they wrote it down somewhere it means in Mayan I don't understand you ha ha so when people go down to Cancun and they go get their freak on from Spring Break they're there in the I don't understand you peninsula what is it for Ryan that motherfucker I guess like when they went in you they said what where are we in the like Mumbai in like Bombay perfect exactly perfect love it where are you Beijing Peking love it well like Greece they don't call themselves Greece right they don't have another name yeah how√≠s there's a couple different countries like that Japan isn't it home yeah yeah oh that's another place where we just shot Greece hole the vodka yeah Greece is completely insolvent is that the case well it is and and you know so we just shot the riots in Greece France Spain Italy and actually the rise of the neo-nazis in Germany but Jesus with the sack they're back don't call it a comeback there she can fucking Nazis again in Germany really Germans yeah really folks come on you got the Internet you got 4G you motherfuckers actually what's what faster internet than us do they bring that than us yeah no no this year are we online at all why I found out that you probably have DSL and which is like the worst internet in the world right and so I put it down to like mobile bandwidth style sorry it's such a low right I am I said but is it working barely you're a technological genius well he's a bad motherfucker and without him I'd be lost and he has great he had all great he has great t-shirts and I want one he is a great taste in women so it's a bad motherfucker that Brian Redman yeah so you you mean look man I love you but every time we get together we start talking to them and glue my fucking shit my pants and I want to believe that there's a way out of this I want to believe that I know the rich and human there is and I've got to say this I've got to say this because it's up to guys like you guys like me and guys like everyone listen to this podcast to say we have the power to that's a lot of responsibility well he how to get high and watch The Hobbit however you want to get high and watch The Hobbit however I'm going to say this publicly and online Joe Rogan who's a famous dude who does UFC and TV shows and comics and comic genius all the stuff he does a podcast you know pays for a fucking studio pays for oak tables pays for state-of-the-art equipment all this stuff to do a podcast to tell the fucking truth and by the way that's fucking admirable and by the way everybody out there who has a camera who has an iPhone who has a fucking YouTube connection everyone can do it and there one should do it because it's time to start fucking changing shit because you know what shit is fucked up they are doing it and that's the beautiful that's the beautiful is there's a bunch of people that we've introduced but via this podcast like Daniella bolelli and the guys from London real who came down so fast and those guys are really popular now though they're podcasts are popular and it's it's instead of you going through this traditional system of not being about the the value of your contribution but rather being about like who's hot who's not who's it and who's like fucking dating who and all the nonsense that we get roped up in as primates as social primates and to instead say the fuck that what I would like to say to everyone who's listening this Joe Rogan red man over there is fucking the technological genius you guys are doing something that is purely democratic that is incredibly fucking important incredibly useful it's the reason why every time I come to LA I do this because you guys are giving guys like me and everybody else a fucking platform to say hey by the way I don't want to be all doom and gloom what I want to say that what but hold on what I want to do is say this shit is happening it's real and people should know about it and we can do shit about it and by the way it's not just us here in America people in India can do shit about it people in Pakistan can do shit about it and by the way youth are fuckin pissed off they're upset the politicians have failed them the rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer and what we're trying to do is bring back journalism in the sense that journalism is saying this shit is fucked up and we collectively have to solve it otherwise you have kids our kids our kids are going to be fucked yeah I run through these various scenarios in my head about the future of humanity and the only thing that gives me hope is the access to ideas and information that are available today just for me what I know about me you know with a phone I can pretty much answer almost any question I have about anything in the world in within a couple of hours of sitting there reading shit all you need is a goddamn fuck you're a guy that doesn't have to do this you don't have to take your time out you don't have to pay all this money to set this that's not that much funny well okay if any fairly reasonable and it's a hard and it's money and it's time every day and you're setting up this shit by the way more people should be doing it and more people should be doing shit because I'll even think about it that way I mean the way I think about it is first of all we were doing it at my house and then we were doing at Brian's place that he set up desk wat studios in the ice house and I thought about it I was like why am i doing my shit in my house like let's let's take this to the next level it's so I was inspired by like Brian putting together this crazy studio not using it for you know how long will be there bro I was a year anniversary last month and bob-fish are you beautiful motherfucker you the guy who owns that place is just such a sweetie they're all sweeties they're the wages are sweeter ease but look what is nice but look at what you built it up and I've got to say everybody out there should take this as an example because everybody can do shit yeah I'm by the way you're doing shit you don't have to do shit you're doing shit see that's where it gets to that's where I wanted sort of straighten mama I don't think that I it's not like I don't have to this note there's no motivation to do this other than joy other than fun other than the fact that I love talking to guys like you like how how else would I organize a three-hour conversation with you and I the only way to make it enticing is I have to fucking broadcast online to get to meet someone like you like tomorrow we're doing that uh John McAfee the guard the virus guy who's you know in Belize on a run yeah we're doing that guy I couldn't get to talk to that guy in real life why would he talk to me but you tell more truth here on your podcast then MSNBC and Fox put together and I've got to say that's the future of journalism that is it's it's it's people regular people like you me who actually give a shit and who have actually learned stuff and because of you go around the world and you see shit I go around the world nice you should we see this stuff and we go hey this is ridiculous yeah change is incredibly difficult it's incredibly difficult for people change it's incredibly difficult for systems of government or system monetary systems to change changes in cred Blee hard and resisted tooth and claw and the people that are involved in MSNBC and CNN and all these people that perpetrate all this nonsense journals not I don't fault them I don't because as a guy who's been with it this is my position as a guy who's been in the system of television before I've been on two different TV shows I was on a sitcom for five years and then I was on fear factor for six years I kind of see I got a pretty good view of the whole system of creating things in the network its insurmountable it either has to collapse or be absorbed by the Internet those are the only options but it as it stands is bureaucratic there's too many people involved too much decision making it's not it's to dip it's too expensive and difficult to put together a fucking sitcom usually if you look if you look at your audience and you look at what you're doing and and other people like you are doing you have millions and millions of followers and I would say this I would say look you have as many and by the way more you have an audience that's actually willing to do shit and willing to participate and then they you know they tweet and they and they Facebook and you know get on the socials and I would say this is like if you look at Fox which is aging at 67 68 there those people are dying and going to die out this is the future and and what you're doing is you're saying I'm going to put my flag in the sand and I'm going to say you know what I'm gonna fight you've been in TV you've been successful you're still on TV you're still success what you're killing it and but yet still you'll take your time out of your day to come here and say we're going to try we're going to do some funny stuff we're going to some regular stuff we're going to this and that but we're going to try to fucking at least say hey this is what's going on with McAfee this is what's going on in Pakistan this is going to whatever you have me on you have other people on and I got to say look that is the future of journalism because that is the only way today that we're going to get to the truth and I look I I agree with everything you just said and the reason why do it is because people like you are out there the reason why I'm so committed to doing a podcast like this and the reason why Brian and I are committed to keeping them free is what we we benefit from it just as much as everyone else does we benefit from it from our own conversations I mean Brian and I were just talking about simulation theory today you know it's and it's because it's brought up by so many brilliant people on the podcast that you know we've had these like freaky discussions about it it's a this podcast has been an incredible fuckin thing like I can't ever take not only kind I don't feel like I can take any responsibility for it I can't take any accolades for it because all it is is is it's really I'm feel like completely like a conduit I feel like if I could tune into guys like you or had less trout on last year last week Survivorman you know and I've had Alex gray that the brilliant visionary artists on if I can get a forum where these people can talk through the internet and reach all these other people like I who else has that opportunity I know if you had it you would do it if anybody else had it they would do it if you're thinking in your right mind and you had a million people that we're paying attention or whatever the fuck it is now and you knew some shit you'd want to tell people some shit this is but I'm allowed to say it's admirable and if I listen that's not nearly as admirable we're chilling here in the fucking valley right at our in the air-conditioned studio you're out there and Mumbai do about what I'd like to say is life is good right when our life has been good and we got to kind of get out of jail free card when I got out of college I used to say I'm never going to live in a house as nice as my parents or drive a car as nice and my parents and gen-x my generation sort of got a get out of jail free card but Gen Y is going to have to pay the bill and you know and so saying I think it's our responsibility to say we know the fucking problems we know and yeah it's going on we know that this is a fucking problem and we have to go out there and say look this is a problem I don't know the solutions again I'm not Jesus on the cross but at least people and this is why this is what gives me hope is that people fundamentally I believe are good and I also believe people are fundamentally smart and people fundamentally want to do the right thing well I think people fundamentally want to be good because love feels better than he like if I have a little tiny dispute in my life I don't know about you but the way I feel about especially amongst my circle friends or amongst people I do business with or work with if there's any sort of a tiny dispute there's a ripple in my force and I don't like it I don't like that feeling and I want to resolve it is lovingly and as kindly and as apologetically as I can I always feel like that and some people never get to a position where they really feel at peace with their place in the world and how they interact with the people they can't whether it's because they're too in debt or they're in a fucking terrible neighborhood or they grew up with a crazy mother whatever it is you took a bad career path stuck in a fucking abusive John position whatever the fuck it is that locks you into your reality your existence it's very difficult for people that are in a torturous position to look at possibilities and options and to look at the possibility and options that this might not be the correct way to live life and that in reality my narrow-minded view has set me on this insurmountable path of ultimate failure and there's no way to accumulate enough shit in this life if you're a temporary being there is no way so if that is a focus of your existence accumulate but that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy some shit doesn't mean you shouldn't like get a fucking Samsung Galaxy s3 and go ooh because all that shit's bad ass to the reality of like something like when you when you hear people talk about I was having a conversation with someone they started talking about the law of attraction oh it's the law of attraction you bring it into your life it's a law of attraction like well yeah maybe but maybe babies die and drive-bys too like the woods what's realistic is let's look at this whole thing the reality that we exist in let's look at this whole thing and be honest about it and say we woke up in the middle of a dream you know the the American the whatever the fuck you are with the Japanese man who's 50 years old who wakes up when his alarm clock goes off today and looks at this world this world woke up in motion and the people there's too many of them first of all there's too many of them for ever to ever communicate that no one can no one understands when it fucked anybody saying there's too many different languages there's no Universal acknowledgement of our plight and we are headed to doom ultimately there's no way if we continue along a certain path that it doesn't completely explode in our face whether it's overpopulation or whether it's pollution or nuclear disaster there's a certain amount of stops along the way until the whole thing ends well I think I agree with you and I think that our generation years of mine has come out of the pond and we've had a good life and I love I love this country because I came down here and built to me I like your country better I know I do well shit hits the fan I'm moving to Canada for fucking Shore I don't think care if it's Montreal I'll deal with that snow I'll take it Toronto I'll get a snow blower in but warm quote but the thing is is you sit there and you say we came out of the pond we realized this shit is happening yes you want to live a good life I want shit to get better precisely because I've had such a good life and I'm not a doom and gloom guy I'm a party guy I like to drink I like to travel I like to eat I like to do stuff I like to learn to go to all these different places the reason why I'm like hey hold on these guys want to nuke each other or how you hold on the world is sinking or hey hold on this shit's happening that's going to fuck everybody up is because I like my life is because I like guys like you is because I like where we've gotten to to date the problem with it is is that you sit there and you say okay I don't want the next generation to not have that to not be able to go outside swim in a river go fishing do all that stuff and and bright now we're at we're at literally the sort of breaking point we're at that inflection point of we are we can fix it we can solve it we're smart we're good people want to do it and if you you know follow this I'm sure you do the people who follow you and and and if you look at what they say on Twitter and you look at what they say on the Facebook people are fucking angry and they're down and they're happy not wonders you said did not represented and the thing is notice what's happening especially global let alone in this country but what's happening globally is that the people with the power are disenfranchised because the systems that are in place are set up as such that they can't be represented so what this is is this is true grassroots democracy and by the way I hope to god it continues and gets bigger and bigger and I was making a joke earlier this is the first podcast from here and I'm like I'm going to look back 20 years from now and say this was the first podcast that changed the world because this is the root of journalism which is the root of democracy well I think that the people that are in the position of power that are doing these horrible things we really need to figure out how to heal those motherfuckers because I think we have to figure out how to get them the fuck out you got to get them the fuck out but you have to get them to fuck we've got to discourage that type of behavior in the future I mean if you want to be a real hippie and a total idealist you would say that there's got to be a way that almost everybody can change and that these people that are in this positions these positions of power that are looking at things like war and economic attacks on countries or embargoes or all these different various things that people do that really can cause unbelievable irreparable harm to communities and families and like that we need to figure out a way to get those people to look at things differently and say your motivation is off or you your motivation is based on so you don't shoot a primate shit it's based on some ancient primate shit where you are running away from Jaguars and who had to be the most vicious motherfucker to survive and that stuff manifests itself today millions of years later in the male dominance mentality and that mentality is not best suited for attacks against your fellow man and it can be conquered it can be conquered it can be understood it can be understood in your mindset you will be happier person if you do not behave in that manner and you won't be any happier if you get more money there's a certain amount of money where doesn't matter well I have got to say also that if you look at it and say I want real people I want people like me yes who have had a drink too many who've danced you drugs who've done ever who've had a real life if you have you know guys like you know Romney who's like squeaky-clean and whatever I'm like I don't want a robot representing me yes because I'm not a robot I'm flawed and fucked up and I've been through way more than you will see but the whole thing is is I want someone who's human well he's I want someone who's been to shit and who smoked fucking dope when he was fucking nine years old and you want someone who's emerged I want someone who know that what the fuck is going on Romney could be saved with mushrooms mushrooms and Thai hookers and just get Romney on a fucking island and just just give him some mushrooms and let him understand that this is this is a fucking dream man this is one frame in an infinite movie that goes on forever and the own control you have whatsoever is to enjoy it to increase harmony to spare listen to the happiness and the thing is this you were talking about you know talking to females or talking to Taliban or talking to this or that the thing is is if you just talk to these motherfuckers everybody has a point right everyone has a point of view everyone has a point and if you actually say look you know by the way for example when I was in Pakistan they were like we are super mad that you let the innocence of Muslims come out like America you know sponsor that whatever and you're like that video you're talking about and you say you understand that there's millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day every fucking day on YouTube there's no government regulation there's no you know Obama's not sitting there going ha ha we really got them now and they could not believe that they were just like no you guys have done this thing and that's why we're sure and there were people killed and there's been you know violence because of this and now there's a whole you know because a lot of the people are illiterate that the Imam say well the America is doing this and this is part of their policy whatever and you're like this just a bunch of fruitcakes who did a fucking thing and all of a sudden now people are dying and there's you know whole militias being mobilized because of this and at that point you're like if people just actually fucking you know which I do I say look I'm going to tell you I live there I do this I have to the most popular channels on YouTube people just upload shit it just fucking happens it's not like government policy it's not propaganda it's not this it's not that they don't fucking get it and if you just actually just said look dude here's the way it is here's the reality of the situation which nobody does that's the whole fucked up thing is nobody sits there and says this is actually what happens this is the truth well you not say you're incorrect it's not all funny it's you you do it you're motherfucker your own fucking channel does it what are you talking about it's there's there's guys like you there's this there's the congressmen that are coming up like Daniel seaman the congressional representative or a candidate rather who is completely honest and well-read and young there's there's a whole group of people that are coming up now there's a bunch of people that are broadcasting whether it's the Young Turks or whether it's you know any a number you know Alex Jones to a large extent a lot of what Alex Jones says although absolutely ridiculed in the 1990s shows to be true from 2012 I've been Alex's friend for a long fuckin time and a lot of people think he's crazy and he's fucking crazy that's why they think he's crazy but he's crazy in a beautiful way and he's right a lot of the time and that's sort of that's sort of understood now and there's enough information now that people have their head collectively cocked sideways yes I think the whole United States is like wait a minute there's something I tweeted yesterday that someone tweeted me and I retweeted it was 33 different conspiracy theories that turned out to be correct right and when you go and look at them you go oh okay this is just this is sort of how it's always been so what we have to do is figure out how to get these people that are thinking this way in this crazy position of power where they whatever group however many agree to do something totally immoral and for-profit I yes that's really the only real reason whatever comes down to it we have to figure out how to reach people like that and to let them know that this is a false pattern your mind is locked in some nonsensical thinking that is based on the predatory instincts of animals that had to survive from fucking Cougars and jaguars and bears and shit there was a ruthlessness that's designed into the DNA to make sure that the animal procreates and that can be overcome yeah and that we have to understand that the only the only way to true happiness is to look at each other collectively as if it's us living another life you look at every person you meet is if it's you living a complete also just just to do it just and I agree with you hundred percent because sounds like hit people no no but but but you look at you and you say look here's a guy you know UFC guy came up Taekwondo chub use of your fighting guy you know all this stuff you obviously work two guys here sitting here were not hippies but what we're coming to is is saying look we came up you know we came up hard we fought we did all this stuff and now we're realizing this shit and we're saying hey you know we've seen this we've learned from this is why I get to go back to it is I don't want politicians representing me yeah who don't understand this yeah which is I came up hard I came up on the streets I learned this shit I learned that the hard way by going to these places and what I've realized is exactly what you said which is unless we overcome our base desire which is I hate you I'm going to fucking bomb you we're all dead we're all dead because now it's not a knife it's not a gun it's not an RPG it's not a tank it's a nuclear fucking warhead and when we start fucking trying to fucking be alpha male with a nuclear warhead like AQ Khan then we're fucking where's that guy is he's still alive he's still alive that motherfucker he's still a lousy whereas he's in Pakistan Jesus Christ and he's the reason why there's the proliferation of nuclear fucking does he have like Nolan twenty bitches around him just dancing in their underwear at all times you don't do you think so but no be a fucking man with it at least you got to be a conqueror be a fucking old-school Conan he has a bunch of ISI guys around them at all times because of those guys those guys so the ISI is the CIA of Pakistan and they started the Taliban and they are the guys who are basically running Pakistan and they are the guys who are becoming increasingly radicalized and they're the guys who are saying we are going to bomb India we need to get those people all on mushrooms so what we need to do is just say you're not allowed yeah well that's you're not allowed to blow up the world you cannot do it and by the way if we had politicians who were doing the right thing you would go to India go to Pakistan and say you're not allowed which means that we have to say Russia is not allowed we are not allowed nobody's loved because again to go back to it if you're playing roulette and double zero means the end of the fucking world you should be playing fucking roulette languages and so take that double zero off the fucking board at least if you play Russian roulette you have five chances to not get shot in the head when you're playing world dominance it's like how many opportunities you have to start a nuclear war exactly it's really not a question but not a question of if it's a question of when yeah there's not a whole lot of chambers it's the whole thing is fucking ridiculous because it's people locked up in this idea that somehow or another conquering makes things better and somehow another controlling the resources makes things better and is this all these observations now from people that are paying attention to what's going on in Afghanistan about minerals minerals and how long they've known that Afghanistan is is in incredible deposit mineral minerals or Congo yeah what's happening what's happening now in the Congo is 100 percent due to coltan they wouldn't be fighting they wouldn't have all the money they will Colt ran coltan Colton and coltan is a is a rare earths and rock that makes also your iPhone your seong your your iPad they all need Colton to actually work and the majority of Colton actually is in Congo and so what's happened now is this this continual warfare you know and it's I believe now the sixth bloodiest war in the history of humanity is all happening because of iPads iPhones Samsung's all these things we're buying them this is the whole thing we're disconnected I mean I grew up thinking or whatever happens in Africa happens in Africa that's their problem my problem and then you realize oh that fucking war is happening because I have an iPhone 5 and that's that's the reality of the situation it's sort of analogous to the human experience if you really boy that sounds gay hippie and gay at the same time so we're really having a love trying to pick up a confused dude in the new in the new studio the human if you look at the human experience and you look at where we're at right now at the highest levels and let's perceive that the highest levels are innovation and technology and that the fact that we can broadcast this with minimal cost even though it's kind of sucking right now powerful AT&T the why did you get DSL I don't know man I had a fucking who did this manager handle this how old is this business manager I don't know never met him oh listen do you need a young kid to do that shit I I got shit I need to deal with this is not one of them you throwing me off where was I minerals are bitter observable you know whatever what is it important that I finished my sentence I have nothing to say ladies and gentlemen of grandstanding clearly I'm trying to somehow another project project better ideas through whiskey through whiskey and marijuana allegedly allegedly Adam I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing folks I sound like Colin Quinn there you've got to irrigate yeah go to irrigate the mine yeah that's important people don't drink or I've never been drunk I don't really like you nor do I trust you okay I'm going to be honest I trust drunks and trust dry drunks I trust you're just saying that because I'm here no no I'm just being honest III appreciate sober people don't get me wrong but if you have not at least experienced whisky with all the people raving about it would you not dive in the waters at least once how stubborn are you you've never had a drop of alcohol who are you partying with man that's ridiculous if your friends have kept you from a drop of alcohol they're assholes it's usually people have had too many drops of alcohol it seems like everyone I know is in a a out here well you know what the issue is slightly biological and that's something that I'm willing to admit 100% because I have friends that I trust dearly like Fitzsimmons Greg Fitzsimmons is Greg and I have been friends since we were in our early 20s I think we met when I was 21 and Greg was probably the same age Greg has always had he's he's a legit alcoholic and it's in the sense of he could have a drink today and he could be fine but there will be a pull a biological pull that's reinforced by his relatives it's reinforced by generations and I have many friends that have this issue and I do not discount it my friend tape Fletcher he's a brilliant guy and Tate has a problem substances he cannot yeah you know he's like I go could you even like take a look a baby hit of a joint he goes maybe or I could wake up in an alleyway naked and not know what the fuck happened and I'm not willing to make that jump I'm not willing to take that chance there's biological weirdness two people fucking get they die from peanuts yeah okay a person could be allergic to peanuts and die I would never discount that but I think that generally speaking there's a mentality of a non chance taking boring bullshit that comes with the I've never had a drink people there's a few examples are contrary like Penn Jillette has never had a drop of alcohol the only time he's ever had any sort of medication is when he's been injured after surgery like some sort of a painkiller he's a brilliant guy and I love talking to him he's one of the rare examples most people that have never even fucked up you never you never tried to get laid when it was preposterous you've never tried to pick up a girl there's no way medically you can get an erection if you're not if you've never been 21 years old and thrown up in the back seat of a cab who are you who are you and who do you party with but I also think that it's again to go back to the people who are talking to is it's a way to sort of distance yourself from all the norms right and to say I'm going to question what the fuck's going on I think and maybe some conspiracy theories are not true and maybe some are true but at least we have to question them oh for sure there's a lot that aren't true for sure there's not but we have to question them yes and that's the whole thing we have to question shit that's our that's what we are as humans we have to fucking question shit and we also have to say how do we get better it's just a funny thing to say but I'm not endorsing alcohol consumption but there's a certain humility that comes from being an educated drunk well you step back and kind of you know you just realize like look this is all for you know like Tony Bourdain you know Anthony Bourdain I've had the pleasure of having on the podcast he's a guy just like you a regular dude you talk to him but there's a certain like having a drink with you have it a drink with him having a drink with anyone who's just a real guy anyone who's where there's a moment that comes where you've had a couple of drinks well you look at each other and go ah we're fucked up who knows it's crazy but he's a perfect example of a dude he had a cooking show on the Travel Channel well before that he's a chef yeah he was she wrote a book in the book it's so attention so it told is it crazy on the chair but what the hell happens in restaurant exactly but he had it he had a cooking show on on a Travel Channel nothing and nothing and he turned it in to a political statement and he turned it into trying to tell the truth and he turned it into we're going to eat some food but what the fuck is really going on yes with real people yes and I think again there's a lot there's a whole movement there's you there's him there's me there's but there's like you know 100 million yes there's millions of us are just all around us just now yeah of Technology and I think that you know him and I believe he built the Travel Channel on his what about Bert Kreischer how do you feel about her Bert Bert Bert calm okay well I'm just to finish with with Anthony Bernie I would say that that guy that guy went out into the world and and talked about shit that you should talk about on a channel that would never talk about that shit otherwise a channel by the way that's very conservative owned by script yeah which is the I serve scripts scripts yeah so travel channels on beside prescriptions no it's like Sanskrit are IPPs it's a very Christian fundamentalist and he takes a lot of heat and he gets a lot of shit and they tell him not to do stuff and he says fuck you I'm gonna do it anyway because he wants to fucking tell the truth and I got to give it up to him he has a lot of fucking courage in their defense in their defense I do understand the Travel Channel it started to try to reevaluate their position and maybe reach out because I heard they're interested in Ari Shaffir because though some of their executives saw him kill at the DC improv and so they sobered a bird ain't like look he opened the door all scripts is super super conservative super Christian their poster child is a dude who goes out in the world and says you will eat some food will cook some shit but I'm going to tell you the fucking truth about what's good you know what he did he he said I'm going to show you some cool shit yeah I'm gonna show you some cool music I'm gonna show you some cool bands and I'm gonna keep are gonna do it all about and people are gonna talk about what's really going on and people are gonna cut by the way watch the Travel Channel okay I Bert Kreischer I love him to death I would totally watch any show that he's on but I never watched a Travel Channel before Anthony Bourdain was never I never even thought about watering it I don't know how I even tuned in to his show I suspect that I was just channel surfing yeah I was just flipping through channels and all of a sudden there's this guy's talking about Vietnam and how much he loves Vietnam yeah and I remember going who is this crazy fuck oh yeah oh dear maybe uh Liberia he's eaten camel yeah and he's loving it yeah and but most importantly he approaches the whole thing with this this really palpable feeling of humility and honesty and you know pi i drunkenness occasion and it's it's it's not just admirable it's it's enticing it's attractive it pulls me you know it's like your shows all of your shows man I found out about vice because of the the Hinemoa keppa sewed the guy who lives in the Arctic where's he living is like North East Alaska shot like that he lives in the most remote part of the of the world he's the he lives he's the most remote human being in the world there's um I have a message board on my website and the message board is before Twitter it's been around so it's like 1998 my friend Andrew started the message board and it's been this incredible like magnet for fuck and weirdos and a lot of cool people but what's what's been really fascinating that Twitter sort of surpassed it in a way just because of the sheer access but what my message board became was this with this strange area where cool shit would be drawn to so they would post these things these threads about shit you would never find out on your own just the average person who's not connected to community you're never going to find it what do you read you even look at vice.com why would what would you be googling that would connect you to the series someone put up this this link to this video and I watched this guide it's got frozen caribou hanging from a fucking tree nice auam and cooking them and your guys that were there who just blown away by this experience of hanging out with this dude who lives in a 100 foot square shack in the fucking most hostile environment known to man and to see that he was not not only was he not alone but that he was cut there was no narration he the narration was just sort of describing how they got there was no but it was never it was never any judgement on people or the scenario and when I found really fascinating about it I was like you got to know a guy with all the and hind mole has lived here for 65 years he's content wandering the Rosen countryside hoping to spot a caribou yeah is he happy only hind mode truly knows you didn't do that you you you instead inserted intelligent people into a alternative sort of a situation that sounds over below in each other no easily like bro yeah glad and fucking watches one live well the serious each other senses is it's because we practice a type of journalism called immersion ISM where we go we immerse ourselves in the actual story and we just press record you guys changed this podcast I want you to know that for sure 100% that that episode and the subsequent episodes that are watched all the different you guys changed because I was like this guy is fucking your urine you're there you're actually there you know you're really going to write when I was making fun of kissing someone's day I guess it's what are you get but I will say talking about Twitter is after I do this podcast you get so much response from people who give a shit yeah and people who are like saying this shit like the truth and the blew my mind and this and that matter and you realize like you know we're guys just you know talking about shit whatever and they're going this is I learned more on that podcast and Fox and MSNBC fucking CNN and everybody all put together and that's the tragedy it's it's great for us it's the tragedy because we're just regular dudes going okay this is what the fuck is happening I don't think it's a tragedy man I think it's the the normal chain of progression and I think it's a natural it's a natural system and I think that you don't get to be you unless you've seen Burt Reynolds get a crazy facelift right you don't get to be you until you've seen all the most preposterous shit that people have done you don't get to be you until you read all the crazy accounts of nonsensical violence on the internet the crazy revolutions in Arab Spring and all over the world and all the things you physically experience by actually being in these places where there are chaotic events that are just uncontrollable by the population it's out of it but it doesn't mean anything unless people watch it doesn't mean anything unless there's about it doesn't mean right but you're you're compelled like you you can't you you can't even take credit for what you doing because you're compelled you're compelled by the natural order of the universe the natural order of the universe is to move in a progressive direction and a more understanding and more comprehensive enlightened direction that's all of our ideas the idea is not to maintain the science of the 1700s the idea is to figure out how to you know how to get on Mars and create an atmosphere so we can have a new plan in case this one gets hit by an asteroid the idea is that it consistently move forward and I think we're just caught in a struggle of that happening and my real hope for the world like you know all that shit about a CI the people that believe that you can manifest reality they know your secret and the idea that you know your own mind and the more you focus on things maybe maybe maybe it's just the fact that you're not paying attention to what you could do positively and that's what impacts the world and positively we've got to figure out how to do is to change the mindset of all the people in the people that are in positions of power instead of fighting them and attacking them and try to understand the fact that the human animal is incredibly frustrated we don't know what's going on we have these fucking bodies that are exactly the same as pre-internet pre movies Prix cars ping planes and it's all happened so quickly all around us that we haven't had the chance to really as a superorganism take in all of the knowledge and distribute it in a way that where we we govern over the consciousness of the population in a fair and ethical way that keeps everybody happy but I think ultimately that that is a possible scenario for sure it has to be it has to be if we don't believe that then we're really fucked I don't think because I keep saying Dave Mugu I don't think this is doom and gloom I think this is positive because as long as we know what the fuck is going on we can work towards doing something about it the problem is is we didn't know what the fuck was going on because nobody fucking told us that's a perfect way of describing it that's it perfectly describing it the real problem is that we were living in some crazy movie we since the 1950s we have been locked into some sort of crazy version of the world that is in many ways based on fiction and the real issue is whether the world of the worlds remember in the world the worlds you got a peso no gotta go no no we didn't we had I'm gonna go get a drink but I didn't want you to win it the War of the Worlds freaked fucking people out if you don't know what it is Orson Welles in like who knows when the fuck it was Alex wants get out of here but it's not happening bitch take a seat don't worry about your previous commitments they're not as interesting the War of the Worlds was the first time where human beings were able to be tricked into thinking by Orson Welles that there was an attack by alien beings like people freaked out and it's really difficult to discern how much of it is bullshit how much how much of it actually happened because they say there were suicides who knows what the actual statistics were you know we're talking about the 1930s or whatever the fuck it was but the reality is that human beings were not prepared for the information that was coming at them they weren't prepared that wasn't an that wasn't a regular part of their life where they had grown accustomed to having this fakery planted on them it's not like today with the onion you know like every now and then I'll retweet an article and it turns out to be like some new fake onion like some this bunch of dudes like think that the onion is cool so they create their own bullshit news story those motherfuckers and you retweet them but that's to be expected the people that existed before the internet or before those are the people that sort of set this scenario they set the momentum of our culture and they did not have access to this shit we have now the idea that we're so hung up on the the brilliant wisdom of some people that lived in the 1700s and created the Declaration of Independence which by the way was written on fucking hemp the first drought that the fact that we're committed to the ideology these people that lived they didn't have cars or 2,000 years ago that's when religion started and ever since then everything else is a cult but 2,000 years ago that's when we knew what the fuck was going on I gotta juggle my act about Romney that it's a cult we know who wrote it right oh he's a call because he we can it's not like we have to go back to some fucking shit they found in Qumran that was written on animal skins this is like we know the guy he was his name was Joseph Smith and he was only 14 I mean this is not that confusing like you're a fucking cult man and he don't he found the book of Latter day Saints in his backyard but you know what's beautiful about the the Mormon cult is that what I've learned from my personal experiences is that there are certain people in this life and although I don't feel it's justified to a lot of people there's certain people who do get by better if they follow like at least a scaffolding of morality sure some sort of something something that lets them believe that at the very top there's a cherry and that cherries God and he's right up there on top of the whipped cream and just gotta get I think you know that's the problem is that if you look at just we were talking about global warming earlier and you say okay yeah the shit's fucked up the world is thinking we're not going to believe in that because of god you're like yeah but you're gonna die and your kids are gonna die and it's going to be bad if we don't just say this is the thing that is bad that's happening in ascent no because it's God and whatever and they want and I think it's this yearning to have there's a rational being who has a plan for all of us well the fact of the matter is is we are creating our reality and we are not a rational entity humanity isn't rational humanity is irrational and complex and fucked-up and weird but at some point somebody's got to come up and say yeah we're rational where we are given but there are certain things that we do which are self-destructive and by the way they have to stop for example if you have the ability to destroy the fucking world which is my world you're destroying my world right and you're you know halfway across the world over there if that's even a possibility that no is the answer no I'm not gonna let that happen so that's why I keep preaching on this stuff because when I went there and I said Bill Clinton said it's into the world by the way and I where'd ya and let me say so that when he left the presidency he said that is the reason why Kargil war the war between India and Pakistan was the glimpse of the end of the world and then he got his dick sucked by young and Wow holla so so from that's why so when I white takes blows out some interns so fuck my head is near why not so at least enjoy that sweet release he draw be merry uh buffets eat drink and be merry yeah the problem with that is is when we went back we realized oh it's fucking way worse than when he said it was the end of the world so hold on hold on the whole thing is is though is we can stop it we can say fuck it fuck it we can't just we just have to say there is there can be no you know intercontinental or ballistic or nuclear warheads there can be no because what you're saying just so everybody understands what you're saying then is as long as that technology is there it will go to Iran it will go to Pakistan it will go to Congo it will go to Libya it will go because the technology is there right and what happens when Qaddafi now Qaddafi he's gone but what happens when Qaddafi has warheads what happens when a Q Khan has warheads what happens when when Iran has words when Israel attacks Iran because they can't have a nuclear Iran what's going to happen what will happen when they attack around everybody knows everybody knows what will happen when they attack Iran and it's going to be a fucking catastrophe however it's nothing it's zero compared to what's happening in India Pakistan Israel and Palestine is like you know like I guess when you're like 2021 and you have that one couple that just won't fucking break up and they keep fighting and they keep asking it for advice you know with Rotella bro what do you think I should tell her I don't think she'd fucking run I know there's people now hahaha stupid shit well yeah there's a lot of them that use that as a distraction right don't think don't think you aren't all conflicts ultimately some form of distraction because if if the the Israelis looked at the Palestinians that are suffering on these poor people that are trying to make this sort of home for themselves in is Gaza region this very dangerous and hostile region what if they treated them all as Israelis what if they treated them all is just fellow humans what if instead of lumping them into groups based on ideology and who believes what old crazy shit what if they just looked at them as that could be a cousin's I mean that would instantly change the whole thing right the idea that we need to exist in a conflict scenario is that the problem that's the real issue I don't agree with that I have a neighbor I don't even know this motherfucker and he wanted me to chop down my trees but he's still nice I say hi do I want to drive by I had a convert the only conversation I've ever had with this guy was a conflict I don't hate the dude you know I want him to be happy just don't be crazy let me loan your motherfucker I'll give you a hug come here give me a hug what are you nuts you know come on let's go have a drink you know that's what we should treat the whole world can approach other human beings like that it's just we have to get past this ingrain scenario that we have in our head which is that war is a part of nature and nature is unsurmountable it is what it is you got except men are going to want to be Philander and you know there's going to be conquests and swords and fucking rockets but if you go if you go to Mexico and you see what's happening there now it's the rule of the thug if you go to Pakistan it's the rule of the thug if you go to Congo it's the rule of the thug why because conflict breeds lowest-common-denominator it breeds I have a gun and I'm willing to shoot it right and whoever that's those aren't high thinking people those aren't people thinking we're going to save the world those aren't people thinking you know the world is sinking those aren't people thinking we could you know destroy the environment by by having a nuclear standoff what they're thinking is I'm going to gain power because I have a bunch of guys you know young guys you generally young men with guns if you look at what's happening in Europe right now this is what's terrifying is you go to Spain and you say Spain you know old country educated country you know EU country 50% of young people are unemployed so you've taken away their future we were just shooting there 6 million people came out and fucking shut the whole country down that's people who are pissed off really pissed off while you were filming there what happened riots what would the eval well they're about us anti-austerity so it's it's young people saying we're fucked but I mean there's riots in Paris and I don't know where else Tara tea means what does that mean so you know Spain is fucked economically is fucked economically what's happening there this is what's really terrifying is that in in in so prolonged economic crisis so the recession now the last time this happened was the depression now what happened because of the depression was the rise of radical political solutions ie communism or fascism so now what's happened is you have the rise of the Communist Party in in in Greece and to counteract that you have the Golden Dawn which are full-on fascists who now are you know 14% of the government you say the Golden Dawn Golden Dawn are yeah that's what I heard the Golden Dawn they have they do you say the Golden Dawn will pretend because it's ridiculous whatever Golden Dawn yeah okay they do that they do the Nazi salute they have the swastika as their thing imagine they had a big fucking thing on their shirt was big golden dick frothy dongs would it be look would it be hard or would that be offensive for military would have to be like well they have the support of the military and the police and everywhere we went was anti-immigration anti-eu anti decide today and what's happening in Europe this is what's terrifying is because you have an economic crisis you have the rise of communist and fascist so for example in France you have a very far left government and the second party is Pro national fascist and you sit there and you say okay the exact same political situation exactly that started World War two is happening today in Europe not fuckin Africa not Pakistan not India Europe and it's happening in Germany it's happening in Scandinavia it's happening in Spain and Sami in Italy it's happening in Greece it's happening in all these countries and you sit there and everyone just watching as exactly the same fucking thing that started World War two to the T to the fuckin T riots in the streets ultra right ultra left-wing parties fighting each other radical parties getting more and more power and you're saying what the fuck do we have to do - we have to relive it again it's exactly the same thing that started world is that just a natural cycle of humanity and if you look at societies you look at cultures and you look at this rise and fall when you go to the Acropolis and you see ancient Greek ruins and you wonder how the fuck why are these regular houses like really close this incredible structure what happened is this is this inevitable dude are we in this constant state of developing consciousness and one of the the big wrestling matches of trying to sort of innovate and accomplish higher levels of society and culture is that you you have to meet some sort of opposition and if you don't meet opposition you won't have the motivation to really accelerate things as fast as the technology around you is accelerating and completely get out of hand like it is right now like it is right now with with you dictators and crazy fucks controlling nuclear weapons almost it's almost like those things have to be in place in order to motivate the highest levels of thinking well you probably you know the cliche is those who don't understand history are doomed to repeat it and what's interesting is when you go talk to young people in Europe and you say you understand that this is exactly the same thing that happened at the start of World War two they're like I don't you know I don't know what you're talking about and they don't understand history the other thing is they don't understand war and if you ever go look at war and this is what I was talking about with Iraq is war isn't the manly you know I got my shoulder nicked by a by a bullet or you know I come back with a Purple Heart war is a catheter bag war is I don't walk again war is I'm a radiated war is I'm fucked up in the brain for the rest of my life and those who don't understand war are doomed to repeat it and by the way you know hawks and people who say let's go to war let's go to war I go to war go see a war zone it's fucking tragic it's tragic from start to fucking finish its babies with no fucking fathers it's every man fucking killed it's you know rape it's you know in some cases in Africa cannibalism it's it's literally the lowest form of what we are as humanity and people who say let's go to fucking war let's go to war let's go you should fucking realize that before you go to war young dudes you know that we know are going to come back and their dick isn't going to work again then it's fucking they're never going to shit right again all this stuff and you go ok that's what these people are proposing in Europe in India in Pakistan in Africa in Southeast Asia in some cases in South America and in some cases here that's what people are proposing you're like what the fuck I would just like to take anyone who wants to say let's go to war I'd like to take them to a war zone because if you take people to war zone first you puke then you cry and then you freak the fuck out how many people do you think in positions of power actually go to war zones nine out Wow and the what I mean some must I mean you see photo you don't but you don't see what it really does so you show me the we don't own the reason why the reason why I I do what I do is because I've been to war zones and I've seen shit that makes your stomach fucking turn and you'll never sleep right again because when you see what war really fucking does and talk to Marines and talk to Rangers and talk to guys who come back for more talk to them before they go and then talk to them when they come back it's a completely different fucking conference I have and it's very similar to people that I know that have been in jail there's a I have friend we were friends when I was teenager and he was always crazy and he just vanished we didn't know what happened because I just knew him from the martial arts Gemini tribe but he came back three years later with all these crazy scars all over his body he had been a prison right he was a completely different human being it was like before he was this lovable troublemaker and three years later the lovable troublemaker was gone there was a psycho there was a guy who would he would fight for survival he was like a wild animal you won't come back normal yeah you won't come back no no I've met friends that have gone to war too I've had quite a few friends that were in the military and went over I came back including a buddy of mine who went over as a mercenary yeah you know it's a it's a weird conversation when you're alone you know sitting down on a curb somewhere going so so would you have to do yeah what was it like what would you you know how much they pay you do you want to do it again you've done I've done a sure like what the fuck there's there's realities in this world that I think most people in their day-to-day existence do not consider as a part of the equation and those realities are real problem there are real problem for our culture because not only are they disgusting but they're oh no they're avoidable yeah there are most of them are avoidable we have a distorted perception of what can be done with the resources that we have in place and I think that distorted perception is based on greed yeah when you see war and aftermath of war which is again to describe it I'm not even going to do it justice but at Milky eyes from chemical weapons people with their limbs hacked off systematically you know women who have been raped you know 50 70 a hundred times you know incredibly scarred people and by the way if you go over especially if you go over from our culture spend three years in that culture and look it's chronicled after World War two after Vietnam after Afghanistan after Iraq and you go to these things you will never be normal again you will never either mentally or physically you will never be normal again so why do we still fucking rattle our sabers why do we still say we're going to fight why do we still say we're going to fuck each other up and the thing is is if you look at it and you say okay why the fuck did we go to Iraq why the fuck will be there all these fucking guys all these Marines all these army guys who come back fucked up why did you come back why did you come back so fucked up and you're never gonna be normal again why why was it al-qaeda was a 9/11 no Jesus Christ Shane
