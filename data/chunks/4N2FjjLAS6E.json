you know took yoga hung out my dog and now we're here alright well I what's up max how are you brother see ya yeah how you doing I'm good finally here I think what 17:17 fight straight organized a couple of times but maybe you live on an island in the middle of the ocean I know it's a little it's a different thing you know logistically I know I know but we've you finally made it happen yes you made it happen man I can't wait so how you doing man everything all right everything good laughing good while walking great totally fine oh yeah I told you guys I was at a party after the fight I was bullying I was yeah chainsmokers there's actually a Texas well I that they had their concert ding a Texas and uh they thought they'd bring me up into their booth and I was trying to get him to let me jump on and off the stage with him because it look like he's having fun that's amazing man because your left leg it looked like at least during the fight it was getting busted up yeah yeah you know it's yeah it is you know I I heard I saw I got to watch the fight live it over you know and uh what do you know talking about the fight a lot of people actually about the press conference when I said I thought I want I think so people I people is taking it taking it the wrong way a lot of his fans take the wrong ways like when I was in there in my mind I thought I won because I when you think about it I I thought I was landing more damaging shots to the head and body you know I know leg kicks he's landing here and there but I didn't think it was too much into after I saw whatever happened you know but at at the end of the day you know it's like is what I said I just my my legs felt fine I went to the after-party I danced then and if if I put it in this way you know of out of my all my title fights this is the least damage I took in a title fight and I lost my belt so get into the face into the body you know and he hit someone I know he was landing some leg kicks and and some Sawa's power and but they're a bunch of the ones I thought so I was like you know I didn't know that there's landing that much to that today extent and then again this is uh it's not a street fight you know Bron I see it's a it's a it's a game and you help pointing me in the game so you know good for him yeah it's it's an interesting game when it comes to scoring right because like what should be scored more punches or leg kicks like you know it's it's hard like leg kicks are damaging they mean a lot me fights have been stopped on leg kicks you know but Barbosa I think stop beeps yeah yeah yeah but it's just it's I think the system sucks the 10-point must system it's boxing system yes yeah yeah we shouldn't have that system yeah we should have a more comprehensive system that it recognizes everything and then sometimes it's weird to you know especially like technically my fight but like other fights like people you see people who stick and move nice and this and that and just because the guy is walking forward he's winning the fight right and then like you see them get into uh you see people get into scuffles and then one guy bounced back it looks like he's retreating but he's actually not heal and worn the scuffle and he since he bounced back to like oh I think that guy I was staying there was actually winning the fight so is this is what you said is this super like you know some guys like they favor a little bit more thing than another thing and this is a real problem with judges not even being martial artists that's why it's a giant that's why Bert Watson say don't yeah that's easier said than you find the best guys in the world to you you can't expose it's not smart so I'm smart way to fight you know the way you're fighting is the best way to fight but the the judges should at least have some martial arts experience and I know there's a bunch of them that I've never even fucking trained I guess some courses I was talking to some people is talking to that was behind the scenes it's a talking to they came from the DC was the DC event in front of Arizona and some of the Commission there at the DC event was like I heard was crazy like some people just not like didn't know anything yeah that was the video I was like what is going on like to put in perspective for people out there it's like you know like there's all I do for a living that's all I do so like to me I gotta put the trust in someone that doesn't you know what they're doing when I'm over here sacrificing my time it's it's kind of hard you know I'm not talking about my fight again I'm just talking about other people yeah you know it just it just tough you know it's horrible it's horrible they don't do anything about it and there's people that have put in bad decision after bad decision and then you see them still being listed as judges and you're like this is crazy like I want to ask them questions I want to show them I was inside work before I did my first conferences though you go who is judging this we need the fire everyone I don't need to fire everyone you know what they should do man they should hire x-fighters they should this shit I was uh I talked to a Frank Trigg before he moved off of Hawaii mm-hmm and he was trying to become become a ref he's roughing and now he finally got to Bellator you I think so he just did you see first time couple couple weeks ago a couple months ago and I was telling I'm like why would they not just let you put in there there's like oh there's a time system you need to do this I was like you like fought for a championship show and the highest organization what [Applause] qualified I would look I would want you sitting or judging my fight you know I mean like just because someone okay maybe they did take a class but it's like it's like license you know you can see dragon like I passed it license test doesn't mean you could you should be allowed to drive on the road I know what it's like it's like passing a written test but never haven't driven a car exact that's your driver's license you don't even know how to fuckin hit the gas you don't know how much brake you should apply when you you see some of these people that are judging you can you know they've never done anything they've never done they don't they don't have any idea what's going on they just have a cursory understanding of fighting and that's not acceptable for the highest level of the game yeah there's so many X Fighters that would make amazing referees or judges and there's so well I don't have much of a problem with referees there's a lot of great reference but there's so many people that could be great judges there's so many super fans out that have been training their whole life that just they're really really into the sport a lot of these fan these these judges rather not even fans yeah they're just people that are doing it for a job but getting paid in and yeah and then getting to wash the feet the flights for free live yeah front row and they don't even care it's crazy it's funny yeah like I said like the fans I actually think of what is his name I'm praying for him right now Joe the old matchmaker Joe Sabo Joe Silva yeah I actually think it you ever heard his story of how he got to work for you see yes that that's when you say like this super fan like he's one of the guys a Joe Silva was the guys shout out to Joe Silva he was the first guy that accidentally shot his shot you told me Holly I heard he started he told me story in person like he wrote down he told me what he did he wrote a letter to you see this and that and like what'd he think he should change this in the errand and they called him up and be like it would you like to come off we like your ideas did you get set up you know Joe Silva is the first shot shooter guys yeah well he's a legit fan I mean still is to this day yes he made enough money he retired his smart man he just said fuck this I'm out why why yeah you just use a part of business when they got but I'll chill with your family you know yeah he just decided to just lay back built himself a nice house maybe that like what is historic so mean like this like stay like oh yeah you got to move here this noise like no your gig was a hard gig setting up fights Oh MMA fights in particular because guys get injured so much more than embark or anything yeah that's one thing that um I like talking to people are telling people they're like oh there's so difference of this and that about blond like guys boxers and will be MBA what NFL they had they had a set schedule they have a set schedule like I can sit down LeBron can sit down before a year relevant the announced their first regular season he know exactly where he's gonna be the whole year boxers do the same thing they know exactly we're gonna fight this month and this month they don't know what opponents name but after a fight they already kind of know who they fighting you know MMA fighters that I don't you know what's going on I have no clue right you see most fought khabib yeah for the title for six days but somebody did you weigh when you were trying to get down to 55 and they stopped you when they stopped what did you weigh when you started I was whenever we got to call when I got there when I checked in I was already uh the day before weight check I'll tell you what I was the day of the weight cut I was 170 170 day of the week cut and I and I tell you I'm not gonna tell you exact number was before they stopped me but I was like in reach like I was right there but why did they stop they came in the room they looked at me they said they said oh yeah you don't look good yeah we're cutting it close like what I feel good let's do it you know it was right there and then does this what they said you know is they had a real problem with New York in the beginning I mean especially there's a lot of people that just weren't prepared for MMA I mean I mean like I mean the New York cards period don't have a lot of luck at all and I heard them they they're going back to Brooklyn whatever Tony fighting 28 card already scheduled and that was a good fight yeah so they put it in there yeah I know that God you got to keep Tony away from cables the day before the fight Tony just someone needs to just be around him all the time just ready to catch him yes please mate this is the fifth fucking time they've scheduled this fight hey you know right it's a great fight though I can't wait I can I decide I mean stylistically I think he's the best guy that that could be observer face because he can fight off his back yeah he's a guy that doesn't survive off his back he attacks me attack and he's a guy just he just he throws a lot of weird things from weird places like you it's just hot it's hard like people don't understand it like it's it's very hard when you fight someone weird and awkward a miss Barden because you try to get something and then he's like bang here to an elbow but his head is like by the ground high-level guy ever yeah he's good he's real good he's real good at his is his level though cuz I consider him a world championship caliber fighter and she's at his level I don't know of anybody that's more unorthodox than him for sure checking cardio man his cardio is crazy off the chain off the charts I don't never seen anybody with cardio like that I don't know what the fuck it is do you think that's genetic I to some extent I'd yeah 100% I think you gotta have it everybody keep telling me all you got it's just like knockout power like you can't read it but some people just have it I was talking to my friends like like I got a little I got a little Japanese fight he's with me on my corner all the time my wrestling coach he helped me a lot Mirko Nakagawa and I tell him all the time like this this dude is a little hundred 25 pound you know any 115-pound guy pretty much a little girl I tell my like you're a little girl right but if anything like it was just one time we was out and about and this guy was just acting crazy this is this is a this is like a a couple couple years back and I was - I was at the UFC but was that one of the UFC events I forget what event was that but was doing something is a big thing and I was at a party and then this one Asian dude was just like getting all crazy in people's faces like the crazy drunk and blah blah get in his face and I told all right this all hard my friend punches I tell him I tell guy I'll crack him but I'm scared I'm not gonna put him to sleep I know if you punch him he's gonna go back out like you go ahead he wouldn't hit him but he he punches so hard like he's the smallest and a group like even one time and weezing was at home and like he walk in and there's this drunk guy and there's like drill out there's four or five of us and he's the smallest guy in the back and we're all walking in like almost a line and this big guy he like he slips everybody little guy laughs he bumps him hard and I looked at him I'm like I like what and then he goes the little guy he turns to my friend him like what my friend goes what and he does and then he's like oh okay nothing he walks away and I told him and then I told her we just hanging with this new guy this guy is just hanging over us I told him that is the wrong guy to bump into because out of everyone here he probably won't punch knock you out he's the tides the smallest guy this is it I think it is genetics it's a bunch of powers and you're definitely a genetic thing Wilder look at Deontay Wilder there's no way yeah there's no way you could teach that 200 200 well what is it 215 he's cracking yeah but he's like killing people like you know that this is not guys' getting flash kills and we rode welder is different that he could wake up you know I mean but everybody else he hit they're like they go flying did you not see that video they made of his last bite this is okay yes that's what it's like man it's like when he hit Ortiz on the fucking forehead man hit him on the for me in the chin that's how you know you hit hard did you just hit different yeah he's but he does it to everybody when you look at his record he's got 40 knockouts in 42 fights one decision and one draw 40 knockouts and 42 fights like he's huge skinny like you'd be like he's a skinny dude you know and like if you looked at Anthony Joshua like really think he would knock out people he would not get everybody especially before he fought Ruiz the first time yeah he was super judge he got a little more lenient after the first fight but yeah he's at he's big like do you remember Frank Bruno Frank Bruno Dino was a boxer from England there was like one of the biggest guys ever and Mike Tyson fucked him up this big giant dude though he was so big he probably built like a body build you thought he would just flatline people and Mike Tyson just smushed him you might say Mike genetic yes he did not see the video of Mike Tyson showing what McDonald yes how does flip mokuba that guy his 50 movie like Teddy Atmos told me that when he was 13 years old I said wait 190 pounds what yeah it was true he brought him to smokers and they would go how old is this kid he was 13 he was get the fuck out of 16 he's like telling you he's 13 they put him in with 16 year olds because they wouldn't believe them they believe 13 you sure that you shouldn't did that from what does that caught what uh what is that one movie that one movie that baseball movie Benchwarmers when he's like I'm 13 no but I see it's real yeah man it's genetics or it there's there's him within GaN oh look at that he looks like such a elder statesman too you know with his beard yeah yeah he does he slipped in he does oh I think that was a different one that was him was it oh here it is here it is here for the beginning put it for the beginning Jamie whoop whoop whoop whoop yeah he's shown him angles this guy is a B what you don't god I wasn't thinking about fighting in boxing for yes and I think I think that's not a bad idea because the the boxing heavyweight division is like it's very good at the very top there's like four or five really really good guys but I think you get murked motherfuckers on the way and you probably make a shitload of money yeah I mean oh yeah definitely 100% now that UFC is getting involved in boxing I don't think it's a bad idea yeah but he's got to get past Rosen strike Rosen strikes a scary fucking dude that thing he did the allister's lip I've never seen a cut that bad before oh yeah that one with five seconds left yeah yeah crazy that just shows you how nuts the sport is right Alistair is winning the fight on points he's scoring he's fighting smart and he just just has a mental lapse games are inches seconds millimeters you know just you just cannot you know like every time like that's the hardest thing with of being in a fight you just got beyond yeah yeah he's cute because there's some times that go I'm just gonna do to the bone right my seconds left winning the whole fight on the scoreboard he's winning he showed it yeah how sick is that to watch after after going that far you five seconds away from the final bell then and then you're going home with a fat cut you probably need like 400 stitches on that layer yeah you let me I never like to see you look at that picture that is oh my god damn crazy that is without a doubt the nastiest fucking injury I've ever seen in this mother I mean I almost rather get a broken leg than that oh no no no definitely not most like Anderson's broken leg ah no look at that though looking at me smiling that motherfucker oh my gosh Elster takes a loss you take a loss better than anybody but owl stirs right up there living like that saying no wait after the fight we walk around with me of my son the next day on what I not the next day oh yeah it is the next day sunday i walking into new york new york there's a hawaiian I love Hawaiians I love my one today greatest fans in the world she comes up to me and she rubs my back and she's like I'm so sorry boy and I'm like for what she's like you lost you fight I'm like and they I'm alive I didn't okay you know we're gonna get the bag is a place won't fight we'd be back but yeah I love people talking to me like it's my funerals I've done like guys I'm okay I'll be back I didn't take no real damage I'm just happy that I'm not injured and out for a long time and I can get back to do what I love in and that's punching people in the face I'm happy you know I like like I said I didn't need the belt to be a champion I know I'm a champion the bell was just to let people know that look I'm one of the greatest guys to ever do it you know and my plan is just be one of the greatest of all time and uh whoever whoever you guys think it is let me know I go knock on the front door and now I'm the like a that says something uh yeah well you you just need to make some adjustments for a rematch and exactly to this the the whole thing was him attacking your legs yeah that was he was getting close it was a smart strategy yeah it was really good game of inches you know yeah he did way he did like we said he's not street for it it's not a street fight he the points nice you switch better than anybody you're really good at switching while you're fighting you switch stances you switch or thora but you were forced to certain times in the fight to fight Paul because of the leg damage I'm not really because of leg damage because I just felt when I was going so Paul against him I just felt more like he was just he was waiting a lot more soon as I went regular it was funny because like I was like I could hear I caressed I could hear his teammates tub and I hit his coach as soon as I go I go a cell phone in there not really seeing anything and that's when I switch back to regular I hear the word dragon dragon and dragon was leg kick like it's going the distinct dragon it was like late kick so I could hear it in there and I was like okay well let's go so Posey what they start calling here and there wasn't really calling anything there was just like you need to punch now you need to move down attack so I guess so it wasn't really ready for a southpaw max more than a regular cuz I went back regular they were screaming dragon like it was religious or something so it's crazy it's crazy what did you think he was gonna fight like what did you think his strategy was gonna be coming into the fight I you know I thought so I thought so he was gonna I knew he's gonna do that a lot of things for sure you know I thought he's been do like how he did although maybe living more getting me against the fence but I think so he's kind of tripping out when he when he got me there and I was able to get off and some some of them I think so he's tripping out that he could take like he he was gonna I thought so till playing a narrative like this is gonna take me out and ground upon me and stuff you know so I don't know I don't know what we did I think so we did good and then he just did better in in one aspect with the lake cakes and uh it all added up yeah when I have to watch the fight again but I don't remember him landing a real significant punch that had you hurt no no no it was those good punches but it was just his leg kick work was excellent though some of the first ones in the first one some of the first ones it was great it was what was good in the early rounds but some of the other ones is just like we're super close and then he just throw it like you know like I'll just would end up getting into a tangle and he'll just end with a lake just for it just to even touch me you know so and then there's like oh I guess I was the game plan to like kick up but you got to get a rematch I mean you are without doubt the most accomplished featherweight champion of all time I mean if you look at your career you beat Aldo twice you beat basically everybody you beat everybody in the division Ortega you beat all the up-and-comers you beat all the veterans you mean everybody was there and so my eyes like a rematch makes sense and it's very exciting fight it would be a great rematch yeah you know so yeah yeah he's gonna sell for sure there's no one really compelling yeah that's you know there's no it's not like you know you lost the title Volken offski beat you but there's another guy who's been like begging and pleading and right there that everybody wants to see five yeah but those nos it was that guy yeah I mean there's good guys in the division yeah but you've beaten most of the guys like Ortega was the big guy right and he was the one that everybody wanted to see you fight because he was undefeated didn't he would win in such spectacular ways but you you know you you deserve a rematch I'm really feeling yeah we see what happens I can't wait if they you know I heard a little bit didn't hit me up yet but her dinner saying something in Australia or whatever but yeah yeah I'm just you know how it is I got there's no attitude motherfucker used to be 240 pounds how crazy is that that is crazy you know what he was playing rugby yeah bulldozer yeah yeah I don't know how someone that tall is that heavy like a nice on her hands love it yeah he wasn't that fat though he was just huge and just Jackie's huge you still see it in his legs he's a tough fucking guy man it's it's interesting to see this city kickboxing gym you know from style bender and Dan hang hang that hooker hooker yeah I was a big hooker friend for a while yeah for a while I've been watching him since his foot when he was in 45 I was watching him I was like it was I was like we're probably gonna end up fighting each other with that for fighting who had the 55 and everyone's like saying he's a big 45 and I mean 55 he makes it look small he's pretty generous you yeah he's dressed in a style yeah he's had one one bad fight where it didn't go his way that was the fight against Barbosa but he just he stood with Barbosa which is just a fucking terrible idea for most people Bible is a kick so goddamn good yeah he's a he's a fastest which kicker I've ever seen in my life yeah I never seen anybody throw a switch I never did I always try to I always try it like I watched his fights and then I always try to go to gym and mimic it I don't even know how he can balance that fast it's so funny anybody like you know even sometimes when he had like Lakey people and like you know just even switch kick people to body and you sit there his foot land I'm like yeah I can't be that hurtful but when he lands only his foot I'm like god this sucks oh yeah it's with oh it doesn't matter if it's shin or his foot he could fuck you up with just his foot yeah well he's got the first wheel kick knockout ever in the UFC he happens Terry Adam if yeah that's come on nobody gonna forget that I was crazy that that was the first ever first ever will kick Malcolm yeah all those fights imagine and in statue after was crazy the way he's a beast man it's just uh it's interesting he's so he's the most kick oriented fighter I think in the sport because you don't see him beating guys down with his hands no no he always always hand his touches yeah yeah yeah and late kicks and sometimes each other like too late kicks that he chose so fast his kicks his kicks is like his jab yeah yes but then they is like jazz but they hurt like shit yeah I mean he stopped Dan hooker with a punch to the body but that was because his body was brutal a body kick right here let me switch kicking him he was switch kick Konami hit him was spinning back-kick did he make a folder to like pee blood or something yeah I felt he said Herman Felder had to to Lourdes and crazy he's yeah he's a really interesting guy this it's it's only so many different styles that's one of the cool things about the sports is there's so many different ways to do him Mariah Mariah yeah Jose Aldo look up resilience fast which was unfair fast for what did you say did you watch them arise all the fight I was kind we're not doing it so I kind of got to see kind of kind of didn't so I never really watched it most people pretty salty on the decision yeah how you feel I didn't like it yeah I thought although without them I thought he looked he opened up with a switch kick to the head and had all those staggering a little bit Aldo covered up and weathered the storm and then Aldo started putting the pressure on him and Aldo started hitting him with big punches and really was controlling the center of the octagon and really pressuring him and being very aggressive and then he got taken down the last couple of seconds of the first round but nothing happened he just took him down and hold him in my mind that shouldn't mean much that don't mean nothing that doesn't mean I get mad about takedowns period and an MMA because I I understand how I can beat somebody up for four minutes and 50 seconds and you you take the last ten second you take me down for last ten second you win the you win the round it's crazy I think so you have to take me down and if you're not gonna advance you least gotta go out and pound me for thirty Seconds forty seconds to make that legitimately takedown I agree it should be something happens when you go to the ground 100% you got to brutalize the guy or threaten with the submission it's got to be something but with Malin and Josie Aldo if they gave that first round to Marlon it's on the basis of that high kick some strikes landed but I thought Aldo did more and I said although it did more in the second round and I thought all I thought although won the fight I thought it was close but I thought all the won the fight if he was more aggressive everybody's tripping on him I was like he looked good yeah I'll do just have high cheekbones then like and then he was like leaving his facial hair for like all five weeks so people's like oh my god I look scared I'm like guys this is his face is ball too you know that doesn't help help but you have born no hair you know people just think he look crazy already look well you know that was the first fight that he ever had a nutritionist for his home yes I heard that is crazy like that that's what I heard I heard I heard his meals when he's at 45 was just whatever he wanted to eat like he's not like eating whatever you wanted to he did it I'm like yeah that's why this dude's one of the greys all the time he's an animal well he ate whatever he wanted just drain the shit out of himself yeah exactly but he had some times during his career where people didn't think he was gonna be able to make 45 anymore he's gonna have to go up to 55 yeah so then the see him down at 35 was quite crazy but what I saw when I saw him when he was standing and getting ready I saw muscles yeah it wasn't like he was like yeah you see some guys when they're just they're making a bad way yeah they just look like shit yeah he just look ripped no he looked good he look real good you know even when I because I saw him what do what did I see him I'll do an immediate day or whatever early in the week we even worked out me and him had the same workout room for one of the nights and we worked out together and when I showed them I you know I'll shake hand he pulling in a hug first thing I go back to my was like guy hard as a rock he's gonna make weight when you when you're that hard and you have muscle it's much easy to cut water right when you touch someone they saw he's like yeah man you don't made peace be with you people don't think that right I mean we had a it's it's it's a we had a conversation about that with the fuck is his name it wasn't Dolce it was the other guy I'll remember his name in a minute Lockhart yes thank you George Lockhart sorry George it's the weed I blame the weed but Lockhart was saying that big muscular guys there it's easier it's easy to you you can suck you can suck water out of someone who's muscular cut his muscle muscles gonna let go let go to water but if you got fat fat is gonna help hold on to everything right why you fat was like once is something bad like muscles won't even hold on hold on to something bad if you eat sugar you so muscular you feel sick it's funny how different guys look on the scale versus the next day like Lombard was a good example like when he would make 170 he looks so much smaller on the scale in the next table like fuck because it's the same muscle yeah and then muscle wants water yeah when you put water into that day that bad boy my gosh you look like a balloon yeah carbo yeah you know lumbars fighting bare-knuckle boxing now No yeah I know who are you fighting I don't I think he's fighting Joe Riggs why I think he's fighting Joe Riggs and I bear enough para nada boxing is weird gangster gangster it's weird how popular it's become yeah it's crazy it's good and it's nuts to me like I think the MMA fighter is gonna they do much we do much more better than professional boxers inside of it because professional boxers they like everyone fight we're so used to the small four ounce gloves that like the certain slips we know don't work already like when you watch and you see a professional xbox or go to that bare-knuckle thing and they try to do their they try to do like their shoulder world rolls and stuff don't work as normal a glove you know like right the glove the little half-inch of the glove would like bounce off and work yeah but now it's just coming straight chew and be calm and you see people people whose eyes is go you know that's crazy yeah there's certain techniques like Floyd Mayweather would employ that just would never work with no knobs I'll never work and you can kind you can kind of fight in the clinch to right and move their knuckles yeah yeah you can clinch you can clinch you can clinch and punch from inside the clinch you know other things kick boxers the same deal you know you watch a lot of the top level kick boxers they're fighting like this yeah yeah we can you can even when you go around like you might not get the food glove you know but now there's that the extra pad is it's not there anymore so if you think you're gonna block it it just coming right through yep yep yeah it's interesting what would you think if MMA had no gloves would you like that man I got I got a little small tiny hands so I don't know I think it'd probably screw up my knuckles I hurt my tongues almost every fight so I've heard this fight before the fight everybody is this a nagging injury you know so like we always take care of it this and dad but you have to tape it any differently not really I love TV Mike I love tape my tongue like a boxer feeling when when you just got something holding cuz like when you do when we do train we're in boxing gloves anyway mm-hmm so you you always feel something there anyway so when we go to the Fight Night it's it's kind of weird if I don't take my tongue like I know I tried not to take one time like yeah no I got do most guys take your thumbs or no I don't know I don't know I think there's this preference personal preference did you watch the Kobe Guzman fight yeah I was a little bit of it livid not the holding how would you think I thought I was crazy crazy I thought I was crazy that was a while I liked what you said you know even though like if you don't go we talk like that most guys that talk like that is like act like him can't fight he can't fight he could find he tricks you he does he tricks him to think he sucks he's wearing a cheap suit he's caring around Donald Trump Jr's book is wearing a manga hat he's on the same reading reading the fucking book I mean he's lucky I give up I give it up to that guy for a lot of reasons first of all he was his back was against the wall the UFC was telling him they're gonna cut him after this fight with Demian Maia they don't like his style they think he's boring they literally told that to him yeah so he goes in the ring after the fight cause Brazilians a bunch of filthy hands says a bunch of crazy shit and the next thing you know he's got this fucking character oh yeah for children we were making fun of his suit and next thing you know he's one of the most popular guys in the fucking sport from talking shit and that was only three fights ago man there's a massive adjustment yeah it's crazy smart yeah it is you know in a day you know if people ask me well you feel like he came out and said that it was like a stick you know I was like oh sure whatever it is I just told people like it's him yeah I mean like it's not me like he's digging his own grave let's go dig it you know I mean he got living it now you know like now I got living it like I think that the fire apparently acts over did why did you laugh when you found out that he outed himself I was like because it's a storyline you don't see this WWE guys burn around they know they should keep their story line until they go out and we can noted it first me out at first me and Brendan Schaub out at at first story Latin I would be like be honest II like joe rogan guess what I hate you and that's it I'll leave it as it and when it comes back up the aisle or door Joe Rogan is allowed I'll stop making lunch organized walk weed that space he's looking just regular grass guys you heard here first smoking regular grass guys oh that's hilarious we haven't had a guy that put on our character like that before he's the first yeah yeah you shot in a little bit yeah she else on it a little bit you know he kind of put on a little bit of an act like that but Colby took it to a whole new level I mean and he's adjusted it over the years cuz if you go back and look at the beginning of it he used to wear nice suits he was wearing like a sweet a very nice tailored suit little expensive now he's wearing the cheapest shit that he could buy like blue and orange he's where he's on purpose you know he's doing on purpose he's wearing chief says it's fucking hilarious man it's hilarious it's terrible and it was a good goddamn fight it was a good fight it was real close fight got 50k it was three and three on three judges scorecards are on two judges scorecards they had it three and one so three rounds to us man on one judges score three rounds to Colby on another treasure scorecard yeah it was that goddamn close and - and - with the last judge this is another example of being crazed and crazy but this is another example why we should have more judges yeah you should have more than three judges it's quite um a judge Olympic I don't know I think they get I think they have eight and then they take the they take like the top whether they take whatever score is matched like not five whatever and then they back they then they better make sense that makes sense eights a good number nine would be a good number because none would be like a tiebreaker yeah you know if you if you had five one or four one wave the way I feel like threes ridiculous like why you only have three well you know the judges suck already so why do you only have three people that suck if anybody can change this for you can I have tried man I've tried to eliminate weight cutting I've tried to I've tried I've talked to these guys I've talked to Ari I've talked to Lorenzo I said let's get rid of weight cutting get rid of it do what one Fc is doing use hydration tests make everybody fight their natural weight open up weight classes make a bunch more having two weight classes between 185 and 205 is fucking bananas you got 20 pounds yeah we could yeah I think so we need to open weight yeah and then even like um one of the most weight things that I hate is like I don't understand why the champion and the Challenger of the champion need to make 45 and then everybody else get the panel knowledge yeah we're like that's backwards right a champion and the Challenger should have the power lines and everybody else need to make the weight right right right or you just be like it if you want to get the champion more love you just be like look champion needs to come in at 46 and the Challenger come at 45 that is how it should be is if you're gonna cut all that weight we know you're gonna fight for five rounds give them an extra pound yeah but I feel like hydration test of the way I do this is cool I think oh I know a couple guys that in the one I want to see and stuff and they do that way that's super dope I bet you could feel better I bet yeah you just walk on five buttons but it's great because we if we do do that you know people are just gonna try and find a way to finesse it anyway I wonder what they do it and want to see to prevent that I mean apparently they haven't had an issue with that they test people they make sure that you're not dehydrate yeah yes I don't know I have no idea but I find them whichaway they find what you weigh in camp that's what they should do just show up like one day hey max what's up hey get on a scale bro brother Almighty what's the heaviest you've ever gotten the heaviest I ever gotten uh I don't know I got we in Hollywood I can't be telling you my way not this is Hollywood Chatsworth I'm pretty damn close Valley bro we're pretty close if you had a guess if I had to guess 180 probably 180 yeah 80 85 90 that means 90 that means one it might mean a 180 210 noise you guys really think I over here put on an act calling out DC see you are eating everything I want to eat you know what a Romani fight is DC it's me out fight your ass that are you to it all you can eat buffet let me know that is not on the planet right here the data spare the planet hilarious there's never been a battle motherfucker on the planet with a body like DC never never never usually those guys are journeyman you know usually there's a lot of good fighters that are built like that but they never really get to be like world-class BJ and that did what he did huh and do it and continue to do what he's doing a man but when he fought steeper yeah big old belly still crack I tease him all the time I bought it about you like this you can be using the tight stuff you got big t-shirts up come on I get ideas about that I love that guy I love that guy too what do you think is gonna happen with them I wonder if steep a is gonna be it steep a apparently he's injured he's having a hard time recovering they're trying to do a rematch but he's got an injury even if he's not a rematch it are they gonna move on from Steve Berra no listen they everybody's scared of Francis nobody wants a piece of that dude they're like fuck that fuck that noise yeah DC told me yeah Alfred in France he's like fuck that I don't want nothing to do with Francis and God Oh No thank you sir not he is like I'm here for Steve pay and that's it he goes out my house he was I'm in the end of this I got like one or two fights left to me they gotta make sense and he's not interested in that which I wish I was in his corner I'd be the thank God you thinking this way fuck that guys too scary yeah he scares them he bad me he's fast he's super fast I'll do is supersenses fucking he nukes dudes when he hit her with that left hook that was crazy doesn't Detroit I remember that when I was watching that you see you see how his head Wiggles in the air even hits the ground how many times has Alistair been knocked out like I think a lot it's been a lot but it doesn't help that you come from the k1 background you know like you just get punched on what can describe and then he always always said like what was it 185 right he was 185 205 and hey wait now it's a come on you don't say well he had a real hard time making 205 you remember back when you fucked he was he's smaller you know like and and once you get past one like once you're 185 and up it's like everybody can knock out everybody there you know and once you like and once you get knocked out your brain is going to just keep saving you early and earlier you know every time you know just once you get hit set in the way your brain just gonna shut off because it's just trying to save itself yep yep and there's nothing you can do you know that is crazy right there's no fix for that well if your brain is just trying to protect yourself you know even like I know people who get choked out who got choked out to sleep and now you can choke them out or like easier because the brain is just like the very the brain is like no yeah I've never seen that with chokes yeah yeah I saw I know a couple people Wow damn very good yeah they say that chokes I used to think chokes were a free ride I think no big deal you just got choked out but now they say no no no no no like chokes give you brain damage for sure your your your your body they do something that it doesn't want to do is shutting your brain that it's telling yourself like before look I'm gonna turn everything off before you die yeah and this it because it's if you keep holding it when you're knocked out you're gonna do someone tell someone so that's your body just be like okay look I'll turn it off now so let's just hope you recover but they're short they're sick they're finding CTE in jiu-jitsu players they're finding is yeah but that's high level jiu-jitsu guard I don't I don't think that is from choke exactly like I hit my head all the time I hit my head on digit when I'm grappling and stuff just muscles game punch sometimes like sometimes I'll punch your head like when we're removing stuff but when you're doing jujitsu and stuff like someone tries to take you back oh snap you down are you rolling or collide heads oh yeah collide heads or you stay on the top and they're bunking like you know you got a wild child onto you and then you hit your head you know or you get their background while man like I got like something when they do something I'm like when I got a wild child I like boom oh okay this is how it's gonna end and every do it I'm like after you tell moms like look y'all relax guy like that's what I have though if you look at it like this is a cool thing about my team like my coach he will never ever let me do a jujitsu tournament I keep begging him like on digital Milan dude you just tell me he's like no he's like I'll let you go do a boxing match with the jujitsu time I was like why he's like cuz you see all these top MMA fighters they go to the league the guys jujitsu whatever the determinant is deterioration they come shoulder yes we can they get choked out they hit the head they get cut cuz I gonna fight this freak freak stuff happen when you're grappling well cut blew his knee out just this weekend yeah I mean he said he's on a real high note right now just beat chrome Gracie yeah and he's also 36 with a family you know so it's like this guy can't afford to take a fucking year that's why he was locked up in a leg lock with Jake Shields who's at least 30 pounds bigger than him Jake is a big fellow and you know they're doing that quintet thing with different weights will compete against different guys shout out to Sean O'Malley I saw him put it on for the UFC Kraus James Krause caught King mo and a standing guillotine no I like him a lot very very smart guy really nice guy - yeah really nice guy like oh yeah he was in the workout room to it that week I thought he was fighting but no he just did in the bathroom that's cool yeah so Jake Shields tapped out Mark Munoz and then he got him in an arm try and then head knob choke and then he was in the middle of the scramble with cub and he had Cubs you know leg laced up like a heel hook position but not who didn't apply he looked they were just in the middle of transition moving and cub just like he just rolls over his back you know you know you know better than everybody that once you get there and you go the wrong way Pilate stays there yeah that's Krause tapping King mo standing standing guillotine guys a beast yeah grappling is not it's not a safe bet I can't believe that these guys who are fighting in the UFC for a career we're doing be willing to risk that because you really can get fucked up man you really can get really badly hurt like Jamie finger oh yeah you know much times I hurt I hurt my doing with my role with jiu-jitsu and my role kickboxing I have way more injuries and doing straight digits in and kickboxing training really 100% Wow that's 100% that's well I feel like it's easier to go light when your kick box exactly yeah yeah yeah cuz you can control it you know right and nobody wants to get knocked out like in jujitsu and stuff it's like it's like oh you could probably put some sleep or break their arm but like you gotta be pretty good with your partner like some guys like you know certain guys that go and they get if they get this arm they're gonna fucking take home yeah oh there's always guys like that I always blown with some guys just fucking they go so hard and they'll some guys are hurt they hurt people yeah some guys are always hurting you always here you look over oh it's Mike motherfucker getting people in arm bars yeah it's a you know combat sports are so hard it's a why it's so hard to train correctly you know like if everything was great you would you would have full control your opponent would have full control you guys would spar correctly yeah you have great training huh it's so hard to find good training and it's all cool yeah yeah I just um I love my I love love my teammates when I'm getting ready for fights whenever we got a mimic guys like even though like sometimes it's horrible like sometimes like some guys like you got a trained assertive way and spar me give me the certain look and they're getting it and they know if they just go back to their normal style to give me more competitive exploring right they stood do it I'm like and I tell them off that every practice I'm a guy thank you don't worry when it's your fight I would take my husband to the job I'll pay you back my friend well it's like the weirdest style you ever had to prepare for what fighter do you do you think was like the most difficult to prepare for in terms of getting ready for their style um I think so it was uh what is his name um we'll chop the one that I started in the win streak on you know he was so tall like 64 like hoody get ready for everybody I know what I was six floors on there's like already 20 pounds 190 pounds 200 pounds you know these guys like stuff so like 600 or 145 is crazy yeah I was crazy and then like I remember they going in there and I was like trying to hit on me he's like jabbing me I'm like what is quite like how is this guy so tall you know what the weird is one I think well it's it's it's interesting you see long tall guys and the use of distance if someone's really good and they're long and tall that is such a giant event like John Jones is the best at yeah yeah he's the best super smart he's so good at using that length oh oh yeah and then boom when he wants he hits you boom boom and aim it he doesn't he does did you cheats away he's hit either all the way in all the way out yeah he's out he's either on you or he's awful you he's never ever put himself in like stupid positions where you might get a shot on him I'm really interested to see what Dominic Reyes can do with him I'm very interested to see he's got to rise to the occasion because you know he had some rough moments with OSP you know who also had a real good fight with John Jones like a lot of people yeah don't you know osp's a beast big strong guy fieri pound genetics yeah and very powerful because the excellent striking power especially with his left leg and his left hand he fucks people up but you know she's got a nasty power left kick man but you know he he's struggled with OSP a little bit in particularly in like the middle of fight OSP hit him with a good shot and then and he knocked OSP out he should have got credited for a knockout in that fight cuz I'm gonna knocked him out like with like two seconds to go and he walked off I mean the referee didn't stop the fight and he's like no you got to get up you gotta get up he's like wait he's out man and then the buzzer rang and then they just called it a decision they gave it to him by decision but the fight should have been stopped I mean it was a knockout that's crazy he knocked him out yeah that's crazy well it's just one of those things it's like you know the referees call just yeah and you know that we all know John Jones is different you know yeah he's a different animal he's the even even though one you see him and you see him looking kind of normal and stuff it just it was very way yeah he just finds away look at normals attract yeah yeah like when he takes pictures of himself looking skinny fat don't let that shit fool you that's John Jones even skinny fat will fuck you up he's so strong - I bet you know and that you want to talk to genetics his whole family is super athletes all this brother Oh imagine that one guy is the greatest light heavyweight champion of all time the youngest ever to win a world title in the UFC the other two brothers are nfl superstars what the fuck is in the water at the Jones house I don't know that's some serious fucking genetics over there and also I think like when you grow up with two bad motherfuckers there's yeah you know yeah you know yeah beaten the fucking why he became funny when they do any college if I was if I was John I'll just tell them to it you know tackle me a shame to work yeah okay they trained in in-between for his brother Arthur is fucking gigantic yeah I know that dude so big yeah shit about John yeah if I fight never may I fuck him up but no shit they could they talk shit to each other like that yeah exactly but then when they go home I'm like yeah okay Chandler but a contract I see how much you making I like your eyes right here we let's go Joey let's go Joey to get a fight it really is a three raisi successful athletic family like maybe the I don't know of any other family that has nfl superstars and a world champion you know combat sports athlete I can't think of another family like that no it's great it's it's this not life's not fair you know it comes to things like that it comes to genetics life is not fair yeah you just got work with it gotta work with what you got when you had that situation happen where you know they were running a bunch of tests on you they couldn't figure out what was wrong with you uh-huh what do you think was going on uh you know what was funny was that a July fight yeah when we get ready is in Vegas right we flew I had to fly to New York to do my media day so from Hawaii to New York 12 hours yeah and then we did 12 hour media and then we went to Vegas I think I got to Vegas on Thursday and then you know I just felt out of it and you're cutting weight at the time too not really cutting weight was dieting and stuff and like everybody even the water thing it was like wow I think that's the load of water fight week even why even with even before the fight you know we drink the load of water you know and um a tenday like a couple days pass and it just wasn't going away you know and then what was how do you feel I could tell I could tell you exactly what was it something was consumed you know and like right now not that much people know that I I left my old management I'm with new management now and you know my manager now he's like a behavioral science guy and he's probably like watching the stream and I was squirming and while I'm talking about it but we got we you know like we got stuff going on and you got a bunch of I'm looking to like work on like with lawyers and stuff and we plan on suing somebody so there's what yeah there's a bunch of stuff that I really can't talk about that's why he's squirming back there you know I probably shouldn't be talking about it too much but that's what it was something I consumed and like a supplement I don't even know if I can tell you yeah for sure for sure well let me know when is this all supposed to be settled out we see you know I just left that to him you know the one of the great things that I love with the team is that for me I'm all about keeping the main thing the main thing and the main thing for me is this fighting and making sure whoever's in front of me whatever cupcake it is I can enjoy that cupcake Wow why they go do everything else for me and you have to think about anything else not nothing it else that's beautiful that's that's the way to do it you know if you can have a good team you know people that train themselves like you know I'm like it's crazy can't do this okay like I talked to my I talked to them I talked to my team like I love the chaos like I love chaos around me a little bit but then they make it so simple and it's great but I kind of stood like to for myself like I like when things ain't in order you know like when you come to my house I love that my room is messy I people might chip bug like you messy room or like yeah but you know like I have somebody come clean it later on but like I just love the chaos like I like oh yeah I'm messy you got to be a little bit messy you know just does that keep me sane if I'm to clean I just I'm like things going too well things is going to good you know like it's just like it's like a fight way like a fight in you it's like if not if something doesn't go wrong for a week I'm like nope this shit ain't happening I'm gonna screw something up right now just so we got him do you like things going perfect don't it feel weird what everything goes perfect I guess I'm just different now that is a different way of looking at things that you'd like a little bit of care I like a little bit of chaos me I like I like to know that there's no like I'm I feel like I'm a very very very fortunate person and I like to know that things are crazy and random so I could appreciate my fortune yeah you know I mean exactly I'm lucky you know actually I love that life is so unpredictable strange life is like life is like every me mm is unpredictable or something like that and that's why that's why I love it that's why it's so comparable that's why a lot of people can kind of compare like they kind of get it but they don't you know like fighting is in there DNA like everybody everybody the once they that I can't watch this fight this and that I'm like I don't know what you're talking about because this is like a combat like you were licensed we're like licensed fighter this is like it's not a gladiator David people like cutting a child head off like Oh take his life no it's not we did we have the sport yeah we pass these days you know so a ten a day is just when they actually I get III always uh like my fans a bunch of my friends it's like old people or even moms like moms like moms always shit but like I work out they come they come to the gym they see me work out they actually talked to me they're like oh wow I didn't think so you use you like this whatever I thought you was like just this guy just an asshole involved look cuz I was a fighter I was like no we're human talking about you know that just like you well people think of cage fighters they think of like the most aggressive them nice people in the in the world and most fight that's the weirdest thing about fighters in the UFC like they're the nicest people they like cowboy Cerrone he's one of the nice he hugs everybody he's a sweetheart yes fucking nice to everybody is one of the baddest motherfuckers ever yeah amazing and God knows a really nice guy yes he's super cool big giant scary motherfuckers super nice yeah real friendly yeah you know Cain Velasquez real nice campaign yeah if he's on him in economy and uh hey what you do yeah both the fighters don't have anything to prove you know a lot most men that run around in society especially men that don't train on know how to fight they filial they have a lot to prove there was puffing their chest out and talking loud and there's a lot of that with men particularly the men who who don't know how to fight but fighters you know if you're a UFC fighter man you've proved you've already pretty you're you're you don't need to impress people yeah you know you and all so fucking tired from training all the time too oh yeah yeah I never said yeah yeah I know exactly what you mean that's how everybody who is telling me like whenever they like all my friends whenever they bring new guys around our new friends is hanging out like asking me about fighting and this and that like this so like cool I go what about this what about that I'm like okay what do you do for work it's like construction I'm like well how's your job site don't go in right now you know how's the house the fork house the your concrete prices going up I don't know like I like I won't talk about that like exactly please understand someone's a fan of yours they're running to you like it's Matt oh shit look we actually have a lot more in common than fighting you know like let's go freak and go raise some cars or something right right there's something fun yeah what do you do when you're not when you're not in camp like now now that fights over you got a chance to unwind for a while when we what do you what's what's a typical max Holloway day like I just lounge around wait for many blessed maybe if he got if playing sports taking to sports he like he'd been liking k1 speed lately so we're gonna go racing or we got we just got a a roller rink in Hawaii like really yeah like a roller rink but actual roll away we had ice cream for every day we got a roller rink and you guys have had ice skating forever yeah yeah in their City and then now we got a roller rink and me and Minnie and a bunch of my friends we'd be going every day we kind of get a roll bounce on and just do this stuff you know like in camp but really can't do it cuz I don't want to fall out and break my butt or something on a finger so now we can kind of play around more like just do fun stuff just stuff that like I don't have to go to the gym too much like and then I don't feel bad to if I do miss the gym like Michael just kind of know like they kind of let me offer like one or two weeks or so and then yeah please hang out nice to just unwind oh yeah and it's being able to the school to their 7-eleven is getting Slurpee and whatever yeah and then a couple weeks after the fight then you start battening down the hatches again oh yeah gay right getting right back into it training you know and then you start talking your manager like what's next yeah exactly I call them I let them know I tell them we plan and kind of have an idea we kind of have an idea because ever since we heard Dana talking about hit us up yet so what did Dana say he said at the press conference that he wanted mean on me and Alex and what is that called in in Australia you know I just don't know where for yeah down on down every went sadly cool yeah Australia's great I love it there I've never been in New Zealand I want to go to New Zealand but fuck I love Australia people are so cool so it's a it's a great but in this you know it's relaxed man there's only 20 million people and it's a place of size of the entire United States Pharrell yeah I know this is less people in the whole of Australia than in LA crazy that's crazy it is good California as a whole has way more people than Australia that's way more yeah but LA has more people than Australia and and if you have a census those fucking people that have a census all the census so there's only 20 million people bitch you're not counting Mexicans you are not counting Mexicans you're never gonna count them and they come over here this sneaking around they're doing whatever they want to do just I'm happy they're here but you don't know how many there are I'm happy here I'm happy they're here hey does it you know what we going after this dollar tacos maybe do this a great place over here oh yeah sure you'll put yeah this is burrito spot legit is fucked they got all those Mexican soap operas plans yeah nobody speaks English fucking holy you know it sounds charts so good some horchata look I'm a giant Mexican food is probably my favorite food but my point is they don't know how many are here yeah there could be another ten counting yeah yeah yeah they have no idea and either way it's more than the whole of Australia but that's why I'm struggling so cool they're not all stressed out and you know there's too many people together in one spot like I was driving here today and some dude cut me off just like someone just like doesn't care just yeah what I saw oh but he's telling maybe the tents they did a study once where they they set cameras up on one side of the street and then on another side street and they measured this the distance between this the the the two cameras and they measured how fast people were walking from one camera to the next and through the speed of their walking they could determine accurately how many people live in the city so it's a direct response to too many people people start moving faster and more aggressive and more tense and they they walk faster yeah yeah literally you could literally set a camera up on a block and within a couple of hours they could tell you how many people live in that city just by how fast they walk that's crazy crazy nology nuts did you saw how fast they talked yeah that's crazy no that's crazy yeah technology is is insane thank you brother do you blow your nose laughter oh you clever bastard ya know technology is amazing but that's just you know you live in wahoo yeah there's a lot of people in Honolulu yes I live in I didn't wine I okay so if you put if you put a you put that county talking about in wine I like people's less stressful be chili people people be walking slowly like oh my gosh we was living it over here loving it that video of you that they play where you were a really young kid where you were just getting into fighting I was I was

let this kid represent Hawaii like how he said because he says it's like there's people young people there's let him just let him represent and then they did it it's five hours in a plane across the ocean that shit is barely America Hawaii is amazing I love it it's one of my favorite places to visit I go there three four times a year I love Hawaii but that is not America I love that they're protected by America I loved it I loved all the rights you know I loved all that but I feel very strongly that they should have their own it should be sovereign it's it's you know they just have their own it's it's their own thing man how the fuck you gonna claim something that it takes five hours to get to on a plane yeah it's not even attached it's crazy it's crazy but again I love that it's protected by America I loved it were considered to be from the same country I love all that but every time I go to Hawaii I'm like come on man this place is different there Hawaiians like if you go to North Dakota you can't look at someone to go oh that's a North Dakotan right you go to Hawaii like all that dude so why is a Hawaiian guy you know Polynesian I mean there's there's so many people in Hawaii that they're clearly Hawaiian yeah I mean it's there's no state like that there's no Alaska you don't look at someone I mean they get a full beard flannel coat and fucking moose leg over their shoulder maybe that's not Alaska you're guessing yeah he might have moved there yeah it might just be a mountain man and we're 100% it's a great place though this is a thing about Hawaiians that they have like a you're on an island you're surrounded by ocean there's like a reverence for nature yeah that Hawaiians have yeah that I really like yeah you never did you never see my hiker Holloway's what does that make her Holloway hiker Holloway yeah I got YouTube we got it we got a guy named pyke Holloway whose hiker Holloway you looking at the man you you have a YouTube video we just hiked hiker Holloway what the fuck is this oh this is a shit you did recently yeah I did this in Vegas Canyon isn't that funny that Red Rock like just outside of Vegas it's like a whole nother world like you might as well be on Mars yeah yeah it is it looks like Mars if you survival tips goes to YouTube guys you know I break down plants there's a plant that you see in there what plan you cannot it's called it's got a ladder tree but yeah you need to go and see stuff do you actually know what you're talking about hiker Holloway surviving in the wilderness all max s all max s do you surf I love it little bit ya have to surface Yeah right yeah let him out a few if you don't yeah yeah I I mean the countdown people came the shot and I didn't get me on the best way so I was like wow I was like guys I caught at least 20 waves and years put like the the four that I sucked on what are we doing he's doing that on purpose what we're doing here yeah he's not going or I could have actually only caught that four ways that I could be like so we don't know what what you do hurt I don't you get I'm gonna keep you guys up to you guys and keep you guessing waves like surfing is an interesting thing right because it's you're in their world you're in the water world oh yeah so like I don't know like all the big wave surfers in like Makua Rothman them and they always tell me or even when I see my friends at surfing z2ow countless saying and they call it to me they tell me man if I'm so crazy I'm like guy surfing is crazy and they're like no fighting this case I was like guy I'm fighting with a human being and I kinda can't control what they do at certain times and what I do and this and that like when you're surfing you're fighting mother nature my god like you follow up your board and if mine is still like I was gonna throw you three times you're going get thrown three times just a video that Dana put up on its Instagram but one of the big was a Molly I was a big wave that's like a 50-foot wave that yeah that guy alright I think he's fine yeah III didn't know I think I just saw it I saw it cuz dana posted I saw a bunch of my surfing friends posted X that is the number one nightmare this guy gets on the board right away he's slipping and just goes down and watch this motherboard oh yeah the weight of that water that has and he's got one of those vests on will you pop up yeah but but yes that's the next thing I was gonna bring up yeah you got to pop up this but like I talked to my friend and stuff that doesn't some of this like you don't know if it's gonna if it's gonna pop when you go underwater like what if it like you trust it yeah look at him wipe in there boom Jesus his board looked to the wall it looks like nothing yeah that's like that is probably a 50-foot wave that is fucking crazy that is terrible I'm so scared and that's a real surfer that's a national fuck so my buddy Kenny he just went to Texas in Waco Texas they got one of those endure sufferings yeah yeah Texas so he said he said it was amazing oh yeah so he's flying into Texas he gets off the airplane he's got fucking surfboard some of my buddies and everybody's going looking at the plane what you're at the wrong place man wrong flight yeah I I was uh the 40 spots harassing Kelly Kelly Slater Kelly was that pipe he's hitting me up and he's doing something so he's calling me seeing what I was doing I they were doing mousing camp so I couldn't meet him and I told him I was harassing I was like I'm going to surf right he's like let me know we've got the surfer and so I want to surf I want to go to his Sir Francis right that's the hours from here yeah yeah couple hours his own is in California right now yeah where's his near it's like it's near Fresno or something like that Valley so Central Valley so that's like two hours from here so something like that three or three yeah yeah that looks amazing man that's a way to learn oh I can't even wakeboard I can't boarding is harder is it yeah cuz you gotta get your ass up on the thing at least listen you can paddle and kind of stand up okay wait wait buddy it's kind of hard yeah there's like but you're an athlete you can do everything come on with time yeah time to get into surfing my fear sir look at this is this is the Machine this is so this is him surfing with this thing like fucking how crazy is that you can learn how to surf so much quicker this way you know because you don't have to fuck with all the things that everybody else has to fuck with like waiting for waves you could look at that look at riding that - that's so crazy no sharks right good point very good point Jaime no turtles no nothing no nothing yeah but it's just you'd learn it's all about the balance right learning the balance they say they were riding that wave is a little bit different though oh really yeah it's a little bit different from like a normal way feels a little bit different like what's on treadmill versus running on the street yeah yeah I think so the power of the wave is little bit more different than how it actually feel yeah a little more predictable yeah yeah that's what it is fuck this it seems like a good hack you know that really no or Shane Dorian someone who really knows how to surf there's probably practice practice to stay on it how much do you think it cost to make one of those things oh I was blind it was fuck it's a bunch and then you need to you need the motor or whatever that's gonna that nothing it looks like a train is pushing Oh must you see sighs yeah you see side of it the one that they have in Waco is supposed to be bigger than that even the one they have in Waco supposed to be gigantic what are you laughing at Jamie it's not cheap to visit how much does it cost says customers paid $10,000 to surf for an hour oh gosh what yes PA wait a minute what this is the ESPN video they made a batterer says you can surf 100 miles inland for $10,000 Kelly Slater trying to get okay getting his money back real quick lake in the middle of the desert that's clean and safe and right but $10,000 for an hour you could suck all the dicks well this employees you get a fork yeah you can suck all that maybe gonna heat it what's not colder I got some cash ain't spent $10,000 to serve for an hour but if I was a professional surfer look at the stars who've done it Eddie Vetter Tony Hawk Chris Hemsworth the Thor they have Thor surfing the ad darlin I think store paid ten thousand bucks I'd read or just you know use this hammer now you keep it you a bone yeah that's a lot of money man is it really that much that can't that can't be right ten thousand dollars for an hour I know it was a YouTube so maybe maybe clickbait yes PN's you time not that there ESPN's not really click 300 percent must be fuckin expensive as shit to run but it makes sense I mean it's probably got a crazy motor that powers up when you guys hear that he sits private too so maybe like yeah I want to turn it on that makes more sense that makes more sense well that's probably how they keep people out listen bitch $10,000 thank you I'll call my friend see what side I mean you see the way my college set up right now all right I just Google just so we know okay general admission tickets are $99 a day or that's a private kicked me it must have been for the private stars that make sense so if you want to use the whole thing just for yourself okay what the fuck we're friends ten thousand bucks that makes sense if you want to rent the whole if you want to rent out the roller place if you want a roller skate for a whole day probably cost you 10 grand no way how big no come on if you want it all for yourself for a party how much you think that if you said listen nobody can come here it's just me I bet they would want a lot of money uh you think so yes man I've laces for my kids it's not cheap man you know yeah we know we know yeah yeah you know they - in Hawaii - things are expensive in why man you cut you might be right dude lanai is great come on no guy no Joe Rogan I'll shut you out the next time shout you out I'll shout you out man the night we were there we saw strawberries that were like seven bucks for a little package of strawberries oh but it makes sense yeah crazy but like I don't you know get more but I felt like $15 they were all telling the folks who live on the lanai are telling me like Amazon Prime's the shit they don't have to shop everything just get everything's flowing into them Hey oh that makes sense because the planes are coming there every day this load up some of your stuff on planes you don't have to them because otherwise they have to go to Maui or somewhere yeah yeah you know yeah do you think you live in one of them little islands like that because you live where a lot of people live like you're in yeah yeah we live it far off no hiker Hollow is only there's only a only couple our kind of thing is a 10-minute video log for you to my guys after that I'm right back to gatok Holloway gadget Holloway yeah and the gadgets I didn't do I'm in the technology yeah what are you into whatever I just want if you did my school loans yeah shooters yeah game video games a video game that's my kryptonite video games well gaining fame well we were playing quake champions but I got a real problem what's the matter I just wanted to get back in yesterday I just thinking about yesterday we're talking about else like one more game and put more I have a very new PC personality yeah yeah Mouse to it yeah too hard I tried to do it for me and then I was like man cuz I want to get into it but yeah it's too hard for me like and then and I get frustrated I get frustrated like when people like like yeah I'm like guy come on come on guy send me location that might be one of the greatest things that ever has ever said when someone said they want to fight him said location said okay yeah those little things those little Xbox and PlayStation controllers they're not is accurate you can tell I play so I was playing when I was playing for another playing PC before they had to cross play now you can play with everybody on to your police station for but I'll just put my controller in and and I could you could tell that you are when I was playing with the with the mouse and stuff you could tell Dave and accuracy it was way different now you use your controller and stuff the delay is like really it's very small but you can feel a delay like I'm like I turn around already you know like it's just 9 it's just not accurate enough and even with your movements right like the movements with the keyboard especially a mechanical keyboard I feel like I can really calculate what I'm doing like within like inches centimeters that's know yet super dice play eight hours a day I just play online I had a t1 I lived in like in the wilderness and there was no fucking good internet so I had a t1 line installed in my house they had a drink digging to the ground took forever lake pipes and shit so that I could get a good gaming line that's you had you appreciate that that's accurate and I got to the point where I was like I gotta stop I quit for a long time I had to stop I had to stop playing games cuz that's what I do like I'll train be gone all day get home play for another four hours like and then not screwing up my sleep and whatever it's like even like tomorrow ever came out during this uh during during this fight camp and the new one I was playing and then I was like I was playing I was loving it and then like the last three weeks of camp I was like yeah or last four weeks I was like yeah I gotta stop playing there's no way like done so I turn it yeah cuz they you just get lost track of time I don't play story more like I'm a guy like I just want to get love fortnight and and then even Call of Duty because then you can you you pretty much have all the same guns and you just get in there you can just start battling with guys and like it's competitive you know yeah and so that's what I liked you know just being competitive and then I was like man I didn't play for 10 plus years and then we set up but we had a land room in there in the back yeah dudes real problem and so once we started playing I was playing every fucking day hours and hours and hours Jamie you played you had it for like what two years and Jeff and I put logged in more hours on the just that game yeah for sure we logged in more hours in how long two months three months more than two years ago in 660 days playing four hours a day yes and that was just because I only had four hours a day like if I if I didn't have to go somewhere I ought to be good I come here on days off I'd come here work out I come here I hit the bag do some rounds on the bag and I want to play in four or five hours online and I was like fuck I gotta stop doing it attack say what are you doing come on bro let's go do this though it's too crazy it is crazy to be a dick dude my brain is like what the kids making now oh yeah they make a real money oh my gosh millions million millions playing video games please no leg kicks did you see yeah did you see did you see what's the name Sean oh my I give like he came 15 plays and he made like more whatever it is and they did a comparison of how much he made like twenty seven thousand twenty seven five hundred thousand and versus his fights yeah versus fight they did it they compared it to his fights I was like what that's crazy he could be a professional fortunate ER for nighter he's good too I saw a couple extremes wow that's well he had to do something right he didn't he get fucked over by a band supplement yeah Sean O'Malley says he makes around 4500 hours a month or gaming he just want 20 I think was 27,500 gave it to he gave it all to a charity really he came fourteen place or eight play something like that but he also chair yeah he's the man I like that kid yeah I like him a lot yeah and then I think so I think that he got caught what was was with I think was marijuana or something like was it yeah yeah I think what I think that's what it was it's not what it was I thought it was a tainted supplement yeah I think Jamie was saying they're gonna not test baseball players anymore for pot I saw that yeah good good that's what we want a bunch of stolen people out there trying to catch a ball I'd be terrible maybe better I really know where that balls going they took marijuana off their list but they added opioids which is oh that's good thing but yes dad it was so oh boy - on the list before people are like Juan what what that's that's crazy because that's a real problem man that's so that's a real problem opioids is the real problem not marijuana that's great that's heaven Oh Hawaii has a lot of drug issues right Oh 100% yeah yeah 100% how'd you avoid that chick growing up huh you know like I saw it I saw like I remember like being like dingo ate tell us eat no no how we had to be younger maybe I was six seven six or seven my brother's you know one younger than me I remember like my uncle coming into the bathroom and my mom was showering me and my brother and like just fighting with my mom like that they're fighting like fist fighting and like you know like this is normal or you know like Isis like Isis like crazy in Hawaii and that's his bathroom yeah meth and I was like holy shit this is nuts and then I see like my friends and family their parents or whatever or even going to high school they're my friends doing or this and that I'm like guys is not for me like I ain't gonna do this shit like I I see what it did to my family how affect and someone might look like people I love his friends and stuff families and I was like I ain't gonna do this and then and then that's this why I just stayed away I'd never I never did anything never did no type of drug not even marijuana never tried it really never never did not done yeah no but yeah you have though that's what's funny yeah yeah yes so man I don't need it yeah I did I just saw I just saw what a lot of people like and then I step away from marijuana for the wrong reason because when using high schoo you remember when I heard this always sticks out to me whenever you talk about it is when you bring up the dog no you're not you're nothing if you top that's a bit from my leg I think that's from 2009 and I really wish you wouldn't smoke guys play that shit go back rewind a little bit hear the whole thing I wish you didn't smoke weed you're not the same when you smoke and I miss my friend I'll be outside what the fuck would they think you are I really think you're not very wise our cocaine and sleeping pills her fucking dog is talking to her not only that she's not even reacting if your dog was talking to you and you were high you'd be like fuck you could talk wait wait this old dive you use the Deaf bath of outside what are you doing why are you barking at me if you want double you wanna eat yeah it's just so she doesn't even react she's like she's not freaking at a hat she's not freak you would freak the fuck out yeah Marshall started talking to me a bit like what hold on do that again get my phone out yeah that was a stupid commercial no yeah well yeah I just saw I just saw a lot of people like and we got a lot of talented kids from our side from Waianae like I saw it guys like supposed to be in I think I think personally this was being NFL and will be orally supposed to be greater things you know and just drugs and just other stuff like you know the most of them you stood at home I stood seen him around town when I'm around town and working a job they don't like talking about the days when there's in high school and they did certain stuff and I always told myself that that's not gonna be me you know the older people I was old me and it would drugs to us like the saying I stopped me you know like I'm gonna let this be it you know this ain't it for me so where did you develop did you always have this mindset that you're gonna be great at something Oh 100% when I like what I saw so ninth grade when I was my grade I remember going from eighth grade eighth grade to ninth grade I was great night great and one of my cousin's my older cousin she's with me at this last fights I thought he was supposed to be an MLB I saw I liked and he wanted to be an MLB player sighs I don't be an MLB player so I go home uh-uh I tell my grandma grandma bill and we'll be player she's like okay good but you know he got to college right I was like yeah and what's the problem she's like we don't have money for college so you need to go get a scholarship so I'm okay though so I I made school I I just graduated cum laude and stuff because I thought I was gonna play I thought I was gonna play and I want to play a mobile and to go to college get a scholarship but but anyway 10th grade tanker it came and then it was off the ending of baseball I found fighting and when I was fighting when I fought I fought the ladders like only a week left in school and then I fought and I fought we came to school I trained I first I trained I only tried to start with him and me no I started kickboxing I only trained for three days I drink three days yeah my friend told baseball this season just done I went to train with him I trained for three days and then on the second day or I went there to a Wednesday Thursday Friday so four days so Wednesday I went trained Thursday I show up they told me oh oh and my friend was fighting on Saturday he's done Oh max the coach loves Mack someone dropped out you want to fight you gotta weigh 135 I was like I was like bet I was i'll fight because I was gonna go out I don't have to ask my but my story was I had to ask my grandma for $35 to get into a fight towards my friend kickbox but I was like I get to fight and I get for free I get in for free you know you train for two days in the ass today what kind of fucking coach were you going to they ask you if you want to fight he I want he he saw what out what we sparring already I was boring the first day second they came back like they was like technical sparring but then we was doing you know like the first time I ever sparred when I went with them I got punched in the face and the first thing that went in my mind like I got a punch this guy back I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I'm gonna punch you right back in your face cuz I heard you know and that as what we did and then I ended up fighting I don't know winning the fight I remember going to school that following Monday and telling everybody this is when k1 was huge this is 2007 I was like I'm gonna be a k1 fighter guys watch someone told you that like hey man I was at the gym for two days they told me I'm good I should fight it's not a fight that weekend and not one mom was because I wasn't 18 I was only 16 so I had to get approval from her like she had to like tell the coach that I could do it and she liked my I told my mom there is actually a fight any my mom asked me are you ready I was like I don't know I don't know but I wanna fight is like okay just don't get hurt that's how crazy my mom you know I mean that's my mother she's crazy so she let me fight and the rest is history and in two years later that's when BJ Penn was the BJP an era in the UFC PJ is flying George BJ went on that 55 streak and then I saw how much he made after won his fights it's like 30 K I was like this is done I was telling everybody when I was when I was graduating at the humvee UFC champion I'm like okay I told them I'm bi i I thought I would be a UFC fighter I was angry a UFC fighter 100% and then my brother my older brother he graduated he graduated from from high school from college I mean from college he came home with California he went to California to support something or to do arts to something here and he came home and I was graduating high school that day and I was on his computer playing games and he was like he's like you graduate what you're gonna do now I was like I looked at him I was like only a UFC fighter and he did this laughs I'm not gonna ever forget is this ingrained in my brain is like ha ha ha ha he said yeah I don't know how that's gonna work for you so you better go figure it out you know and then I was only nine and then two years later January 4 January 4th I was at the hospital and my my son was with my I was waiting on the rival my son I remember exact times 10:03 am i I give my phone I have my phone rang and you like lay check the email so I go check my email and is a UFC contract to fight poor year for February for first I hang up the phone I hang up the phone first person I call my older brother and he know I was there for my son's for my son die was being born and he picks up the phone he's like oh he said what's up max I was like what he's my nephew here I got no and he led them what and then he and he's big into Vice Allison but as I was saying was I told you so like there's this thing like I told you so and I told him ah I told him all no guess who you talking to you is like who I'm talking to I was like he's talking to your C fighter and he glad go ahead go ahead you can tell me I gotta tell you what and he like tell me I told you so I was like no I just wanted to let you know it's like I call you in my son's ear and I hung up the phone and they drill through my son's there so January 4 it was one of the best days of my life wow that's crazy and then you fought Connor when you were like 20 or 21 I danced 21 yeah 21 I think he's 23 or whatever I think he's 2 or 3 years older than me so I think if he was 24 then I was 20 tours on then 21 so that was your last and then you went on a crazy streak yeah you weren't on a crazy winning streak yeah yeah it was crazy you know like what like when you see that Connor doing stuff like I'm a big believer and things happen for a reason you know before that we had a actually member talking to you after the after my first one was Bermudez on I fucking Mutis mm-hmm and I was a tough fight I remember I ran into you at where we fought MGM and I was and he was leaving he was going back home to LA or wherever he was going and I saw you at the elevators he's like keep your head up kid so I thought you did I thought you did enough and I was like yeah you'd be back though for sure and then and then after that we fought Connor and then those two fights really meant a lot at that time in my career cuz it it just made me like realize like how much I got all this I really gotta buckle down I really had to do do something I really had to find something I didn't have a striking coach until yeah like I had my first coach that started with like when I got into UFC it was no longer and I I'm with um I ended up doing jujitsu it I rather than Azar's the coach I'm with now he's been ever since UFC live it before my UFC fights too and then I never had a striking cause for what Dustin and then we went on 402 so whatever the one one five six seven my first seven fights in the UFC so what did you do for starting you wanna you really want to know what I did yeah you know the USC game I'll use henan borough and um and and Jose Aldo and I'll do stuff with them a black hole yeah this works in the game so my friend at the time Dustin Kimura he would kind of hold mitts for me and I'd be like look I tried this in the game and it was working let's try it and we did it I figured out from UFC right you see the regular you see in the first ever used to get yeah what hit him bro watch the video gonna play a video game and be like oh look at this I tried combination of like oh yeah this kind of works so let's try it why not it was it got me that far that is so ridiculous Wow so then you realize you had to do something different after the Bermudas loss not the Bermudas loss like the boom years loss we was trying to find a striking coach in this and that and in the corner lost he was like yeah yeah I get this shit going you know my my my my coach did Ryland I was like man pull somebody in and then he bring in the guy I work with now Ivan floors my striking coaches my striking coach and AH and he lives on the islands yeah he lived and I did we all we all in one gym now well together yeah so it's like super easy now I made a giant difference a humongous difference like big big dish what does your brother say now greatest featherweight of all time yeah nothing yeah I can't say yeah let's go yeah I never say hey man you remember yeah I always yeah I'm not gonna let you forget that God let you forget that it's kind of hilarious right it's like your younger brother telling you he's gonna be a UFC fighter yeah he turns out to be one of the all-time greats and you're mocking them yeah he said this is exact Wednesday's yeah good luck that is the EJ you should start you should start looking into colleges or some type of state job I was like I was like nah you just watch you just wait Wow talk about like calling it but that's one of those things like if someone tells it to you like I'm gonna be a UFC champion okay yeah one of my friends you know like Micah Nakagawa like he he used to train my alpha male cuz he went to UC Davis he got dropped he got picked up from you I favored him because the UC Davis and stuff and that's why you can see Russell yeah he's a wrestler yeah big-time wrestler and then I remember the first time wrestling going with him and I was in the UFC already and I was in idea I was in the UFC already and Chad was one of the top guys you know I know all done and Iraq I remember my friend my friend told me does it come more like oh yeah he chillin alpha-male damn bro blah I woke up straight to him I shook his hand I'm like I told him you know what Chad Mendes ass right I think he was like wait what I was like yeah I probably would Chad Mendes ass and he's like okay and this is here after he just taking my ass down like hundred times in practice you know I mean like he or or right before he did that in and then he we would practice and he took me now like a hundred times in practice you know I don't know wrestling too good and I still told him it and I start talking like Chad Mendes eyes I'm gonna beat up like this is this how life goes you know I was like I'm probably gonna tell him and I probably talk I don't be all day although I won't be the champ I was like these guys can't date now you touch me and you can ask him about the story and he always told me like when I actually happened here finally told me is like yeah max I was never going to tell you but I thought you fucking insane this is a different confidence he's gotta put it on in the world you know if you think you can do something go do it and go work hard I wasn't scared of hard work you've always had this attitude though do you know where you got it from ah I don't like my grandpa you know I guess it has to be from my grandpa you know my grandpa he probably mad you know he passed away when uh when I was eighth grade but he probably be mad now I'm fired because he didn't want us he fight he's a electrician so he just wanted us to get a good job a great job family house and all that stuff but is this him hard work you know like I remember coming off coming home from practices or or or school before you go out we had to do all the chores whatever every Saturday Sunday we wake up at 6 o'clock he had breakfast he had breakfast made for us and we clean the yard before we could go do anything else and he just had structure you know and hard work and he's like if you want say we had the pool weeds and he was one of those guys that would find work out of nothing like we doing one thing we'd be done and it'd be done ahead of schedule like ok perfect I need to do this like no no this is not it you know we could say nothing but we gotta ask me if if we did but yeah I think I was just my grandpa you know like and it was just like sacrifices I get high in high school but I what I did when I was playing baseball and stuff like I gave up all my my recesses my recess and my and my lunches or my lunch we had turned me at lunch and 15-minute recess like to do my homework cuz all I wanted to do was be a MLB player so when I went out to practice right after baseball out right after ice of school is finished I remember just going on the field and not thinking about going home I got to homework or I got to do a project a lot of teachers would help me out and in school and out stuff and this and that that's how I got come lolly like I'm not the smartest kid like I figured out I hacked a lot of things going to Kent getting in life I hacked a lot of things like one of the things in school I realized that you sit by one of the smartest kids I used to sit by the smartest kids every time I was in class I'll sit by smarts kid accident for help they're there help me willingly like okay I help me help me help me and if I get really got stuck today ah give me that take my work and do my work for me perfect okay I just have to get like C's on top of my my Tessa's to get the grades and I was doing good you know boys and the money so this is about hacking life I guess so you just learn hard work from your grandfather 100% so what he made you do and then he put it in your head that you could do whatever you wanted to yeah you save you if you want anything everything anything or everything ever comes from hard work you're not gonna ever get gifted anything and if you are gifted something don't take it say thank you smile or whatever but go out and work for it or earn it you know he didn't he was one of those guys that if you gave him something he always made sure he gave you back something he didn't want to feel like he owed you you know maybe he would be upset that you were fighter but damn he'd be proud of you yeah why not that this is the number one thing like so every time the huge he already was like he was out of work he's retired stuff and he every morning 6 o'clock in morning be we had a gazebo drinking his Miller Lite every every morning school day week day every morning say come home from school at 2 o'clock he stood there drinking really like you know like drinking a Miller Lite so I know he's up there wherever he is whatever you believe in I know he's looking down on me and just being like he always just a stupid kid and I know he doesn't look at me and just I know he's proud and stuff but I know he's just like you it don't mask as cool as well you know it's it's just amazing what you've accomplished it's amazing when you stop and think that you're still only 28 to you know you got a long way to go man 20 we got took that's why that's why it's funny you know like a lot of people is like yeah this guy's the future division or this is the future thank you yeah I'm on the time traveler gasps the voice right now so that means that that you know most guys your age not even fighting for a title yeah I got in like was coolest to have a stuff on this card uh Hooper died Hooper kid yes cuz he 20 yeah yeah I'm just like I was just like it when I came in I remember uh I remember I told him oh sup I saw him I said hi and I was talking to him and then people's time yeah you know he is 20 I was like yeah that's why I wanna go shake his head cuz I was I was that kid how are years ago yeah and I was like what's up man you know thank you nice to meet you you know and uh it's crazy because like when I was that age I remember fighting in Vegas the first fight poor year I remember I was standing I was watching people gamble and then there's like a can't get your ID I was like oh yeah sure show my ID to card they gave me back there's like yeah you need to get the hell off it get the hell off the floor I was like why they're like it's a casino hook you're not 21 you can just only walk though I was like well there's some bullshit you know I think it was bad yeah that's hilarious you're you're old enough to fight but you're not old enough to gamble exactly I saw something biggest gamble you can ever do with your life exact and I'm fighting grown men yeah you know like a grown man come on and it's a gamble yeah that's the real girl fuck money man you're throwing knuckles and shinza people trying to choke them they try to choke you that's the biggest gamble of personal life yeah that's wild you have crazy fucking cardio man yeah your cardio is very impressive genetics is it genetics it's gotta be a lot of hard work - man I've seen the hard work done with the sale yeah all kinds of what kind of shit do you do first strength the condition you have a separate strength and conditioning coach yeah yeah I got I got this guy named Aaron Yap top takuchyan conditioning I don't know wha whoo and he's won evenly but he was best guys out there you know ladies and of course I say like people know my coaches because I don't really like they don't really like me talking about them oh yeah every time they hear me talking about so saying like they just want everything to me that's how this team is like this they just want everything on me they don't want people don't know they don't want literary luck yeah you're very less yeah yeah I'm blessed I got yeah I got some I got some of the best best guys behind they don't want they don't wanna know but yeah it is hard work you know and and then you often do you do it like when you're in camp guys I do Sharon conditioning at least four times four times at least for us and what kind of shit are you doing I lift weights for sure and then we do cardio stuff like we try balance it you know like you gotta have one of our favorite sayings you gotta have gold muscle in our show muscle you know you see some of these guys I just like how you said like there's rip and look amazing this and that but they're like tired in like 30 seconds that's show muscles you know we gotta have go monster so I do a bunch of some days heavy listening some days circuits some days sprints different type of Sprint's David type of running I like running I like jogging but it's run on the beach I like running on the beach you know the the beach is pretty fun but it's just it's kind of everything I like swimming I do swimming here and there but it's all different type of muscles you know we make sure we uh we all sit down we we do and we talk about the goal at hand and then we make the training around it so when you're doing four days a week he's scheduling all the stuff for you like you know what you're gonna do oh so I have the boy got it easy the boy got it so easy like I'm my manager him the couple coaches I got a couple of PT guys and a couple of doctors they're all in a group text they all got my my my calendar and they put everything in there for me so you just got a look at my calendar the night before and I know where I need to be with addresses times and everything Wow so let life be good you know like be really good at that they spoiling me love that's beautiful so four days a week you're doing that are you doing that in the morning I like I like working I like doing that before I like if if I am doing it on that day or whatever that I do do certain condition that's my first work all day I like I hate when I see people do do the jiu-jitsu training before and then they go and then they go and try to do stuff like that's not gonna happen like this backwards like was a because I believe like you're getting tired and stuff and you go straight and conditioning you're not gonna be able to give your foo like I can't you can you cannot push on a weight thing like if you got a lift heavy or or do cardio stuff you can't push when you're ready tired right but because you got like it's a cardio thing or there's weights evolve or whatever I'll check my but when I'm in jiu-jitsu I can mentally push myself to break you know I mean like I can go without without getting hurt without really getting hurt Brian but then if I go to do jiu-jitsu I got I got a live I can't like what I could do before if I'm fresh versus what I can do now is like it's totally different you're not getting stronger you're not getting anything but you can't get mentally stronger or whatever or smarter with it and you can figure things out when you apply it like I'd rather be tired going to any type of jiu-jitsu training wrestling training or kickboxing training versus going to versus the other way around there's a lot of jiu-jitsu gems like Carlson Gracie is they used to do that they just have a real hard workout before you were trained before you were trained you do bear claw bear crawl yeah the one like yeah yeah push-ups sit-ups and different kinds of drills that you do like strength and conditioning routines and you would do that before you would ever get a chance to train so you'd be exhausted because you got to figure it out hmm because this is like if I like I like to like do I don't know it just mean you know like with this point system this is that I try I always try to finish fights no matter what even if you the best kind where I don't try to finish you and you always assume in your face I'm not gonna go away because that's just it you know like if I if we fought to death if there's no time limit I'm good like I'm gonna kill you like this is my mindset like there's no way I'm gonna figure out a way to make you tired and it make you quit and when you quit you you know may peace be with you to the next one but at the end of the day that's what it is that's why you you should be in that moment because if your freshness that everybody can be the greatest fresh but there's the special ones that know how to figure it out when they're not there like when you're tired and you're dead tired you gotta go that warm around the extra minute you figure things out and that's what that's what separates the great from the greatest you know this is the difference I think well that's always been a real signature of your fighting style is your endurance and your confidence in your endurance so you could push through I'll never forget the rematch with Aldo and right before the second round you came over to us and you went the man's time going already and when I came down when I came by you I was like the man's tired cuz I knew I was like this guy's done he's done he came out I remember he came out fast he came up faster they go straight right left hook and I was like maybe he might not be but we're gonna find out right now and then I pushed the delivery while I was i okay yeah yeah yeah that's a little smokescreen here that's what he had left from the little minute he got to he got to rest you know I couldn't fight that's his style is so explosive yeah he couldn't fight that way with you I mean that was a perfect example I like what you said I like what you said like I want in a dogfight knowing that I'm gonna come out on a dogfight like that I won't bring the fight to him and that's what that's what that's what we knew you know I knew that I had forced him into yeah I knew that if I got into a couple of slugs with him every time I went every time I came out my battery probably dropped 2% but he's dropping like 30 why is that I did the dude is genetically gifted with power hmm with power you know and I knew it I knew I knew that I was in it I was in him for longing and if you watch his last is a lot of his fights I I got to that's the cool thing about him like I got to watch I got to watch him when I was 16 I've been watching 16 and now I got to face this guy like I always told myself like even before I was in MMA I want kickbox this guy if I could fight him for five rounds I I could beat him in a kickboxing match that is what I told myself you know just is the belief you need to be great you know and keep pushing in because you just watch him you can just see him get tired overtime you know I said he win the first three rounds fort fit he just coasted yeah yeah the the gifted with powers so true because those guys were gifted with power rarely have the cardia yeah yeah like there's there's a lot of guys there that I just think like gosh I wish I had your power if I could just have give me 2 percent of your power right I would love that you know but and we work you know I'm working for I try I'm trying to get it but just I get just God give it like this is different like this some guys this god-given power they just touch each it boom people's likes a little said for the kind of endurance in the style that you have that style of constant pressure but I like this my style and stuff like I like it because like when you do knock out someone they can always be like oh he just caught me you know like we all do and stuff the first one that's what they was saying there's like yeah Mac you lose in the first couple rounds but you just caught him so the second time we did back we ready that we running back and I I had to do what I do you know I want to show everybody look I'm here for real but that's why I like my style but like yeah you do good but I'm like and what like if you knock out somebody like catch them early in the round say five seconds in akumal you can be like yeah you just caught a lucky punch even if it was the most calculated punch in the world you know even like what the corner didn't like this is the lucky punch there's not a lucky punch you know Conor is in the back practicing it you know I mean like you see it wasn't a lucky punch but people keep telling them no it land is lucky blah blah so it's always gonna be whatever you know over your head whatever but the way I fight and stuff I just want to just out class you in every single way that I possibly can and show the world like so you wanna you wanna wrestle yeah try and get me there you want to do jiu-jitsu yeah take me down let's see let's see if you can get me there first and then if you want to do the striking thing yeah let's do it you know I just want to show the world that look I'm better than you in every aspect so like mentally that that just screws with someone you know do you think that a guy that has the kind of power that although house can ever have the kind of endurance that you have for sure you know but it's fight different yeah for sure you know but in the back in their back pocket is just tough because sometimes when those guys mindsets I feel like with the guys who get knocked out who has knock up our mind says they turn to light they tend to like daddy's gotta land this yeah so so that's what and then and then you get tired in there like that because then you mentally fatiguing yourself because you're thinking about like oh shit I'm having a bad night now I just change it I got turning it now you start you start getting tend you start looking for that one shot you start missing that shot and like even when I fought all dude you is calling a lot look he's like he's whipping like when you miss a punch and your body goes with it it's tough it's tough to recover it's like oh my gosh and then you don't put in the the extra 5% that might get you more tired because you thinking like why like I just missed where is this kid you know like what is he doing then I'm back right on you you know so or anybody like they're back in your face like I'm here you know knock knock hello Utah laughs no all right that's dialed that's like Colby Covington Stiles very similar in the sense that he hears a crazy volume you know it doesn't he's not hitting you a hundred percent no I got talked to him after the Robbie Lawler fight I go I go wood how hard are you hitting are you hitting like 60% 70% he goes yeah somewhere around there 67 he goes I'm just putting it on just put it on I'm just keeping on staying on that Robbie Lawler fight was a perfect example he just kept that pressure going kept that pressure going super soon like Robbie never got a chance never had a chance to unload never had a chance to fire back and you and we're always line up our plans they look for it yep so I knew yeah that stuff they're looking for it and never come in mrs. cuz they're in their mind like I can't no don't worry it's not this one the next shuffle and then the next row of cars no no I got the next shuffle you know they they keep saying the next one but it never opening was never there for him the opening was never there for him that was why I was so interesting to watch him versus Marcus it was one has a crazy gas tank - yeah you smarts weird that was crazy but was just you know thank you pretty much punching each other right yeah I mean right in front of each other it was basically the kickboxing match I mean I don't think there was any takedown attempts if I remember I don't add him I think I don't remember any takedown temps very few low kicks you know who's been through a lot of kicks the body a lot of front kicks to the body in particular his body work paid off big-time yeah you see Kobe really fighting that body won't fade Behati work man yeah I mean the front kick to the body - that was money for him and that left hook to the body - you know he was digging digging oh that was actually right hand to the body right because he was fighting Orthodox yeah Kobe's fighting southpaw yeah yeah it was uh that's a wild fight that was a wild fight because it's like this month's got power and he's got cardio yeah both dance yeah for just smart use of his energy when you got daddies like I said it's a mental thing a lot of mental a lot of the guys that had the power is this that is kind of cut it off sometimes you know they don't rely on that yeah let's get back to working like this you know but Koosman is like a wrestler so he in his mind he's like I can wrestle to work and so as this do this wrestle pressure thing we just punches yeah I want I would see a rematch that fight - that would be very interesting to see a rematch because deaf I was super fucking closing competitive if I night that you know it's competitive that's how I hate everybody go yeah it was like no let's not get Friday night I don't want to look at it I want the fight to be like what is going on that's my thing well like the second Aldo fuck yeah I want people to be like wow this guy what's next yeah he's never gonna beat him you want that yeah you want that feeling exactly what I remember thinking that too because all there was a late minute last-minute replacement yeah I'm in the second fight particularly you would like it is what it is yeah and I was like do you know how crazy it is that this guy is talking about the greatest featherweight of all time he's talking about fighting him again it's like it is that is hilarious is this the guy if this is a guy you guys think is the greatest let me fight him like I said like everybody keep asking me about oh you really want to be fine after seeing what he's doing I'm like this could be human human you mean just like me in your eyes if you put me in octagon where I'm gonna fight them I'm a fighter that's it you know at that I just want to be the greatest of all time and he's the guy there you know he's one of the guys that he'd want to guys that stood undefeated in MMA it's impossible to do so why would you not want to fight someone like that that's the thing that blew my mind when people's like take it so short notice I'm like guy like that I this is what this is this is how these old legends are made this is why people remember your name you know and it's like they're like oh why are you doing this I wouldn't like the champions in MMA is John Jones is not defeated yeah he's not he's got this one bullshit loss you know that was one of the dumbest crazy yeah I remember you saying that - cuz they he was already finished the fight was done yeah he stopped him yes I was already done before before the elbows even came into it because he's like when he dropped him that's what the guy showed the problem yeah and and Muhammad is staying still already right he's getting crushed he was getting crushed in that fight it wasn't a competitive fight at all John was smashing them and then the fact that they gave that as a win to Matt Hamill is just bananas doesn't make any sense at the very least it should be in no contest he should be undefeated yeah should be undefeated it should be a win I think it should be a wind yeah exactly he here ready the fight was done when he did a trip-hop the show died when he was smashing him look this fucking rule is dumb this 12 understand how I can talk to six you first and out like jump right jump in the air and I and I like what is that 20 jaw yeah that's legal is legal but then once we go to ground is like understand I don't see what is the difference of both of it you know it's an old rule and it was brought together because John McCarthy said that they were talking to the commissioners when they were first starting establish rules you don't see people break eyes a punching fist all right they do use their head yeah dumb dumb dumb rule but anyway the bottom line is John's undefeated yeah and there's the Beeb's undefeated and who else what are the champion is undefeated I don't think there's another one so who does Ben beat it being who else you know it's could be khabib the only one as a champion yeah you know whose mom lost is one of the early fight she grander style no well he's not he's undefeated in MMA yes yeah Alba Nike watching yeah he lost to Alex Pereira that fucking demon is listed as undefeated yeah so it's style bender Jon Jones and khabib yeah so he's he's undefeated in MMA and I think he's only got one is the China girl to China champ wheelies young she John wheelie um the you have to say it backwards now Zhang Wei Li she have a loss not on this list she's not a list of all undefeated fighters yeah okay so she probably has a loss of brilliant career she's a monster man woo yeah that's big - for a girl like that to be that good and represent China you know China so he's so many people yeah it's huge for the UFC she's a wonder when she fought that girl Jessica entourage - man Jessica drives a beast you know for her to start her like that in the first round very very impressive it's a crazy time for the sport right what a time to be alive it's awesome so how do you feel like right now like what what happens now you relax for a couple weeks and then you concentrate on a rematch is that what happens we see I haven't whatever I don't I don't know you know I cannot I cannot say oh yeah rematch blah blah yeah it has to be a match for you if the you see one man yeah the fans once we see it happen I love that you know I'm a competitor yes everybody's like oh yeah you don't wanna rematch this and that or I see I'm like are you stupid easy dawg I lost it on my workout I want to fight every single one of them again you know I mean that's just how I am I'm a competitor we come we compete and if it's the reverse of the rematch you know if it's not if it's a different weight class different weight class if it's up couple-week I don't give it yeah I just want to be the world's best fighter ever and I want the most interesting fights if you guys if you guys want to see me fight somebody let me know you know like whoever you want to see me fight yeah you guys think is real gangsters whoever getting a real gangster fight is let me let me have my chops Adam beautiful I love that attitude man that's one of the
