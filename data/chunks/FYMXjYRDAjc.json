you'd go right out your door being the most awesome hiking spot ever and we're live ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you for joining in PR please no I don't want to do that but bratzman Jeff Evans bud Brett's been good friend of mine next-door neighbor and Jeff Evans his buddy who apparently has lived a fucking crazy life rescuing people off of Everest traveling up there and Budd told me we were at this little carnival with our kids like I get this guy on God talk to him so no pressure yeah your arm got put behind your sister back no it didn't it sounded good I was interesting this asshole on how did you get involved with first of all you when was the first time you summited Everest 2001 god damn man how many times you done it just once just for good I gotta get a 1.5 cause out of blonde dude with me yeah so you took a blind dude all the way to the top why didn't you take him like halfway yeah load his face dude you made it you're one of the rare ones the funny part was we got to the top and we like man we can see the curvature of the earth from here brownie goes I don't give a shit the guy would get out of here I can't see any big would it go that's actually not sure what he said is hey Eric take a look around take a look at what he said take a look around it was it instinctual or were you just fucking with him I mean I think it was a little bit of both I kind of instinctively fuck with him right we've been bros for a long time I mean it's a very fraternal relationship that we have so I by nature just sort of automatically fuck with this guy and I'll enjoy it and he enjoys it back because he is super blondie Rio the whole world loves loves him some Eric and I'm probably one of the few people that just kick him in the nuts you know giving a little bit of a hard time yeah yeah if you're a blind do that climbs mount everest people just give you a free pass a lot of stuff it's only that he claimed what else did Clint well he's done a bunch of stuff be just kayak the Grand Canyon two years ago in his own boat the whole thing 277 miles what he have a guy behind him going left right that's right buddy back and they had you know these earpieces and you know he asked me to go that's I'll climb Everest brush you're fucking gonna taking down the green cane there's something that people really love about someone risking their life and then pulling it off right something assuming you pull it off assuming yeah if you don't then you make one of those Instagram greatest fails yeah geez they were telling us before we went up there like you know Blondie's gonna die and when he does what'd you think was gonna happen they would tell me oh yeah we heard what the Sherpas or who oh no just the others like experts you know this is member this is back in note 1 this is when Everest was super-gorgeous yes a little bit a little bit more raw than it is now how is that what what has happened because I on the outside what I've seen is all the expose is that show all the human waste that they leave behind and including actual shit right and the tents and people pay people to kind of do all the hard work and then you just kind of show up and still hard right but not as hard you got to put in you know you got to put in the steps we got to put in the work but it's so commercialized that it's been it's been diluted to a certain extent and you know I'm I am a Sherpa advocate to the core you know these guys do the work I mean they put it in every single day they're humping the loads they're cooking the food they're setting the lawns they're taking the biggest risk and then allowing you know other folks to move through a little bit more effectively and faster and you know not have to expend as much energy and so over the we kind of we kind of got in there and oh one towards I think I think on the head of the curve just a little bit as to when it started to sort of change the face of ever has changed a little bit so how do they make it easier like what do they do that made it more commercial yeah not money number one gets in there and and pays a lot more Sherpas to do a lot more work so the lines are fixed the weather forecasting models are more effective and more efficient when say the lines are fixed the lines are fixed meeting the ropes the ropes on the mountain oh they're also fixed in clip-in yeah you clip into ropes when you go up okay so the ropes are there before you get there all you have to do is just kind of like hoof so it's not like before so you kind of wow that's weird so it's almost like you're on like a theme park you're like an Everest II it's you're still in Everest and you still could get fucked up by an avalanche right no question it's very dangerous there's no way to mitigate all of that but you know it's a it has been it has been eased up a little bit the edges have been taken off just a slight bit but it also adds that they're dangerous because one of the reef I was looking at it it's sometimes more dangerous now because there's lines there's sometimes 300 people 600 people in a line yeah and you're waiting from some asshole who didn't train and you're watching him try to climb up this little 20 foot cliff and they don't know how to work a Juma or they can't climb what's a jumar to hand-to-hand things an ascending device it's like one way of sending device to go up a rope so you can slide it up and it catches on the way don't you just pull but there people go up there when we were up there they had people they've literally what without talking shit about trekking companies there are some companies like alright we're going to show you how to put your crampons as you're going on the Icefall if Jesus Christ yet they've learned like we're gonna learn they've never had crampons before we we had to Jeff not me Jeff had to rescue risk his life in helicopters going to high high altitude to pick up people who shouldn't know business on the mountain so they didn't manage to get their body acclimated is that what the issue it's not that they didn't put in the apprenticeship because you know nowadays the commercial component allows folks that have enough money to pay and then show up and get guided basically to the top so back in the days you know if you didn't have your teeth cut you know you you know it was on you and nowadays you can just show up and and you know generally someone will be taking care of you whether it's a god or whether it's a Sherpa and so you know it's changed but you know I don't I don't want to take anything from the folks who still go out there it's a dream for so many people you know it's still an aspiration and and a life goal for you know a lot of folks and it's still very difficult yeah and so for instance last year we just saw I mean we saw a really nice cross-section of of skilled experienced climbers trying it but then we saw a shit show you know we saw a lot of folks who should have been on other Peaks first and then they weren't they skipped to the top you know right you know anything in life you know you you bypass the work and you get smoked yeah yeah we did a week our rescue team ARS rectus team our $5 to rescue in history 28500 off the balcony and a girl husband and wife I don't know if they did did she summit I don't think she summited though yes she was coming down the summit summits at 2935 she's at 28 500 she decides to sit down husband left her shirt Oh how's the left of it people quit yet people quit so just yeah yeah but she sat down and he left her yeah oh wait there's more to that story so he left her and then we go rescue her she say do you say sit right here Oh back in a couple days this is up for questions it's like there's two ways to look at we talked about this last night was she may have just been a Tapout bitch and just said I quit and he tried doing please come on come on come on finally just left her that's one scenario the other scenario is you know he just was like peace out good luck I'm out here's a problem I do it this way and I understand about diving so let's say you and I are diving we're 300 feet below the below the water right and my air goes out and I know we can buddy breathe but let's pretend there's nobody breathing and you're going to stick around and watch me die and you're gonna double dying or I'm going to grab a hold of you and grab your regulator and you're both gonna die you can't help anybody at that level you can't you're tired your body is eating itself you're basically dying in the Death Zone he could explain that basically and if you're if your wife says I'm sitting down I'm going to get up in five minutes you go ahead and she's got a Sherpa with her and then you go I go ahead and you get back to camp four which is exactly what happened get down to camp four and look around your wife's not there holy shit and then they call us and they wake jeff and i up we're like you're gonna what so I was I was with her right at base camp which when we delivered her to her husband and I was trying to gauge like is he gonna be one of these guys it's like oh my god I'm so glad you're alive or holy shit she's alive you know I don't and I think it was the former I think he was really ecstatic he was crying remember he was really no he was really upset but then hold on put all the team we got it we got no no that goes back because actually the first thing first kick in the ball so without taking the whole thing too just so what had to happen is as Jeff and I honor base camp manager Anthony had to take four Sherpas from camp 2 or camp 4 took two Sherpas and two more in the middle of the night so 6 o'clock 7 o'clock at night the most dangerous start winds are blowing 30 40 miles an hour it's 20 degrees below zero nobody nobody's ever done do you don't do it and we sent them up there and we said can you go get her Oh God so and you got to find this person on the line so they walked they kept walking and they kept walking we have video remember meeting this video how long does it take to get up the line like how normal normal human being you the three of us how long would it take the three of us to get from in South Col to where she was how can he probably three or four hours if you're in shape so take me out of that because I'm not a runner do yeah but I'm not doing any high-altitude hiking five give me five hours okay so so it's like very dangerous extremely dangerous especially at night the worst hanging it out yeah at the worst time not even no no no one knows where she is but the terrain dictates that she has to be unless she's falling off the side she's on a spine basically and and you know if you go up the ridge you're either gonna find her if she's loved or she's tossed off the side so she and also she's dealing with super low air no we're squeezing extremely cold no air bringing 30 what she's got they drink tanks yeah her air was gone so you're drinking you're your she brought no air with her or they'll she brought with her she's done she was abandoned basically so they left her so you know generally you would have somebody with an extra tank to be able to help her out but I get the sense that she just said I'm done and she sat down and everybody tried to kitten and then no one I have no one could get her together I want to walk back with her okay you can't ride that you can't carry somebody 29 thousand feet 28,000 feet so keep going so she would oxygen up there's 33% less than what's here at sea level 33 percent I mean it's at 33 percent so it's 67 percent less a third yeah Wow normal oxygen she was no auction so she sat down so the boys we have GoPros on them we had special cameras and pockets and all kinds of weird shit the film on the mountain and the boys are walking I have footage of Mingma Ming was walking up there and he's going I swear to god I'll say this for you he speaks decent English the whole time I'll send you the clip it's a funny clip you ever seen he's I'm like goddamn motherfucking fucking fucking mother he's is cussing every step of the way yeah it's a fucked up scenario yeah and you know to middle of the night he's looking at some you know potentially dead person in the Death Zone yeah in the desktop cool situation of time why is it a dead zone because of the oxygen is the lack of oxygen yeah your body's got it starts to conspire against you I mean you you you know you can't assimilate any nutrition you know you're the fluid in your body starts to go to places it's not supposed to go if it goes up in your brain and you get cerebral edema and you make bad decisions and you get a headache and you lose your vision and then you get pulmonary edema your lungs fill up with fluid you're drowning your own fluid you know it's it's a this is like stepping out of the spade capital of Mars know what this is gonna do to my body and you step out and shit start to pop and it's it's strange up there Wow they've done MRI studies actually this so that's where it is right there this is the line Jamie pulled over to the Death Zone lack of oxygen above 8,000 meters can be fatal to climbers so see that light thousand feet is fucking high eight thousand meters Duchess that's a season see that last dot before the summit that's 26 thousand feet which is right there exactly Jamie does not where she Sobers I love that that's like a way up and that's the balcony right no she was almost there 500 feet she was 500 feet from the top she may have who knows I don't know if she made it she was that she was a 28,500 we have a GPS coordinates on it she was a twenty eight thousand five five hundred feet from the top so she could almost say she summited Everest she's like she could see like Everest was like where your cars parked yeah except there's a lot of crazy-ass terrain between where she was and across that's where the Hillary step is that's where the ridge goes it's no water than your laptop and sections and it's a 10,000 foot drop into Tibet away right then a 6,000 foot drop into Nepal to the left either way I would hurt pretty fuckin it's as wide as a laptop in sections it's pretty pretty narrow you know but then why is it you know it opens up in it and it shrinks down and but I mean it's no place to screw the pooch you know and she did so oh my god so this is it right here that's the Hillary step right there which by the way it goes really interesting two years ago remember the earthquake two years ago and yeah so it knocked that whole Boulder off that Boulder that people are standing on right say Hilary stuff imagine if you're on that you're like I made it yeah you going for the ride that's not to think of ever for head a be you bro I'll fucking hop off and grab ahold of you mean see ya Yanks it up maybe you bro so that's uh look at that look at that clown show oh my god there's so many people so if someone falls onto you you got a real problem too yeah so the year we were up there in 2000 the year before the fall before there was a British guy I can't remember his name but he got caught up in the ropes descending from the summit down the Hillary step and got caught and there was nobody there with him and he got caught caught and he got stuck like I'm throw to 'ti yeah so we thought that for sure the first people that were going up in a1 that were a few weeks before us had to cut him free because we were we were speculating like if we're the first group that gets up there we're gonna have to scoot around this fella you know oh so he's just stuck on this line look but he's not there when we got up there he wasn't somebody ever to come for a now what do they do push him off the side well here's something for Jamie so there's 248 bodies on Everest yeah right now still there and these climbers I didn't go up I was at base camp the climbers use them as mark markers right you kind of go up here there isn't the original climber the guy for the first kind of Meghan well they found one yeah but he's on the South Summit he's on the other side they on the north side and Tibet Mallory it's yeah Mallory they found Mallory's body they see his body back right is bad still they're frozen kids they're weird yeah it's like ivory skin yeah that's still flesh like yeah still flush there but the crawlers cryogenically froze the crows pick at him they eat him there's crows at that at that altitude they pick at him this guy yeah yeah that's Mallory Jesus look at that that's so weird but that dudes a bad dude man that is a very bad man right there because they went out with some hobnail boots and some marginal equipment and everybody was telling him that they were gonna be dead for sure and they said we're gonna charge ahead and they did I mean this was this was back way back man this was in the 20s Yeah right so and there's the controversy that blew that boot the college versus that they summit at first but they can't prove it so that's a big controversy they thought her Vaughn and Mallory summited and then they fell on their way down so crows picket him oh yeah but whether the obviously still there yeah I mean not only that get at him as much but there's you know there's things there's just there's a lot of stuff there you know I get a lot of year there's a lot happening there that that's sitting on the mountain you have to walk past that yes you know I didn't see that guy but you've never seen that guy I didn't see that how many of the 200 and plus bodies of you see well you know the the conditions change so dramatically over the each season depending on snowfall so well you know that dude Jesus or some creepy things up there sumail that dude's face I mean there's looks happy I made it I don't think he and that you know Ike nice jacket that's pretty fresh that's a nice looking down seat yeah that's what I'm saying like how many people die a year well I think the average is you know nowadays is usually I think somewhere under 10 that you know between six and ten every season how many people attempt it I think it it the grade is is increasing every I think this year was the most it's summited the most attempted and most summited was this year I think close to 300 people somebody did Jesus pull that picture up again that image of deaths Sherpas and regular folks so a lot of the Sherpas died too huh yeah well I mean there they go they're higher in concentration they do the majority of the work well and that's one of the reasons I went out there we saved more Sherpas and we pulled out Sherpas off because more often than not they don't have helicopters and they don't have helicopter insurance and so we would go and I would pay for it they would go there's a Sherpa who's really sick and he's going to die and then Jeff and I would just decide to pull him off the other thing they don't have is they don't have life insurance and and you can imagine so a lot of these families a lot of the Nepali and the high-altitude workers families they lose their only source of income when these guys get get killed so actually a friend of mine Melissa are not who was the first American woman to summit Everest without oxygen just last year she started a fund called the juniper fund and it actually compensates the families when their loved ones are killed on the malleus nice it's good it keeps them straight because they don't have a choice this right this is Valda - you little area you're gonna be a Sherpa reporter yeah highest level you can be you're a shirt but you're a guide Wow so what happened this lady again oh yeah all right so Mingma goes up there they're walking up there and they need some help so they they and I have all on video and he's going fuck mother fuck he's pissed it's so funniest thing in the world he doing at a comedy show so then they they hear music not kidding they hear music so she has a phone on her I don't know how the batteries lasting and she's sitting at the balcony but on the ice and just barely breathing and listening to music and then so they go to her Rihanna or some shit no I'm just even some kind of Indian music in her career or whatever was and then she Indian yeah she was Indian her name was a Chetna you don't want to say her name well no she'd been a disparage ur Donna she's alive she's good she's a lot of stoked she's already tell me a Christmas card okay yeah no it's a blast nice yeah very cool our Christmas card with her kid so what happened so then they get to her and then they start calling her mama they're like mama mama you need to wake up you need to wake up we gotta go and she's like no no it's all in video like leave me alone leave me alone I don't want to do it I don't want to do it I don't want to do it and then they put oxido nur crank up the bottle try to get some blood flow and get stuff on they sit up there at 8,000 feet 35 minutes 45 minutes oh Jesus trying to coax her yep trying to coax her to get her down and that was it because of her personality or is because she's so like so diminished cognitively things go south - right so she probably had pretty profound cerebral edema so her decision-making was in the toilet so you become really apathetic and it's impossible to carry someone down you can't carry something you can lower them down which is what happened you can tie a rope to their harness and short rope them down when you know with two or three dude so I working really really hard it sort of loner down and that that's how they got her down you know she quit and a lot of people quit I worked search and rescue in Alaska on Denali for years and and you'd be amazed at how many people are just like done you know she just lay down and they're done because they're not rational enough to know like if I sit down and I just took just a little bitty nap you ain't getting back up you're taking a snow nap and you're done you know and that's just known now yeah it's no no I don't like that that's a weird turn but but with hypothermia the interesting thing that happens is you get euphoric right you go through this this stage of super cold super cold and then your core temperature drops low enough to where you foria comes in so oftentimes the same people we would find are undressed so you get hot you get warm so they're gloves happy laughs is Hanson unzipped and you know everybody's everybody's buck naked on the side of the mountain right before they die before they die so I mean not that I want to go out that way but now I can take a worse way so that gets you forward apparently Wow we also pull people back I've seen multiple times when we pull people back and they discuss that they described it and then we start rewarming their frostbite and it's not right after that that hurts turns out that hurt faster frostbite is so horrible to look at - it's just she the stuff we had to see and her fingers are still half half fingers are off she's dr. yeah she sent me pictures she's missing fingers missing tips tips yeah she's lucky some of the phalanges are going chopped off so they got her down they ended up hours and hours and hours we're tracking and we're trying to talk to him they get her down to camp four which is that tractor you saw then the trickiest part as he'll tell you because I can't tell you camp for to camp 3 ya camp 40 camp 3 and then camp 3 to camp 2 which they didn't even do they couldn't get they couldn't get to camp 2 which is straight on the lefty single loads he face it's a it's about a sixty sixty degree ice face well which is slick so when you're roping somebody down you know there it actually does provide you know less friction you can actually slide somebody down but you can't get going too fast yes you know so now your twenties awkward twenty six twenty seven thousand feet you're 130 pound 125 pound Sherpa and you got a lower this 200-pound lady down mmm hard oxygen these guys are working her intimate she's 200 pounds well she wasn't that big but you know with all our gear and although we didn't know yeah I mean she was 160 hundred seventy pounds worth of weight you know dead weight slightly lower down oh so we got her down we got her down to where we could go in with the helicopter and we picked her up and took her back down to base camp and that was when the the meeting took place between her and her husband and the tearful rejoicing and you know saw the part you missed was the helicopter landed it it couldn't land a camp - we weren't supposed to go up to twenty-two thousand five hundred which at the base of lotv crampon point Andrew got there and said I can only pick one of you and she looked at her husband and said you stay well and so she made it stay and take the next helicopter out so we got her down she looked at her husband and said you stay he's like bitch you quit well she was mad cuz he got left she was pissed off - she was pissed that she got left but he couldn't have carried her no that's it man you're switching it depends there's ways looking at it both ways somebody quit somebody gave up somebody said no I mean who knows but I'm sure they had to go through through some deep ass therapy when they got home okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna fill in the gaps here so fast-forward nine or ten months and dude husband has it has a heart attack and - so he died I'm sorry I'm not should be laughing at that's kind of fucked up I mean it's it is gonna fucked up but and going to Everest then you fucking but what's the Karma though they left her baby like what is he gonna do if he doesn't leave her what does he do he sits out there with her you have told people that she's up there and she's lying panic it was panicking on the phone he was there yeah I don't know I mean we talked about last night at the romantic story you huddle up with your girl and you're gonna die together whoa right and then all you get you go down there try to get her saved and you get ridiculed for leaving it it's easy to Monday Morning Quarterback any of those situations because all bets off when you get above 26,000 feet I mean it's it's it is you're you're kind of hanging on a little bit and that's why you know you get these big into thin air stories that happen and no one really can remember exactly the details and you know it's a little bit sketchy like I my intentions were and I did and you did and I mean some at nights on 26,000 meet 26,000 foot Peaks there's always it there's always variables that come into play and it turns into theater I mean it's a stage who even make choices people make mistakes we had that one guy on on the what's her face again graces team he was a triathlete he went up broke a bunch of rules respectfully well with regards to climatization conversation pushed himself too much summited got back down and died in his tent Oh his fifth attempt up there you can look it up it's on the Internet his fifth attempt up there pushed himself way too hard ruled the rules are if you don't make it to a certain point by a certain time you should turn around and save your life and come back another day and he said no he said no I'm pushing through got to the summit too late came back really exhausted 16 17 hour day died in a tent he was 35 years something what did he die from exposure cerebral edema he might have thrown a clot good I mean I don't know I don't know the autopsy but I mean he you know something fairly acute you know it wasn't just exhaustion you know it wasn't just hypothermia he made it back to the tent and then just expired in the tent so not sure I mean there's a lot of things that can go wrong and you have a small window to get it right what is good about it well about what summoning and gas Mountain yeah you know I think that's the tough question it's a pretty nebulous thing it's very subjective it's very selfish there's no you know there's no chance I used to climb pretty hard and then I had a kid and my sense of objective risk changed significantly at that point because climbing by nature is a very selfish pursuit you're going out there to do something that is bring it brings me joy and it brings me fulfilment and it gives me a sense of connection to the people that I'm sharing a rope with because we're on a rope man I mean we're going to win together lose together I mean it's but Jeff doesn't do it selfishly and not you give all these climbers shit like that's a very selfish thing to do for him but he did it because Eric did it Eric wanted to do it so he like oh you you're a selfish prick you summited Everest he goes no I I've helped my blind friend go to the upper state it really wasn't his goal his goal to help the firm I got it and everybody on my team I wasn't just me I had an amazing team it was it was you know with all our Sherpas on summit day we were 19 of us and at that point I think this record still stands we're still the highest number from one team in one day to stand on top together and I attribute that to the fact that just as you said by like that was just a bunch of bros who weren't commercially goddddd we were just friends and we were there for something that was bigger than us we were there for Eric we wanted to get him as high up as we could and get him back down and if that meant the summit awesome if not you know we'll come back and we'll still be Bros maybe we'll go do some other cool shit you know you know so what happens when you don't go up there for me to plant my flag is we got the summit I got to stand on top you know it's pretty pretty cool what is the feeling like when you get to that top and you realize you have summited Mount Everest well up there and you're looking around you're like holy shit top of the world MA well just like so many other times with him and the stuff that I've done with air I was worried about him getting down that's all I was I was obsessing on it because there was a storm coming in and we heard all the radio chatter time to have the storm I mean it shit is barreling I mean it is moving quick from the from Tibet across the we could see it coming it was probably nine ten in the morning and you know that's early and when it comes out early the monsoon the edge of the monsoon is late May so the monsoon starts to pick up in late May you don't want to be anywhere near but Joe you talk about all the time the adrenaline dump so imagine Journal's up in a cage you talk about all the time now you just summit of Mount Everest but you're only halfway done yeah 3% of all mountaineering accidents happen on the decent Wow he says that's why why is that because your decision-making cop is compromised and yep you uh and you you did what you went to do you don't you know you're like oh you relax yeah gonna take your adrenaline you're like I did it and all said no like get down that's why more technical to be honest with you that that's somewhat of a rookie move and you know experienced climbers always know to have a little bit more in the tank you know it's just like a fighter right yeah oh you got to save some for the fifth round right and you got a you got to know that it's coming and it's gonna hurt right it's gonna hurt bad I remember my legs like I was they were jelly man I mean try to come down from the Hillary step and I was just jacked I was like the Gumby man coming down and I actually fell I fell onto a fixed rope right below them or right above the Hillary step yeah and I got caught by rope and it was one of the only times I clipped in that whole day oh jeez I thought it was it was kooky shit did you clip in cuz you felt like your body was yeah what'd she want once again I knew like yeah a little bit not right I shot I shot my wad coming up I dug some ropes out with my buddy Brad bull for the team earlier that that morning that were buried we were the first people up we were the first people up and all these ropes were buried and we were digging them out in the ice and they were buried under a foot to two foot of snow at 28,000 feet I made Brad and I made that decision to to dig those ropes out because not to know which way to go up but to make sure they were there for the decent because that's when weather comes in that's when the blind lead the blind down you know so we dubbed the ropes up and I knew when I did that that I was going to be out of gas and sure enough like coming down I knew it so that's when I was clipping it I was a little bit I was a little bit more fastidious on you know making sure if I fell that I'd be caught sure enough sell Wow on the rope and then got back I was like good night that woke me up enough you get a jolt yeah yeah shake it off or look around go god damn I wonder if anybody saw that start head effect yet so is it the appeal of like accomplishing something very few people accomplish and joining like a very special Club is I would what motivates these people is it just a really difficult task and they want to see if they have it in them I mean obviously everybody's got a subjective answer to that and mine is I like to be with my people in the hills that's my church that's where I feel the most comfortable it's where I I feel safe actually in the hills right because you know you're around other very rugged people well just people who make good decisions you know and then you know the cathedral of the big mountains makes me happy and sort of rejuvenate to my soul and but there's there's something to be said for for seeing what my body and my mind can do you know I think that a lot of people would would agree that that's probably one of the main reasons why we get out and do these things but I mean it's no joke it's dangerous man I mean you saw one of the most accomplished Mountaineers the probably the best Mountaineer in the world just died you know under two months ago really you will a stack yeah how did he die he fell he was getting ready to go do his training up in the in the valley in that Western come from that camp to on Everest that you saw that image he was going up the west shoulder of Everest with one other Sherpa who's a friend of his not just a paid Sherpa it was his climbing partner and they were going to go up a route that has yet to be successfully seconded so these Americans seconded it's like so it's been done once love died trying to do it again several parties and he was going to go do it these two Americans Willy unsold and Tom Horne bond did it and it hadn't been repeated because it's it's straight-up commitment man balls like but his Sherpa was sick the stripper was sick so you lay was out training one you know one morning and I think it was around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning yeah so he was up in that sort of Cirque and he was over on a mountain called nips a which beside Everest and and he fell who knows why maybe slither he got hit or you have to see this guy this guy you can see the videos online URI stack is this guy no ropes no nothing he's got two ice axes and he runs up the hill fast and you can run on pavement sure sure Josh recon Swiss the Swiss machine one believes a video of him doing the hundreds of lots of how do you spells name you lay so it's you Li stick now the incredible when you see it the incredible thing about it you're at the six degree pitch ice walls he's at twenty six twenty seven twenty no twenty three thousand feet he's just gonna back back back back back back back back he's in the video game he's a ridiculously committed he was athlete I mean he's committed to his craft being as strong as he could be you know technically capable but you know it's it's it's still roll the dice and how many people have died trying to do this summit to do s ii did 100 a good handful i don't know exact numbers but several from different nationalities so everybody is either failed or died except one person who's the one person to two americans that was willie unsold tom horne barn that's what they do once they summit once that once the climbers are and it's just you know humans in general these climbers do it then they want to find a more difficult route or they do without oxygen so you lee was gonna go up and do that look at this fucking guy he's gonna go do that and then come around summit Everest and then go check that out dude he's like a fucking goat no yes look at this look at that it that's incredible so his aerobic you know he's got that ability to kick out the lactic out oh my god that is insane he's an absolute beast it's a shame it was a big loss it's just because he's been doing it for so long oh holy shit no ropes oh my god okay for people just listening um what is the name of this video Jamie so you li e li e Li ste seek a new speed record I gir 2015 so this is the North Face of the Eiger and so he's a Swiss dude he grew up sort of cut his teeth in the Alps and just all this now now I want to be clear the ropes this is that this isn't like the first time he did this right it's probably the 50th time you climbed that route he did it over and over and over got it dialed figured it out and then went out and did these speed records you know and set these speakers very similar to what just happened on El Capitan last week did you hear about Ellen Arnold and what Alex yes oh yeah I did I watched the the pictures and video that yeah he's been on the podcast for Alex s yeah he's a freak yeah so I mean I waited he is what he did what he did in mom a great way was like landing on the moon did yeah the the ability to pocket fear and just focus on the 3 square feet in front of you yeah on paralleled yeah I can't I mean I've climbed El Cap and and I just I can't imagine being up on those slides how long did it take you in you saw no cap three days so three days soak in four hours so free so low that the point o types you lay you know people look at that in their like well she got super sweaty mine are mine are too by the way you know I think so you see look at you lay and you see this video and you're like wow he's crazy he's crazy lated and so is Alex Alex super calculated like he'd climbed free rider the route that he did a few weeks ago he did it several dozen times and would fall on it you know with a rope and he just was in the right headspace that day and went up and did it without a whole lot of pomp and circumstance just went out and nailed it look at this there's going to be a crazy-ass video that Jimmy chin Oh Jimmy I'm shooting it and his - yeah Jimmy was near the top with no what did he did he shoot it like next to him with ropes lesson so so Jimmy was very respectful of not getting in his way cuz this is a very obviously very intense thing oh yeah hey man how's it going yeah going good you can look it down there fuck would you do that of you yeah I've missed the shotgun go back up hey man can you give me a thumbs up so look over and smile but Jimmy's a very accomplished climber and he's amazing some of the others Jimmy chin National Geographic Jimmy was a Chen top he was at the top and him and his team I think lowered down and and yeah greatest greatest athletic human feet Jesus I ain't gonna lie I have to agree because it's if you think about true athletic feats it's not just obviously the you know the corporal sort of you know event it's just the whole mixed bag of who you are as an athlete mentally emotionally behaviorally physically how you execute in the moment when shit is just on point like right in your face and he did it like to this level that I can't even Vince it's unbelievable man ripping out of my hands I mean guys I mean once you get 30 feet off the deck it's game on you right you know and then now put you know power of a hundred on that you know there's very few sports where one mess up you're dead that's right does he have any like guys that are trying to be the next Alex Honnold that are chasing him well I just read something today this morning about that there could be some emulators you know there's like who knows there's other super tough badass climbers that are out there that are also free soul on and doing shit without ropes but he's at another level and everyone knows that you know there's how is he at this other low well first of all like what is what separates him yeah well there's a lot of body chemistry that that is sort of a mystery like how does his pituitary how does this adrenal gland not just flame out right how does he control that in a way that I can't right I mean yeah we're sitting here at the desk my hands are sweaty just thinking about right so there he is is calm and collected as he can be they've done Studies on on Alex they brought him in and like you know buzzed his brains like where are you you know chemically biochemically when we introduce assaulting sort of variables on you and he's just flatline so he's the perfect blend of biochemistry and physical capacity but also devotion and commitment to his craft I mean he's an artist right that's the oniy he got down from that from that calm that day just a couple weeks ago they're like what are you gonna go do now you know this ain't Disneyland he was going on his fingerboard and he was going to go train and do like you know fingerboard workout that afternoon cuz climbing El Cap for four hours was not enough workout for the day it was like whatever he says put him in an MRI and showed him images in this bet suppose his responses yeah the brain is brains fear levels after looking at gruesome and arousing images he commented it was like whatever that is that dude he's so mellow right that's what the how he described it when I said to him I said like what is it like are you freaking out he trying to keep calms like you're really mellow he goes if anything is like if you if there's anything wrong it's so wrong like when it goes wrong cascade yeah like you're fucked like so you're always he's his de way of putting it was mellow though yeah I think there's a video I believe it maybe Alex and maybe somebody other climb but but think of a video of him probably tell cap when he was free soloing before this one where he said give me a minute it was Northwest direct face of a Half Dome and I've climbed that route too and I tell you I the only time I've ever seen him flap that was the that was the iconic image on that geo on National Geographic magazine of him standing just in his plaid shorts shirt like on the ledge you know leaning back and it was he reflected on that they asked him about it later and I said you know what was going on he says I just needed a minute and he got it and he calmed himself down whatever was happening in his head room knows and he recalibrated and went up you know no gear so it's just who knows there's there's a right there that's when he needed a minute no no there's there's another one of Jamie it's it's it's he's in that green there he is over there on the right yeah that one the green or the right above it right there it's uh the one where you stand in there sort of all on the lit yeah that's that's the one I think was the Nazi ish yeah that's what he says I just need a minced just need a minute that's um that's a thousand feet off a deck but i mean magic's that's your kid we all you know and you're like what are you doing today honey so he apparently he has a very very close relationship with his mama he get on Sacramento I guess and uh I'm guess is my he just tells his mama what she needs to know yeah he doesn't a learnt the left it's over mm-hmm yeah fuckin Christ just like that is uh that's a crazy thing to be awesome at you know alright alright hold on so we're talking a lot about climbing but the other reason why one bring Jeff people hold on was we're not changing subjects I don't know where the fuck you think you're going this this guy like so you said that there are a few people that are trying to emulate what he's doing well I think there's just a few guys doing their own thing and it happens to be free soloing and you know he's he's the pioneer there were other guys before him there's gotten in Peter Croft it was out there for many years sort of you know he did a he did a route called Astro man in the valley that was at the time and I remember you know that was a mine I think my early twenties when when Peter did that and I remember reading about it and thinking no like what how how does this one want to do and I was just really getting into climbing a lot I didn't compute but Peter Croft I think in guys like him and like Alex just have a wiring that's very very different than the rest of us and it seems reckless to many many people but what I do seems reckless too many people so it's so relative and there's a scale you know and and people that would look at Alex and be like you're crazy man it should you're gonna get in like he's like whatever man I'm sure yeah there is a scale there's like a yeah well you what about physically like is there like an optimum build you like for a basketball you really want to be tall and thin right is is there an optimum build for what does mean I think you know sinewy and and the strength to weight ratio is is obviously you know the best climbers are usually then pretty thin and you know carry themselves well yeah and you know it's it's uh he's got big hands like not necessarily big like basketball player but like his fingers or sausages use these fat fingers from constantly training them almost calloused yeah well the just the amount of weight that he can carry on his hands he's got to be pretty unusual this so this finger thing that he does like what is the well he did the campus board or a finger you know peg boards like for wrestling that's kind of like a campus board is like a inverted sort of board that you climb up just for strength and it works your core and your arms and your chest and your delts and stuff but then then the fingerboard allows you to get you know mano doy double doy you know two fingers strength so he can then slot and then pull on one of those so it strengthens all your tendons and your in your hands and your finger look ticularly I'm just little holes carved out of a sometimes it's a it's a that's all right there yeah so sometimes it's good sometimes it's a composite it's like almost like a little cubby shelf and so you stick your hands in there yeah and then there's routines I guess there's two finger pockets and three finger puck oh wow you you use one two I do yeah wow I was one two and then I'll try and hang you know and then count the 30 hang and then go to finger and hang and he did this after he summited yeah so we went down and like got interviewed he goes sorry man I gotta go do a workout now how is he not tired well just loves that's why he's the best right I swear he is yeah Wow workable so did this exist 20 years ago was there a lot of people free soloing 20 years ago those like that's the Peter Croft you know those guys there was a few and back in the old camp for Yosemite days I can you know 70 though I mean it's this was the place this was the the birth of it and then there was some dudes that were not far from here and Joshua Tree that we're doing some pretty balls out solo man in Joshua Tree yeah in J tree and I lived in Joshua Tree for a while just did living in my van by the river there and climbing all the time and eating ramen noodles and throwing my head a little bit you know that I'm trying and in the tree man and because you know there's a lot of climb in there that's that's uh it's pretty this high ball stuff and if you could look at like the amount of mushrooms that are done like in a specific location and then look at Josh which are like the high concentration and so on I know so many people go to Joshua Tree just just to shroom out yeah yeah I mean it's a I'd like to look at that map to be a big target okay yeah seriously probably a big cluster right yeah I mean I've I've I've seen some good stuff there man I mean that was when I was sort of really really diving in yeah I was diving into climbing those think those two things were conjoined was psychotropics and in a way and in climbing yeah they are the with a lot of folks well it's that extreme connection to nature right and to life and like you talked about a little bit ago before we came on air was you know when you know in your stone you see the ball track better when you're playing pool oh yeah well you feel like the revolutions of the ball like you're feeling how well you could touch the ball and get it to move like your cue ball for me at least yeah you know I feel I play like ten percent better when I'm high yeah for whatever reason feel more in touch with things yeah that's why I like the social sliver social sliver yeah what's that mean sliver microdose oh so just the microdose of of mushrooms or acid mushrooms but I'm yeah so the the new medium for us I don't know if if you've if you've heard of it as goo do you know the goo goo no so it's super concentrated psilocybin so they take mushrooms and they distill it down concentrate it up get this liquid turning it into a tootsie roll appearing consistency color give it an Halloween get a stick yeah and you get a stick and it's literally the size of a Tootsie Roll and we just take like a little just a little nip and that's the social sliver and then it makes you just a little more tuned in I mean a lot more tuned in I have a buddy who's a high level kickboxer world champion kickboxer started micro dosing a few months back does it every day every day micro doses any competes on it fucks people up always micro dosing so with what with L or with now mushrooms so the I think and you might know if I was locked in the zone more than me but if you if you take it serially it starts you lose it gets diluted over time yeah but when he takes when he stops taking it he feels it he messes it it does every day like Heidemann yep I think that's called addiction maybe I don't think so because it's not addictive it it's like you get addicted to washing your hands if you're one crazy OCD guy car wash your hands one more time if you really you can get a mental pathway that's very destructive you know and you can call it addictive but it doesn't demonize washing your hands you know I think his issue is uh when he doesn't take it he says it just things aren't as fun doesn't feel as good but I've been around him when he's taking it and he's a hundred percent there like it's not it's not he's like wow man I could like see your eyes and I'm thinking your eyes are looking at me and what are your eyes seeing I assume they're seeing with him know he's there they're like you're you know but body needs a little experiences like it won't agree I've died I'm really quite over here except no idea what the fuck I am with the social sliver before just to see what happy good he could go either way with him who shall hotbox him right now let's fuck him up no no scared he's gonna do PETA interesting deed Pete does he owns his own company that's a funny to see Justin any tough time so Jose would try to get me just like some pisses and Jose are trying to be - by 18 years it's not exaggerated no so I'm the mic reducing the goo man it is it is Johnny get well let's talk later bug I know well I've there's people there's come there's conversations that need to have yeah absolutely so um are a lot of these climbers doing that I don't I don't think so I think you know I think that uh you know there's there's probably a handful of us that like to mess around with those things all together and not to say that I don't like to you know trip my balls off and go get on a rock of course right matter of fact I've had a few sort of spooky Tom's just being really stoned and being on a rock and not liking the situation I was in yeah yeah I've been that way is normal life while you get too stoned especially like edibles Chiba to fuck me up all they'll fuck you up oh they'll fuck you I had a bit off my last special that's based on the truth eight a fucking gummy bear a pot gummy bear and this the guy told me to just eat the leg it really is a true thing I'm like why the fuck are you making a whole bear then if he wants them to eat a leg it's this tiny little thing and I ate the whole bear and oh my god for the foot for a while - so long time till it's metabolized right it's hours hours we wanted a view but you feel so good when it's over you feel like I needed that I needed all that pain and fear and just I got through it it's like a near-death experience you know like something something about it like it's cleansing I guess sure if eating a gummy bear should have that kind of shouldn't but it does and when it comes through on the other side like it's beneficial as long as you could keep it together you know as a person who's that's why it bums me out that you don't smoke pot or do anything cuz I know you could keep it together cuz you're a tough guy you keep life together like you would just it would just make you like more aware but here's my here's nineteen years ago we started this okay take honey bud is on the deathbed I'm gonna get him high yeah bud likes to be in control yeah that's like a problem and he's afraid that he might not be you ever look at Budds closet I did does it shock you and everything's black it's a little confusing so I had a 10-minute conversation with this dude last night like dude that kind of fucked me up looking at your closet they're the fucking looks like I don't like other colors everything's black is like one linear feet of one shade variation of the other black shirt or the other box like some folks he's afforded you know play makes Jack a dull boy all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy oh yeah it's efficient decision-making right I don't have to make that decision is the other shit to go in last song where where that I think I can feel that I can feel that I get it I never know guys guys everybody develops a uniform in life right when you it doesn't matter if it's khaki shorts and a blue everybody you're out you long Brian you develop it no it's interesting though if it was orange it would be a big issue if you were walking around with orange sneakers and orange pants and orange shirt like this wacky motherfucker but somehow another because it's black it's bud friend of mine Tom DuPont is ahead he owns a de Patri magazine green pants like shitty looking green pants all the time like what's with us shitty green somebody I'm rich bitch oh fuck I was only part we had many chemicals fuck off bitch I got so much money I like Mary great his reality is probably so confusing like everybody remembering my green pants yeah I was in lanai recently in Larry Ellison owns the whole the whole island he owns the whole he bought it and he built it yeah what was Dole pineapple owned first of all don't pineapple bought it off of I bruised their I've read the history of the islands amazing a Mormon owned it some crazy but they don't even think he was really a Mormon they think it was just a con man who used being a Mormon to lock people up I'll make a wise I'm not yeah this is probably a lot of stories just like that oh yeah oh yeah there's quite a few especially with Mormons that's right that's a very very interesting religion right when you know the guy who made the religion like there's two religions like that are pretty prominent l ron hubbard of course and then joseph smith the mormons you know the guy kind of a common yeah a hundred percent fuckin coming in forgot it was 14 i found a golden tablets that contain the lost work of jesus and only he could read them cuz he had a magic seer stone hit a stone that he could look through this to read these fucking christ he broke out of jail yeah he jumped out of the window it was murdered yeah i got murdered in jail yeah he got killed in jail I think what the funny thing is anything it didn't it was him or somebody else who invented the polygamy part they're like wait a minute I got a tablet I can fuck all the bitches I want hold on yeah every get out as many wives I want you know it's uh yeah good luck with all that that never works but the why would you want more than one I know I can't handle one yeah some people just like danger like Alex Honnold likes to solo climb yeah you know you know it's just people like it like nineteen chicks yelling at them know whatever sounds like it I'm not here to judge over though I think it should be legal I think if those 19 women are into it and you're into it why why is it even legal to get married at all why is it legged with when you see 50% divorce and people get their their lives devastated when is a government step any go hey you got to stop doing this this is just ruining all these people like kids if ruins more people than anything just stop getting married keeps the lawyers afloat yeah it does that you stop the fucking lawyer it's big business and weddings and locators yeah we can't stop that we don't make any money Jesus Christ yeah fuck all that but um so this guy who's this crazy Mormon guy sold it to the dole company who used to run pineapples there they used to have just massive pineapple plantation and that was what it was forever and then some other dude Murdoch but not Rupert Murdoch in ordinary owns he was half of West Lake yeah almost all of it that dude bought it and then he sold it to Larry Ellison who just runs around gold underwear and fucking has people carry him like he's an emperor kind of curse making that up Colonel Kurtz uh yeah I don't even know where he keeps a place out there I guess but he just wanted to own it it's a fucking baller place to live though so there's not how many people live there 3,000 that's it there's 15,000 access dear though oh yeah so am i right and remembering that the the concentration of people it's not necessarily on the coastline now Knights in the middle yes right it's in the middle smart people don't live on the cum yeah they're smart they're like um this Islands not that big and sometimes she comes back yeah let's not be over the water ease guy we could go to the fucking water it's right there the asshole America like oh I want to live there anyway you are you can take a hike to the water you know it'll take a few hours if you're in the middle but don't get there like you don't have to live there Jesus Christ so tell me about the axis dear I want to hear like say they're everywhere I was receiving sporting or I was definitely sporting because these animals they evolved to run from Tigers mm-hmm they are the fastest fucking animals I have ever seen in my life like in terms of like their ability to react like there would be a deer 60 yards away you draw back on it and launch the arrow and it would be nowhere near that arrow by the time the arrow got so you lost a few sharp sticks oh yeah well you go five lighted knocks I can see them in the in the grass but I lost two but the arrows are going 275 feet a second and the deers like bitch a chance I do not I did this to the island no there's no indigenous mammoths on that island everything is invasive and everything has no predators so they bring in these Rangers and seals these snipers they bring them in they set up on a bench and they just start popping but bang they start shaking amalgamated 50 Cal yeah well no they don't have to use a 50 Cal it probably is like no funnel meter or something but why do that when you want the meat meat is outstanding it is some of the most delicious meat in the world but these animals are so on point so for bowhunters is like one of the best places for spot and stalk like if you could put the smackdown on an axis deer like you either got lucky which is me or you got some skill you know I've got a little bill but the guys that I went with that are really good like Remy Warren I think he shot three or four was there my friend John Dudley shot for world class bow hunters like as good as it gets those guys killed quite a few but it is you got it's a great learning ground like for stalking because you you blow so many stalks get along smell you um I only hunted for three days because I had a problem with my bow that I had to fix once I got there and took a day to do that but once you get there and you see how many deer you realize like oh okay this is like this place is overpopulated so but in those three days all right I saw you saw shipped thousands yeah I mean thousands and you took a few shots yes I took a few shots yeah they're tough animals too so are you moving are you little are you moving in stalking and pausing and holding yeah you're doing what you call still hunting still walking and then you're looking for an animal that you you're constantly using your wind checker which is like a Visine bottle with talcum powder in you bow hundred oh yeah well just recently started so you puff that in the air and you find out which way the the wind is going my guide though he knew where the wind was going he just knew from his face and his neck and skin like he can tell of course the wind blowing and he's like like this and he just puffed that smoke in there and sure enough it was going exactly where it was shout-out to row man but his uh his ability to sneak up on these animals pretty fucking impress - you know I do a lot of crawling like a lot of the grasses like waist high so you're doing like crawling where you're moving like literally like a snail's pace try not to make too much noise because you know they're over there oh yeah I'm excited I'm already got glassed and yeah through there yeah and you're on an island so they can really go that far therefore there's plenty of room for them to go there's I mean this is not like you're hunting them in a 100 Acre confined high fence place it's all wild and free range and it's there's mountain terrain and there's plenty of places for them to get away from but they're aware of one predator humans you know so now that they're not scared of anything other than people so they see a person like fuck this but are there a lot of bow hunters that go over there there's plenty of bow hunters that go over there yeah it is uh it's it's a pretty amazing place man but Maui is another really great place for bow hunting too apparently and now he also has pigs Maui has access deer they have a deer Ram called a mouflon that apparently is unbelievably delicious but the locals think it tastes like shit some locals said it tastes like shit and some local said it's the most delicious meat ever but the bow hunters that I was there with there's a mouflon the bow hunters I was there with see if it's sunny on Revie Warren's page Remy Warren's Instagram I think I ran because he shot one a beautiful one you like that ax is better than venison it's not better nil um it is delicious it is delicious I wouldn't say it's better than elk elk is my favorite meat um but it's right there it's right there it's really good yeah yeah cuz you know like and I'm not trying to relate those but anyway there's Remy super say gee this is a one that he shot in the nice it's a really small animal right and they're you know they're on this really rugged mountain terrain Lenni is so fascinating such a fascinating place and the people that lived there could not be nicer could not be cooler this beautiful gorgeous paradise yeah but um yeah it's weird because they've decided to introduce these animals I think they did it way way by hundreds of years ago and they have to keep those populations in check and sometimes again they bring in snipers and they put a bench down and they just set up shop and get those long-range skills going Popeye so I was I was on Maui probably about I guess a month ago now and I went over to my buddy's house and he has a pretty sweet spread it's at the top of this canyon and looking down up on the up on the hill going towards Haleakala and he's like man you can come on my property anytime and shoot these fucking deer Wow cuz they come because he's like they're just they're a pain in the ass yeah they're everywhere yeah we need to get rid of they come in and eat my oranges and us not so but what's the tag situation like yeah after I mean is it part of my license realize there's this public land you get out we hunted public land and we hunted private land but you get our license yeah and then shoes managed want no limit no limit didn't want they mean to have a griddle yeah it's not a problem it's not like they're not sick there's plenty of food for these beers yeah that's we're not getting chronic wasting no no it's a beautiful lush and green yeah but they're just everywhere they're everywhere but they're not easy you know if you had a rifle pretty easier but you'll set up a impact and get it back to the baits as you go over there looking you want to shoot 10 up and close you get a deer fantastic me you are organic couldn't be healthier they even serve it at the restaurant at the Four Seasons inland I you know it's just Scott dam is good so good lean and good oh so delicious just you feel the nutrition in it's just so fantastic you know and when it comes to like sustainability and ethics it's like one of the best places like that's a place where you actually should be hunting these animals you know whenever I go to Hawaii I always just feel like I should show my passport like it's just not America st. marys stole that shit that shit is straight up like it's a foreign country in a beautiful way yeah in a beautiful way it's it's own thing yeah I mean I like the fact that you can go there without a passport but I agree but I'm one of those weirdos think there shouldn't be passports should be able to go anywhere it's part of our problem that everybody's all locked into these land masses and forbidden areas yeah break those boundaries tear down that wall I was just in Iraq and you're talking about some boundaries and sort of lines in the sand and so forth boy you know I'm sure what were you doing over there so I went with so back up two years ago the earthquake nopal that killed nine almost 10,000 people throughout the country 19 on the mountain on Everest right yeah a lot of people got dead and people died and that one was it a blast economy yeah well so the earthquake triggered a lot of glaciers that are hanging up around in that sir can dit released and a lot of stuff just blew through base camp and killed folks but throughout Nepal throughout the countryside I mean we're talking villages that have stone huts and no mortar and no rebar and you know just shakes just a little bit and she falls down inches Counsel's I mean the place was destitute terribles yeah so so lots of devastation lots of people dead and lots of injuries so that day that happened I knew I wanted to go to Nepal to help I'm a PA I'm a physician assistant and have specialized in emergency medicine so I knew I wanted to be there and more than anything like focused on sort of austere medicine you know like I want to go out there where shit's a little bit off and try and help the best I can so I went over there located in an NGO called NYC medics and what sends you and in a non-governmental organization so not supplied or you know subsidized by the feds this is just like sponsorship basically donation money get you over there and you do your work so you're not under the auspices of the feds so went over there with these guys NYC medics which is a group of former and you know Newark City paramedics that realize they wanted to take their skills and go do some cool shit around the world so I I found these guys I went over with them I was on the ground for a month way way back like in the way back this place called da-ding bessie which is right at the base of the kinesha mall so this is a place that we landed in some helicopters and set up shop and there was a lot of these Nepal ease that there Tamang Nepali there that's their ethnic tribe not sherpa but tomorrow they see the helicopter come in and these white dudes get out of helping like what the fuck we need help are you here to help yes we're here to help so we had three helicopters worth of gear downloaded it set up our clinic and were there for a month we saw I don't know seven or eight hundred patients in the course of a month and what started as trauma from the earthquake sort of then segwayed into primary care infections and yeah I mean the juries well and also bullion or not like a lot of you know psychological pain like they were scared the earth was shaken still I mean it was tremor after tremor after tremor I mean every day the earth would shake I got home and for a month after I got back from there I still felt the ground shaking in Boulder Colorado because it was just my body was still sort of the equilibrium was weird so tremors every single day so these people needed you know anxiety medicines you know to be able to take the edge off so I was over there for a month we saw a bunch of people and it was very worthwhile so got connected to this this this organization and and became good friends with with all the folks who run it they do amazing work and so I got a call in January from one of the heads the organization says we got this kind of kooky thing that we've been asked to do by the World Health Organization mmm would you be interested kookie kookie Thunder Iraq that's the word he used kookie kookie Jesus so who the fuck uses kookie so it well I mean when it comes to going Iraq twelve years of medical school not not understanding what sniper fire is it was a little bit kooky so he frames it up for me and he's like listen here's what's going on we've been asked by World Health Organization to go in and be a trauma stabilization point in Mosul which means you will be as close to the front line as possible embedded with the Iraqi special operations forces and your job will be to lead a medical team of we had nine of us within 2,000 metres of the frontline that was the way it was framed up and that's what we all would have signed up for and that was the agreement with the World Health Organization so we would be the first point of contact as these Iraqi Special Operations guys went in and put in the fight to Isis to liberate western Mosul so you know Eastern Mosel been limited related you know months before and he volunteered for this by the way so that's all Eastern Mosel on the east side of the Tigris and then on the west side you know Isis was still sort of dug in right there and they were there ready to put the fight down they wanted to get after it and saved you know that's where their Caliphate supposedly started or was was settled and so our job is the TSP this trauma stabilization point was to be as close to the front line as we could be and this is the this was a kicker you know within a margin of safety but still be close enough to where we could receive the casualties as quickly as possible stabilize them and then get them to a Forward Operating Opera operating suite which was typically run by Allied forces so our guys so I said yes before I asked my wife which now in retrospect probably wasn't the best strategy because she was not super stoked but she you know I pitched it to her and I've got an 11 year old kid and she gave me I think the the least amount of pushback as anybody around me in my close Network I mean a lot of my boys were like the fuck did what are you thinking man like what's what are you getting what's your point what are you doing this for what's your intention to go over there to a war zone to a combat zone volunteering you know and and and and helping a group of people that you have no affinity for it made sense going into Paul because I love Nepal I love I love everything about Nepal of the Nepali people so that good everybody got that that's the weird thing about Jeff because he was on the phone me the same time saying hey are we going back to Everest go rescue so he's gonna no matter what sometime in spring you can put his ass on the line to help save people he was calling me ago we going back and I'm like I don't know if we're going back the network may order another season we probably go back and I started lining staff up and just in case I know president stuff aired yet yeah ever stared enabled shows ever stared November last year Everest air hmm and what network - the arrow Travel Channel six episodes on Travel Channel it's on iTunes and a couple other places - okay so people could get it right now yeah so Wow so you tell your wife yeah and she you know she knew what she signed up for when I you know when she married me so she knew she was kind of getting a little bit of a you know a little bit of a wild buck in her hands but this was different you know I can go climb and I can set my sights on this and that get out there in the mountains or do adventure races and stuff and all that's cool but then you know mad respect to the men and women that serve in our military man and put it out there every day but I had never been in a combat zone that shit is crazy man I mean it is it was real and I have no you know predications that I had any experience close to what our men and women have experienced but from a medical perspective it was intense to say the least I mean it was a mind bender at the first after the first three days I remember texted my wife just saying like this I don't know if this is sustainable like just this my emotional state because every day was immense volume of profound penetrating trauma panic I mean never was there very very rarely was there a guy who had one gunshot wound typically you know seven or eight or not they were leaking from there you know from lots of places you know these dudes were getting shot up and then the IEDs and would blow these guys up and we would get them you know they'd be this youngesters just screaming and drop these guys off and and then five minutes later another ambulance is coming with two other dudes and was just constant constant and we would do the best we could to stabilize them or call it and the ones we could save we package him up and stabilize him try and control the bleeding we didn't abate him if we needed to and put chest tubes in and crike him in some cases and stabilize their extremities and patch their holes and and then send them on he would do these weekly daily blogs right so people who know him Rove they were waiting watching CNN is gonna be on what she was and you do these daily blogs long long diatribe which is I think how he stays somewhat sane but to get shot at there's motors come in in their compound we're aware of these blogs on my blog um which is yeah it's on my website Jeff be evidence there's I like to Jerry Evans calm yep Jeff B Evans calm so I like to write and bud you write and I like to write the time well so this is what I would do at night like if I would lay down and we were sleeping on the floor on these these rocky blankets you know and we would just lay down on this so we'd go into these abandoned homes and we'd set up these trauma Bay's and we'd sleep in a room off the trauma Bay and so I you know we we do our day i god very rarely wasn't dressed and ready to get up and go because it anytime the head logistician would be like patients you know and everybody would pop up and and get ready didn't go out and the ambulance would throw people on mostly during the day but fighting with generally subside at night and we'd get a little bit of rest and then I'd write and I'd write and it was important I think to sort of you know percolate that shit out a little bit and let it let it sit so we were we were in this one place for a couple weeks and then came the request from the head of ice off special operations general abbas and he came to our headed logistical gal and he's like listen you know as the front line is moving forward we would like for you guys if you are up for it to move forward as well the only problem is it's not going to be within that tent that to twenty-five hundred you know meter cushion from the front line it's going to be more like five hundred meters from the front line five hundred meters yeah which you know that's really class really close especially since the front line is pretty fluid anyway right and this is a conventional warfare right these guys are you know they're Isis is was reinforcing these these vehicles and you know steel plating them up and then taking civilians and handcuffing them to the you know to these steering wheels and tell them the best job and they drive and they'd be packed full of explosives and c4 and they'd blow them up you know and and you know these are guys you know the Iraqi dudes would be like trying to Pelt him to take the dude out I couldn't get you know that shit was really archaic but effective you know and so so they told us you know we'd like for you to move and that in our head logistical gal Cathy she's came to the whole team and she said this is our this is our option you don't have to do it you know no one's obligated to do it y'all are volunteers and and and by the way we were close to begin with I mean it was it was constant every day just mortars and small arms fire and there was bunch of artillery that was set up all around us outgoing so we got used to the sound of outgoing artillery we didn't hear a lot of incoming because they just did push them back so okay we all said let's do it you know if we can create positive impact and we can save more lives by being closer let's do it so we all gotten this big Akash and Humvee convoy and and drove down past the airport and I think a lot of military folks that listen will know that airport in West Mosel very well probably we drove right through the old busted up you know you know it was just rubble the whole airport's rubble it's just completely it looks like fucking you know bedrock Flintstones you know it's just a mess drove all the way through there and then went to this house and we set up our clinic on a street corner covered by a corrugated metal roof and put all our trauma we put six trauma beds and got our trauma sleeves up and everything was ready to go and then we we set up our residents across the street at some other abandoned house and we're down in the sort of concrete bunker so to speak and we started seeing patients and you know day one shit ton of people and lots of slots and things happening I mean talking dozens and dozens of you know multiple gunshot wounds is multiple careers that I experienced in that month of just the flow of volume of of penetrant Chama so then then it was day two or three all these displaced locals basically got released so they've been holding that a checkpoint fingerprinting the the fighting aged males making sure they're not on a record and you know making sure everybody's not not strapped and letting them through so on day three or four they just let this flow of humanity started walking down the street about 60 70 yards from us from where we were set up and they'd see the Americans and they'd see the stethoscopes and they'd just start running towards us because these people had been captivated for in in you know and held captive and hiding out in their basements eating grass you know trying to find any fluids at all that drink there's no rainwater and you know it's fucking rain there and and just just eaten by and little kids I mean these are civilians these are little bitty kids and they're hiding out and these in these homes and they would just run they would just take off running and get to these checkpoints so on day three or something that this flow of humanity comes by you guys are starting to sort of bum-rush our spot and everybody starts to get a little bit panic because we weren't quite sure what was what you know lot turns out a lot of bad things could happen you know in that situation so we sort of get our security detail to keep everybody away and we we treated shit-ton of people day four rolls around and we wake up that morning and the first patient I have is a five year old little girl they'd been just absolutely like homicide like killed shot right in the head assassinated back of the head back of the head and that was how our day started it like you know 7:00 in the morning that was it and the day got worse so the first incoming landed about I'd say about 75 yards from us an RPG and landed in the neighbor in the neighbor's yard next to us and it just blew a bunch of debris up and it landed on our corrugated roof there and we were all like damn but we kept working then ten minutes later maybe another one came in and it was 50 yards and just just getting closer this second it's called a grid as a clip you just get a little click there 75 50 25 so we didn't know it at the time but yeah you're right that we did not know this at the time so that one obviously got everybody super tingly but there was still a shit ton of people coming in we had patients I mean we were working and we had our kevlar vests on and we were trying to you know say then then the third one hit and it landed right outside the door and it blew a shit ton of debris I mean we felt the blast and one of our medics got a big piece of debris in the back of his leg it knocked him down so we went into this bunker basically the staging bunker and we sat down in there and you know no matter what we couldn't we weren't going to go out into that then 30 seconds later one of our security detail dudes carried in our head of security and he was lifeless and dropped him on the table this is the dude we'd been you know eating cookies with and drinking tea with like a half hour but you know an hour before you know standing at the door in between you know ambulances there is our guy you know and he was dead and so we we all looked at each other and I was the team lead and I tell you man I wasn't about to ask anybody to go out into that and no one even hesitated like we went out and started working on house even we we we got on him quick and he was out and I listened to his lungs he didn't have any lung sounds on one side I saw some penetrating entry wound in his chest put a chest tube in his in his right in his right thorax and about a liter of blood poured out from his pleural space just like that and as soon as that happened he could inspire again so he started breathing and resuscitated him so he was dead and he came back to well she was he was unable to to inspire so you know his whole body had shut down from number one from the shockblast right and and being hit that hard by by a piece of shrapnel and just being that close to the impact but then also you know this penetrating piece of shrapnel went right through his chest and didn't hit any of his vital organs just cause this hemothorax his blood to fill up in his pleural space so evacuated all that blood and he started to be able to breathe again so there he is he's back we get him out we go back inside the the the bunker there and a couple hours later we got out so we find out the next day that a dude not a fighting age a local guy was a sleeper cell and that he had come back in the neighborhood and was three or four houses down and was communicating with his operatives and his Isis Bros you know two three hundred meters away and was releasing pigeons to identify our position so the way they figure is that one of our security guys would see a pigeon go up and you didn't think much about it and then a mortar hit and then you know ten minutes later he's like there's no pigeons around there right because I mean shit's crazy it's the combat zone and birds don't dig combat zones so he kind of started to piece it together and then he realized on the third one he's like he saw a pigeon go up and goes we're about to get hit sure enough so we got out of there saved us Yves life he got out and they went and found this dude and got his phone and sure enough he was doing all this any admitted it he's like yep that was me I was doing I was releasing pigeons to identify your spot and I was told they took care of the situation that was what they try to kill the Americans who were trying to help everybody well yeah so I just wanted us I mean they wanted to get us because we were there we were helping the enemy right now she is so that was that was a couple months ago so they documented on his on his website CNN was interviewing him and there's there's mortars dropping crazy yeah Eddie took a lot over there for about a month yeah Wow side when you're leaving well that was they knew this this NYC medics they knew this NGO knows like it was hard to sustain that you know I mean with the concentration you can't help but affect you I mean that's why so many of our our military folks have such profound PTSD right it's just from getting your ass kicked like them these guys go through these deployments that are just months on end of that right and right you just can't imagine how much you know how that hurts and then go back to Kansas and they gotta go to the grocery store yeah it's it's it's hard to fathom you know it's the unlocked are tootsie rolls rights are so social it's a black dar it's much rarer so it fucking is I'm just different I judge Johnny Cash with that dope please young kids Wow yeah so that was got it took me a little bit to to to roll out of that and thank God for my wife man she came back and we went on a run up in the hills like a few days later we got up to top of this hill and I just I just cried on her shoulder I just let it go and since then I'm fun but it gives me such a deep appreciation for how hard it must be for you know for these men and women who come back from these deployments and they've been a part of these things and and been affected so profoundly it's it's it's got to hurt you know on a very deep emotional level who I can only imagine man what a crazy life you live helping people that are involved in traumatic situations over and over again various traumatic situations whether it's getting stuck on k2 or whether it's getting there yeah but he seeks it out that's what he does I just wanted to bring him he seems like what am I going to do this spring is gonna change 50 people's lives what it where's Kay - that's the twos in Pakistan Pakistan yeah that's a is that a more dangerous one the first nothing generally the consensus is it's more technical it's more dangerous and it's not as commercialized right so it's not I say more technical what do they mean by well there's just longer bits of terrain that require more high-level technical climbing skill so more exposed steeper you know more longer stretches of hanging it out there contouring you better your shit dialed or you're gonna get smoked and you and when they go on these like crazy hikes like you have to have very specific kind of gear to write like they must have like the clothing pretty dialed in yeah I mean look remember those pictures of Mallory right yeah that's come like the students in wool which by the way wool is pretty good pretty good yeah it's pretty good than cotton not there and cut but now you know it's it's a matter of getting the right gear that works and you can rely on it you know it's I mean I don't want to be 20 miles back and you know in the backcountry hunting elk and have my therm-a-rest have a hole in it so I sleep in the dirt for five days which is what happened to me last fall all right well myself and you know it's way way back in the first night you know my therm rest at hole I'd never thought no it's late in the dirt for five nights I was a dick off yeah you get cold from it to fuck your pad put my I have to put my pack on her you see yeah yeah I had some nights like that so yeah women you up seconds you hole in your air mattress I it was it was flat man I had nothing I did you bagged on the Japanese guy because he had a hole in his mattress well which guy the guy that came down yeah well he called a helicopter and I sucked it up he called a helicopter because he had a hole in his mouth this is funny story we had so we I got a call so there's a Japanese guy and he's dying to camp to dying dying no telling everybody's fucking dying he's dying mmm so what I call shit all right I'm sorry I could get the helicopter get a helicopter the risk their lives they go up there and get him fly him down base camp base camp to lukla where our station was get that helicopter and I'll let Jeff take over well yeah then you know I starting you know asking him he's just pleasant as he can be and what's going on do you hurt you have pain you know is so oh very very tired very very tired hole in mattress and I you have a woody what and he said I have a hole in a mattress and he was at Camp 2 and was sleeping in the snow and had a hole in his mattress and didn't tell anybody just was basically he was done like we were talking about he was done and because he's got money he calls in the cavalry and says bring a helicopter Jeff was pissed I was fuckin pissed pissed it's a lot of people risk their lives I saw a dude on Denali do that at base camp in nineteen ninety six or seven this dude shows up with a a like a Boy Scout old-school Boy Scout like we below looking fucking thing you know like made of cotton I guess you know with like some weird synthetic shit and I asked me for a knife to be able to cut the plastic off of it you know and I'm like man that's not a good idea where are you going and I didn't want to I should have questioned him two weeks later we get a call and have to go up to 17,000 feet for a guy who had broken his ankle so we land the helicopter down at 17 and he runs towards the helicopter which everybody knows is you don't run towards a helicopter make a little if he runs to the helicopter I'm like he's got a bro so turns out he was his Colt I'm telling you man like a lot of people just tap out and because they know there's an infrastructure around that will pull them out instead of being accountable for themselves that's where I get pissed so we pulled this guy off and we interviewed them and then Jeff goes the nicest thing he says have a nice life walks up just start cussing and piss he's paid you don't want to do an interview this is the Japanese guy yeah yeah yeah didn't want to talk about them I mean it's very dangerous to fly a helicopter that I'll to write selfish anything can go wrong we are helicopter pilots were I mean absolutely the other the military pilots got to be the best helicopter pilots in the world I mean these guys are so skilled and understand what those conditions make you do as a pilot it's it was it was phenomenal but that being said machines break now when I put him in a helicopter one time we'll put a volatile copters one time and that telecom and that pilot are dead now yeah from that well no like a few months later I was being the probably fuck I'm fine crashed into a cliff yeah won't it won't name the company but yeah we there was at one little flight we put them in there yeah and there's a rack that was a rickety old helicopter when you do all these really high stressful high danger sort of situations you're constantly around people that have this extremely high threshold for the extremely high tolerance to discomfort to you know pushing your endurance levels overcoming obstacles like you're around people that are like really solid human beings like they're very unlike we're talking about people that are willing to summit Everest people that will rescue people that summit Everest people that are willing to do these medical stations 500 yards or 500 meters from the front line I mean you're talking about some really solid human beings very very unusually solid human beings when you come back from that and deal with people I got my fucking self on such a piece of shit you know like oh my god this traffic oh my god like that is that one of the hardest transitions like the modern first world problems gripes the bullshit that people whine and bitch about yeah yeah that was part of the discomfort I had when I came back from Iraq specifically was you know the delay in flights and just how pissed businessman Bob gets you know like come on dude I let like louis c.k you know did that you know you're not fucking walking you know like thirteen of you're dead when you get that you know like no I'm just I've been on a gratitude tour since I got back like I'm just grateful for everything I'm so grateful that I was born by right random stroke of luck you know in Roanoke Virginia with good parents and a good family structure and was given all the opportunities that I was given and I wasn't born in Mosel and hidin in a you know of cellar from the most evil dudes on the planet yeah I mean it's just a it's it's great so I've come back and instead of getting mad at those people are frustrated with those people I just try and smile through it and just think you know to myself like man I wish you could taste what I tasted just not not long ago you know like it really recalibrated me where it just doesn't you I just let it Teflon off you know to a certain extent and with regards to the people that I work with I tend to I think gravitate towards people who like these chaotic sort of environments and I got turned on to this this thing it was this concept this acronym that the American military academy kicked off a few decades it goes like 30 years ago or something and they started referring to working in these VUCA environment right volatile uncertain chaotic ambiguous environment and how we operate in those environments and how true champions and leaders like Alex can operate in these places in these atmospheres that are just absolutely shithouse sideways and when things go crazy how do you handle how do you manifest it you know what do you what are you doing are you flipping the fuck out are you withdrawing you know and and we all have different methods for dealing but I feel like I've kind of gravitated towards those kind of people yeah I just got done reading sebastian youngers book tribe I just read it to when I got back amazing it's amazing yeah it reminds you of of where we are and where we've been yeah and also why people do gravitate towards those environments and like what it what they get out of it and how this life in these intense environments sort of it magnifies so much of what it means to be human mm-hmm and and to be a part of something that X's you yes that's the phenomenal thing I read I read youngers I read that book too right when I got back so just like last month I read it and it was a great tool for me my um my SEAL team buddy told me to read it when I got back and it says all the team guys you know I've read it because of that it reminds them of why yeah why and then why things are a little bit you know the threads come undone a little bit when you're not in that tribe right yeah pretty much and how many people live in environments where they don't know their neighbors there there's no danger there no excitement there's no nothing and they live this muted terrifying life in a lot of ways it's terrifying because there's nothing there it's empty there's a void and it's not how human beings are supposed to be we're supposed to be confronted by a certain amount of difficult supposed to be challenged right now life's very insulated and and soft and as a result we insulate further I think from that and then we medicate to deal with the hollow feeling that you get from being isolated and insulated what evidences the quest is for earlier which is why people climb Everest why you climb k2 why you go dose yourself I know but you put right why anybody does that why do people push himself yeah well yeah well and why do we why do we hunt yeah why do we run yeah why do we do the things that we do because if it creates engagement for me and I'm not running for my life but create struggle I did run for my life just a few months ago you know and and I you know I look back now and that was that's the fucked-up thing that I think so many military folks really struggle with it and that's what younger talked about in that book was how would you find the you know the environment you were in was so precarious and it was just so tenuous like it could be wiped out in any second and yet you want to go back there you know I got my I got an avalanche on that mountain almost dead turns out I want to go back why why like what why right what is that that that wiring that makes you want but you know why because they want to be with their boys and their gals and like you know in it in it connected feeling like you know our shit is tied together why do I want to go back to the mountains the same reason because I want to go with the same boys and get the same sort of you know intense experience and I think that we missed that I missed that I really just got this thing you want to teach his son and when we were up there and ever so you kept on talking about teaching his son to serve others be be positive role model and serve others and I don't know where that comes from on him but he that's what he always talked about well I think it started with Eric right because that wasn't foundation in my relationship with this with my blonde buddy I was a selfish dirtbag climber in J tree you know in the in the mid-90s and I met this blonde dude who needed an ally he needed a friend he needed a guide and he not just a guy but he needed his need a teammate and not somebody that would that he could trust but somebody that would eventually trust him and that's pretty that was pretty wild for him to ask at some point for a sighted person to trust a blind person on the side of a rock face or the side of a mountain hmm cuz you know it's hard enough with everything and you take away your your vision and you know shit just get too amplified and erekt pretty famous and he's summited what is he some of it he's done the Seven Summits so the highest points the seven continents I was on six of them with them and he went down to Antarctica while I was in medical school but then you know he's gone on to do a lot of stuff he's a he's a bad dude man motivational speaker I mean he's a great Erik whiner so I mean but to be honest with you he'll tell you'll be the first to tell you that kayaking in a in a boat by himself down the Grand Canyon was way scarier than anything he's ever done whatever how could you don't know what's Cohen did the violence and talk about chaotic environment around you just you carry me here the dude in your ear and sometimes not at all all you can hear is his violence and somehow he just paddles through and then you know he'll get tossed and go under and have to roll back up and it was he tells me that you know he had his own little version of PTSD from that from just get being freaked the fuck out and having nightmares how long was that travel 200 and something miles on that tiny it was a couple weeks yeah 12 days maybe something like that I think it was yeah pretty remarkable and pretty remarkable yeah I can imagine so yeah it's bad dude that but it does some it is a reoccurring theme this this thing where people are in these incredibly hostile dangerous scenarios and they want to go back they get over it and then they want to go back yeah you know and I mean the challenge that whatever you get out of it is that him yeah that's him oh there's a video of him doing it Oh you bet was he born blonde so he was born with the degenerative retinal disease called written that shit oh my god I mean that'll swallow you bro how do you spell his last name Jamie w e IH en ma y ER so wine is what he does in the mountains sometimes which other than mayor of the city well that's an old that's an old image he's got hair right there Wow but yeah that's ed right there's I never pulling up the top but he's a he's a bad man dude and you know everybody loves him some super blonde dude you know and I think that's why I relationship is so strong is because I'm not afraid to give him some shit and kind of keep him grounded but behind the scenes he's he blows me away my alladia he's this very special human being crazy that he could figure out how to balance that and figure out how to go left and go right well he's an amazing athlete first and foremost I mean if he was sighted he could have been like a pro ballplayer you know he's just got that sort of body awareness and then he's born with the degenerate retina disease so he was those under he was blind legally blind but then his retinas unraveled and at the age of 13 it was totally lights out and then his mama got killed in a car wreck two years later and so he I mean it was it was step up fortunately for him his dad is was a Marine fighter pilot Edie and Edie was not about to let his blind son sit back and let life go by so he grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and took him on all these deploy all these you know around the world as he got stationed in different places and and and Eric just realized like pony up ain't no time to feel and got time for sitting around son Wow get up and he did and he found rock climbing and then rock climbing turned into mountaineering and that's when we met and 23 years ago 23 four years ago now I think this is all very hard for some people to process especially people that haven't experienced very difficult things or very scary things or dangerous things you know that this that people would long to do this to be a blind guy who's going through 270 plus miles of water in a kayak or to be someone who wants a summit Mount Everest or to be someone who wants to be a medic in a war zone to be Sebastian Junger who's out there you know embedded embedded for years right years you know I think that maybe the general population might look at that and feel like maybe it's reckless or some or super inspired and like pain that's so great and then others are like yeah I mean I I'm I'm down dude I'm psyched that you're out there charging because then that sets the template and what it does I think for a lot of people just says all that Bond guy can do it well then that means I should stop feeling sorry for myself because I'm feeling low today there's their dare guarantee there's a lot of times when I don't feel like train and I don't really feel like going out and doing something hard and then I'll think I need to train harder to be strong enough that when shit goes sideways I'll have his back ya know whether you do train for something like Everest how do you prepare for something like that climb just climb up and down up and down lots of weight like a place like you go to Boulder or somewhere in the mountains above it or shake my bigger mountains yeah like way up in the hills yeah and like big long days like long days like 10 12 hour days that's how you train yeah do a week on you know I mean two or three probably like big long days I try to you know get broke the fuck off at least you know a couple times a week right where I'm like boof okay you know you carry weight on your pack and don't do those days of carrying big heavy weight I've kind of stopped doing that and I just go because I like to feel a little bit more free there was a time when I would put on a big pack you know and just just to feel that weight on my traps and Joe's only asking is he's experiencing 45 pounds he put out he has a new vest he was he was testing out the other day yeah I'm asking cuz it's crazy how 45 pounds is just not much at all no but it's a lot then I start walking up hills it's all yeah yeah yeah but you know some of these guys are probably carrying way more than that right like 60 70 on Denali like a Denali packs close to a hundred as a guide no something on our pet the client's would typically have oh it's 100 pound pack and a 20 30 pound sled and I was those were Denali days and that's a twelve thirteen fourteen thousand feet that's not milking and that's yeah what are these guys built like well I mean the ones who are good are pretty pretty narrow how the fuck are they carrying that much weight I carried that much weight for years and years under my house I was a buck fifty back then you know and and would carry a hundred pounds and it hurt yeah but you just remember mountaineering is slog I mean when you're really moving like on that kind of mountain it's a slog it's really slow and then you got a technical train you best lighten your load that's you're not carrying 100 you know hundred pounds then you're carrying you know a light light pack light is right you know ounces make pounds pounds make pain right and what you got you got to feel like someone carrying a hundred pounds you have to build up to that no yeah yeah for sure there's always weird stabilizing muscles and your hip muscles and you know lower back and oh man I couldn't do it now I mean I couldn't I'm just I get sore thinking about it but I mean this was back in my 20s when I was doing your back-to-back Denali trips and you didn't know any better I didn't know any better and it's like this is fun it was fun and it was cool I used to do a lot of expeditions because I was the quintessential dirt back just so I could go eat you know so I could get fed and I didn't even care I mean I'd have done it on expeditions just so you could get some food to eat didn't know I was going to eat some dehydrated food yeah right I mean I was I was the I was living in my van man how did you start out being this guy I grew up in I was born in North Carolina in the Smokies and I grew up in Roanoke Virginia and my parents are not adventurous at all but you know my dad and mom were both just working you know middle-class you know the hard-working middle-class folks and I was just a restless Punk you know I was just super Restless getting in trouble all the time and I got arrested several times before I was 18 and just bad just just restless and dumb like most of us I think and went to school at at Tennessee for a year and got a 1.2 my first semester in a point six it's possible to get a point six Wow yeah daddy in racquetball no no true story you just weren't paying attention no I was I was drinking brown liquor and chasing women hmm I was good at it what about those things and so I failed out and then I moved to Colorado in 1989 and moved to Boulder and is just a bunch of hippies and like I was into the Grateful Dead and I was you know tapping into some good fun things and growing my head and I fell in with a group of climbers pretty pretty quick off who were a couple years older than me and they basically took me under their wing and sort of gave me this apprenticeship and taught me how to not get dead Wow now polders a real weird spot right there's like fly-fishing there and kayaking and hikers and live ones riding mountain bikes and everyone's fit it's weird everybody wears the fat people it's there's no fat people in blue it's so weird no you walk around everybody's got like Solomons on shit like everybody's coming in from a workout yeah yeah Whole Foods just everybody stinky in yeah add some granola you're all seen you in shit Ranchers there's a lot of people so I just I've lived in Boulder on and off for 28 years I went to medical school in Philadelphia Drexel Medical College Pennsylvania other than that I've been in and out of Boulder for 28 years and I were moving to Evergreen we're moving to Evergreen Colorado which is a super sweet spot but yeah it's a reason I'm leaving boulders because it's just it's pretty congested man lot of people live there hilarious a lot of people live there and now I'm riding on the 405 here I'm like 200,000 people oh yeah I don't know how y'all do it and one of the people I was talking to Illinois she was saying that she's gonna bring her nieces to California they've never been outside of Maui whoo they've been to lanai and Maui that's it that's it so they haven't even been to fucking Honolulu and now she's gonna fly them to Los Angeles they're gonna go to Disneyland Oh Universal like what in the fuck she gave him some mushrooms see what happens you don't need to that'd be I relate I met when I was a kid and we went from New York to or front Boston rather than in New York for some thing was for a karate tournament something like that but we were driving up the West Side Highway and you see the city looming in the distance like the Death Star and I remember thinking what in the fuck is this like how are there so many buildings Boston's a city but it's not that kind of city it's not Manhattan it's yeah Manhattan is something very unique and special and star yeah and you pull up to it you're like what is this it was so intimidating well that could go either way for those kids right that can be fascinated by the energy or bug the fuck out yeah can't wait to get back to well this amount of stimuli that you get in an environment like that is just overwhelming yeah but you're like boulders too much just too much too many people there's almost a hundred thousand yeah well do this anymore I don't like to sit in my truck I like to move you know if I'm gonna go drop somewhere I want to drive there and park get out and go in and do my deal and come back and then you know the trails are pretty pretty populated too you know yeah go climbing you've got to wait in line you know so let me go up like like rope climbing yeah when people are going up sides are you better get there at dawn really get up yeah that's it's a lot of people getting busy out in the woods which is cool but you know I'm just feeling like you know it's a lot of a lot of folks turns out the older I get the less people he wants to talk to so what do you think also that's Bo you're involved in these intense situations like being in Iraq or like being on ever since sometimes you just want to sit back and process it all yeah I don't sit on the rocking chair and I like to you know like I want to mow my yard I would tractor I want to drive my tractor around you know sip on a beer I'm a I'm a southern boy at heart and I like quiet things I know a bunch of guys who've moved out there for that very reason yeah it makes sense and so we're moving their hearings couple that's awesome the in the landscape couldn't be prettier it's nice beautiful it's real nice how the winners brutal ain't gold hill winners though no no that's that's way worse but it's brutal you know no it's real you gotta ready you gotta get ready yeah we live on a dirt road holla yeah you're out there huh I hold up to Joe's house there's an old power wagon his old house in Boulder an old power wagon with a snow plow and there's a couple snow machines out there in a poem I do you why those things are there Joe she's got a pie yourself out because I'm not nervous no man I when I lived in Boston I drove a van I drove delivered newspapers I drove 365 days a year so I drove every fuckin day everytime a blizzard hit every time snow head I'm not scarce snow I know how to drive and snow it's not fun to get stuck and you will get stuck but it doesn't bother me doesn't freak me out but to someone has never been in snow yeah it ain't the place I like to play but if you had to choose between like it's you know it's it's a tough call because I would you rather live in like Phoenix right now I heard it's 124 degrees that they're canceling flights because it's so hot they're canceling flights yeah you know yeah I mean I don't do something about that cold and snow to that's like really peaceful like there's something that people don't like I remember when I was a kid one of the things that I really liked about snow is especially when I had to deliver newspapers it's like I would have to be out there and you would hear nothing because the snow muffles all the sound yeah so it's like you get a kind of peace and quiet that you don't no one's driving because it's you know there's two feet of snow so you're out there and it's just nothing nothing and everything's soft and you hit it or of your feet on the ground and that's it mmm you know it's like you and then I think people that live in those environments like live in the cold you appreciate summer for real like you really appreciate summer out here every day is summer nobody gives a shit it's 75 degrees perfect in January yeah you know and you go into Boulder and on the Cu campus you know like you get a 60 degree 50 degree day in the spring and whole pitches just go down to their daisy dukes well you know like they're like he needs me up those feathers yeah that scent fly whoa yeah wow so what's next for you man what are you gonna do now no that's we're gonna figure out between now and next spring because Springs when I start get the itch you know to go do something and so how do you guys work it out do you like come to him with an idea or does he do you guys sit down to talk about it well we can't talk about her can't talk about gential well he just pitched something to me yesterday that's pretty interesting and adventurous and fun and curious and a mystery to bit of it just good TV I

just trying to find his way and I can relate you know he's trying to get out no one just knows their way there is no everyone finds a way no you have to I'm still looking man and you always will be yeah and that's the good thing I think that's part of what I'm doing while I'm doing it I'm still looking 100 you know I'm still trying to figure it out I'm trying to do the best I can helping people where I can I don't have I don't have a wide array of skills but I know how to help people when they're having a hard go that's a great path though in the path of service the path of helping people and the gratitude and the experience that you get from that that's very positive yeah yeah I mean that's I feel like if I can instill any of that into my boy like I win you know it's be grateful like yeah live live a grateful life and and by living that what does that mean is like you know pay it forward show gratitude show love show compassion and and allow people to to be the best version of them and do the best you can to make them better you know well said and I didn't know I didn't know that till I met Eric be honest with you he was catalyst for all that wow that's amazing that one
