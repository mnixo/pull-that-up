join my gang Joe Rogan podcast by night all day it's like one when 1/35 first opened up it was in the UFC was there wasn't as many fencing room there were that elite mm-hmm you know there's like even to watch the guys who were really good improved like you saw the cody fight where he was fucking fantastic against Tommy but it's good how goddamn good to TJ look against lineker completely nullified Linacre nullified him Whitaker he's like one of the best examples of a guy with absolutely freakish physical attributes a fucking iron jaw iron jaw never seen a guy get hurt he gets hit by everybody gets head kicked he gets punched robbed font said he hit him with the hardest punch he ever hit anybody with his life and he goes he didn't even acknowledge he hit him he just walked right for it he's and he hit him with a body shot felt like he got hit by a car he didn't look like that that Linacre I don't think that same Linacre showed up on Saturday or Friday nullified him he didn't he's days but oolitic was very hesitant and I think it's because of TJ's the way he was fighting the faints the takedowns the kicks and throwing that that head kick to the body kick but he was very tentative when he got he got out beat he threw him in the truck almost had him in a cab yeah I thought I was gonna go for the twister and I was like oh my god if he goes to the twister but he got went to the calf slices but I'm like I looked at her like he's not gonna adapt to that it's just me a stomp he needed to stomp down TJ looked amazing amazing yeah and the timing and those takedowns like lightning bolts like it looks like he's throwing a punch and he's underneath you just so so nasty he's so fast man but god damn Cody Garber what the fuck god damn and I'll admit I said I think who's gonna be champ just not just not yet he's gonna be your champ but he's not ready for Dom yet then I open him rounds like what the fuck he's so he's mimicked him he's doing breakdancing he's doing push-ups and shaky fucked with Dominic's head and that was one of the things that I was thinking of like this kid's been a lot of street fights like I don't know if this trash talk is gonna work on him the way it works on other guys like he said he was fine in there like I asked some buddies like I like that he goes I feel calm he goes I know I can stay calm when that's going on and I think he's just like this young hungry dude who he took it personal and a lot of guys get real emotional and I was worried that Cody come out super emotional just get murked like taking down just you know the real emotion like a although did against McGregor we forget size technique in rushes and get hurt but dude he just took all that and the best performance I mean can you name another performance like that where a guy he remember he was even number one contender's five or six in the world he was eight was he a I thought moved to six maybe but that might have been some shenanigans yeah right just um who knows the cheeto fingering King jab but still motherfucker went from five six right number one I'm not that's a big stratum handily it wasn't a double one round yeah and I was da me one one and Cody dropped him hurt him we don't we still don't exactly know where the cut came from some people were saying it came from a punch I heard people say online say it came from a kick the guy definitely not brought but the guys in that truck said was a headbutt your truck boys were off because I heard when they said I'm like what the fuck are they watching they pulled it up for me but it's hard you see while the fights going on they'll do that and I'll tell me it's a headbutt and see I have two monitors in front of me I have one right here and then I'm one over the side and they'll say like look on monitor B and then they'll show us me but I can't really it's hard for me to do that while I'm watching the actual fight you know so they'll show it to me and I usually I just take their word for it but occasionally it there but I think in the replay that they showed maybe they saw different show the correct one three play that they showed it was definitely wasn't a headbutt well they definitely did collide heads for sure for sure and so who knows it was hard to tell but who gives a fuck it was a big-ass cut big-ass cut on Dom's eyebrow and he got drew how good is Dominick Cruz took a punch to by night he came he gets cracked his legs ghost if he goes down and a couple times Cody like acted almost like he wasn't gonna follow him to the ground and and beat on him on the ground and almost acted like he was done he's like calling them up we're like a Mark Hunt kind of walk off ko yeah better get on him did he do didn't even make it a tap to you right well maybe doesn't want to have anything to do with the ground maybe he feels like that's where Dominic might have a chance not boo shush you down there no son I don't know what Dominic keeps I thought I just want to punch him too maybe does Dominick Cruz have any submissions oh no Dominick Cruz is really good yeah hell yeah sure are you Donna's record does he have any submission yeah he has submissions from usually from guillotines though back in the day does jujitsu is really good trust no no no yeah anyone he's a blind without further I've seen him compete and in jiu-jitsu Germans yeah and any wrestled as well he's a wrestler before a guy not to go down in his guard that's some shit that's got some Hana McGregor dia shit we like I just don't I can lose too easily down there well I mean it might not have been that at all it might have been even more simple that's a lost Jamie I'm naked yeah so he's got a rear naked there he's guys so he lost two he's got one rear naked he's not no first our dojo you're right well who knows we you don't you still you don't know what he could do but the bottom line was Cody wanted to keep the fight standing I think just want to punish him yeah and you know just thought it was hope dude was it getting hit him so hard I thought the fight was over he he seemed the answer for Dominic I mean at least it worked for Cody was it or wasn't not a no striker that he made Dominic come to him and it's different when Krakus is that what it was well sort of but it's also you got to give credit to his team see Justin Buckholtz and those guys have been imitating they fought Dom so many times 6:19 imitate his movements so they can mimic his shit so when they're sparring they do that that fake stat that like false start you know cuz Dom does this thing where he false starts and then he starts and you never know which one's gonna be a kick which was like it's a lot of like like patterns that Dom throws up paint so they figured out how to do that and they mimicked and they watch them so many times that they can get it down to a tee and Cody didn't binding to the faints just like come on come on coming within this range and he kept baiting me and bait and they'd make it count yeah the bottom line is if his brains not confused and he just knows that in these exchanges Dom's gonna be there and he's gonna do some you know he's got some really unpredictable movement Dom does but he does like a bunch of things a lot and then commits yeah and so he timed those things and caught him with some fucking vicious punches man yeah and yeah he wasn't you know like Don fites a lot of guys they're like what the fuck that Chris Tucker who gets in the Facebook guy which one al kicked me and you don't know where it's coming from but he just he just garb and just never bought it you know like I'm thinking wait for you to commit you can do all that jazz I'm just gonna wait right here it's also a guy's been boxing when he was really young I'm really talking about last night yeah I'm just a 32 and 2 amateur record you lookin at yo yeah but in the UFC compared to all the fighters that boxing comes in and the huge he was catching he was key Cody was catching Dominick Cruz on the way out mm-hmm which that's a lot of people don't catch him on the way I never see it no he was catching them on the way up and the speed and precision of those punching a power glorious for five rounds and then when people forget Cody in high school he I think he was first team all-state out of Ohio which is big deal out there he had scholarships played Division one I'm sorry compete in Division one wrestling it was like now I'm just gonna fight professionally a full time that's what kind of stud you're dealing with yeah his uncle was an alternate for the Olympic boxing team so I mean he comes from a long line of just savages too pretty crazy yeah this his count-out piece was pretty amazing [Music]
