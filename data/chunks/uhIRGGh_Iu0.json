is our friend Keith Jardine and Tate have created this company called caveman coffee because they're both fucking caveman and they have a relationship with a guy who grows coffee in Colombia his family grows coffee and they they go direct to it's a single-source farm so it's kind of interesting just by happenstance because Tate is uh takes a big coffee fanatic always has been that dude ever since we met him but he wouldn't go anywhere without a venti Starbucks in his hand you know yeah he quit alcohol and drugs and went right to coffee then well that happens man those do dudes that are

supposed to do anything that's you know what would be the word for it twisted you know anything where you're feeding some some you can all those guys are addicted to Red Bulls yeah but that's not markers it's not like huffing paint yeah I guess which one's more dangerous is actually good for you or about sniffing play-doh that's and people who deny this listen you have to read some articles on this it appears that coffee has a lot of functions a lot of benefits you know what it is it's like every fucking thing else you can overdo it you can overdo it you could drink coffee all fucking day every day and just torch your adrenals just jack your system or you can have a little bit of it every day it has gives you a stimulant effect on top of that it's rich in antioxidants there's like a lot of good things about coffee believe it or not it's actually not bad for you we used to think it was bad for you what's bad for you is dehydration but if you drink coffee and you still drink water

sends you things is ridiculous you're gonna give you someone how much I gotta give you 80 bucks and you're gonna take some shit that weighs 20 pounds across the country what the fuck is that that's ridiculous it's amazing like people used to complain about stamps when a stamp was like 35 cents you know it wouldn't 35 cents I'm sucking thirty-five cents someone's gonna take your letter and they're gonna bring it to another part of the world like that's amazing they're gonna take it to the other side of the continent and it only cost 35 cents and you're whining you fucking lazy spoiled bitch yeah I love the future shit like this is a great example of a website taking something that sucked and making it so much better and so much easier to where you could take advantage of the USPS you know for like you know sending stuff to your parents for cheap and not having to deal with taking it to the post office waiting line two where it becomes a chore yeah we have a bunch of our

feel you my appointment next week bitch there's a weird vacancy of their eyes if you ever go to like a or watch a documentary on those people like I've seen those people if you there was a Planned Parenthood I think it was in Boston and I remember seeing these people outside of it and they would would you drive by and they would hold up pictures of like dead babies and stuff like hold up like that and they harass women as they're going in they like show them these pictures but when they come out nobody is out there yeah have you noticed that everybody's gone yeah why is that I don't

Congress to tell you what to do with yourself yeah no no no one can tell you yeah because why is you happening you can't take guys to kids when I was fifteen what the fuck was you Dan Congress you got two kids might over 15 yeah that's crazy two kids Wow I have a fucking childhood that is incredible I don't know how I made it it was incredible Wow well you obviously made it you're okay you're funny yeah but I took I went through a lot of shit to get funny Christ wasn't funny when I was having them jacket on man yeah old were you in you and your first case I was 14 when I had my first kid by merit man I met him when I was 12 and he was 22 whoa so we started dating I was in elementary school oh my god well I had a really nice body I was fuckable I might not be fuckable today Joe but I was fuckable bag dear when she start fucking twelve he was the first one first one Wow he was the first one you got a baby with him and you had a baby when you're 14 - but and I did I got pregnant again and gave birth when I was 15 oh my goodness wow that is a crate where it was you never met a teenage mom oh I've met teenage well I'm an old teenage mom I used to be a teenage mom that's just uh it's it's hard for someone who has children especially someone was daughters like now I got two daughters - yeah they didn't have any kids they didn't have the life on it not in play that shit what do they feel like when they hear your story that's got to be hard I mean I guess you'd have to ask them but that has to be crazy to hear that your mom went through that well my daughter was there you know she was there cuz I mean I got pregnant and fourteen and I had a brother then I couldn't get a job I started selling drugs so she was there through everything I mean I think I'm her hero Wow so she got married and I straightened everything out you know she had a better life but you know that's one of those situations where people that have that attitude like that everyone on welfare is just just lazy like that people don't need a help they do they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps like stories like that man you gotta shut the fuck up Ronnie so tastic let me tell you something when you were you dealing with you like I grew up in the ghetto my mom was on welfare her mom was on welfare so people I tell a story about welfare is like diabetes if the mama get it there's a good chance the daughter might get it so you teaches I mean she taught me how to do this shit and I just said I don't want my daughter to go through this bullshit I don't want my daughter to be a teenage mom and you don't drop out of high school my daughter is the first one that graduated high school in three generations and the first one to ever go to college in my family Wow so I was determined you are not gonna end up like I ended up that's beautiful that's amazing that that to me is the greatest form of success ever if you can learn from your own mistakes import and part your life's wisdom on your children and then your children go on to take the ball and carry it and run it further and do what you just said become the first person to go to college become the first person graduate high school and many generations that's beautiful that's yeah that's an amazing thing congratulations well thank you I mean I worked hard for this year because I mean I didn't graduate much nobody else I had nobody to look up to I just know I was like my daughter would not go through this bullshit that I went through in life and I had a son - so he graduated - but Wow nobody else I mean how the kneestr because i custody of my sister for kids so hurt oldest daughter graduate cuz they're the same age right after my daughter did but nobody else everybody just keep having babies and dropping out it's so fuckin what do you call it epidemic yeah you know it's just keep passing it now yeah yeah it's um there's definitely kids everybody learns from their atmosphere that's why I always tell people if you can surround yourself with people that are trying to get their shit together and we'll help you get your shit together because you you force yourself to the standard of the people that you're around if you're around a bunch of people that are real friendly you're more likely to be friendly you know if you around a bunch of people that'll go out of the way to help people you're more likely to go away to help people and that's what I did I started to surround myself I said for me to do better I need somebody I can learn from cuz I didn't learn shit from my mama my mama stayed drunk all the time and you know I was raised in a bootleg house so all I saw was drunk people just bullshit all my life so I started to pick my girlfriend's if you didn't have a college degree a high school diploma you couldn't be my fuckin freak because I have a bunch of stupid asthma I need somebody I can learn you know this is we put a correct sentence together all that bullshit cuz I've dropped out of school in eighth grade so I needed to surround myself around better people so all my girlfriend's got college degrees and you know they married they you know that's amazing though you figured that out like how old were you when you decided to have these like really high standards um probably about 17 cuz probably about 17 when thing was winding down from being a bad relationship with my kid's father because you know I I started dating him and I think what I was looking for was just somebody to love me cuz my I didn't have a fucking father so I think I was just saying I need somebody to love me so I get involved this guy become very abusive who shoots me he who beats me and then I'm thinking you know cuz I was taught this my momma said if a man don't hit you he don't love you she said fuck yeah he hit me with a roller skate one night this is like the worst advice I've ever known give me a lot of fucked up advice that I realize now that was fucked up advice but it was passed down to her so she was like if a man no hit you he don't love you so like my baby daddy hit me with a roller skate one night because it's fool love the roller skate and that fucking skate shook my skull and I say to myself at this love bitch I can do without it I bought up my face and I knock that motherfucker in the backseat and I started to fight back from that day on he shot me in the back of the hand not to see me shoot you with a 38 Jesus Christ where'd you hit you and it just it cracked the back of my skull that's it just grazed you now I went in a little bit but it was fucked up cuz I did it was like I can't believe you not dead so I was in a hospital I get better and I call him it's like oh you love me come get me that's how fucking he wasn't in jail you didn't call no I wouldn't tell I was in love cuz my momma say if I don't slap you a couple times you know so he shoot you oh my god that's real fucking love Jesus Christ he was trying to kill you what'd he say he

of my life cuz I miss my daughter going to kindergarten you can't get that shit back right but I was just trying to survive honestly I was just trying to survive well I couldn't imagine how anybody would function just being 14 have a defend for yourself having kids like what you can't I couldn't because I was 15 and I needed a work permit so a lot of times I would just show up on the fucking interview and it was like way your work for me I was like meet Ashley and I kill I need a fucking job I got two kids there's like you're supposed to be in school that's here not there I got two fucking kids to fend for so at that time Craig had just hit the black community really hard so I started to sell Craig because everybody was getting on him Wow did you take it I never did drugs I grew up watching my mama um as an alcoholic so everything my mama did I said I wouldn't do she smoked cigarettes she drank she did whatever I was like I'm not gonna end up like you motherfuckers I think y'all stole me well you were the the end of the line you know I mean that's that it that's what it looks like I mean looks like you're the one who figured it out and then you're imparting that onto your kids but the end of the line like sometimes enough is enough and enough is enough your own genetics will like stop cut the bullshit that's let's reset this whole thing yeah good for you especially when I keep my keys can't grow on this bush how'd you start doing stand-up um I went to the welfare office you know to get my food stamps on welfare recertified so you like it a white caseworker and I tell her oh it's such a whole life I've been shot I've been this I've been that and you know white caseworker once I tell these stories in the detail white women they're so easy to make cry so this bitch to give me a few h2 bumps and tell me what was going on free so one day I go in and I got this black caseworker so I said oh this bitch is gonna be hard because you know you think all black people's from the ghetto so I started telling her these stories in this bitch busts out laughing and I was like what the fuck are you laughing at she's like you should be a comedian this shit is hilarious you ever heard of Richard Pryor these are Richard Pryor stole that's like I didn't come here for no fucking job I came for free shit that's hilarious you didn't want a job no I was on welfare I mean at the time I was trying to get my life back together so I'm you know I'm just home had a free house cuz I Section eight cuz they're my sister four kids so I had a total of six kids and a husband who was working I was like you know this how I grew up motherfuckers standing home watching The Young and the Restless so you didn't even start to think about doing stand-up until this lady brought that up when she too first want to kind of put it in my ear yell I never thought this shit was funny it was pain see what I mean you know I mean when you tell when I tell these stories I had to get over them so you got to forgive and then you gotta you know you got to let everything go so it doesn't bother you to tell it on stage I can laugh about it now you know people look at me having you know sleeping with a married man I'm 12 and he's 22 that's fuckin child molestation but how do you deal with it so I deal with it I laugh about it I'm turning all that were you say and I used to be pissed off at his do because he took my fucking child I mean think about it I was a mom at 14 that's crazy I got a 16 year old daughter that all she do is fucking play with her iPad it just doing with a 16 year old supposed to do I never had that opportunity I never had an opportunity to build a girl it's overrated because it was awesome shit right now you know every song I wish I was seven again I was retarded when I was seven I'd be playing with Mutant Ninja Turtles and pretend pretending helicopters are real or plastic helicopters that's stupid that's stupid shit I'm glad no you're not you know you don't know I still your daughter Charlie fucking be dropped kicking the shit out that old need to get y'all ass away from here you ain't get no pussy mother fuck this cat what is it about a guy that would want to do that that's what's fucked up ain't like but you were talking about like the whole patterns you know ink your family falls into a pattern I bet they're in this my mama my my learned cuz I'm writing a one-woman show for my for my life and I learned that my daddy got my mama young like that mmm my mama had six kids by the time she was 22 so it's just passing it down yeah it's so common that that happens on both sides you know I mean maybe maybe you're a husband or the man who gave got you pregnant maybe like in his that isn't that my fucking husband the dude baby day whatever he was at the time he was never your husband in 82 point I know he was married oh that's Wow well whoever he is I got Facebook friends bet huh I bet you know in his life I bet that was probably common to you know I bet that kind of fucked-up behavior was well yeah yeah because I mean if you look at it is child molestation for sure so to me he's a fucking molester you know we learned later we did all the shit but I mean to fuck a 12 year old 22 and show up at the hospital and sign both kids birth certificate nobody questioned your own Laius that's that is the most gross shit out of all of these I cannot look at Mikey's birth certificate it because on there I'm 14 and he's 22 and my daughter went to get her birth certificate cuz she was going on the cruise and she was like oh my god look this is nasty I was like bitch put that away I didn't say bitch but I was like wow yeah it's a sickness it has to be this it's and it's a sickness of the mind and apparently when someone when it gets done to them it's more likely that they're gonna do it to somebody else yeah and you know he never thought he did anything wrong cuz I X and I was like you know I'm in my 40s now you actually took my childhood and he was like your mind and body wasn't 12 what the fuck are you talking about my mind anybody cuz I had a big booty that was around and my titties set up like apples oh I had a cum fucked me sign on my forehead well that's his way of excusing his behavior he got horny when he was around you so he felt like your body and mind but you know when you describe it see how was a man supposed to decipher that if he's a dumb dude at 22 you know he's not gonna decide for that now he just wants to fuck yeah that's the problem and though it's such an overwhelming urge unless you have someone around you constantly imparting morals and ethics and growing you the right way we grow up like animals we have instincts you know yes animal instincts horny instincts they overcome any idea of guilt or remorse or and so that's his way of rational you know rationalizing it like your body and mind weren't 14 well my body truly was finest fuck I'm not excusing him but I'm assuming he's a dumb dude right he's dumb as fuck he worked at jiffy lubes now nothing wrong with people working at Jiffy Lube but I hear you it's just it's it's hard to get your shit together you know but you getting your shit together in your situation that's more impressive than anybody any normal person in any other situation because your situation sounds so fucking crazy that for you to go full circle from that to be in a working professional comedian paying taxes the whole deal I'm out and on top of that the most important thing seeing your kids grow up in a completely different way completely I tell my kids all the time you don't know how fucking get you average especially my second my second to buy my husband you know we live in the suburbs and they don't know she they don't hear gunfire I never had to put drugs and they pampers and called a dope and sell drugs in front of their schools I never had to do none of that shit to them so I was like you don't know how fucking good you got it yeah a lot of people don't you know that's what that the old expression you know that or the old thought rather that one day there's gonna come a point in time when the apocalypse comes and then civilization is gonna crumble apocalypse is already here it's just not in your neighborhood like there's spots in the world we can go to right now where you might as well be in Mad Max right there's how about Liberia you hear this shit man they're fuckin closing the borders of Liberia because Ebola is breaking out and people had it they escaped from the hospital these fucking people escaped from quarantine Jesus Christ they don't know where they're going it's a city of a million people wasn't there somebody here in Los Angeles that just xscape from the hospital also with some kind of really contagious disease and they were like here's a warrant for his arrest right now because he just left the hospital did he take the Kirwin on that was that movie the strain I think you were probably stoned in your water stream that FX show have you seen the strain no good fucking show man I read the book and I didn't like it I liked it for three-quarters of the way but the last quarter was kind of wack and I decided that that's not enough you know three-chord is really good and then 1/4 the book sucks I can't recommend it but as a show it's awesome it's really cool that's just I think that's what they were meant and they meant to do when they made this tray in the first place they meant to make it as a miniseries and they wrote it as a book but that that's how it takes place it takes place that they're a disease there's a quarantine and these people get out and then then everyone's fucked I don't like to get out of me but I'm just going listen to you we're talking about the apocalypse talking about terrible situation why Quentin Sean that's it you were 15 you had your baby with you and you drug deal and all that if you forced some white woman in her for yeah into that situation she would be means our fucking that would be the apocalypse there'll be the apocalypse for her I have to sell crack what someone shot my tit off what I can't do this you know I mean that would be just like the apocalypse there'd be no different would be I found it it's act it was actually in North Hollywood it was a guy with tuberculosis tuberculosis is that super contagious if we give bad I think it's something that you like if he starts sneezing this yeah I think they arrested him oh okay yeah but they could treat tuberculosis right that's not scaring me like Ebola Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus which means you bleed you bleed everywhere like you but your eyeballs bleed your fucking skin falls apart like Ebola is rough business that's no joke those hemorrhagic viruses when I did that sci-fi show questions everything the the real issue with it was like the scary on that show was talking about infectious diseases and they were talking about you know everybody's worried that like there'll be some terrorists and then released some anthrax and everybody get fucked they like listen what nature makes the stuff that nature's making that is way scarier than any fucking shit that anybody's cooking up in a lab because at any given point in time nature can make some insane virus that no one can fix at any point in time these two viruses can interact with each other and create some mutant and it can they're constantly changing and growing and they're constantly avoiding the attack by antibiotics and and antiviral drugs so they're strengthening and getting stronger and in finding new trickier ways to get into people's bodies you scare me can we just stay the fuck out of me he scared the fuck out of me one of these dudes was a Russian cat who told me that when the Cold War was going on they had trenches filled with anthrax trenches and I go how many people would that kill he said every person on the planet every single person I said there's enough anthrax to kill every person but he was absolutely no question about it there's enough anthrax that had that could kill everybody what are you talking about how much anthrax is there I don't Lee takes like a little bit to kill you like anthrax is a motherfucker and this idea was that they were gonna figure out some sort of an airborne dispersion method and even the government even tested like there was something I think it was in Cleveland I forget the city but they sprayed some shit over this city like phosphorescent like something that they could track they like essentially what the chemtrail people think is going on you know like they actually did it and they did it from the top of a building they sprayed it or something like that because they were trying to figure out how much of a containment period how much of an area would they have to contain you know if a disease got out that's how goofy people are they were thinking about like actually just it's so indiscriminately just letting a disease go out a dizzy like that was an option like a disease that would kill the entire part not just the soldiers not just the people that were you know the politicians who were causing the war in the first place no the entire population with a virus a virus and make your fucking eyeballs bleed out I think you just scared the shit out of us you know why I think we should scared because look if the world was just us we would work everything out you know yeah I couldn't imagine going to war with you miss Pratt you seem like a very nice person but I don't mean it like that I mean you know I'm saying if there was some if you had a country that you owned that I had a country that I think we could come to some reasonable terms I don't think it would be an issue but when you see shit like what's going on in Israel today you see these you know Israel's got they've got all their military troops there and there everyone's launching rockets and it's just horrifying man you seeing babies that are dead on the beach these photos Anthony Bourdain tweeted some photo the other day it was horrifying like why if that can happen over there that can happen right fucking here I mean it's contained while it's over there and our idea is that well if it's out of there if it's out of our mind but that shit's going on right now in 2014 and it could just as easily happen in New York or in Pittsburgh or anywhere anywhere just pick a city London that can happen in London crazy shit can go down like that any part of the world if you've got enough people that disagree and they're highly armed and they have religious ideas attached to what they're doing you got a terrifying situation that's how we're living right now in 2014 I saw the worst video over the weekend on Facebook for some reason Facebook has the worst videos now people are posting on their lines but one is this Israeli family that captured a child from Palestine and kid was probably like 5 or 6 and they're teaching their daughter who is Jewish I guess or whatever israelian I to beat the kid with a bat and so the kids like crap please stop you know this look five-year-old and this little six-year-olds hitting it with a bat and she wouldn't she didn't want to hit it hard you know she's just barely hitting it and this other kid that's a little order comes up no but there's no hate um and just like starts punching this little kid in the face because the kids bouncing yeah yeah they like captured somebody and they're just beating this kid up like the whole family like the kids everyone oh can we go back to the ghetto Eddie Bravo and I we watched that movie once what is that fucking movie is a Brazilian movie about the the ghetto Oh children of God city of God yes City of God City of God it's all fucking crazy move you ever seen it no god damn this Pat you gotta see City of God it's incredible it's really really really fucking good but it's all about the favelas of Brazil and how the violence there is just on a completely different level first of all these houses are essentially like a lot of them are almost like they're camping out like they don't have windows then I'm running water they have dirt floors and some of them you know there's like some of them they can range in you know like ghetto - incredibly poor like essentially you live in the woods and you just have like a shelter around it's not much different than that and these young kid drug dealers just unbelievably violent and ruthless the whole movies just like soukra more people die in the first five minutes of that movie than the entire boys in the hood damn yeah like quickly like more people die maybe in the first five minutes it's a but it's a good fucking movie - and it's based on a real scenario if you you go to the ghettos of Brazil like some of the worst poor neighborhoods where there's a lot of drug violence that was what they were scared of when it came to the World Cup you know that's really some horrifying shit can't be going down there that's happening right now so I use always somebody's got it worse that's how fucked up people are this just a huge range of what we're capable of you know so when people see fucked up shit that's going on in the news and they try to pretend it's not happening right now because it's on the other side of the world that's like yeah well if it's possible right now somewhere it's possible here you know just a bunch of things would have to go wrong and it could be just as possible here well let's hope it don't make it here we just gotta figure out a way to get better people to lead the world it's that simple it's really that simple that is the 100% solution for all of it yeah there's a lot of problems financially there's a lot of problems in this world as far as politically the different sides like like the the argument like you know I'm not a I'm not a Republican by any stretch of the imagination but I believe in some things that they think make sense I'm a big Democrat but I do believe in a lot of stuff that they say yeah well I think the Democrats what I like socially the attitude of the Democrats better I think it's a more progressive attitude as far as caring for people and looking after people and sometimes people point down at that and they say you know the accuse people of facilitating the welfare state and they have all these goofy ideas about like what it is that keeps someone in a bad situation like that that's the number one problem that I have with right-wing people this is pull them up by their bootstraps mentality cuz I'll meet someone like you I'm gonna go what fuckin bootstraps she's a fucking 14 years old and she's got a baby you telling to babies yeah - well another one we 15 you're telling me that she should be pulling herself up by her bootstraps that's fucking crazy I don't know other than what you did though other than what you did personally where you just realized that fucking enough is enough you worked hard you got yourself out of that situation how else you been through it it would if you cut how to engineer the way our society fixes this problem that we have with it so you gotta what me I had to somebody had to make we realized there was a problem which when I got married I met him when I met my husband he was like people don't live like this and I was like what do you mean people don't live like this he's like people go out and get a job people don't take from other people people don't sell drugs so I had to be taught that from my husband that's crazy you know and I'm here I am 1:19 I think at the time and I had to go get a job how do you go how do you go into society and get a fucking minimum-wage job when you used to making $10,000 a day as you know when you 16 and 17 years old $10,000 a day yes I had a fucking trap out of this world I mean I don't want to call a trap I don't know what they call it now because I've been going from the ghetto too long but back then it was called a trap so when you're selling drugs like your neighborhoods attracted yeah you stand on the corner that's your a trap if that's why you start the crackheads or the junkies to calm then that's why they came and everybody knew rabbit was on fast rate Oh rabbit was on fast treat that's her trap a thirst trap we need to start call our shows traps oh yeah we do a trap this weekend the ice house no use that term anymore cuz I don't know what you do to sell drugs anymore if they didn't use it on the wire people haven't heard it no that was desperate because it was I think the wire was a little after I study said probably written by white people too but you know what that show fucking husband I love this show and I was like he was like you gotta see this show and when I saw I don't want to see that flash shit I don't want to relive that crap yeah and I got into night you know watching the whole fucking I'll love it and he was like how real is it cuz my husband come from a background where mama go to church every day any day to go to work every day and it was 16 with them but they wasn't on welfare and daddy and Mama provided for them where I didn't have that life you're not hooked right you know his mama and play that shit you weren't selling drugs you wouldn't run in the street you was going to school Wow so you know so did he like when when he met you and you said nobody lives like this did he offer suggestions or do you just take you by the hand listen bitch we're gonna straighten this shit pretty much he was just like you know he I think he was he was attracted cuz I was a go-getter cuz I was I was I was coming out of selling drugs go people had you know the crack epidemic was forging checks so I was I was into that shit really heavy he was like you heard me give all over fuckin know these people Bank of America and check number his high you know he's like you can't do this shit and he just talked to me and I would listen I remember I had a lot of drugs one day and he was like I like you and I want to date you he said but I can't take you home and my mom as a drug dealer and your name is rabbit so I'm thinking this is an opportunity for my kids to have a daddy and he got all his back teeth any can read and his shoes clean and he don't punch a bitch in the eye every Friday ching ching I had to have him that's hilarious Wow so I went for that so I gave my niece who I taught how to sell drugs all of my drugs so she did she work for you or did you see her the business what she was young when I got her she was like maybe ten and they will haul the drugs for me over the years so I you know I told her how to do it and she became a drug deal when did she start selling drugs for you she it was probably 11 oh my god we was all fuckin kids cuz they mom was on crack mm-hmm this is my this is my baby daddy's sister their mom was on crack so I took them me Here I am she think they're 11 and I'm fuckin 15 they thinking I'm grown ain't growing off shit so now I got my two kids and her three kids and we live in I'm taking everybody to school cuz I saw drugs in front of my door my door to school this was before the no school no drug school zone signs went up so I was already grandfathered in when that she got there that's a really serious federal federal offense right if you sell drug yeah hose to a school yeah but I was already growing them size wasn't not making those days so I would drop everybody off at school and everybody when they got out they knew what to do with the drugs right wow that is crazy so you just had a whole system going I had a whole system going so when you decided you meet your husband you say you know what all right this dude's great I'm gonna listen to him I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to keep this work and I'll just have her take care of this does she are you telling what to do is she an employee I just give it so I say you can have the whole trap I'm gonna give this dude a chance and it was weird because I had no more money I couldn't ride around in my flashy Cadillac anymore yeah because I hadn't learned his license and what alone is like you need a fucking kid you need a licensed driver so our high a crackhead for a day different crack is hey you got a driver's license in the car I'm gonna supply you a you know crack every hour I just need the police pull pull out your fucking license so I can drive with my learner's like it that's not I learn how to drive a crack it taught me how to drive that is crazy so you're driving crackheads around just so that you could drive they that enabled you to do your business yes to drop off dope pick up no would think the crackheads would go this chick is fucking 15 and she just ran shit they was they was scared of me how did you have your shit together like that at 15 we live you know what my husband tell me he said it it has a lot to do with my granddaddy my granddaddy used to sell buuut he was a bootleg look I mean bootleg liquor bootleg house whatever you call it so he said I never saw anybody work in my family everybody hustle so I guess I got those skills from him it makes sense if you grew up seeing something like that I think that's how people are supposed to live and everybody thought I was grown Joe nobody knew I was fucking 15 I mean I had two kids and other kids selling drugs for me and everybody was like yes ma'am no ma'am and one day they was like how old are you and I said six days like you fucking 16 I had like eight cars a learner's wife who's completed crack yes they were hey baby hey rabbit you want me to drive for you you were right in the car and I would just apply them rocks and they smoked the rock when I'm riding around with Run DMC and whoever was out at the time you know Invo pumping my visa are they smoking crack because I needed a licensed driver in the car is so crazy no how old were you when you got popped um you know what I had a police officer beer he said he said I know you selling crack bitch he said but I'm not gonna lock you up until you seventeen cuz when this crack first hit the black community everybody went to jail at 18 you went to juvenile at 17 but people just go down there yo your kids get caught with a fuckin half a key of cocaine and you can get them right out of juvenile cuz they didn't really know how to handle the situation so they changed the age from 18 and 17 yo let's go to jail at 17 in Georgia so I had a birthday April the second that fucker had me in jail April of feel free to seek some shit like that I had a cousin that in the morning everybody went to school they set up my cousin so my cousin I would drop or I'll say hey sell this and I be right back on part of the car so crackhead was like rabbit the police is up up on the hill on the ground laying down before I could make it back to pick up my cousin she was like 15 he went down there and fucking arrested her and took her to where she hid the drugs at and so he it shouldn't weren't for me so I couldn't say with know yet being on the heel taking pictures all day I mean all morning so that's how I got my first drug charge so how long did you go away for oh I didn't go away then I got probation and then I got popped again and then I went I was in jail a year so when you got probation did you have any like idea of like okay I could get caught for this really easy business no I was like fucking I thought I was fucking Al Capone I was untouchable I have money it's like fuck you I'll be out in no time and back then when you first went to jail like I told you they used to give you buns but they stopped giving you buns so I remember I needed I had to have a bun here so I had to pay for the judge in Atlanta to have fucking dancers and he gave me a $2,500 bond and I was out they have no answers what do you mean Paisley is holes you know what who the judge you paid for the judges prostitutes hos there was there was having a party okay so my lawyer was like you gotta put in a few extra money he's gonna give you a bond but you got to put in a few extra money so I put in extra money pay for the holes and they gave me a twenty five thousand dollar bond I cut my friend frog who I was selling drugs with at the time cuz we was partners like come fuckin give me so the judge went and took your money and got prostitutes yeah that's hilarious ad but that's what the lawyer you know that's what lawyer said yeah verify that that's one of those things they like people would know about there's a judge that everybody was cricket Baghdad oh my god crooked that's that's a bad position to put a person in do you remember the judges name was a judge Matthews no judges oh yeah there's something about being a judge and I think it's an unhealthy position I don't think anybody should have that kind of power or someone like to decide to send someone to jail to not send someone to jail send someone to jail for 30 days or 90 days or I just don't I just think that that kind of power I think there should be rules most certainly but I think that kind of power bestowed upon a person to make that sort of a decision their own discretion is just it's too much it's too much responsibility you can't trust someone to be totally ethical and not fucking crazy and people change too they get more crazy as they get older and they get more crazy with ego you know yeah people get nutty there's a lot of nutty people they get a little bit of attention and then they just fucking go off the deep end go off the deep end believe their own bullshit and if you're a judge everyone's kissing your ass all day all day but you wear the robes you come in the Honourable they fucking everybody has to rise when you come into the room what kind of shit is that everybody else has to stand up because you're here and they call you the Honorable get the fuck out of here there was a guy they busted recently was using a penis pump while he was while he was presiding over cases he had on his part this is walking he's pop up his penis I'm sitting there talking to people and under meet the table he's jerking himself off with a giant tube and a pump like what are you doing man and the foot went flat just a guy is just a guy no one deserves to be a judge no one you can't be a judge you can't be the king either by the way can't be a president that shit was for dumb people that didn't know any better we in 2014 with the information that we have today we needed Google all we need is let people vote on shit okay let the entire country vote on every goddamn thing that gets done ever you can't have one person that has any over oversight or power over everybody else anything you know I mean I don't know how you would do it as far as like cases as far as like prosecuting people I don't know how you would do it without a judge but it's got to be a better you ever been to jail no it's a horrible thing the food is horrible when I was a little kid and they closed the cell and they leave you in there for about five seconds San Francisco so every time I go he's like you want to visit a cat ray I was like look you dumb fuck you don't act a convicted felon do they want to give volunteering visa fucking old jail no I don't wanna visit Alcatraz I've been to jail before I know what it looked like there's something also about people to go to jail it's a lot like people that have been to war or people that have gotten over some a very traumatic event is that they have a certain kind of strength there's a certain kind of strength that a person has when they they're the people that decide like I am fucking never going back there like well yeah some people like I got some brothers that been in and out of jail are they fucking like some people like going back my brother-in-law's do for me when I miss my daughter going to kindergarten I'm doing a year in jail that totally fucked me up and I you know my meet by me having that lifestyle not really nothing that I chose but what I went through I did not have a bond with my daughter Joe for years and I don't I don't know if you have any kids but when you have a kid that deeply probably hates you for the life that you chose you know to help her she didn't realize I was doing this shit so I could make better for you you know me missing school and meet me missing her go to Kitty gun and you know me selling drugs and hurting people me my daughter did not have a fucking mind for a long long time so when I brought my husband into her life she immediately bond with him but I was always the bad person Wow well she probably looked at him as like the savior he was a savior he wasn't said she has a bun out of his work now we talk every day and you know another thing is when I went to prison then I I got out and I really fucking hate him and I hate to say this that's your punk ass so fucking be hope you don't take it the wrong way I hate it game women I don't know I could deal with gay means but I saw so much other than shit in jail now I've never been with a woman nobody fuck with me cuz I filed out of time but I just hated this shit and then when it when it came into my life my daughter is gay I was like oh fuck how stupid am I you can't deal you can't judge people on asexuality so all doing my when I was raising my daughter oh she always ended up getting a gay fucking Chilean coach and I hated this bitch and my daughter no I hated gay women's so what my daughter was gay so that's another thing that did not allow her to bond with me because she knew my hatred for gay women wow that's intense oh shit so would answer me this weekend what do you think it is about the black community that shuns gay people or shuns like gay marriage because that was like a big issue in California here they had Proposition 8 prop 8 is that what it is the Bible it's religion yeah you know black people believe no matter what they believe it's a god you know we're going to heaven or hell that's just how we talk and I think a lot of that shit come from because our ancestors were slaves and it just I think it just rolled on through the genes but we believe so that's what it is yes but it seems it's sold in this town 2014 you know it seems so discriminatory when you see that people are born gay well you know Java gay daughter did I'm very supportive and I don't feel that away and it's almost like I'm a white doing his door though to bring home a awake a white goddaughter bring home a black dude I mean you either gonna get over a fucking jump off of a bridge and realize that you the person that has the problem not them and that's what I had to realize you know because these bitches will put in jail and I didn't like them well these are not these are not that gay people who my daughter is bringing over so now is very fuckin supporter whatever makes my daughter happy plus you gotta remember Here I am 15 years old getting fucking dogged out by her daddy beat on shot on fuckin knocked around cheated on you know she just saw so fucking much that I think turn you know fuckin like fuck me and some niggas ain't right yeah so I think that there was this part of the issue too she said she was born gay I say in my fucking room bitch the archer saw you was not licking anything so I mean do I know I don't know if she was born gay but she's gay and I supported her decision to be gay that's my firstborn and I love the hell out of her you know like when she first came out cuz she when she went to college she left town because she knew how much I hated gay women's and I ain't seen my own fuckin child for three years I would try to contact her she was out in the rural been homeless and I was like what is your fucking problem what is your problem I said if you get just say you gay she said I'm gas but can you come home bitch cuz I mean she been three fucking years so and now we talk every day we talk and I love the hell out my daughter she got him I got a wonderful daughter-in-law they looked just like she look like Paula Paula no but I've seen her so you know I'm a supportive mom now I mean I love my daughter I love my kids to death I have four of them you know and we talked about the shit that I taking her thing from putting the drugs in their underwear - you know me dropping out of school she was there with it but she must feel different about you now shit I'm not fucking around and she's mine I mean because she did something that I never had an opportunity to she didn't get pregnant in high school she didn't I mean she didn't she you know she went on and graduated fine when she graduated Joe I said I fucking made it I thought it was nothing that you could've killed me that day cuz you know why none of my cousin kids graduated nobody else my fucking Ashley is walking down this aisle I made it I couldn't stop crying and she's like what are you crying I was like if only you knew what I did to get you to this point you broke a fucking cycle that has been going on in my family for three generations I didn't even cry like that when I took her to college but boy when she graduated high school I pick up that diploma once a week and say bitch we lady and a high school diploma bullshit about it equal to my GED yeah today right yeah even a college diploma it's so hard you hear stories about people getting out of college and looking for a job now it's like it's so confusing it is I mean it's hard I tell my kids on time I made more money you could probably ever do doing shit that you really want to do cuz when you go to college you going for you know you don't really know what the fuck you wanna do you want to go and get high and fuck the first year that's all my god my daughter went to college and I you know what I pay for her tuition the whole three years she was there that's because you were not struggle do you know she went to college and ate pussy on my dime she ain't pussy on my time like crazy she's trying to find herself yes it's somebody else yourself losing back teeth and shit I'm like you got to stop eating pussy you got a blue shit you lose your back teeth when you eat bad pussy joke what defines bad I don't know I can call my daughter one faction oh no watch your gums I don't know wait you know that is crazy wow that's a hilarious story it's gotta be a nice thing to be where you're at now though yes I'm happy how many been doing stand-up 11 years I've been married 23 Wow so so 11 years ago this this person at the welfare office tells you should do stand-up so what do you do from there I go home and I told my husband I'm funny he's like can you sit down and be quiet so I said I'm gonna go to open mic he was like don't pay my husband not the type he's not gonna say don't do it either whatever because I was in the process he musta husband some ego from a drug dealer to forging checks to fucking I got a little vending service at the Georgia done when Michael Vick first became our our quarterback so I'm making a ton of my money with inner-city kids with a nonprofit organization so he's telling me go from that and then all of a sudden you want to be a stander he's like how many time are you gonna change your career I said I'm telling find myself so I get my girlfriend which is a long story short my baby's daddy baby mama lived around the corner for me this is a chickie show up at the hospital after I give birth to his first child so he we became best friends I swear we still we raised the kids as cousins because she had a baby bottom too so I get her and I was like this case workers say I'm funny let's go to open like and I go up there Joe and I fucking killed and I'm first time I told I told a story about my brother was a UH profession a cat burglar but he was fat so he kicked this lady doing one time he's like freeze bitch I'm the FBI give me a TV in your VCR so he fear and not to go cuz he broke at houses everyday and that was my first joke that's hilarious and so when you did that did you write any shit out or you just I didn't know cuz I grew up in I started in an urban womb so I started to follow the arbitrary I suck dick I eat booty you know how other black people do the shit you seen Def Jam so I was like I look up and I got that drug-dealing mentality I was like well I'm not sticking out I'm doing everything these motherfuckers doing and I was like it's gotta be something better here I'm not gonna make you $50 a week they say how to dope gang work cuz I everything is like the dope gain to me it must elevate right and so when my husband got a transfer to it was either Detroit st. Louis or Indianapolis and I was like you're not gonna kill my kids in those other cities and he chose I wanted to go to Texas so he chose Indianapolis so I walking out with his uh I walk into a mainstream club at the time which was more these and I got this urban flair and it's like not here bitches we don't do roaches jokes so if forces jokes yeah roaches you know how you see a black me yeah you ever had a roach drink out your kool-aid oh I get it you know in India then you got the jokes about the government cheese and shit so when I move to Indianapolis things like you can't do that shit here you know nobody gonna have fuckin roaches what the fuck are you talking about so it forced me to open up to my life that I had which was way more interesting wow so you were trying to just do what everybody else was doing and then going to this white neighborhood go into the white neighborhood when we moved fuck me up it fucked me cuz I never been you know like an every club did more D's in a nap in yeah yeah and and it was a little black owner at the time well he's in jail for bank robbery last year with no girls you just showed him all 32 of his cavities get up whoo and I got

better off without it you better off he'll be coming you and now yeah getting famous you could handle it better yes so when I got to Indianapolis shit change I moved to a white neighborhood and I just started to work on myself so do you write like material or do you always talk about your life like I write like stuff about being mayor kids most of my stuff is personal so I you know where everybody gets it you know my life you know been a drug dealer I talk a lot about my mom who was an alcoholic mom who used to give me the worst advice like she would say shit like reach for the stars and I hope you hit the Sun and burn up so I I told my whole other day my mom was so fucking stupid she was I'm not gonna say she was stupid she didn't know shit like she couldn't read so she will force me to read her horoscope but what she didn't know I couldn't read either so I would just make up shit every day I made a bullshit bullshit and she went forward like I was saying cuz she was shoot at us like she told her 22 pills stir because she was my mama was a very small lady so she walked around at 22 pills she's carried it everywhere oh yeah we're like we wouldn't watch this pop out why some god damn dishes we shoot it into the ceiling yes and when it rained it showed so when it rained water would come dripping through the holes that she left by shooting the news why don't fuck the ceiling leak cuz bitch you don't put 22 of them holes in his ceiling what the fuck are you talking about Wow yeah that's a way to motivate kids though and we get out of her way out of her shit it on she never pointed out oh she left but I'll just shoot a light out Wow so damn but we got used to like oh mama with this bullshit did she ever shoot at you and she shot at me one time I was on the phone with my baby daddy I was on the phone my baby that she's like get the fuck out the phone so my mom was like pre handicapped because we live in the project and the security-guard fucking body slammed and

you would be watching the TV and she would tell you to move she'll blow the motherfuck out if you didn't move really any time she shoot the TV just once because we can't afford a novel it's only two wanting it for the keys and one for her how much material do you think like I would say if you're gonna become a big-name stand-up comedian you're gonna have to put out a bunch of specials right so if you put out how many specials can you do on your life before you have to start talking about other shit probably four or five four five specials cuz you know what a lot of stuff that I remember like even so at a time like I can laugh at an ambu-bag dad it was pain so I didn't get on drugs like my sister did I didn't my brother Tim got on drugs to deal with bullshit that we was going through I just say you know sober and thought these motherfucker was crazy so to get rid of the pain I just kept putting it in the back of my head I didn't want to remember it so when I became a comic all of

up I have my crip walk a fuck seems like one more level I mean not everything went I saw is nothing that I did not see as a kid money murder fuck yeah I tell you before I tell you about my son more murder when I was a drug dealer that's when I really saw murder but I had a guy that lived in our backyard well we lived some part minutes and this is when heroin and she came out very popular in the black community so my next-door neighbor used to shoot up but my mama used to shoot up too but it was diabetic medication so I would walk out there this y'all walk outside one day on the back porch and I'm sitting there so he shooter what I thought was diabetic medication he get butt-ass naked y'all run over to me bend over he's like rabbit get the rent out of my ass so I'm looking up this dude asked for right and I'm like jay-bez no ready the diabetes fucking up I was like the red is hanging in the front so he thought he got nichkhun every weekend there's nobody said shit you were telling him was his diabetes medicine well that's what I thought it was but it was it was heroin I learned we learned later that he was shooting arrow so it when he got naked on Friday well like Jay badge is high he'd be all right there's only one day he got naked no he got naked every time he shot drugs how many days a week did he shoot drugs shit two three so two or three days a week he was naked on some people care some people can't like when he wasn't you know he was a fucking he was all engineer for a living an engineer like he designed things yes that's what he did for a living he got a hair on it engineer like running a train no not like that he designed shit he was like fucking corporate America he was a shit but he came to the ghetto and got high and take off he felt so embarrassed once his high came down Wow and people would just let Jay Bell walk around naked I wonder if that's like his way of releasing all the stress of keeping all wrapped up tightened in corporate America no he's a she I think he thinks stuff was crawling on him- Dee Dee's ass and we blow Jay Bell just naked he just ask I before we moved in these boobs before we moved in this set apartments I will go to the wrestling match every week when we moved in this will set up apartments I stopped going cuz it was nothing to see people fighting you know motherfuckers like they're acting a fool it was more interesting set on my back porch and it was real wow that is crazy that has got to be so bizarre be that young you gotta pull one guy's legs apart no big fuck that no other guy that's running around naked and he's on heroin that was the norm when you in that situation nothing else seems what you doing the right shit is out of place what I'm doing this is what I'm used to you that's the weird thing about human beings they're very adaptable you know that's what they're saying about people that live in any country watch tribal people and you know why don't these people don't have any TVs they don't have any electricity like they don't even know what that is like this is normal to them you see people in those villages they find in the Amazon and they don't have any contact with human beings we feel bad for them but what are they doing they're just being people being people that figured out how to live there you know and you were a person who figured out how to live in your your wild world Wow Wow that was a wild world I mean it might as well just been the wild of the Amazon or the wild of the forest or the wild of the city it's just wild there's varying degrees right yes this there's places where shit is just wild and where you were living craziness so once you make a movie about your life like you should that's what you should do you should write a movie be all the best stories completely totally factual completely totally accurate insane that would be a fucking chaotic movie yeah 15 year old girl 15 year old girl you're at it shot off while she's holding her baby and dealing drugs and this guy's running around naked he's got a rabbit up his ass diabetes medicine oh that's nothing let me tell you more story so when I I was about probably but like I said I was about ten I left it's not a really nice figure so I learned you had a nice figure I was fucking third grade honestly Tina are you sure yes Jim I know so how do you know I remember everybody used to say I was fine and I didn't know what fine was Wow when I turn I tell you this story so I'm buddy 1011 so sometime I could just walk away from home nobody gave a fuck so I go downtown to the local Hilton Hotel because I said I want to go see what white people doing you know rich white people cuz I thought everybody stayed at the Hilton was rich you know and plus I went in there because we'd have no fucking a/c so I was standing in front of the door when it does open the a/c hit me my fucking face so I'm standing at the phone booth one day in this white man say hey you wanna come go to my room me I'm like huh and he thought like like he's jacking his dick and I was like okay honestly I go to his room jump and he had me jack his dick and I jacked his white man dick and he paid me $100 I'm like are you gonna fucking be here tomorrow so I'm thinking this is my first job I go home and tell my mom I got a job downtown jack and white being dicks for $100 you told her that yes you wanted to go to ghetto for Jack and dick you might get some oatmeal cookies you go get our damn bunch of dollars oh my god oh my god oh my god you at the time 11:11 you told your mother you got a job jacking off white men's dicks for $100 and she wants to go with you yeah that might be the craziest fuckin story I said they're not hiring to fuckin oh yeah forty that she wasn't really cute it's funny do you have to qualify that the 14th but she was cute as well she wasn't cute at all you know but you mean once you only have four teeth it's like what is really cute your tongue something about being toothless is not that appealing to us wow that is so crazy your mom wanted to go with you yeah when I was look was where we saw all this go what cities Atlanta it without it really started in a Buble this is when I knew she was fucked or like on Friday my grandfather customers was fall asleep and why they were sleep my mama would make me rob them and for every person that I robbed I got five dollars per person and I probably was seven or eight I remember that shit like yesterday and I told I said you taking advantage of me I should be making more money it's all cool extra for Tiffany's thing because I've been watching Sesame Street but neither one of us knew what the fuck to for 10 percent of the robberies have you watching Sesame Street yeah oh you didn't know what it was I was like it's $10 so she gave me $10 for every wallet that I stole and I fucking would get up on Saturday morning and play pac-man to the fucking Sun go down I only did it because I wanted to play pac-man it's incredible yeah what a crazy inviting us and then getting past that and looking back on it like when you were say asking does but this really happen or am I crazy like how does that feel now when you tell these stories you you be in this normal person now you know as normal as you can be having children that are doing great living in the suburbs staying calm like this this has got to feel like another life right it is another life yeah I used to hurt me like it used to like I would cry when this shit come up and I was like I'm not you know I have I have this whole thing in life and shit gonna get me down and I learned that from a fourth grade teacher because you know I used to go to school I'll just stinking kid I was a poor kid but I had a teacher named is true that would tell me Patricia get here earlier and I will bring you clean clothes and I will comb your hair so we were in the bathroom one day and she just was combing my hair and she said I want you to remember that you can be anything in the world you wanna be all you got to do is believe and I later just died this year and I when I did time in prison any time I got it low anytime I wanted to question something that I was trying to do in life I went back to miss truth cuz she to me she was the first person to ever believe in me and I'm 42 years old and I still fucking quote me is true that's crazy isn't it amazing I'm one person like that can have an impact to think of those two people's impacts the one lady who told you you were funny and then that lady the caseworkers my gun momma now so every day yeah she must be blown away by see when I got more in dealt with the stores like you know after I tell you all the story they probably take a month you know people call me can you tell me this story one more time and a lot of time never my meal shit how many do you write these down do write them down you just confident you gonna remember them all I do remember my mouth well it's like the six that you working on like now I talks about my mom and my egg and I talked about being married so I really don't need to Uncle Jack and II you know right now I tell that story later on in life on stage I talk about being a drug-dealing them you know just to basic just stretching the surface right you know cuz I'm not a star so it's only so much you can put out there before you make you fuckin audience cry uh-huh so you know when you when you become Chris Rock they'll take anything from you but I'm gonna miss Pat fucking nobody I gotta give it to him easy and you gotta remember I'm a fuckin black woman talking to a white audience most of my fans are white water I have no fucking idea I appreciate y'all to the fullness hey I love the fucking I don't give a fuck if you had one I thank you for supporting me what do you think it is about the audience being all white like how'd that happen I don't know honestly I don't I did a radio show called Bob and Tom in Indianapolis that's why I got a lot of them from and they just started coming I mean I will go into that mainstream club you know mostly white people and I would tell these stories and people be like wow and I still help people be like want to cry I was like get the fuck away from me I'm not fuckin crying over this shit I'm over it wow so it's just because they don't have anything like that in their life and you think people like to know that you overcame mmm you know I could be on crack like my sister my sister been smoking crack from day one she been on drugs all her life and I think that's how she dealt with her pain a fucking molestation and all that bullshit that we went through his kids she'll never admit it because she haven't faced up to the problem yet but with me I just packed the shit in the back of my head so I think I think when I tell my stories people at home going through whatever they're going through and it was like fuck I thought my problem was big hell no this bitch had to pull a crippled uncle's leg back in here come stick his dick in at 8:00 so you realize your life ain't as bad as you I think after you hear my story like fuck I had good pants it's the feel-good story here I can't even imagine so you start 11 years ago you start telling this on stage and when when you first start doing it what you doing it you do an open mic nights and when I started talking about my life about six years ago when I moved to Indianapolis so six years ago yeah so the five years before that you were doing all black clubs yeah all Atlanta mm-hm and so then you were you were more like everyone else around you just trying to like do whatever everybody else did try to get laughs yeah so moving to Indianapolis is that when you started getting paid work or you getting paid work before that um I started getting paid working in Annapolis I became I became a comedian I was bullshitting the whole first time and my husband used to always say nobody want to hear that chicken shit on stage and I didn't know what he was talking about he's like it's not funny I mean he wouldn't say it to hurt my feelings but he said he wouldn't he wouldn't support it he never would come see me he's like that ain't funny you know anybody could talk why are you gonna talk about your bedroom on stage and I said oh you just fucking hate but when I became Miss Pat who I am today with my life he's more supportive like when I say I'm gonna do Joe Rogan Park case he was like here's my credit card but be folks like I'm not giving you no money that I'll tell on fucking roast jokes so it makes a difference like he only seen me once but yes once I can't Williams when I open for Katt Williams here fighting them out that's the only time he's ever seen you because you know what he said I was never funny to him I was always serious he said people just laughed at what I said they thought what I was trying to be funny but I was just being me Wow so for him it wasn't funny no because you know what when I did Bob and Tom and I talked about being my baby daddy shot me a hit another do shot me in a titty his his co-workers listeners you shot your wife to do he's like that was a fucking abuse questions about me he would escape my dude that was not fucking me that was a do before me oh I was so broken before I met this dude is your nipple like together still or is it just like gone no no is there it's a little damaged but it's there the other piece in its store right you said you're saying no what I was saying when I do my mammogram and they smashed my boob you can see the the gun D what does it call the gun the fragment oh my mallet fragments yes Wow no spots and they look like breasts council but they know it's not breasts council so they have on my chart and my mammogram off is been shot in the right t they're missing nipple they say titty on your mammogram well whatever booth yeah if you start calling the titty you might want to where's your fucking certificate most cool they always titties Joe always yeah that's a good name for him I got no problem with that what do you call them titties are great okay I have a friend who says my friend steve says titties for things that are good he's like we're going on a titties camping trip I say tits like that's tits or the tits yeah boobs I don't have boobs I got TD mushy dang he's like balls and I have to put grease up on them so they slide across my stomach easily so they don't fucking create friction and make a sword really I got real shit job we were talking about your husband before the podcast started about he became a vegan well yes ton of weight lost some pounds that's crazy yeah he says health was going down I mean knees and shit hurt and everything and he just said I'm not eating this shit anymore well if you're a hundred pounds overweight just imagine that guy he might be God carrying uh extra hundred pounds like just everywhere you go you have to put 100 pounds of your shoulders like everything will start breaking after a while that's what most people are doing that are hundred pounds overweight they just don't think about it right yeah so he got a shit together became a vegan and eaten meat in two years wow that's crazy and did you would you stick food in his face like smell this bitch don't bother my husband is so fucking strong-minded this motherfucker going on a 40-day water just / water I was like oh you like looking crazy we can't live on just water he drops so much weight just on water and went to work every day that's crazy you're not supposed to do that that's what I told I think this stupid fucker on phone face on YouTube that told me can live off water I was like look at your fucking titties they're fucking just go you need to eat something 40 days 40 days of noe to drink juice nothing he didn't even brush his fucking teeth he breasts away water supplement or some kind of no you did water well let's see how many days do you think it says online I'm not saying his story's not true but if you can call me you know I believe him but I'm saying how many days I did do you think it says online that you could only drink water before you died I did a 10 day water lemon fast where I couldn't no we didn't do no lemon he didn't how many days I would say you could live to be thirty days with just water and maybe some stuff but I think it's 21 you be dead like the last two weeks I think that's like this isn't that the the story behind drunken and afraid are they and not drunken and afraid naked and afraid don't they don't they say that like it's 21 days is the day okay let's find out can you live off only water go to Yahoo Answers it says the average person kid depending upon your body fat the average person go from a week to one month or so without food so this guy went 40 days he like probably hit the boundaries he was so she was shaking so bad and I was like can you please fucking me how you just gonna down me I don't even know what a policy it is so crazy you had to do some kind of supplement okay there's a hunger strike Wikipedia page apparently you could live as many as 74 days that's the longest a person's ever gone with just having water oh my god hunger strikers dying after 52 to 74 days so 74 is a big one that's ridiculous yeah Gandhi Gandhi apparently went through a bunch of hunger strikes when he was a I didn't know Gandhi was all alive so young uh-oh so long ago it was 1922 only way I can go on a hunger strike if they shut down all the chick-fil-a do you mad on Sunday why does chick-fil-a have to be so religious they can't do well by that time I don't fucking soak all of that crap into my body so much I love chick-fil-a so much I made my son get his first job there so we can get a discount it was um there's there's certain people that are that are famous hunger strikers apparently a guy who fasted to death his name is boy tribe pronouncing this J atin das das Jatin das maybe it was a hundred and sixteenth day of his fast they gave up their hunger strike surpassing the 97 day world record for hunger strikes which was led by an Irish revolutionary so apparently you can fuckin do that you can not eat for 40 days like your husband did he's crazy though like he was probably on death's door I know he was so fuckin wee and he went to work and worked at my husband build the transmission for Allison Transmission that's a crazy way to decide to lose weight I mean he just wanted to cleanse his body yourself but you know his skin turns so pretty I thought that his kids skin changed yeah it became super smoothing how many days in to his family cuz I you know I travel I try to travel at the time I was traveling a lot so you know I come home and I was like goddamn you losing a lot of weight dude they're not fighting on the fucking water I was like you need to fucking eat yeah but did he ever get to a point where you were worried about him falling asleep no not really falling asleep driving I was worried about him fucking he was always cold so I was like you call you back to die what the fuck you gonna leave me here with each other I gotta do gate oh wow so then when after forty days he starts eating he starts eating and what did he eat he he started to like fruit he went into fruit first just real gentle yeah that's gotta be a big shock to your system yeah that's what he said he don't want to shock his system he doesn't shit all the time he don't go that long anymore you might go 20 days 15 days oh really mm-hm I've heard of people doing like six days of juice that's told me to call him and ask no i blissing I'm not questioning I'm saying I don't know anybody's ever done that that's a very extreme dude he just liked that when he said when he just I tell you he used to smoke cigarettes and nobody knows this and he just stopped and he started back one time when I got arrested he went to court with me when I was getting my life together and I needed my driver's license and they just said you have five thousand dollars or for traffic tikis how you want to paint it and so my husband I can only get five hundred dollars out and one you know during the day that's it he said well you gotta go get some money we're gonna lock her ass up he started by smoking because he never been to jail Wow that's the hardest one probably quitting smoking no he would call Turkey he and after I got out of jail he stopped he didn't gain by the week he always do every fucking thing Kotick Joe I've been trying to lose weight forever I've tried all the nice shit out there Nutrisystem did

fucking out of shape and she still try to wear that sexy shit and I'm like oh no boo-boo take them home short south it's not gonna work you miss your opportunity let my fucking son get you pregnant oh no boo-boo take you take that whole shit off I told you nothing that my son get you pregnant holy shit that's for me there was a thing in the news the other day where ages 18 to 24 are twice as likely to get vaginal surgery than most women I guess it's really popular with the young kids now to get the Barbie cut where they chopped off all the lips and everything so it's just the line you know like lipless pussy it's it's the porn that people are trying to get the morning look you know like the perfect that must be exactly what these kids are crazy no everybody wanted daily lives what is vagina lips called la ba la vela labia lady everybody maybe you only read it and never say icon it yeah what's gonna kiss the stuff that's coming out of it I mean the panning line is down to catch at the Falls but it's gotta like run down the sides meet curtains mm-hmm meet Curtis yeah I don't know I think it is pornography though because you think about like pornography is so it's so bright and visual you know like if you got a camera you if you're having sex with someone you know there's a lot of stuff going on right there's a their faces in your face you're kissing you're touching each other but if you're watching a porn a lot of times they're just showing you like the insertion they're showing you the dick in the vagina they're showing you the body parts are showing you things moving and you're concentrating on like this one particular area and you can decide for whatever reason like that that is that's what you got to focus on like that need to trim up your fucking yard you could clean your hedges so it looks like these videos well you know what jump I got stomachs sitting on my vagina ain't seen a 90 so maybe I don't know what's gonna go down maybe I need some what is it called Batman pussy - good God Almighty yeah I don't think you need it no I don't need a job I mean don't nobody needs that don't do that and plus some guys like it like Jim Norton he's always talking about he loves big pussy lips it drives him crazy that let me get that fixed there's some famous porn star I think her name was Houston she did something with her vagina lips like she sold them or something like that sell you'll agree that yeah there was something crazy I'm trying to remember the story she I think she got surgery then she did something with it she was also one of the first people to ever do a gangbang remember still like the future she was and we saw that she didn't hit all the time we first came out Joe come on I mean in a porn oh oh okay GIMP a one of those giant ones like 500 people like yeah she's like 500 people have seat this is the thing they say it's 500 people but it's really like 60 people and they fuck her a bunch of times they like go through the line and they keep going and you know they act like a new guy I think some of them have actually gone big of her today I'm not into porn I'm not into porn no it was Houston she saw her labia for $50,000 and we just come by to do balm and suck on for skin yeah like like a silky blanket what deal how long will it last $50,000 how long is it good for sit in this freezer somewhere he's probably had it dried out just like eating his like beef jerky beef jerky of a job I need to call my daughter that she might like that is there a photo of said labia no I don't want to see no sub labias I just I just don't understand after picture of a pussy if there's not that's right and it's just reportedly like it's okay so it could be yeah I'm more for the woman's of trying to keep down you know yeah I'm just one of Aegina jacket just I don't understand it's gotta be that it's got to be the porn it's gotta be he's gotta be I mean think about fake breasts fake breasts or so-called you know what the other thing I was at I did k-rock the other day and they brought up Korean women who win the like Miss Korea you know Miss Korea they look exactly the same like pull up pull up there's a video anyway no no this is way crazy cuz it's all about plastic surgery they get a very specific type of look by plastic surgery it's super super super common amongst clothes we all love them but that's what's crazy it doesn't make any sense because they look exactly the same so over the years like so how think of how many look at this plastic surgery blamed for making all Miss Korea contestants look alike look at what these women look like they look exactly the same like you could have photos of any one of them doing something and then tell the police and they'll go to charge for the crime I mean look at what they look like I mean I don't like generalizations you say Oh everybody looks the same well maybe to you you race fuck no those girls look exactly the same and what they're doing is apparently they're going and getting a very specific type of surgery and they shape their face to a very specific way and they do it with their chin and they do it with their eyes and they do it with their noses and when it's all said at least very close really close when it's all said and done there no no no no there's a lot of before and afters this is a real common problem in oh I would say common I wouldn't say a problem rather it's a cultural issue in Korea the plastic surgery has run rampant because if you don't want to have sex with your wife you send one of them over there and when was I mean oh so if you won't want to have sex with your husband exactly just like that just seen your husband jumping you go why did you go out with your boyfriend sit in there and he realizes that extra work done down there no don't no this is not my wife unless he thinks that she had something done but it's just uh it's very strange that they're all adopting this uniform look that's scary to me you know that's the scary uh there's before and after of one you could see look at this you know she looks very actually they should do that joke I like the karate key if you could tell the big the big thing that they're getting is the you know what that what's been quoted is the anime I if you look at the eyes they're very big and but you know there's kind of stretch I don't stress the eyes out they cut the lids they changed the lids they changed this shape of the lid they they go in there and they it's just too much pie slice out pull that bitch together in their eyes like this that's what they do to people when they get older - I know what do - did that has eyes done like to get your eyes done also and you like this it's nothing like seeing a dude looking like an old last woman with plastic surgery Kenny Rogers have you seen him lately it is the creepiest thing ever he's like on a commercial right now anything Kenny Rogers terrifying you know Kenny Rogers is I don't know yeah yeah we'll do you ever see what he looks like now no yeah let me see would recognize him really yeah poor guy he's pretty open about it I think he's had conversations about her talked about I fucked up shit I mean you kind of have to talk about how you fucked up when you look like this because it's it's so obvious well Joan Rivers had a lot of it yeah that's not a bad picture dude in that picture he kind of looks normal but there's yeah that's a bad picture that's a bad picture could get get a good one because there's some good ones that are like really shocking just pull up Kenny Rogers bad plastic surgery and you'll get some good ones I was on the beach the other day and this dude caught a manta ray you know what a manta ray is and he pulls it in from the water and there's it's in Malibu and there's all these rich people that have houses there and they think think it's hell people what to do for whatever reason so the dude had already released the manta he caught it and released it you know they were trying to catch fish and they just caught this manta ray accidentally and so he he's releasing it and this lady comes running cuz this other lady was like you know they're doing this they're torturing that animal they pulled it out of the ocean and this chick comes running to tell them what to do and when I tell you that she looked like a monster like I am not exactly I mean this poor lady I felt bad like she had done so much to herself it was like her face had been so pulled back and the guys are listening our podcast fans the guys who caught the fish so they're probably listening to it right now they they were talking to me before so I assumed if you know who you are what's up nice guys you know regular looking young tattooed up dudes who are out there fishing they caught this big-ass manta ray but this lady came running and when I saw her as she approached them I had a visual I mean a like a vision visible like I felt and tangible like quiver like I saw her I made the visual contact like my eyes hit her face like I just fucked up here did you do and not only that she's in this crazy ass fucking multi-million dollar beach house you know this be those beaches in Malibu or ridiculous and he's also we're cheating with somebody who eyes is not wide open why he sleep he's probably just xanax the fuck out just trying to deal with her and him and own life he's a probably a mess - I don't know who he was or who she was but it was the arrogance of this crazy lady running up these guys she was guys throw it back throw it back thank you you could keep a manta ray and eat it if you wanted to nobody could stop you and it's like you beat look out there that's the ocean like that's a really fucking big it's the idea that you know this guy on the side of these gonna do anything to the population of the manta rays like that's not how animals die they die because of giant nets that they pull amongst these huge boats and they they pulled them out of that's what's over pop overfishing it's not a dude on the rocks pulling something but in her idea was a you know in her mind she was gonna tell this do it demand for yeah but I felt so bad memories are cute they're kind of different they're a unique species i oh yeah they're kind of cool but you know you ever had skate like at a restaurant it's delicious what is skate skate is a manta ray it's a type of Ray that thing name it wasn't that one that was not the one that he caught he got he was like a stingray it had like one I don't know what kind of Ray it was it was cool-looking but he read he let it go immediately he'd already let it go when this lady came running over but she just had such a monster face monster faces so I'm going to take this manta ray and beat the hell out of you if you don't get this beat your face up they called police so fast they probably have I don't know how they do it but you know like this came Rodgers that's a good bad picture of them why you say it's bad the one that eyes eyes and his nose looks like he's high as fuck he might be in California that's not a good one though there's some other ones here it just looks really awful well there's other I've seen a one comparison make this one's a good one to it maybe yeah that's it that's it holy fuck you look great I can't not be no Kenny Rogers this is daddy no it's him they changed the shape of his face and it doesn't make you look better either it just makes you look different and not a good different his eye was wide open you can't shoot that shit in your face either man that thing that everyone's doing with her put filler in their face not just boat but the black girls are putting it in the ass they put a a so many train Ginger's have died I'm serious a little stuff and things there no there was no you haven't heard about it googly they was taking people was telling names giving them but shots but it was putting fucking corn oil Hawking oil and it is me and I know I know so many black girls with fake booties that's a photo with some captions on a field yeah when I shit hard enough ain't nothing make a new one a crowd they can't go in and cut it out no I don't know I don't I wouldn't let nobody shoot no no fucking Home Depot stuff in my booty well some women that had their lips done back in the day are there they were scarred for life there was this poor lady that used to live down the street for me and she had like she talked to you and she had a line like right here from here to here a straight line inside her lips from where she had these artificial lips put in and so when you she would talk to you you would see the scar like the scar on her upper lip was so distracting I was like what did you do just see probably Gannicus takes your place wanted lips like yours which one natural ones couldn't get it I always get compliments on my lips yeah beautiful lips thank you wait a minute what jealous that I have beautifully beautiful white women want they want those plump juicy lips you know white women sometimes they'll go drastic measures and they won't big asses now mm-hmm yeah they're getting them too yeah yeah was a botched botched towards more plastics today I was watching one last night where the woman got the the fake bud and it started to it popped or something like that started going into her leg and her enter and stuff and they couldn't get it out because it started growing with the muscles I start attaching the muscles so they couldn't take it out and so she just decided to get another one put in there and then that one didn't take because there was just a whole kid button plants and then then she could just flip them like she would sit down and would flip upside down and stuff like that lady I thought I don't yeah Facebook I saw that lady she just flip her ass inside out and it was a bad job and I was like as long as the long as the ass is sticking the right way is not a bad it was like a little fly I'll lower your standards ya know it's a bad job if you can flip it around who are you a spokesperson for the surgeon I don't know I maybe when it was turned the right way to ass was nice and curvy when it flipped over like a plate that was upside down and I asked could you imagine what it feels like if you grabbed that thing like you're wrestling with something like your fish is underneath the surface I mean it can't be no different in sucking fate teeth I got a cross buy at a strip club in Dayton Ohio and it felt just like boobs on your butt but it hurts but she got the really big ones the ones that were like the size of basketballs and so it was just like gel she was right very jelly uh yeah she probably went too far yeah that's what happens everybody goes too far it's like some women can get breast jobs and they just get a little little bit of an enlargement and it looks great yeah and then other women get crazy and they get those basketballs put in and you're like they may have back problems and they look stupid and they may look cleavage sag I'm just gonna keep it what I got I'm gonna keep the same man Joe I don't have time to be putting cutting off my lever use knowledge on your skin lips whatever you want to call it because that stuff gonna dry your vagina you're never gonna have wet vagina without having those lips you dumb half is that how it works or the lips like help what helps keeps the moisture is in there moisture in there Monica keep the shit wait I'm learning a lot yes I can't do it I don't want to pull my neck back my eyes back I mean you know you're gonna get old shit is gonna stop working that's why God gave you hand when my husband ain't working I'm on I just unstick his balls and we keep it moving we watch the news and go to bed you know what I think I think that also when people are doing their early adopters you know I'm saying like the people that got the original boob jobs like those they leaked and there's silicone and you know the poor people got sick and remember how many people got like lupus and all these diseases from tit I knew a girl got lupus from her breast job she had a leaky breast job and she got lupus like she was all fucked up her immune system was jacked but now like they have it down where like you know it's very few reactions it's a different feel to it like you were talking about it's like a gummy bear boots yeah they feel like a real breast they feel like like really firm real breasts and I think that in the future and not so far away either they're gonna be able to give you injections that make a woman's breasts grow like they're gonna be able to grow naturally every bracelet you know I think if you if you don't have breasts that shit is probably ready Terry go back down the line you got a bunch of flat breasted us and shit you're supposed to have to you are going I want it breast and my coke Mike the I remember the look girls my name is like if you rub butter on your titties they would grow in your ass they would grow so we went in the frigerator took all my momma butter and we just soaked our chests in butter and so and I think that's why I got titties a day so ladies it don't spin your money at the plastic surgeon just buy some fucking I can't believe it not butter put the two boobs in there and soak them overnight and see if they grow in two weeks I'm not sure if that works I don't know either but look at me I'm rocking a 44 double D grease up on the reason there's apparently there's a lot of people been working at this they've been trying to do this for a long time in this there's a bunch of ways that can kind of help a little bit but then not exactly they're not really ready to grow tits yet but you know what someone brought up the other day that made a lot of sense they were saying they're like when a woman man becomes a woman when he becomes transgender becomes a woman they start taking estrogen shots and a lot of times they grow never depressed they do I got a son who eats too much Mac doughnuts he got nice size 8 cups just on the same note overweight is overweight so they should gain weight and grow tits no it might not work it might work but it might not work what they're saying is that they can give a man injections yeah he starts growing like natural boobs wouldn't they be able to give a woman estrogen and would that make the promise fuckers up because we already produce [Laughter] you come home cooking the cat yeah right yeah you don't want to do that there's a lot of fucking problems apparently with silicone and press implants but particularly the silicone gel can cause connective tissue or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus neurological disorders cancer even new silicone related diseases that didn't exist before breast enhancement surgery so you got nice tits but can't open your hands you could have some serious but this girl was all fucked up that had lupus she was a mess you know like that's a those autoimmune diseases like that like lupus or no joke you know is there any plastic surgery that you would get you know what I think man I think we're so close to them being able to figure out how to do stuff without it like I don't need plastic surgery I'm beautiful perfect as I am but I've had it I had hair transplants when I was younger obviously what happened such as my hair was falling out and I was trying to fight against this no you a shave it should have shaved it maybe shaving your trash that's one way to look at it yeah white people stopped getting hair transplant all you gotta do is go to the hood and get something called a quick weave yes it's a haul what you watching on my here it's a whole head of hair for $50 listen that's not gonna work with me I do Jiu Jitsu you know we don't get they don't get it like this anymore white dudes are not allowed to get weaves it's just too pathetic it's what I go around with the toupee that be shaking in shit and we can take this shake it that off yeah they don't need those shave that I know a guy who works at the Lowe's in my area he got one in this fucking horrible it makes him look like a child molester I mean like look like you killed babies but you take the hug last week I know but I don't like he creeps me out because you know it's nothing like seeing somebody with a bad weave when you wear we right so you have a good one and him having a bad one is offensive to you yeah like when John Travolta wears this beautiful one and he goes in the Academy Awards are you like that's a respectable leave yes I mean it's gotta look good the problem is it's glued to your head not anymore this is sold in Sonia Sonia Sonia Sonia the dudes bald like if he was bald like I have stubble up here but it was all just it was going it was gone the party was over that what happens is they take hair from the back your head and yeah it's never gonna fall out and they move it to the joke was that it's like taking a bunch of really healthy people and you move into a neighborhood where everybody's dying because that's what it's like no they stayed they stuck around they're the new residents that you like they Ronnie yeah yeah they grow but the old hair that used to be there along with the transplants that's that shit all falls out eventually so when you grow hair what do it look like what do you look like no no I mean I have enough hair to grow my hair out not look like I have cancer but it's not it's pretty close it was going it was getting thinner it was a cotton candy year it was getting honey it was more and more and it was annoying is that shave it yeah they do well they do it now they do want what they call single follicle so they take like one hair at a time they'll take it from there and put it up there but the bottom line is you only have so much hair back here and especially if you go full Ronald McDonald like if your hair goes bald like way back to the edge imagine taking that little edge and trying to populate your entire head good luck you don't have enough hair so then they figured out how to clone hair and that's what they're working on now they're working on cloning hair but at the same time they're also working on some other shit like that'll just genetically they'll be able to inject it in your skin and it'll grow hair like crazy they're pretty close to be able to figure that out because it's some sort of a giant multi multi-billion dollar industry dudes losing their hair but if I could give anybody any advice from someone who's already shaved her head shave your fucking he was trying to hold on so like freeing and I don't truly do not give a fuck like it doesn't bother me at all anymore my hair used to fuck with me when I was falling out because I was thinking about shaving it but I wasn't sure if I could you know I need you to just just jump in and do it but once I did it was like oh god yeah once I did it that was like oh this is so much better my husband used to have that kid and play fate you can't that oh my god can you fucking get this goddamn Tico hole on the top of your head let it go and look like a bottle top opener what did you want him to do with it cut the shit off he was losing his hair was thinning and it was like it would grow around the fade but it had a hole in the top so he was good until winner what the fuck you know like he was keeping a little safe on top his head yeah we talked about that poor Jason Alexander decided at like 50 something years old to wear our to pay out of nowhere you don't know Seinfeld the show Seinfeld George from Seinfeld Seinfeld no you know he turned me on to sign for you so they don't want to watch this boring that show then I watched us like just a fucking great show it's a fucking great show yeah we spent many nights watching Safi you know do you know a Richard Pryor story yes I do you know his story like growing up in a brothel you know yeah and your story's like five times more crazy than Richard Pryor really yeah yeah I think so it's pretty close I mean Richard Pryor suck no I didn't turn gay for two weeks I reach a book he turned gay only probably more than two weeks probably more than two weeks I don't know I mean there's a different time to if you stop and think about like what was going on in the 70s think about all the people that have a shit well the brothel right yeah brother grew up it's prostitute house but you you know you look at like allegedly David Bowie and Mick Jagger went gay for a while you know like um what's name from The Who what the fuck's his name not Roger Daltrey the other guy Jamie Townsend Pete Townsend Pete Townsend was gay for a while like even do you think is shit when you in Hollywood there's no more you don't hang out of a Johnny you don't turn it inside out you don't stuck your foot in it kicked across the room you don't bake the pussy you're on the beach you're done banging and pussy you don't you don't set it on fire so you're like well you know what I'm gonna go over and play with this dick and see if I can say thanks to dick not that it gay they're just trying to do something else I think that's what they do I hearing just in Hollywood cuz in the Midwest they just keep the same old bitch with the beard who smoke cigarettes and coke babies on the hills maybe you got a good point yeah I think this for a lot of dudes it probably is that they probably want to just expand their experiences yeah it's like getting fingers put in ass I tell you let me think so I went I did I had to do a hosting for a dildo party I'm not into dildos I don't want to fight you get it how did you get this job they thought I was funny they came to show so they like come host our dildo party they have a dildo party yes and women loves this business they got up traders hey they got big statement you know do you know that they got the news that the date with the suctions on it so you stick it to the toilet and you just have sex with yourself when you finish your inches you rinse it off and put it in the dishwasher whatever funky do it right so I host this dildo party so they give me this little thing and I said well what is this she said go home and spice up your relationship so I was like oh my fuck relationship could use some spices how are you been married for 23 so I was like what would I do this she's like this is bowel dose she said you take this fella you dust his balls and you ball dust but it came with a pink fella so I go home with this bodice and I was like open your leg I got some bowel dust and I pull out this Feltham I was like if you don't get that gay ass get away from my balls participate what if it was black he wouldn't it was a fucking fella it was that families who do what a fuck that you can't bow does you're not putting this is cuz it was pink it would turn him off no I think it was bowed down spearing my husband I gonna do out an extra shit why is pink universally a girl's color I love pink well it's nothing wrong with the color but I mean like yeah this lighter is a pink lighter it's a Hello Kitty lighter so it's definitely lighter that's my lighter exactly so a girl just being silly but this is pink like why is that color like a girl color why is white it's because we rehearsal because when you grew up your mom put you girls in a pink bedroom and bought pink stuff and when you're I was boys were blue colors like there's a terminus sake so when you walk around with an ugly-ass baby that was a girl but look like a boy you put in pink so if he was like oh you little boys cute no she got on pink as a fucking girl even though she look like a boy but how did we figure that out though how do we figure out girl Joe you gotta ask the people who started before Jesus Christ questions I don't know Rosa Park questions not rose apart maybe harriet tubman question i'll fucking know honey they came up with this scene I got a GED let's google it it's good why why does the color pink be associated with women yeah probably cuz he's a soft color because I think yeah it is but isn't white as well white is my favorite color yeah a lot of people like white I have a white car it's for a pretty good when I was little I wanted to be white cuz I watched to leave it to beaver and beaver mama was so fucking supportive mmm I want to dedicate it for my mama she cooked every day he wasn't called bitches he wasn't shot at I like I want this bitch for my mama so I wanted to be white yeah pink they don't know they have no idea they have no idea it's most commonly associated with femininity they don't have any idea why there's a bunch of speculation all different pink was likely associated with boy babies as with girl babies it's a certain point in time it was just associated with babies we had that picture member of was it a which which original it was the theater Roosevelt dressed as a girl it was young yeah they used to yeah pull that picture because it's so bizarre people yeah dudes dress with wigs on back in a day yeah this is when they're babies they dressed him as a baby when was a girl when he was a baby why they just did it do that the next day's a normal high heels were actually made for men and stuff like that like we used to dress that's what I love them now really that's why they love him now think about it you could take a gay man he'd do makeup and hair and dress way better than normal like a regular female has that been Snopes we ever run that's the boy yeah okay okay let's see Roosevelt dressed as a girl debunked you guys vote let's see it wasn't always wow it's true yeah that's true what that the that isn't an actual it's in the Atlantic the the photographs about girls or boys rather dressing up as girls that's totally true he had shoulder length hair and a hat trimmed with a marabou feather but not because he was a gender bender the unexpected childhood look as a reminder that our cultural norms about gender specific clothing for children are a surprisingly recent historical development wow that is interesting man it was 1884 he was two and a half years old and boys wore dresses until age 6 or 7 which was also the time of their first haircut Wow that's so weird Franklin's outfit was considered gender-neutral so that outfit pull that outfit up again that outfit was considered gender-neutral at the time what outfit did the outfit that he was wearing where we think it looks like a girl look at that's that was gender-neutral that was a girl yeah look at his little booty shoot and his his hair they didn't cut your hair except like most style across your face so that you can see where you may be still that's not in the Smithsonian calm also that all this yeah I talked about you really detail mm-hmm yes so that is that detailed I mean for the Google between pink and blue but I'm learning a lot here we do want to mean that's fascinating to me it's fat it's absolutely fascinating to me I was watching Fox News we talked about this before about those women like Fox News no not because I believe it I just cuz it's fascinating I watch it too I love people that are convinced of anything I want to be convinced of god i watch religious shows I like people that convinced there's no God i watch atheist shows I like watching people convince just to study their patterns but watching Fox News is always fascinating to me cuz it's like this weird look into another world that don't ever hang out in you know I don't know these people but these women are so hot and they're they're so laggy there's so much naked legs going on and I was taking it if a man dressed like the hunt TV it would be a fucking it was be a sin like you would that if a guy dressed even remotely like one of those women on television it would be front-page news I'd be like what the fuck is society fallen to so if a man came in with like mail UPS short so I mean really tight yeah but that's not is he short or one thing these women there's no short there's no no answer you have to pull down you just lift their skirt up and start fucking it's right there their vagina is there's a tiny little piece of what I think you signing off here on Fox they say they have tiny little dresses on well that's what make people tune in you flipping through the channel you see a signal holy fuck exactly you know you're gonna stop and you'll care what they're say I mean look at Sarah Palin they think she's fucking hot well she was hotter back in the day she was prettier she's starting to hit the wall yeah but if you thought she was hot when she was running for president like six years ago whatever it was that would be kind of she was kind of hot back then it was a power thing maybe well was a fucking god Bless America sort of a thing son she's first of all she's a rugged outdoorsman lives in Alaska okay woman's been a hunter her whole life and she's kind of pretty you'll see well you know what she would do allegedly they would shoot a caribou and then they would call her for a photo op and she yeah they would she'd get out of her car they'd hand her the gun she'd stand down there over the body they take a photo and she'd hop back in the car and drive off think they'd do it that they would shoot an animal just specifically to make a little hunter I know what a caribou is you know what he carries a deer yeah it's rainbow a reindeer rather I guess they're but oh fuck yeah that's what a caribou is you know they're like when Santa has those reindeer that's those are caribou it's in the deer family caribou didn't come to get oh no no they barely come to Alaska you know they didn't believe reindeers laying on your house if you was getting and somebody showed up it was a fucking sound the clown with a pitbull did you ever teach your kids about Santa Claus or do you just I told I tell you when I moved in my white neighborhood I mean I'm in Walmart one day and my son was talking about getting something for Christmas he was talking my son I was like it ain't no fucking Santa okay just tell me what you wanted I bye so white how old was he at the time he probably was like team so lady a white

chubby white dude just gonna show up and leave tall I've got a fucking chimney I got electrifly place how the fuck you gonna get in my house exactly how the fuck is he gonna get he's gonna get in my house so she's like don't do not tell kids it's not Santa I put up a tree because it's cute yeah it's that funny that you have to like that has to be told that's a lie that we all agree you have to tell children it's Easter Bunny the tooth fairy you would catch I would catch my step daddy now taking my fucking tooth and put five dollars up on there when I wake up my mama wanna borrow five I was so she can get high so I'm like all these teeth you lost and did no fucking to fair come on leave you no money yeah the Tooth Fairy is the weirdest one but is the Easter Bunny the tooth fairy Santa Claus was the other one umm Easter Bunny tooth fairy Santa Claus Secretary's day secretary my mother-in-law won't won't won't celebrate Halloween because she's super Christian and that's the devil's birthday whoa yeah so don't buy messes it's demons and mess and I shut the fuck up okay my Master's demon man well what if it's a mask of like you know I don't pokeo or something it's a demon you shouldn't have you shouldn't like my mother like you should have like you know how people have those fat elephant's and shit on they flow mm-hmm you can't have that because they care is dings hold up um fat Elif on their floor carry demons what you know you know how you going people housing they have those those glass elephants and shit and tigers laying on the floor you big black houses with yeah the black leather cutouts in with the sculpture yeah bet she have those no not we're at my mother-in-law's she say that stuff carries demons she's super saying gulp chairs carry demons what's that I don't know what she get this shit for I read that one that's a tough one like you know someone makes a sculpture like that the eagle sculpture in San Francisco I mean that's like I grew up I grew up in like my mama had a Jesus Pichet every black household had a Jesus Christ and I'm all of the King Picchi you wasn't black if you didn't have no fucking two bitches in your house how come nobody knows who Rosa Parks's nobody knows what she looks like I got this photo of Rosa Parks mug shot up on the wall and everybody thinks that it's a Chinese Asian lady she was I just don't understand I I don't I don't know how that's not a famous person how's that another famous person to see this famous person once you tell me she was but how's it not like recognizable like Martin Luther King recognizable Malcolm X recognizable if you saw a vibration she's probably biracial oh for sure yeah she's definitely biracial he's by the coloration but I don't know just probably better instead of doing that well you could do that but it's hard to zoom in on that yeah there you go that's what Rosa Parks looked like nobody knows so she was she the lady that said no she said fuck this I'm sitting right here boy they fuck nobody asked her to move she look white nobody asks her to move but they say Dexter I think at that time it's like she was the tipping point you know all day imagine when they had whites-only fountains and shit my daddy always talked about this year he passed about three years ago when I brought him to Indianapolis to live with me and my daddy really never lived around white people so and my son all his friends was white so my dad was saying like hey you gotta get Garrett he out there pulling them little cracker kids on his motorcycle and I'm like Danny nobody say this shit anymore he was he had a slave mentality well if you stopped and thought about it for a second like how how recent slavery was it really kind of freaks you out because that was 1865 they made slavery illegal that is not that long no that is not that long ago that is weird that's less than 200 years stop and think about that 1865 that's not that long ago if you lived to be a hundred years if you if you're a hundred years old today okay and that means that in 1914 you were born okay if you were born in 1914 a hundred years before that 1814 slavery is legal as fuck yeah so that's like two generations you know grandfather - father - granted this you know like if you go back like two more generations before that that's not that many people that's like a guy has give a woman gives birth to a child the the child gets raised has children of his own and then maybe a generation maybe maybe maybe and the people that are alive like the the patterns of people that are alive birth to death birth to death there's only three three generations of birth to death and you got me not a guy giving birth you know a woman giving birth to her own child and him giving birth to his own child but a person living from birth to death an expedient person being born birth to death there's only three that's not that long and that was buying people you could just buy them yeah take them you could fuck them you could kill them you could do whatever you wanted there wasn't any laws they were yours they were your property yeah they would just tell you if you beat them to tell you not to beat them as much I don't fucking know I wasn't around but I couldn't imagine yeah could you even imagine can you imagine owning a person in your backyard what's fucked is when you hear this just as much slavery today as there was during during 1865 if you like looked at the world the whole world as far as the numbers what about all these sex slaves she had going on with the younger kids a lot of those kids don't like it well I will say I liked it but I don't think those kids like he would let me go home imagine a justified sex slavery like look look look there's other problems in the world they have an energy problem this global warming yeah yeah that's probably that's how they look at it look you had a bad your mama didn't have shit come on over here suck a few digs let me feed you well you made it work you you you were like a person who was mean you suck is sexually molested if you having sex with a man in his 20s and you're 14 or you were 12 at the time story started you're being sexually molested yeah you made it work but it was good sexually molested it was horrible yeah yeah I shouldn't give him credit for that but it was good unemployed unemployed black man fuck

because I was gonna name myself rabbit but that was too close to my drug-dealing life and so I didn't want to come to the stage rabbit they're just too fuckin blood so I was like what can I call myself and at that time when I started being a comedian I still had them the little vending business at the diamond and all my daughter school classmate works for me so everybody called me miss Pat so I was like what I make people respect me miss pett so I I was like okay the key is naming that's a good one I like this my name is Patricia it's very what's very easy to remember too and it's it's unique to you automatically know I'm black the could be Jaden Asian know you oughta know this pad that could be an agent a crazy asian chick or wears tight leather clothes or gay Asian dude no I've walked up on people like in mainstream when things like who perform in items like miss pett miss Pat gotta be black it's gotta be some Def Jam and I'm standing I'm like no bitch fuck is you talking about white boy with your cat jokes because you go to a mainstream club are you fucking here is cat jokes I'm like one of you fucking white boys rob a bank so you can be more fucking interesting you give that bastard gifted bastards yeah you had like privileged revolution bastards I don't want to hear your cat you don't want a monkey to change your litter box hey come on let's rob a grocery store bitch so we can eat let's do some real life shit what kind of cat jokes are you here is this Indianapolis cat no everywhere I go they can't jump and I don't fucking tell a cat joking from it fucking dries my pajama you need to go on stage of the UCB what the fuck is that that's the hipster club as do dudes wear cardigans and they all have cats everywhere they put no fucking hey I have cute two cats you do I have two cats two dogs and 24 chickens what a fuck do you live in California with chickens I live I gotta tell you my chickens Joe Joe you got a chicken store yeah my mama had one chicken in the backyard she had a lot of them but she eventually killed him out so I'm telling you the truth hoo-wee I when my life was so bad I would go outside every day and just tell this chicken everything you know cuckoo my mom and shooting it was cuckoo I fucking hated my mama so I would talk to this chicken and you know chicken walking around eating shit out girl I really thought he was concerned and was listening to me Howdy's Lee I come home from school and his bitch got my chicken my only friend I was listening to my pain by the neck and getting ready to kill him and the chicken eyes is big and I'm looking at the chicken and he's looking at me and I'm like nigga did you snitch on me and she tell me Mac look and she killed that chicken and she made me eat it Wow well you know that's what a lot of people have chickens for they kill them and eat them I didn't know I made friends with it so I that's why I don't have a chicken for a pit I don't have a dog because I had a dog named pup pup pup pup pup and kukuku and pop ice a lot of fuck out him so when Ronald Reagan got reelected pop up got upset about the election I assume he jumped out the back porch with a change on the neck and fucking hung yourself that's why I won't vote Republican kill my fuckin die hey I almost moved to Canada because of George Bush really I thought about that shit when he read one when he won in 2004 I was like this is this is a crazy place to live I gotta get out of here when he won't be one I was seriously thinking about going to Vancouver and I was on TV at the time I was like I would have been hard for me to move to Canada and still come back and do fear factor but I was like this is not good this is a grin same place to live we got to get out of here I was católica Vince we had to get out of here get all my friends move to Vancouver too I mean they all say they gonna do shit for us but in the end we are gonna get fucked about them they don't go fuck about us they just wanna buy nice meals nice suits and do the fuck they want to do I wonder people don't care about people anymore when I was little Joe you could go to the black church and eat on Sunday for free for years until Rick Ronald Reagan got reelected dick I'm telling you he fucked us up because after that they started charging five for the meal and I haven't been back to the church since five bucks seems reasonable but not when you live well fucking enough in the 80s right no fool Stan was once a month right that's like ten dollars right probably 20 mi Mabel when we didn't even eat fucking four we ate beans every fucking day but don't you think they like times are tough and prices the things are expensive and people that do you really think that people don't care about people anymore no not if you my friend you might fucking free alright are we fucking friends or what we're not fucking free no I mean you said my fucking friend you my friend me and I'll do anything for you I'm not a two-faced type bitch I'm down with you okay so people that say they down with you to get what you got sling some yeah this there's ever you could say that about it is business in this bit this is a cutthroat for this is almost like getting a drive-by in the hood I disagree you know why why are you here then you're here because we want to help you we heard about you this is the business this business right but do have I'm not saying everybody's like this business is going on right now in this room is this business mm-hmm and in this business we're just trying to help you so that's bullshit what are you dis around oh you can find those people this is this is my thoughts on this business yeah you can find those people in this business but you can find those people everywhere you could also find people that are nice yes I really believe people there's more nice people than people give credit for because the negative instances stand out it's like when people talk about like online like commenters on YouTube and shit like that think about what percentage of people that is like everyone's like there's a perfect example that society's doomed go read like I was reading something about Floyd Mayweather the other day Boyd Mayweather took a picture with his new girlfriend and then the fucking comments were so I think that is even when you get on YouTube but you get out and you talk about Beyonce baby hair I was like these people are human like people would say shit to me and I like I did a podcast and I talked about putting drugs in my baby panties and everybody way at the time was tweeting you to get me on so this dude was like why would you want her own Joe Rogan when she put drugs on my baby pan I said hold on bitch I was 15 years old at the time have you thought about where I was in my life at that time I say Plus don't judge me bitch you probably like fucking frozen cucumbers up your ass but nobody's coming over your house trying to pull up frozen cucumbers like your ass I'm not judging you because you're very specific because if he doesn't have frozen I mean we're people people do they write ugly stuff they don't have to deal with you face-to-face yes that's see that's not a normal way to communicate with people you people get a free shot at you like you're Miss Pat you know you're on the internet you're on a video they see it and they can just start talking shit for free and more than one it's not one-on-one like if you were doing that in a room say like I would knock they fucking ass that doesn't happen listen if you in a room like say if you were in a room you're talking to me and then someone who's a youtube commenter was sitting right there and listening to you talk used to say someone who would say something awful about you on YouTube if they were sitting right next to you they wouldn't say they wouldn't shit yeah they wouldn't say shit and if they did say shit they did say something rude you'd be like where the fuck are you coming from why are you coming at me I'm not first of all I'm not talking about you I'm not talking to use doesn't concern you so why you making some sort in their new to have a conversation with that person and they would be shown to be retarded and then it would be done but they could just leave it on YouTube that comment is permanent yes yes this morons statement that's not supposed to happen in nature it's just not when you think about how many people that is though that's a small what percentage of the people comments on YouTube videos is it even what I have a fuck of 1% yeah but what is the number I mean is it 1/10 of 1% is it even that you could just look at the likes and dislikes of every video and that pretty much sums it up yeah likes and dislikes is pretty easy but comments sometimes are interesting sometimes they're engage like we talked about that with Lewis from unbox therapy that sometimes he gets people that are like really knowledgeable they're interesting and they have discussions in the put in the comments but it's the shit like on Floyd Bay where they're talking about his girlfriend's like wow not just jealous hateful and they're also they're they're they're giving in to their situation they're giving in to that this guy is rich and famous and a superstar and successful and I am less I will never be in his position so I want to take free shots yeah I'm gonna throw rock cause they would never say that in his face that's like when they was going around say Come Beyonce baby yeah who the fuck are you to tell the Beyonce that baby is no richer than all you motherfuckers I don't know if that baby want to have nappy hair her parents were not having that baby hair was nappy or whatever you want to call it she still look better than your fucking baby who was born on Medicaid bitch well again if the baby wasn't born on Medicaid your argument is invalid I mean people pick at people they don't realize that you you and you say stuff like that they can hear it well it's just it's stupid it's just a stupid it's a it's it's a it's a situation that's never supposed to happen human beings are supposed to communicate with each other they're not supposed to just communicate and when you just communicate no one's there and you can just say whatever you want there's no repercussions you're in an echo chamber you don't even have the fucking name that you have like you're you're 69 eat me that's your youtube name you know so 69 eat me has all these things that they say and they could say fucked up shit on every video they find online they're not even a real person and they could have 20 of those names they could do whatever they want like that situation doesn't exist in nature but it doesn't mean that people are fucked up it means that there's an avenue for fucked up people to express themselves it didn't exist before and there's evidence of that I had a fat girl one time I was on Bob and Tom and I said some stuff Oh My don't think I'm funny one that uh you know I don't like being facto fat girls like to eat all the time so this lady sent me like all the wrong guys even how dare you talk about the fat girl and why'd you own that clansmen show with them white dude and you did and fat girls are six and she sent me all these fucking coupons then she sent me all these fucking look things for Chlo so

out why did they always wear leopard you look at line brownie master stores they always fuck everything is animal print I think they trying to kill us I don't want a shit I would black okay big girls

about big girls I do everything tygo and animals and zebra zebra paints why is that I don't know why do you think we want to look like a bear or some shit it's like an attempt and appeal the animalistic I don't buy leopard panties I don't think I'm serious don't want to see my big ol ass walk around no leopard panties no leopard bra and then I got stomach hanging over the front of it you don't want to see that shit no no I don't buy like like Valentine's Day look Valentine's Day it always a pink and red leopard lunging the rate lunch array for fat girls I'm not putting myself in that
