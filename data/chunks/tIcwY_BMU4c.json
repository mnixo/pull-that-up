the Joe Rogan experience different things mean this is not news different things mean different things to different people and if you're using it in one context doesn't mean other contexts aren't legitimate that's how art and images work yeah I mean that's almost like what happened with the guy in Montana right so yes his work and then turns into Nazi stuff and all sudden he becomes a knob right do with it with Pepe the Frog cuz that guy who met here yeah he's so upset I know because he's you know they do you know they did to him he had a cartoon where he killed Pepe so all the trolls are like oh that's interesting so they took all his other characters and made them full-blown Nazis so Heinrich who's the wolf instead of having reflections in a sunglasses had the SS they're like oh you want to but you want to throw it out we'll throw down asshole and that's what happened here wolf has a Nazi name already know now they gave him a last name it's like Heinrich something else but that name I'll tell you what I know my god I know no not see what do they call it that's a Nazi wolf yeah I cannot see what maybe they what was that that's hilarious if he thought he could just kill it off that's like deep platforming he Tigers get a D platform Pepe what's also like let's suppose I decide to kill off Paul Bunyan but the fucking how I can't what I mean doesn't mean anything like the idea that he's gonna kill it off and they're gonna awkward killed his name was originally land wolf so they said of his first names Heinrich land wolf and the son Eva pull it up and the glasses well maybe we should have a symmetry here when an wolf as opposed to what skywalk the funny thing is about Pepe was it was always so bland and lame well that before it was adopted as a meme like when you said like feels bad man right like it was like this is so low blood sugar it bothers me but it's also the idea of you're saying that because Nazis are using it you can't use it as feels bad man like right if you're giving it okay symbol yeah they're using this way you can't say oh that's okay it make any sense yeah you can't say something may I go okay yeah I'm Alice if I do that that's white supremacy yeah that's no everybody for years it's a guy had a whole series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay sorry course including me back when I had earrings yeah today's bill cosby doing the okay symbol fucking come on man you guys know this is not that's not what this is just because people are using it and saying it is they're investigating people are investigating people there was a guy who is on television and the other thing is we're at a point now where it's more easy to give the finger just someone than to say okay yeah geez you blur the finger out and nobody cares yeah but if you do that what is he doing listen knees touch it as fingers you can't even do like you're holding a joint cuz that's like a white power giant mic if you like doing that like a roach that's bad that's bad how do you you have to use a roach clip it's a ploy by the roads clip industry it's like we don't want to train in a way that we're gonna have to change our training to try to make up cuz all the damage we've done let's try to avoid the damage from the beginning and I'm it's already too late for me I got seven you know I got six broken ankles season I got roaches again what the hell did you just do your ankle is on what's been program six or seven times broke the arch broke all the medicine surfing all different motorbike surfing snowboarding how did you mess up your hip probably cuz my broke walking on a broken ankle for all those years because each time I broke it I had five or six different breaks and then I would keep going so I would keep walking on it and but I'd means I had to carry the load on my right hip so I think I just wore the cartilage out from offsetting and carrying the load of the broken Lake Jesus so that was but so I mean it's so wasn't like one injury where you hurt your hip it was just slung I just wore it out I just I I said I lived a couple lives with Helen L is that that was only a one life hip and I had three lives in it what does it like having a fake hip insane incredible bionic the things not even in my in my in my brain not even how so it doesn't I doesn't I I don't ever even bring it into consciousness it's an its slicker it's like a mercedes-benz ball joint I mean it's absolutely perfect Wow it's a and and you know I mean I've had ACL I had some nice stuff before that was harder to recover from the hip the hip was I just felt like I got kicked by a horse for a couple months and then after that it was like no brainer jump off a cliff go stand up paddle run I mean I tell you to not do certain things no really no you could like you could just start don't do anything you should do with your real one oh really that's don't doing anything you shouldn't do with your real one yeah absolutely that was the only thing I mean the guide the doctor Penenberg who did mine he did it to a contortionist I guess some contortionist had some blown hips and he did it to the girls still performing and stuff so I don't I think it's I mean this stuff is the technology is amazing and the thing that I I the thing that I would consider if I ever had to do it again is that the atrophy from the the the the initial problem is harder to recover from then you just go in and get in the new one and I think when people push it you know they used to try to push that stuff because they want to wait for the technology got better and they only last 15 years and all that stuff but the atrophy that you try to recover from it's harder to recover from than if you would have gone in and gotten it done when you need when as soon as you needed to have it so the one you have now you have to get it swapped out every 15 years no no no but but in the back wall they do they they don't know how long this new stuff lasts they had some they had some material that that wore out after like that because there's a like a some kind of polyurethane some kind of psychic outer layer well like a cart lit like like a manmade cartilage between the ball joint in the socket and so that stuff wore out in the past but they out and they have this new stuff that that has been in for ten years and a lot of people are already and they've seen zero wear on it so you know you don't know it could be 30 could be you know could be 10 I mean I I was actually uh I stayed conscious in in I was able to stay awake for my hip surgery that because I didn't want to have to recover from the from the yeah really yeah it takes people a month to get the anesthesia out of their system really oh yeah to try to get the anesthesia I mean anesthesia is controlled death there just put you right to the edge of dying and keep you alive I mean anesthesia is some hard stuff on your system to get that stuff out of your organs you got to do like a full detox cleanse it's not just like oh yeah anesthesia you know Sicario that movie cigar oh yeah yeah those people are looking at that movie so a lot of the followers suspicious of that vinicio total having an mp5 I was the only Mexican rocking an mp5 submachine gun down there right so it's like you know what did you think of those movies horrible horrible unrealistic you know they should if somebody doesn't hire me I'll do it for free just you know I'll consult for free on that I'll make it look a bit more closer to what it is but it's the main thing is how how I everybody saw that movie and that that's how they would you know that's that's the reality you know how fiction is kind of a basis for reality so Sicario to comes out and it's basically the United States declaring the cartels a terrorist organization you know and I saw that and I was like hmm usually fiction kind of week it kind of has a way of influencing reality further on the line you know that Denzel Washington movie called siege were the budget terrorists attacked New York and then militarized New York and that's kind of like a president for 9/11 mm-hmm so you'd see Sicario too and then you know we're gonna terrorists Trump now says they're gonna just thinking about declaring the cartels as a terrorist organization that's pretty interesting mainly because realistically Mexico has been calling them terrorists forever yeah what did you think about that about Trump doing that do you think that actually is something that can happen if you're gonna militarize efforts against it not just considered a law enforcement type situation I think people should be afraid down there if you do go that route but just realize that's gonna be open warfare not in a foreign country across the ocean that's gonna be right next to your border yeah where people can walk across yes or make things happen down there that will affect you up here yeah in a very real way you know and it'll get ugly before it gets better you know III hopefully it doesn't you know but that's realistic but if that doesn't happen if they don't treat it as a terrorist organization and try to have some sort of impact on it what could be done I mean I think I think culturally they're trying to get us ready for that you know mmm I don't know I mean I think that's what's that's what's happening you see a lot of the cross you know borders US military assets training Mexican Marines down there and having a open relationship with them you see that and that the push is to maybe you know preparing for something you know I think they're preparing for something you know what what could that be I don't know so the what we get about it publicly is just a small sliver of the actual conversations that are being had yeah and and also there's a lot of you know misdirection there's a lot of misdirection I'm personally yeah the first bit we did was an accident Cheech got locked outside the the mixdown room that we were a in La Brea you know Charlie Chapman studio and it was a little courtyard them where the Sun was beating down was like noon and it was hot and sheets as a method actor and you had a put on all the costumes you know they could get into character so he's got all these costumes on he knocks on the door and I was working the tape recorder night and when he knocked that I looked up at the door and I didn't see if the needle moved or not and it's when he not I didn't answer and then he knocked again and I saw the needle moved and so I said who isn't and I was supposed to just open the door and let him in and so there's a pause it's a meme there you go it's me Let Me In come on man so then since that word Dave's not here came from so I waited he'd knocked again you know long pause the pause oh is it and he was getting there come on man it's me I think the cops are you can hope no you know they went into character then then I'll just wait wait wait ace waiting for me to open the door then he'd knocked again and then it finally goes it's me Dave man Dave that's a David Nicholls yeah I go DEP's not here he blew it kicking the doors screaming open the door you almost punched me and but I said listen listen listen we are being played it back in and then Lou heard it we recorded it not as funny but we recorded it in next day it was all over America Cheech and Chong was born yeah and then you're like oh I don't I don't really want this did you see Gaffigan and Neal Brennan no dude no way Gaffigan lit Neal Brennan on fire and shit on his embers no for what Neal started it why Neal started it I'm gonna I'm gonna send it to Jamie I'm gonna send it to Jamie so it's a sober October text message group and listen I love Neal when someone gets roasted someone gets roasted and it's even better because he started it he started it for no no no I tried to be snarky here Jamie I'm setting this to you right now Jim Gaffigan is a mom I'm a monster fantastic young man Sylvain two three your buddy Oh amazing oh I saw that man he was van Helsing wasn't really oh my god is amazing great I love those movies a lot they're fun I love when my son gets into that stuff the fucking animation

yeah as a parent I'm good man to watch the despicable knees oh yeah all three of them are great but I love like three with the 80 soundtrack it's not the Creator from South Park and isn't there another one with just the fucking yellow dudes the minions yeah it's good - that's good - yeah I saw that one a little long Jordana gets a little weird when they get to London but very good yeah

special I made them all for you and he says Neil says which one has the joke about food you say like a food and then you talk about it and I'd be over here dying and then Gaffigan says Neil it's the special where I have three microphones one microphone is four jokes that pretend I can't remember that I read off a card one mic is for emotional manipulation of the audience and one microphone is for mentioning the Chappelle's Show and celebrity friends boom that's like oh that's like one of those bombs it goes off in the distance you just hear boom and we're just like this with got a little frisky frisky [Applause]
