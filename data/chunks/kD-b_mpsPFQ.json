want today one was herpes No Easy's Jamie thinks I love take these back these are yours you keep him and he came back and brought me the right size he exists first he brought me the wrong what's wrong with them let me see him if you were Brendan Schaub they're the perfect thing because they're in this looks like something from the 90s yeah like some kind of shoe from the 90s now what level of outrage would there be if I started wearing these to run the mountains what if they were really comfortable and you liked them what's going on so you think that if I put them on I would all of a sudden love them and I would get it those are stree maybe are those for the street does he have like a bird heel where you have like a extra hook in the back of the heel yeah why is it go like a normal heel like here's a normal right is the boost it's the style of shoe it's the bottom that's what the adidas is it the style or is it the shape is it the style or is it the feel that you really like the feel but well both honestly both but these were really comfortable shoes the boost is super comfortable is this a adidas made shoe is that Oh Saudi just makes yeah and there's no adidas logo on there so it's hard to tell that you're starting to like something start the warm-up well weird how they have this like military-style number yet thing on the side like some fucking Korean missile quit is there I couldn't tell you what it stands for I've seen there multiple things that could just be supply there could be a comma could be an acronym for some money yeah they look like they're from the nineties enjoy them thank you sir what why an accordion like what is are you a monkey no the guy who has the accordion the monkey dance the monkey dances and I love the sound of the accordion and I just I saw it and I just wanted to bring something to the new studio I like how you have a lot of weird shit here mm-hmm and this is weird that somebody loved this sound so much that they decided let's make an instrument out of it yeah are there like real complicated ones of those like do people play them and orchestras and shit no I don't think they made it into the orchestra so it's never been like a really respected piece of musical instrument designer Co New Orleans buckwheat zydeco you're that sure yeah yeah Zamfir master of the pan flute of course what happened in that poor bastard like he had a whole marketing team behind they like dude no one's done this we're gonna do this master the pan flute DVD CDs VHS tapes we're gonna sell it all there's literally no competition there's nothing you can do that your Zamfir he's the Tony Hawk of the pan flute right give me some volume on this guy look at the chest hair change the world 20 million records [Laughter] [Music] not only news magnets he looks like a guy that works in the deli that is a very forgettable sound it's a recorder it's for like wouldn't the one things you learn when you're in fourth grade and they teach you music yeah that goofy like I never I never paid attention to the recorder because they gave me the recorder and I go how come I don't see this in bands yeah the pluck out of here I'm not gonna spend some time learning an instrument that no one plays you had to carry in your sock they didn't even have cases good yeah get old tube sock from your dad and put it in there yes right no case for the fucking recorder now yet to put in your dad's sock and it didn't make any sense either that it was oh he's got it but he plays a flute right well it said pan flute when I talked to Dan but oh well he's a bad motherfucker yeah Jethro Tull's he's he looks like he lives in a hollowed-out tree on the trail Oh has anybody else figured out how to use the flute in rock and roll music besides jethro tull uh yeah it's been some flute there's been but not like him right now where it's now it's hard of a lead we're like a band will come along and they'll just figure out how to do something and no one's figured out yeah yeah exactly no we're gonna do this yeah we're just gonna throw a flute in the mix should we get a flute I was uh I was doing this show last weekend and this guy had an oboe he was like the the in San Francisco he's one of the like the oboist in the world he's playing this instruments very melancholy just beautiful but it really was occurring to me like why who built this who thought this sound was so important when that they decided we're gonna make an instrument so we can recreate this feeling in this for all those instruments in this if you gave me a pen and a paper and told me to draw an oboe I'd be fucked yeah oh it's not what I thought it was I want to think and I'm thinking of a trombone I'm thinking of a thing but it's definitely not that way bigger yes okay pull it up and see what the oboe is straight oh it looks like a flute yeah it's straight it looks almost like a clarinet oh yeah clarinet that's what I'm thinking not a flute that looks more clarinet which is pretty badass Oh oboe and pop that's in Waterworld not the movie right that's not water world's a terrible moving water world's a terrible movie but they have a damn good themed show it's very good it's really good but it's amazing it's like nobody watched that fucking movie it was a gigantic flop yeah but still in 2018 they put on a jamming live show kicks ass Waterworld so everybody's like what the fuck is based on this is some sort of dystopian world where like everybody is drowning right yeah the waters risen to the top of everything and these baddies and good people and and then the stunt people that are risking their lives is explosions of fire wheel flying jet skis I want to see what's great we got fucking drenched by the way if you go to see this good seats don't go during a cold day it doesn't matter good or bad seats man that shit goes up into the 15/16 throws look at that it's a good production value it's great because it's it's like a play but it's fun to watch yes it's very enjoyable that's all Kevin Costner had to do was just do this to make a gigantic movie that movie was a I had some friends that worked on it there were stunt people oh yeah and they were just talking about the amount of money that like whenever you filming anything involving water like your everything is insanely expensive right the cameras here it's all underwater brings water it's wet everything's wet it's like it was crazy and it sucked oh it did suck I tried to watch it actually yeah fucking terrible movie it's like the Seas of risen and they got a land either if they live on this boat yeah but like he's in like a fight for his life and shit he's gonna fuckin cigar in his mouth and they lows movies yeah and they have weird like comedic guys and then Dennis Hopper is kind of looks cool but it's kind of weird yeah see like these guys are about to shoot him and he's got a cigar in his mouth like look everybody's dirty but it's wet out it's like dirty stinky bitch just there's water everywhere that's a great point rip off of Mad Max max the dystopian Mad Max movie was made to be dirty fucking plagiarist see he's fighting for his life and he's gonna cigar his mouth spit the cigar out you cunt you're gonna get shot Jesus Christ I did like that boat though that was a pretty cool boat that he could control the whole thing yeah it's kind of it's bad but it's not nearly as bad as the postman the post Mosman was another dystopian movie that was a colossal failure starring Kevin Costner like Kevin Costner who I'm not I'm not shitting on Kevin Costner I'm a huge Kevin Costner fan I love that guy but he was in a couple of stinkers that kind of shit tanked him for a long time the postman from 1997 is one of the worst movies so bad that I will get high and watch it occasionally just for the fucking yuk have you never has even seen this one oh yeah in the phone's commuter Ribisi whatever yeah whatever GBC yeah you get kicked in the head there and in this movie like who is he Kevin Costner has to deliver the letters it's like this big thing in the future there's no post office anymore so he's got to be like the postman but they're trying to kill him look they're gonna fucking get him he's got a run across the bridge he's like I've gotta mail what are you doing the fuck you doing with these letters I'm gonna bring them important we communicate it's not because of Dances with Wolves was so good and they tried to like redo it no this is nothing like Dances with Wolves get them back in the woods I think this is based on a novel if I remember correctly see if that movie the postman is based on a novel I think it's based on a science fiction future fiction novel if I remember correctly I never even heard of that movie oh it's so bad okay yeah so yeah it's it's about I think it might be like post nuclear war or something who's trying to stop him people don't like mail 2014 there was 2019 yeah oh really the original one was 2019 Wow next year flying cars so yeah that's so well we might make it known fast the thing is whatever does happen will happen so fast we'll wish for something like Blade Runner where there's some sort of intermediate world where the technology and the people coexist because we're just gonna be yeah we plugged into it like the matrix it's just gonna be slow and then all of a sudden it's gonna be just if if you go back to 1994 which is essentially when most people started logging onto you've got mail yeah that's 24 years ago okay that's not a long time that's a tiny brief little moment in human history and in 24 years the world's radically changed the way it gets information completely completely right yeah now go 24 years from now it's probably gonna be accelerated tenfold from that point like the moment artificial intelligence happens the moment autonomous cars start happening the moment the boring company actually has tunnels going through the bottom of LA yeah all of its gonna be fucking bananas I had a guy from Tesla energy at my house yesterday and they bought Solar City so it's no longer this solar company there now Tesla energy Tesla energy is now the car the trucks the batteries the powerwall generators and the solar and this this guy comes in like he's from the future well he is dressed like a future guy in this like black fitted thing he's kind of like those shoes but in white and he just kind of comes in he's really sharp and like really clear and just goes through the thing it's probably adderall and the thing is that they're gonna put solar on the roof and then you have your power wall you're still connected to the grid because you've got to yeah they have to for political reasons but their whole thing they want to create Tesla neighborhoods when everybody starts feeding off of each other they're just completely autonomous Tesla neighborhoods that's a good point what you just said though about that it's politically motivated the reason why they have to stay on the grid it's the only reason it's the only really don't need it yeah but in order to get things passed mm-hmm they can like have that big battery in your in your house they wouldn't let that happen unless because that really would mean that you're completely cut off and the publisher is like no that's not happening isn't that crazy because that's a more efficient way to do it you're getting the power from the Sun it's cleaner it's better for everybody and yet there's still like no now we want to keep these jobs keep the system we want to slow down progress you know we don't want everybody have to radically readjust yeah and they and the costs are for energy just going up so quickly that in like three years what you pay in Southern California is almost gonna double so it's three years really yeah yeah Wow because there's a they have to reach benchmarks by 2020 did you see what Tesla did in Puerto Rico no what did you I remember him saying he was going to do this and then there was no news coverage about it but their whole infrastructure was wiped out during the hurricane like completely that old archaic electric shot he had all these power walls they're giant batteries about the size of the flag mm-hmm and they just store all of this energy like a year's worth of energy you can store and they were about to be shipped to customers here in the US who bought them who want them in their house you know his backup generators basically they were supposed to ship in January they're not shipping now until April because he decided these people in Puerto Rico need energy took all of those power walls ship them to Puerto Rico and has built this new infrastructure for Puerto Rico hospitals are running on Tesla schools are running on Tesla neighborhoods are running on it and it was this quiet little story like nobody this is a kick-ass company that went in and literally is saving this island listen fuck Oprah we need I'm tired of people saying Oprah the last couple of days have been hell for me I love Oprah don't get me wrong I think she's a wonderful woman I think she's a powerful force of good but you ain't no Eli but she also brought us dr. oz and the secret we have to remember what this lady has done she has to be held accountable I forgive her but I mean cut the shit the secret is a particularly egregious offence why you don't you just oh you don't believe you don't believe I want to be rich I just am rich I imagine myself flying I can fly I will beat my wings until I take off what's up yeah it was one of the more just confuse a disturbing but it was confusing when that was taking hold with people when I had friends that were telling me that the secret is real and they imagined they were going to fulfill these childhood dreams that they had had yeah about whatever being a fucking astronaut whatever whatever it would be there's a couple people that I knew they were trying to tell me that the secret was going to be the thing and that they had a vision board and they had photographs they put pictures up of the things like them in front of large crowds and shit yeah oh boy this is so not how it works yeah but there is a kernel of it that works yep positive thinking you wanting something you envisioning it but they that's a little component in just how you live your life it's not just sitting you know wishing it so it's like saying I am going to be a bodybuilder because I drink water yeah it's like no you you you should drink water and it will help you if you want to be a bodybuilder but I've talked to all these body builders and the one thing they have in common is they all drank water and they knew that if they drank water they would be giant they'd be giant huge people it's all you gotta go okay but did they also perform reps to failure did they also take steroids that they also do these exercises squats deadlifts curls you know do they do all that stuff too yes but that but the water why aren't you a believer this is what it's like because they're saying like no these people they believe that they can do these things yeah they have this vision and they focus on this vision and it came to fruition yeah you know what they also did they also busted their fucking ass and got lucky and we're in a business or career that they had some talent in and figured out what that career is and figured out how to navigate the very weird waters of social interaction and skill acquisition and success and failure and that's the big problem is you're dealing with complete yeah sampling bias you're only asking people that are in the mansions Tom papa how did you do it I mean I see you here you have this place it's as big as the White House you have a giant lawn did you did you always know this was gonna be your reality I saw it and I just put it on my vision book obviously it doesn't stick around it didn't it became a fad because all these people well at some point had to take the we're down well and unfortunately some people died because they there was a story I was reading about Oprah unfortunately where this woman had terminal cancer and she she had stage three breast cancer and just decided that through the secret she was going to imagine herself a healthy person and you know she eventually went to dying from it because she she didn't get treatment the iae yeah I mean she she stopped traditionally she stopped conventional medical treatment but what part of so how far do you go with positive thinking because I see you as a fella that has goals and I would think positive thinking plays into your life well what does that even mean really like do I think positive I think in a positive way mm-hmm I try to be positive mm-hmm I try but when you're trying to accomplish something whether you're trying to you know get better at something like say if you're playing a game like what if you let's say golf like say take up golf uh-huh and you want to be a really good golfer like you start thinking about golf like how do I get better at golf you have to learn you have to pay attention to instructional videos you have to maybe seek out coaching you have to play some games and lose you have to choke under pressure you have to examine the mental game like what is wrong with my mental process well when I approach a shot what is wrong with this what is wrong and then become obsessed with the the idea of succeeding in that yeah and I think that that can apply to everything so yeah I mean I certainly believe in positive thinking you know this that was like mystic nonsense no that tips over and it discounts all the other stuff that you have to do there's something to the law of attraction in it but it is one component to this gigantic sort of spectrum of factors that have to be taken into consideration when you're trying to succeed at something yeah the positive thinking is one of them yeah but it's also the understanding of how to eliminate laziness how to discipline yourself how to write down goals how to how to make incremental steps towards improvement how to recognize failure is not just the end of all your hard work but in fact the beginning of a new breakthrough because you understand like how to never do this wrong wrong the wrong way again yeah and the consequences of doing things wrong it's like there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of factors in getting better and succeeding at things yeah and it's they boiled it down to the easiest one which is dreaming right right exactly just that's why it's sold but Oprah sold it I mean she was yeah she was one of the big ones managed all in she was fuckin 50 years old at the time I mean this is not a young woman who was selling this how old is Oprah now 75 89 no she just ran a marathon in four hours did she really 67-63 so she ran a marathon yeah so let's let's think of when the secret came out I want to say that was like 2006 six 2004 2006 okay so 12 years ago she was so she was 50 years old how the fuck did you not know when you're 50 years old they're worth a billion dollars that that's not how it works that it's hocus-pocus yeah it's not hocus-pocus yeah and to sell that to people is crazy and that's a book that's sold I think I was reading its soul somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million copies wow that's crazy well you want an easy way you want something that's easy everybody wants you're in trouble you're feeling whatever and they want something to come something come and help me I mean it's where religion comes from it's just please there's that thing inside of us is like I want to believe if I believe is that enough it is a lot like that yeah there was one of trumps spiritual advisors was he's got some spiritual advisors some woman who was telling people to send her money there was a send her money for January there was some sort of some whole article about it but it's basically essentially the same thing it's like the idea is that what is she saying Donald spiritual advisor Paula white suggests people send her their January salary or face consequences from God she's attractive too is interesting is that true I'll give you money how much do you need I don't know if that's a good picture maybe she just looks good when she's screaming yes she looks good but yeah I would love for some really I would love for the day where there's some real powerful spiritual individual who doesn't ask for money well that's it doesn't real power true powerful or spiritual individual it's a huckster I know that's what I mean like it would be so great if some like so you listen to some people like I watched I was doing some gig and there was this black preacher and he was out on stage and he's talking and it was like he's really entertaining yeah he's and he had a couple nice things that he was saying and then please send me your money and if a guy showed up well there is there's plenty of those people on Instagram who don't ask for doubt yeah they're not they're just trying to get okay like Gary Vee for instance Gary V's whole thing is about hustling Gary V's like the anti secret he's an anti the secret in in you look at like what Gary Vee does Gary Vee is all about I was sick for several days I was fighting some cool-ass right yeah I got the flu I got the flu I thought I had it like I left here I'm so I'm diverting let me just get back to this Gary Vee thing okay but what guys I do want to talk colds he sells books yeah yeah but he's not asking for money I mean he's actually and he's actually a guy was he's experienced some success as an entrepreneur and I listen to people how do I say this without impeding mean there's a lot of people that are giving advice online because people react well to it because they're they're giving advice because when they give advice people respond to it and they say this is amazing and they'll like it and they'll they'll give them positive feedback and love but their advice is at least a certain percent of it is just nonsense they're just talking right you're just trying to say things they've heard before or they're trying to somehow or another put together a sentence that sounds like you'll get some likes yeah you know I mean yeah there's a lot believe guys you just gotta surround yourself with positive people to crystally it makes fun of those people in a hilarious way he's great just not just comedians who do it but just people do it right here's the thing sometimes people will say things that that are real yeah are really inspirational yes and that's great too it's just knowing knowing horseshit yes you got a no horseshit yeah a lot of people don't know where the horseshit is this isn't grit is horseshit you see that's the problem Gary Vee is inspirational and motivational I guarantee you there's a lot of people out there that have dumb things in their life that they might not have done because of Gary Vee because he's a hustler because he's really got a lot of energy and he's like just fucking put down your phone you know go out there and get things done sleep an hour less sleep a fucking hour left and I'll just tell you like do this sell that go and it gives you practical advice about how to get started and get things done it's like the opposite of the secret seminars I'm sure Gary does shit like that it sounds like Tony Robbins he just sort of but he's more like I mean Tony Robbins like younger more energetic hustler character Krystal give me some volume hard work it says you can do anything you put your mind to accept most things it's so funny meanwhile he does all those things as well this is from his last special anyone it's really funny the funny thing is Chris actually does work hard I literally well yeah that's that's the kind of yeah I mean a Kevin Hart now has moved into that realm wow he has so many people listening to him and all of a sudden they just you know he's I love him he's hilarious he's a really good guy I've known for a long time but now he's got so many followers and he has so many people listening that he's starting to do that it's he's not just telling jokes he's doing crunches and telling you you got to believe and and I said to my daughter my daughter was like is he a comedian she asked I think she was telling the thing I said yeah he's really funny this is a different thing I said do you think I could make videos just tell people to live better they would they would like that no well I'm guilty of that too I've done that too but if it's just there's things that you know that you've experienced and that you've done you want people to know about but it's not everything I say the problem was some people take all day you're inspiring people that's all you fucking do right all you do all you do is give out every bus yeah that's it what do you do yeah do you just advise give no that's it there's a thing about there's a thing about Kevin there's a thing about you that you watch somebody they're interesting you like them and they're getting shit done you're like I'll take advice from this guy I'll hear what he has to say there is that element it's when it becomes bullshit bullshit when it becomes no you have to listen to me because I have all the answers right and God talks to me and that kind of stuff well there's songs that there's love songs that you hear that hit you and you go wow like why is that why is that resonate so so much yeah why is that so profound and then there's songs we like shut this stupid talking nonsense down right yeah it's like there's this pop music e plastic hollow empty bullshit that also has a lot of those same words in it right like what is the difference and that millions of people like yeah yeah but they're dumb as fuck well that's it's the same thing you've got all these people that is still buy into the horseshit yeah there is a big herd of people out there that you can if you just start doing if Chris just stopping her convenience start posting videos like that all the time oh he would kick ass he's get followers well if he really wanted to if D'Elia really wanted to be an inspirational guy he's a handsome fella he's got a great voice he's got a lot of energy yeah he's he's you know he's dynamic he could do that yeah he could do something like that if you want yeah Kevin the same thing the thing is though Chris can do other things a lot of these inspirational fucks they really can't do things right I'm not doing anything right they're not producing any great works yeah they're not they're not doing any interesting art they're not creating any interesting music they're not making any funny comedy what they're doing is just trying to like you know there's a lot of people out there that don't think they can do it but you can it's in you it's a flower that must be watered with the love of the dogs and like yeah they are but so their business is not getting money from you necessarily their business is in you paying attention to them and then as you pay attention to them and to their social media their social media page grows and then they can do like speeches at these you have you seen those self-help conferences oh yeah so people go on boats they get they go on a cruise ship the cruise ship is just giving different kinds of advice yes speeches and everyone get in here we're gonna have a session yeah yeah and you know and it does help people that there are people that they do help yes true some of it works I mean if you're if you're lost and you're just you don't know what's going on and you're gonna loser for a while and you take a couple of his tips yeah and you start working and writing shit down and going to have some self-confidence it can help your life but there's some of these guys that all they're doing is just trying to like figure out a way to give people advice when they've never done shit themselves yeah and they're not it's not worth listening to right but yet they're there yeah and they're there but but but is that any worse than an open mic er right is it sorry if someone says what I want to do is I want to become a motivational speaker I want to really help people I want to really touch people but right now I kind of suck at it it's like you don't you don't just start out as Tony Robbins no that's right yeah you're just starting and it's like a trainer it's like a bright a boxing trainers never really want to fight they could just be like an old guy he was just some of those guys most of them in fact or foreign fighters are they yeah it's very rare that someone's a boxing track Yao's guy what Freddie Roach yeah it was a good boxer yeah it was famous professional oh yeah yeah he's got Parkinson's because of it oh really yeah he's got trauma-related Parkinson's disease from his time in the in the ring Angelo Dundee he fought shit what the fuck sustained the Puerto Rican guy Hagler after Camacho Oh Camacho yeah he fought Camacho he fought a lot like big-name guys Wow he he was a big deal like in terms of like journeyman fighters Freddie Freddie Roach was and his brother pepper Roach is also a known guy in the world of boxing yeah Freddie was legit guy oh yeah he was a legit pro so are there trainers that just trained people that they just became trainers yes they definitely have some experience usually they have some amateur fights or they it's very very rare yeah that someone becomes a respected boxing trainer without having any competition experience yeah just doesn't seem to make any sense some of them they realized early on that they're better at coaching than they are competing whether it's because you have physical dynamics or whether it's you know they just don't like getting hit yeah you know they know the limits or some people just are really good at teaching others yeah no that's it that's a weird thing to in the world of jiu-jitsu it's very common because in jiu-jitsu there's a lot of people that get really good at understanding and like one of the guys is gonna be here next week John Danaher is world famous for it yeah he's very famous for being like one of the greatest coaches in jiu-jitsu of all time but as boy as far as I know very little experience in terms of actual competition oh yeah but he's yeah unparalleled again he's like universally regarded as one of the great coaches well that's impressive yeah I got my 12 year old a heavy bag thermos yeah you should he's wrapping her hands he's got gloves teach get some of the teacher how to do it correctly and my buddy Matt's coming over too oh he's a trainer he worked on there Angelo Dundee for a while his own gym my good buddy Monty and he's gonna come a teacher on Thursday that's good yeah it's pretty cool it's a good way to get out aggression too that's why I got it for she would just get angry she'd be doing schoolwork and be like is this bullshit she started like punching pillows once in a while so now we got her a bag you're how much of you is Italian all of its Italian except for my one grandfather was German angry people the Germans are the Italian Thibault yeah Italian yeah these Sicilian is the dominant part there's a little temper their genes yeah fucking feed knuckle sandwich just wants to punch my sister's that way too I stopped dating Italian girls when I was 21 last girl I dated took a swing at me I was like that I'm good yeah did you deserve it nope but it's not coming I was like I was like this is I can't believe this is happening she's actually trying to punch me punch me like I saw her shoulder pull back I'm like there's no way this is actually happening yeah you know says yeah no though I was fighting at the time so I was used to people punching me she's pulling her shoulder back I'm like this can't be really happening I don't believe this is happening oh my god it's happening tuck under it's funny but I think she just wanted attention I don't think she actually I think she's pretty sure that it wasn't gonna land you know that if she threw a punch at me that I was just gonna cuz yeah hurt me she fucking hit me when I wasn't looking you know they don't just look right at you and you motherfucker but then again when people are in the height of some sort of fucking Sicilian love rage right exactly you know what a mess with that yeah that's creamin and the yelling and the throwing things around that's also very East Coast oh yeah I've talked about this ad nauseam but I really believe that that's the echoes of those fucking barbarians that came over on boats from Europe yeah and didn't even know what America looked like no they didn't even have a photo to look at and these fucking cave people nothing pulled up on rafts and started fucking immediately they started baking bread rolling up bread for both of you you brought two you have two lows you're an animal god amongst men there you go this is for you I've never given you the bread I never gave Jamie the bread I'm like he's probably gonna appreciate it how long will this stay good because Sunday's my cheat day Sunday yeah you'll be good worried or should I just pawn my cheat day or move it to today if you keep it in paper it'll we'll have to toast it out though to eat it today is the best way to eat it today or tomorrow actually tomorrow Thursday better yeah why is it better cuz it just came out so it's not good right away it is if you want that warm it is but really it's it gets even better a day after you know that's the case with tuna I did not know that I always thought that if you bought sushi you're supposed to get fresh sushi just pulled out of the water they're gonna slice it up for you right now but know if you go to like a real master sushi maker that sushi sits oh really yeah for how long fucking week sometimes I know just the tuna I watched some documentary on some sushi master oh the hero no wasn't that wasn't guy but that guy that's a great one tips really good I was like somebody what we're talking about his zero is that I say his name hero or zero zero or a hero how do you say it though do you know it's spelled with a J yeah let's say Gero Gero Dreams of Sushi I was like I'm like I'm watch a fucking documentary on a guy makes sushi okay give me some edamame get this started it seemed like some complicated casserole you're putting together you know yeah Wow yeah you watch it okay I'm ignorant this guy's an artist yeah there's way more to this oh my god his whole soul is in it and it comes out yeah amazing this tiny ass little restaurant that's about the size of this room yeah no interest in getting bigger nope no franchising nope just doing this yeah so well yeah the people are gonna are gonna come there's something to that man it's the best it's doing one thing really well oh my god it's the best there's there's definitely something to that there's something to especially like that the mindset of everyday trying to learn how to make that egg dish perfect yeah that one egg dish yeah that one guy said he'd worked on for a year it's crazy a fucking year yeah eggs all just completely doing it over and over and over my bread thing is not like a it's probably like your bow thing the bread thing it's like you do just start to like focus on this one thing and trying to do it well and you just start to get it becomes a part of you you're starting to put yourself into it it's not just making bread it's there it is a practice it is something that for a couple of years I've just kind of gone down that wormhole yeah it's a good thing the wormhole yeah doing that one thing I really I feel like that sometimes with with stand-up it's like we've all these other things that are always going on and pulling us in different directions and stuff and it's like if you could just focus purely on just if that was the only if you weren't taking any phone calls on anything else you weren't podcasting you weren't writing scripts you weren't hearing on whatever like would that make reference like would you be yes and no because I think that we standard requires a certain amount of dedication yeah in a certain amount of time on stage but I think it also requires certain amount of living mm-hmm I think you need to do other things right and although podcasting seems like a job and a distraction one thing it is unquestionably is exploration it's an exploration of ideas right at an unprecedented level yeah like you're you're exploring ideas without looking at your phone without talk just you and I are talking yeah three hours right when does that ever happen in life yeah no it doesn't there's a lot of ideas that I come up with through stand-up or in stand-up that came out of podcasts oh yeah yeah yeah your minds active yeah so I think that again writing similar writings the oh yeah same kind of a thing yeah but I also think doing stuff is important to not just the actual sit down talking part of yeah odd cast but actually going places being active you have to experience things you have to watch documentaries you have to go to a museum you have to go see things you got to go yeah you talk to people we got to go on adventure it's got to go travel yeah it's filling up the well yeah this you have to think of your brain almost like your CrossFit not CrossFit what's that what's that word were you cross-training I guess that's what I'm working for when you're doing a bunch of different kinds of multitasking that will have no no different types of athletic activities that will enhance your sport let's say if you play hockey right you don't just do hockey you also are involved lebackes jumps you're doing a lot of you know sprinting uphill it's a good way to look at it yeah you see these all these things enhance this one activity and it's not just all you have to do is just skate all day and you'll become the best skater yeah well you may be or you could get better at the motions of skating by strengthening your legs with weightlifting I'm writing this and you can accelerate your curve by doing yoga or you could you know yeah I think that that there's something to that with comedy at least for me yeah no I agree I mean when I'm really actively writing other stuff whether it's scripts or whatever my writing for stand-up improves yeah it does yeah yeah and reading by the way reading writing stuff it all feeds the act when you when you then shift your focus over here back to the act you're better because of that stuff but I do sometimes think like the sushi guy like but what if the output was only geared towards that the input I get doing all that stuff but would there be a difference maybe I mean maybe there's something to that we don't know I don't know anybody who does that way though well maybe it taken yeah but Regan plays golf and drinks and does a lot of other shit but it is not creating other art he's not writing scripts he's not he also doesn't write write write he writes like cutting in his head and then goes onstage and works on stuff right yeah yeah which I'm torn on I mean I know it's total it's very effective some people do it amazingly well and that's how they've created incredible works of art but I never give that advice whenever anyone asked me I said you should do both you should write down things and you should write on a computer you should write or however you like to write but you should also fuck around on stage you should do both yeah that's what I think yeah no I do too I can't just show up on stage and hope it's gonna happen well there's some ideas that I've had that I'll like literally like have in my car and then I'll bounce them around by myself a little bit and not having ever written them down I'll go onstage and then it'll just catch fire yeah and it'll become a bit and there's some bits that have made it to specials that I've never even written down yeah I just knew how to do them because I did them a bunch of times and but yeah most of them not though most of them not or at least I always feel like I'll bring an idea up onstage that hasn't been written down yet there's something there you know there's something going on but then I bring it back to the shop and we'll play with it yeah and then then it becomes this back and forth look here's one example this is a bit that I bounced around I was thinking about in the car and then I brought it onto stage in a completed form and it never really changed there's a bit about Bigfoot right I said here's what you don't find when you go looking for Bigfoot black people you're more likely to find Bigfoot than you are black people looking for Bigfoot just fine hordes of unfuckable white dudes out camping no it's not African American pastime that bit came out in the car myself laughs and then it never changed it just became that I don't think I ever wrote it down anywhere you ate it into my 2014 Comedy Central special that's a little gift that's rare those are the rare ones it is rare but man it'd be nice if they were all came that way usually for some reason their one-liners too like that yeah you know it's so funny it's just complete yeah some of them are just they just formed themselves complete yes sir those are best two when you make you laugh yeah like there's things that you've just think in your head yeah that's pretty funny that is a funny thing and then bring it up onstage and it becomes really funny but what it really just truly makes you laugh yeah then you it's such it that's great yeah it is great when there's something just to the point where you just start giggling yeah yeah those are my favorite kind of jokes keep yeah because it's that's what that's why you started making people laugh as a kid in the first place yeah it's just having fun and sometimes as an adult you've got all this other stuff in your head it's like you do have to kind of remind yourself this is fun this is silly shit yeah this should be giggle enjoyable you know yeah it should be yeah it should be sometimes it can be feel like you know because it comes out of writing the other stuff that does come out of writing writing can be a grind writing is insular it's by yourself you're just in there alone doing it's not this joyful place most of the time you're not if you're not writing like but it's not painful see that's a painful but is but it is a practice that is different than just being with your buddies talking about Bigfoot yes you know yeah that's no those are the fun ones right the Bigfoot ones are the ones that come out of nowhere with no effort and they kill yeah it's like got some crazy skateboard II not worried about damaging yeah no writings not painful but there is a thing there is a mental part where you if you're if you ever like put it down for a while and don't do it mm-hm it's like you gotta get your head back into the space of doing it that could be a little pain why is that hard I don't know it is but I don't know what like you've you ever read steven pressfield's book the war of art no it's excellent it's so good that I bought stacks of it and I used to hand it out to people on the podcast oh really yeah because I think most people like when you say it like if someone says like what's the difference between guys who get things done and guys who go don't get things done yeah this sounds so stupid and simple but the people that get things done do things you actually do it they sit down and do it yeah and there's something about the people that don't get things done that stops them from doing that like what is it and Pressfield calls it resistance and what he says is that you have to you have to overcome resistance because that's what professionals do you sit down because you you have affirmed that you are a pro and you sit down and you go over what you are going to do this is what I do right I'm a professional I write write and I'm gonna sit down and I'm going to write and I'm going to summon the muse and the meeting whether the muse is a real thing or not he treats it as it's a real thing yeah and the concept is that you were gonna summon this thing that you call upon to endow you with creativity and doing the work by doing the work right yeah and that overcoming this resistance is the war of art and yeah that's you know and what is the resistance then that's the question for negative thoughts really what's it's not just negative thoughts it's resisting work it's it's not negative in this it's weird there you're like something's post stopping you from succeeding yeah something stopping you from from pushing forward and putting down those ideas you won't be easy you want to just sit on the couch look in my office I have a couch and I have a desk and the couch ace you know nothing is done nothing gets done on the couch really it's it's it's about sitting there there was this great uh quote from this Israeli writer every time I'd say the quote I say I always forget what his name was and I should know it because I used the quote so often but he says that writing and the job of being a writer is the same as being a shopkeeper and it's your job to go and open the shop every day yes and some days nothing happens some day you're just sitting in the shop like an idiot behind the desk and nobody's there and then some days the shop is buzzing with action and activity and people in and out and stuff is happening but all of those days when it's really busy and active does not happen mmm unless you open the shop every day yeah that's such an easy way for my brain to kind of think of it that's a brilliant way of putting it just go and sit down at the place where you do the work and start doing the work he may not be great that's not up to you yeah if it's going to be great it's up to you whether or not you sit down and start work have you ever read Stephen King's on writing yeah that's great that was a good one those are my two go to books yeah when I'm feeling like I need something to recharge and would be a good one to go back to and yeah I read that once like a long time ago and his just thing of you just like what you're saying you just have to do it you just have to he's right I mean there's there's days that I'll go and I'll write four fucking hours and literally get nothing out of it there's nothing there not nothing it's all bullshit then nothing and if you judged yourself by that you go a comma fucking terrible writer and then one day you'll just sit down and then you have your next ten minutes you're like oh boy here I got here I got something here I got sparks yeah because you showed up speaking of sparks did you hear about this fucking bird that they found that starts fires no they found a hawk that picks up burning embers and sticks that are on fire and flies them across rivers and creeks to start the fires on the other side so that it could force game animals to run away Wow brilliant look at this birds of prey are starting fires deliberately man's kites and Falcon no kite with a bird kites and falcons are intentionally dropping smoldering twigs to smoke out mice and insects in Australia Jesus Christ jeez Louise researchers have compiled a study of reports of wild birds spreading fires they believe the birds carry these burning twigs to unburnt parts of the bush the birds drop them in a bid to smoke out Prairie ba bla bla they also smoke three packs a day what does this say researchers said birds Reggie the third force capable of starting bush fires that's incredible this it's clever yeah they're so they're so irresponsible these fuck he got a [Laughter] douche bags did you see that chicken that the researchers created that accidentally somehow or another through when they put it together had the face of a dinosaur have you seen this no yeah well see if you find what I mean it's on my Twitter that they made they made it I don't know what the fucking reddit I briefly read the article I'm like these motherfuckers and I ran away chicken as the face of the fucking dinosaur it's got teeth it's a chicken with the dinosaurs face so who got the dinosaur stuff pull it up who got the dinosaur DNA put it in that oh no gross face of a dinosaur what what I bet now we see earth dude I've been telling people forever because of the fact that I keep chickens now chickens are fucking monsters they have good eggs though they do have good eggs but we have this idea of them as being these cute little you know cuddly little fluffy things that lay eggs and just peck around know they're fucking monsters doesn't you pull up the the the top of the article Jamie go to the top of it and make it larger so I could read it there so it says group of dinosaurs the idea I keep going to understand how one change the other team has been tampering with the molecular process than that make up a beacon chickens by doing so they've managed to create a chicken embryo with a dinosaur like snout and palate similar to that of feathered dinosaurs like Velociraptor they're making Raptors the results are published in the journal evolution the team's aim was to understand how the bird beak evolved because the beak is such a vital part of birds and bird Anatomy it's been crucial for their success the 10,000 or mo more species occupy a wide range of habitats and many have specialized beaks to help them survive so it mess they mess with the man neck molecular makeup of the beak yeah and they made a fucking dinosaur face chicken how long will that be good when they're running around better eggs because like my chickens eggs are significantly better when I let them loose and they go fuck up like my like they'll eat mice and the only worms and then I'll get these dark yolks like the last couple of days they've been running around my yard all day so really yeah so the eggs that I'll collect tonight or tomorrow will be dark orange you know but when their sedentary they're well you're just in the cage well they have they have a very large coop the coop is right the coop is essentially for the 19 chickens 717 now a couple of them died seventeen chickens I have it's basically the size of this room so they all's good space they got plenty room to wander around and plenty of food but the like when you ever see vegetarian raised chickens that's that's they don't want that no no just that they'll eat that if that's all you give them but they were they want to eat things what's the mood like bugs worms worms that's most of their diet mice more than anything Mike because they found a mouse they they fight for it it's one of the few things that they will fight for really yeah one will grab the mouse and they will just chase each other and try to fuck that mouse up how are those eggs after the mouse dazing it's hard to tell like who's laying the eggs so what do you do I'll take some excuse me I got some meat for you I'm out of elk do you I really started to crave it who this year oh yeah I know all right yeah serve it up good you for the meat me and my my dog are so happy when it comes out yeah I guess it would you a picture they send you a shot of mm-hmm my you cooking I was cooking up the ground elk and the dog it's just like we're doing this right mmm it's really good with the eggs - yes mix it up in eggs that's exactly what I do take the sourdough you put a lot of butter on it just use it as the base and put that on top of it we and then just cut it and eat it we need a friend with a vineyard ooh a friend who makes his own wine that would be great yeah we live in the right state for it yeah I know I know does it you do I never had his wine he gave me a bottle what the fuck happened to it oh yeah yeah buddy of mine didn't drink and he's in the real estate business I drank a lot of wine second half of the year yeah a lot too much I started reading man fashion time know but I'm not drinking for January yes so Virginia my friend was my friend was like I'm just gonna uh I'm not I we went out on the second he's like no I'm not I'm not drinking for the month of January I was like that sounds good I'm gonna do that too not thinking and it's been a week and I'm like this is stupid which makes me think maybe it's not a bad thing I've never taken a whole month off since I started drinking his can you gotta do sober October that's the move sober October yeah we all did yeah yeah I don't know if everybody's gonna do it this year I doubt we're gonna get burped do it again Bert was in a do with frothy panic what time November rolled around oh shit look at his face you know where he was he was getting his his jollies he was going on Instagram feeds of people that were clearly losing their fucking mind like send them to me like comedians it's and they're like just just check out our Instagram story I'm like you son of a baking just crazy just being crazy just being crazy there are some people up there and I know I don't want to out them so I'll tell you off the air yeah there are some people you find out about their Instagram story and you go oh there's a hidden little gem here online Instagram is such a great towel for people I was gonna work with this guy and I was like I asked my other friend I said do you know him like is he this is just a he's a director it's like do you know this guy and he's like well I don't wanna say anything I'm like what just look at his Instagram I was like oh what a what an old man thing that I didn't think to do that so just go on the Instagram you're like oh there were train wreck a train wreck just seeing them posting all their insanity inspirational stuff no this was just pure bad chick teaching partying you know how to be the fully actualized person I don't mean to shit on Kevin by the way I mean Kevin is he's one of those guys that gets shit done like he's Kevin Kevin Hart when I was saying like Kevin Hart's thing no he's he legitimately gets things done and also legitimately gets a thrill out of helping people get motivated exactly he does runs where he brings hundreds of people are running with everybody and everybody will run with Kevin Hart yeah he's legit hey how far do you run when you run with your dog no more than well Marshall doesn't like to he gets to the point at the end of the run he's only a year old like two miles is about yes we're you know push a pretty good pace in the hill in the hills very very steep hills yeah that too and I don't bring any water for him no no so at two miles that's all I want to push him because at the end his fucking tongue is bright red and he's like two miles up hills it's a lot it's great he's great for the rest of the day such a good dog man yeah I love golden retrievers they're so good yeah great dogs they're so food oriented though sometimes to the point where being annoying so is my lab yeah labs are two same things a lot of dogs are like that yeah if they're active they're hungry yeah metabolism is quick and they want to eat and they just yeah the good news is they're really easy to train with food because they have food so much just give him like little treats and yeah he's this dog that I have Marshall he's the best I've ever had as far as like listening to sit and stay and lie down and stuff like that and when I go running with him I don't worry about him he stays close to me that's cool he runs and then I'll like he's ahead of me and I go hey man slow down and he'll just stop wait for me then I'll come up to him and it'll start running again it's great I've never I've never taken her off leash like that and I feel like it'd be a blast the only thing I worry about is rattlesnakes yeah that's that's an issue yeah cuz I don't think he knows exactly what a rattlesnake is I bet the instinct would kick in if he didn't get surprised by it the world instincts I'm worried about the wrong ones we try to get close oh you think and get bit yeah just think they'd be like all in ancient DNA of hearing that rattle like I've had three dogs that were bit by rouse things yeah yeah oh really yeah and because they went after it yeah one of them got bit I brought him to the doctor and I'm like I think he got bit by a snake and the the veterinarians like Wow you gonna play music I'm gonna play the sad song and the veterinary they're fine he lived but the veterinarian was like everything seems okay I'm like I don't know man I'm pretty sure the snake got him and he goes well you know if if he's acting funny later let me know so I bring him home our leaders face swells up like a fucking basketball like shit just took a while for it to kick in and I thought I was doing the right thing by getting him to the vet in time I'm like I'm gonna just get him there right away just roam in the car you know I just beat the clock yeah yeah yeah and it took a while for the venom to like it took over an hour because I was at the ER yeah yeah because I was at the veterinarian's office within he got bit I had him there within 3540 minutes and then the vets looking at I was like I don't see any marks I don't see any blood there's no like clear he might have got missed or the the thing might not have got any venom in him that's where maybe got lucky so I take a moment say she's like it's brutal and then it costs thousands of dollars it's very expensive where they take them they use the anti-venom it's really expensive just to inject that thousands of dollars yeah which is really bad for people that are poor you know if you don't have any money to pay for that and your dog gets bit it's a fucking tremendous stress oh man yeah would they survive I mean if it's back dose was out yeah yeah but some dogs died from it for sure it's it's really bad for them I don't have a place to run my dog like that we've got like all streets around this so it's like yeah you got to drive them somewhere man yeah take them to Runyon Canyon or something can you take them off leash in those places it's not the problem is you never know what kind of dogs are gonna run into or coyotes or angry moms yeah that's true too yeah yeah if you can go places that are less populated those are the best for off leash type activities she would be so happy she's a lab - they're sweet dogs wants to run and they're not they're not like the kind of dogs sound like you're taking a Presa Canario 120 pound diamond dog no but nothing loose she's sweet yeah Presa Canario you never seen one knows their tanks they're this huge fucking Canaria looking they there's a guy who's breeding some that I know is making these brindle ones they look so crazy they're like the ultimate guard dog little dinosaur pink thing oh it's like a mastiff yeah super aggressive oh really yeah click on that black one above it look at that great he's gonna fuck you with that big giant horse Dickies these are these around yeah man they're Lea they're real they're not dinosaurs they have these like people have these yeah oh yeah I know some people have them my friend mark has two of them yeah and it's scary so enormous talk they're apparently very good loyal watchdogs oh they are they're nice to the family well it's all in who breeds them look at the one where the dogs on a leash poen right there like a fucking sheath build on that thing below just what a nightmare if that was chasing after you what do you do when a dog comes at you and it's gonna wants to bite you just punch it and give them your arm just give me Ron you know what dogs gonna attack you if you know for sure if you have the time yeah you feed them your arm and stab the shit out of them while you grabbing your arm oh yeah well if you don't have a weapon should have a weapon always I should always a weapon yes you never know when you gonna attack dooba weapon oh really no I told you you carry a dog knife never know nice coyotes mountain lions I was what are you doing when you fly you gotta put it in your bag your teeth like a pirate [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] next to you at the 7-eleven that have their carrion ship yeah on his ankle he might still do it and I want to say his name but huh he was a guy used to fight for the UFC he carried a gun and he's huge he's a giant man right he carried a gun on his ankle he carried one in the small of his back he carried a knife in his front pocket on both sides he had two knives he carried all the time and he carried his shoulder holster just to go to the store everywhere he went everywhere he went he was locked and loaded like he was the wrong guy to fuck with in every single possible way 260 pounds an enormous train black belt GMC champion loaded to the hilt carrying knives and guns all over his persona Mike the cool part about that which I always liked in the movies is when you're done with your day and you're just unloading all that stuff on your dresser I love that part of being a man of just having all the stuff you gotta unload to then go to like be on keys and wallet like gun machete goggles exactly carry brass knuckles anymore are those out they mess it maybe yeah why not yeah it's not a thing anymore yeah like I wonder if those are legal like that was something you'd hear about when were kids yeah they got brass knuckles yes cos Bugs Bunny had them now words are what hurt gets here yeah gives you some brass knuckles see words are violence give me some brass knuckles see yeah like that back then train cuz that's the way it spoke back then see you had that coffee just sitting there for the longest time it's still hot in port no I had a bunch you had a little bit of it yeah I love coffee you do mm-hmm addicted Brendan Schaub told me that he drinks 12 cups of coffee a day and he's been throwing up a lot lately because of the coffee because well the acid stomach yeah does coffee give you acid is that what it does yeah it's acidic yeah put the beans yes and that fucks with your stomach yeah if you're drinking how many 12 12 yeah he was drinking 12 cups of coffee a day yeah that's a big choice of music for him our stomach coffee is highly acidic and it can stimulate the hyper section secretion of gastric acids decaffeinated coffee has been shown to increase the city acidity to a greater degree than either regular coffee or caffeine alone so decaffeinated coffee is more acidic than anything yeah we'll just have fein and coffee stimulate gastric acid secretion and decaffeinated coffee raises serum gastrin levels ooh that's disgusting back to your wine guy yeah let's yeah let's find a guy yeah do you know one guy Maynard Maynard Maynard Keenan from tool he's a friend of mine oh yeah he was a vineyard was a real vineyard in Arizona an era that's right it's not income a great wine oh yeah oh my god yeah well he's an artist he's a weird mother fucker super super smart guy yeah and makes wine the same way he makes music like he they made a tool album and one of the songs was was they they wrote a song to the Fibonacci sequence uh-huh what did you just pull up the vineyard yes yeah he wrote a song to the Fibonacci sequence like the Fibonacci see the Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence the way it works is like it goes like zero the next number is 1 and the next number is 2 and then 2 plus 1 which is 3 and then then it keeps going like in this in this mathematical progression and that's how they had the chord progression had the chord progression linked up to the Fibonacci sequence just fun fucking maniac but that sort of attention to detail and obsessing yeah you know the intricacies of things he's applied that to his one amazing is it really good really good what's the label caduceus vineyards caduceus yeah yeah he has an Austria to he has a small restaurant really yeah geez that's crazy this sounds good yeah think give me the flu that fuck really told me just got over the flu oh my god thanks I was hanging out with him in Vegas and I think that's right when I started to catch it and then I had like a little bit of a car for then it got a little worse and then I really did myself in in the sauna I cranked the sauna up to 210 degrees oh really she's apparently too hot for people how I supposed to go 176 to like one 90s apparently people like anyway 220 I went I was at 210 about an hour she's not an hour but how long he's staying there to ten for I was in 210 for at least 20 minutes 15 15 man oh you know what I don't know how long I did it at 210 how long supposed to do a bunch times to get the right benefits you're supposed to 20 minutes at 176 degrees at least twice a week is like what they recommend but you can get to four times a week yeah you're a lot better off what's the main thing it does for you it increases a bunch of different things first of all does something called it makes your body produce something called heat shock proteins which are which radically reduce inflammation similar in a lot of ways to cold shock proteins that you would get from cryogenic chamber Trias but can I ask a question which made them question but why is inflammation why is anti-inflammatory why what why is it bad to be inflamed I mean I know it sounds kind of that's the root of almost all diseases it is yeah big big big cause of the lot well that was one of the things about this study I think it was a Norwegian study on the sauna they showed a decrease in mortality a 40% decrease in mortality amongst all causes from people that use the sauna I think three times or four times a week what yeah meaning 40% decrease in stroke heart attack all these different various factors and they think that that's attributed to the heat shock proteins dr. Rhonda Patrick really yeah she's the one who got me into it she's a freezing cold in the podcast and super genius and she yeah oh that's cool yeah that's nice the coolest she's very cool she we were just talking about she was on the Kardashians doesn't make them how not to be inflamed oh that's great your lips are inflamed but your butt is inflamed are you if Kim Kardashian got in the sauna she probably started sweating like you know like when you bathe something if you have like a slow-cooked pork roast or something like that you still do see these of juice campanos top is putting a tray under to catch the drippings yeah because you think about all squeeze ins all that fat if they pull out of the sides and then suck in the right and they pump that stuff in the butt to make the butt extra big and then you put that butt in the oven and then I'll just get juicy some goodies right so they heat the heat proteins heat shock proteins yeah cytokines help you with inflammation yes yes it helps your body fight off inflammation and so it doesn't in a natural way instead of like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen things along those lines which are really bad for your gut health really bad for you or like they say that ibuprofen should be taken rare rarely if ever really yeah it's apparently terrible for your body can cause strokes and it also is really bad for your gut flora I had a buddy my friend Cameron Haynes is a ultra marathon runner he's crazy 200 plus miles and yeah he's nutty fucking things because he was taken I be pro fin on a daily basis and got off of it after he listened to the Rhonda Patrick podcast yeah and all of his joint pain went away and his joint pain was literally being caused he thought has been caused by I was running was being caused by his taking of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories which increased his body's inflammation levels what yes which is crazy because it damages your gut bacteria because it's fucking poison he's taking 800 milligrams this shit every day body I was telling like dude you're significantly increasing your risk for stroke and I sent him all these studies and findings on ibuprofen yeah so he stops he gets off of it all this joint pain when it goes away no literally causing joint pain so how is your gut connected to inflammation inflammation which is one of the reasons why people tell you not to eat bread so why people tell you not to eat sugar right behind carbohydrates cause inflammation and one of the ways that caused it through the gut leakage and when we say inflamed what is inflamed that's a good point let's um pull that up in a way that a what is inflammation I'm sorry if you're going over stuff knows everything you need to know about inflammation inflammation is a defense mechanism in the body the immune system recognizes damaged cells of the immune system recognizes damaged cells irritants and pathogens and it begins the healing process when something harmful or irritating affects a part of your body is a biological response to try to remove it the signs and symptoms of inflammation can be uncomfortable but or show that the body is trying to heal itself so if you're in a constant state of inflammation because you're constantly taking in foods that your body is reacting to in a very adverse way uh-huh that is what causes a lot of diseases on people in people and it also causes your body to your feeding certain aspects of gut bacteria you know that are just just not healthy and so you're putting so the body is actually the same way they would fight a disease is fighting these foods that come in for these medicines or whatever yes these foreign things a big thing with foods a big thing with alcohol I see people with puffy faces mm-hmm yeah it's all fucking inflamed everything's inflamed right got sticks out their guts inflamed and is it your cells is it your arteries everything's everybody's just pull up everything's just kind of go back to that stuff with fluid okay chronic inflammation can eventually cause severe to several diseases and conditions including some cancers and rheumatoid arthritis infections wounds and any kind of tissue would not be able to heal itself without an inflammatory response so inflammation is a part of the body's immune system so what you're doing is you're you're in a constant state of damage when you're eating shitty food oh yeah so if you're constantly eating sugar and drinking sodas and fucking corn sauces shit yeah you're putting these weird chemicals in your body and your body's freaking out so you're this is they're not just making a distinction between inflammation that comes from like a bruising injury where your body's trying to heal itself versus something that's happening internally right from from your consumption of shitty foods right but mother's crazy many inflammatory causing foods that people eat on a daily basis and we just think of it as food yeah pizza pizzas delicious right yeah fucking full of inflammation causing bullshit why it's well first cheeses the bread the bread which is unfortunately what you make but I think that your bread sourdough bread which is different because sourdough bread apparently has less complex glutens in it because right right yeah friends I have friends that that have gluten issues that can eat my bread not to excess but it doesn't bother them the way they process bread yeah about this there's something about sourdough bread that it's different no commercial yeast yeah the gluten structure is a little a little weaker yeah well there's a great documentary that I've watched recently called what's with wheat and it was all about how they changed wheat to make higher yield wheat which you could grow more wheat in a shorter area and have a higher yield and that the the glutens in that wheat are much more they're much more dense and complex than the natural wheat that we used to eat we're a hundred and fifty plus years ago right this bread that you're going to eat comes from this great mill in Utah that is pure organic small crops so you won't have a problem with this so it's like ear loom wheat someone takes a lot I don't even know that was a thing until Maynard the asshole told me about that that oh yes they use heirloom wheat in his pasta that he makes it as awesome interesting it's easier for people to digest yeah it's you know it's a little more expensive a little harder to get but it's it makes a difference and the flavor is so much better yeah I've been buying pasta when I rarely eat pasta but yeah I do eat it I buy it from Italy and they have heirloom pasta in Italy and just you don't feel as fucking gross after you eat it yeah it's not that brick that you have that punch in the gut I just fucking like you eat a bag of rocks so what is that so the sauna if you're eating all this stuff probably help and you're putting in there and you're the it would help but you're also dealing with your gut biome right you're you're you're forcing your body to you're eating foods that are going to encourage the growth of certain types of gut bacteria right that live off of sugars and live off of a friend of mine got the gastro surgery yo and she was diabetic and she had the gastro thing done and her diabetes leveled out and she said it was the doctor says because of the bacteria because the something that they did and taking something out this makes sense at all yeah she probably had a terrible diet yeah absolutely which is also probably one of the reasons why she was so big right you know they there's different kinds of bacteria there's different types of diabetes right there's diabetes that has caused entirely by diet and these diabetes that is genetic and the type of diabetes that is caused by diet is reversible it happens with a lot of people that wind up going on you know calorie restricted diets right reduce the amount of sugar they take in and Dean Delray Jean Delray was oh yeah a abetik yeah he went to a doctor in the doctor he was he had a real candy problem he's eating candy constantly yeah this hooked on sugar yeah he talked to him now it's like sure the fucking devil man yeah he dropped a lot of weight he dropped a lot of weight and got really fit yeah he looks great gym all the time now oh really yeah he looks very healthy yeah like Dean's never looked better no man I don't eat that yeah he's like sugars the fucking devil man he's not wrong no he's not wrong at all yeah I mean sugar is great every now and then he's had a lot of drinks a little treat you know a little tiramisu after a nice meal yeah that's that's what he used to look like Wow yeah look he looks inflamed that thing right there it says people ask me how do I do it how do you not get tempted eat sugar I keep photos like this around the house to constantly remind me never again fat Dean fuck sugar healthy see that's inspiration right there yeah yeah well yeah you got a picture of yourself when you're almost dying of a disease it's very very common for people to eat too much sugar for long periods of time and go to a doctor and the doctor tells me you have diabetes right it's very common and especially in America totally brought on just by your diet yeah yeah your body's just freaking out you're constantly making it processed sugar yeah your insulin is jacked up it's spiked all the time and everything's fucking haywire in your system and your body's like hey shithead stop with the skittles that's supposed to eat like this lard-ass what about intermittent fasting I do that you do yeah I kind of like this idea I love it yeah I eat for 10 hours a day and some people say you should do eight hours and no everyday eckstein yeah every day well I take a couple days off a week well then Jimmy came up the Jimmy Kimmel - Jimmy wouldn't eat on he would eat like 500 calories on Monday and Thursday and just like real cow fasting basically on those days and then whatever and then eat whatever he wanted on the other days and that's how that's how he lost all of his weight so for two days a week eats like a severely restricted amount of calories yeah and the rest of the week he could eat whatever he wants yeah that seems crazy does that seem crazy he said it was it's tricking your body into tricking your body and it was so the metabolism was like kicking in and I don't know what the specifics were but that's what he did when he dropped all that weight he wasn't exercising and that's what he did Monday Mondays and Thursdays I wasn't he exercised he hates it now he exercises and is fit that way and doesn't restrict his calories as much because he's physically doing something hmm but I like the idea of not eating a day that whole when people say I hate exercise it's like people saying I hate brushing my teeth like shut the fuck up breathe heavy I know the comedian you're a crazy person I think it's hard he was just on his laptop and in his living room and just had a heart yeah I think so god he was funny but he would wind up like you were like a crazy person dude I saw Kevin me 19 me and my friend Diane DeRosa nice she was a friend of mine from high school yeah we went to see we went to see him at catch a rising star in Cambridge and this is like I think maybe I had done an open mic night or maybe I hadn't even gone on stage yet but I went to see him and I paid to see him it's great the the comedy and he crushed so hard that I was it was unimaginable to me ya couldn't imagine someone could be that funny so funny cuz he was in his prime then and it was a you know maybe a hundred and eighty two hundred seat room yeah you know just kill the ceiling he's on fire no escape he was on fire that's not right that's not right and then he would I opened for like at Caroline's when I was first starting and just watching him just like destroy and then he breaks into that coffee song remember he would do the the coffee song it's like that all the coffee in Brazil or something like that he's doing this musical number like just Sinatra's oh I saw the coffee him all the coffee in Brazil I think it's up something like that he got so comfortable he could do whatever he wanted to he spot there's a spot that some comedians can hit the fucking boat I don't care tonight so you'd have to be there in 1988 you know to realize like how crazy what he was doing was it was so weird but he got stuck he got stuck he went from being a fucking murderer on top of the world Uncle Bob Kealing in every place but he got stuck with his act where he had like the same act for the longest time and that act like didn't work anymore well this is cut back to what I was talking about a bit of taking your eye off the ball and like doing other things he started doing Uncle Buck he started doing some movies and then you know at that time those people weren't so conscious that you to keep your act alive you know what I mean and you know you take five years off the road and then try and come back it's it's not easily done no did you take that much time off the road I don't know I'm just ballparking but I mean you know his interests were other places at that time he was doing TV shows and doing a lot of the stuff it's hard you don't progress because you're not just in it doing that stand-up all the time well everyone was told back then in particular that you had to do something else that stand-up was a vehicle that got you to the big game yeah and the big game was a television show right or a movie like when I got news radio one of the producers of News Radio said to me like why are you still doing stand-up yeah you're an actor now right yeah you're on TV I was like what yeah and I remember thinking like oh my god I gotta get to a comedy club right now this makes any sense no fuck you talk no I mean the way we think is you do that stuff so more people come to see your show so you can keep doing your show that's why you do that stuff it's not the other way around but they that generation saw it as the stand-up was not something that you you'd but also to be fair they didn't have theater shows and other avenues weren't kind of carved out where they would could see stand up as being a special thing they were just in these hard-ass clubs doing six shows a weekend that's true they were like get me out of here when did theater show start kicking in for people for the main for like just regular good comics not you know fairly recently really yeah who else was doing theaters before like you know in those days well there was okay meanie if Kevin Meany was peeking now he would be running off and starting to do theater shows but back then it was just comedy clubs and then television yeah but some people did big places because I saw people in big places like what kind of places like there was theaters there's definitely rock clubs there was something but there wasn't like an act of touring what was the first time man I'm trying to remember the first time I did a theater not that long ago I bet mmm shit it wasn't like part of the touring business I mean you had guys that were big that we're doing it but it wasn't like you know you couldn't have a guy that instead of headlining at a club could just go off and do the Little Theater it was different they were like comedy was you know it was also a slump like all the clubs were closed ten years 20 like went how many 15 years ago that sort of happened yeah yeah what sounds about right huh sounds about right it was a slump right there was a comedy slump yeah when I started in 93 the comedy had fallen on its ass oh you would you started right when it hit right at the end of it cuz I started at the tail end of the boom the boom was like 84 and I started an 88 okay when I started it's like people like I started about four years too late kid yeah but there was still plenty of work yeah there's a lot when I saw clubs at 93 it was over there were discouraged no because it was good for me because all the time sitting yeah one was quit him and I was there I was working for free I wasn't looking to make money I was just doing it yeah so all of a sudden I was able to just if you had a car and we drive the headliner it's a club you could get onstage well there was also this weird I would say that some people would have that like they were getting screwed cuz the the work was going away yeah like you were getting acrylic what and I remember thinking like wow what a foolish way of looking at things that is that you are personally getting screwed yeah because this entire industry was oversaturated with a bunch of hacks hacks yeah yeah yeah someone was talking about is there gonna be a bus now because there's been so much comedy out there and stuff it's not a dearth of shitty comedy now no there's a lot of comedy but it's a lot of good comedy that's progressing and moving forward the art for a lot of moving different voices there's a lot going on yeah it's not there was a bus back then for a reason people had 40 minutes of material yeah and they just pounded people with it relentlessly and they never wrote and they never yeah it was shitty yeah and there was a lot of these formula guys that would go you know they would just have some fucking like really obvious premise and they would work it like a comedian would say they had a way of talking like a comedian mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom playing out in my kitchen yeah yeah she said it was really funny for a while something's happening now where French comics are getting exposed for stealing American comedy verbatim now and and and translating to French like and there was a video that came out today that showed Dave Chappelle and then some French comic pick him off Jerry Seinfeld and then some french comic ripping my plan actually popper ripping him off with the same hand motions the same doing his act in French just doing his act in French as if they were the only human beings who spoke both English and French this was something that we had heard about forever from the Montreal Comedy Festival oh really yeah because the Montreal Comedy Festival not the people that perform there but we would perform in Montreal and we would talk to guys who were comics that's that spoke English and French right and a lot of guys that spoke French sometimes they would tell you they did French shows yeah how was that like that's weird like you do French shows and English shows and they go it's interesting but there's there's a bunch of comics that are famous only in the french-speaking world of touring comedy and they just steal from American comics and just say their stuff in French I go no oh yeah it's blatant well there's a handful of comedians that were making a living touring three years just stealing everybody's shit I love having I love how they steal from the biggest guys so stupid yeah yeah I mean literally this is okay wow they're getting a guy from 2004 so this is their guy this is like hashtag me too that's hilarious look a copy comic mix yeah 85 or 86 to 2005 well that's GAD do you know him yeah how do you know he they call him the Jerry Seinfeld of well of France well he took that shit literally he's good he's good friends with Jerry yeah well stealing jerry shit man yeah it's uh it's interesting and they're using hashtag copy comic and hashtag copy comic mix this is like french-speaking comedians who don't do this who like enough is enough you fucks and yeah they're mad and they're coming out yeah maybe yeah maybe there is a real thing I was thinking the other day I heard you talking with I think it was Neal Brennan yeah and then you were talking about Jenny Richard Jenny yeah who I love Jenny - one of the greats and then I was underrated comedian of all time I think so great when when you listen to his stuff the it is very much of the time I think our all comedy is very much of the time sure it really like even our stuff from you know 15 years ago is of that moment and like you listened to Jenny and he's he's so funny and so but he's definitely of that year like if I were to try and turn my 15 year old on to him it wouldn't fly I don't know I think if you if you made your 15 year old listen to a steaming pile of me yeah yeah 15 year old boy or girl parts of it girl yeah that's of it but I mean it's and it's not an this isn't a knock I think you know it's just comedy is very much of the give-and-take of the culture and what's happening and there's some stuff holds up and some stuff because like because Richard is the first guy to do the lobster in the tank II wasn't even but he wasn't even there was a guy in Boston that was doing it even before him oh my name Don Gavin who had all gotten hilarious bit about a lobster and a tank oh really yeah Gavin's like the king he was a he was a monster a monster but see what happens is he breaks that he breaks that code that guy right he comes up with that bit and then 15 years later we've seen shades of it right so then by the time my kid here is it it's like oh that old thing right and they don't realize at that moment when Don Gavin comes up with that on his way into the club right it's genius yeah right yeah no yeah for sure and there was a bunch of people had similar premises back then yeah you know there's there was a bunch of bits about game shows you know there was a bunch a bunch of bits there's a lot of different bits that people just had their own take on these individual things you know yeah Gavin is so funny oh he was a monster yeah he's one of those guys that never left Boston though yeah Boston was a dirty mistress she fucking kept you around yeah crushed your dreams yeah it was so good there that they stayed stayed and have long careers though right yep they should have been monsters yeah like Don Gavin should be in my opinion he should be right up there with all the greats yeah people should know him the same way they know Robin Williams yeah all these other stand-up contacts that are huge maybe even bigger such a natural such a natural so good see at the time yeah oh my god in 88 when I first started oh really he would show up half-cocked drinking hand go on stage and just crush to the point where you just like you couldn't he couldn't believe how good is timing is yeah and he had that that fucking Boston we're talking about a vacation I went to Puerto Rico I loved it but fucking so many Puerto Ricans you were laughing at you couldn't believe you were hearing so brilliant yeah and then it really becomes you know there's certain stuff like I'll see like the old swatching old Jack Benny on YouTube and some of it really is as funny as it comes that are out today really yes some of it isn't is it nails it but most of it is like I said it it's it just kind of dates itself I was watching an ad for the these Jackie Gleason DVDs so I guess Jackie Gleason had a show yeah I didn't know you had a show yeah and the honeymooners was a part of that show uh-huh it was like a bit was a sketch yeah so it was a variety show yeah and that there they're playing this ad for a DVD for the variety show so my wife walks into the kitchen I'm watching this on TV she was what the fuck are you watching and I'm like look at this is like a time machine like you can just watch what people thought was amazing in 1960s was yeah look there's the honeymooners at the bottom Joe the bartender yeah Wow Fenwick Babbitt Reggie van Gleason the third what the fuck yeah just learned a whole bunch of character they called him the greatest he called himself CBS TV look fast Wow how weird yeah that was his show eight to nine o'clock on Saturdays brought to you by Schick and they all say Oh larette's see if you can find a clip from it out of the back so weird to watch man they all smoked they were constantly smoking like while they're on the set they're like light up and they're doing their sketches and they had like a cigarette in their hand yeah they're doing sketches a lot of them were sponsored by the cigarettes oh that makes sense yeah that makes sense Jack Benny show they would stop and to start talking about it due to the nature of the rare rare kinescope recordings utilized in this tape picture quality will vary in comparison to modern video technology however because the historical significance of the subject matter they are included very nice television comedy damn look what it looked like American scene yeah it's basically a poster you're just pushing it on a poster to see what here this is Jamie fifty to sixty two sixty two so this is right around the time where he was in the hustler oh man was that the best look at this look at that giant pack of Marlboro cigarettes wow what does she say but back it up a little bit so I can hear what she said about Marlboro give me some volume and back it up music so great love the stuff New York City the entertainment capital of the world [Music] I bet those gals would love to come back and do some fucking me to speeches shit was how those are cave people Art Carney was with him played Norton in front of a live audience boy there was nothing to look forward to back then a couple of times and then before you know it your wife was pregnant you had a bunch of kids and yeah and then you just just paying your bills give me a goddamn laugh look at this these gals running around it's just yeah you'd have a little uh this was showbiz I mean this came from you know now how you get yeah but do you think Jackie Gleason got to banging these chicks absolutely 6262 the greatest but I mean you probably could barely get it up he was chain-smoking chained smokin drinkin big drinker hammered all the time big-time drinker and by this time he's probably deep into his 40s right it's probably grossly unhealthy yeah how sunny was T - how old do you think Jackie Gleason wasn't 60 - here he comes look at that face Wow he was the greatest but certainly was an original oh man yeah fuck energy pinkie ring we hear some scale monologues getting laughs he hasn't opened his mouth imagine 38 weeks of this thank you how sweet it is Chris and she walks away that was the joke dances look at that [Music] there was no hip replaces back then Wow all year you had to dance you had to sing you had to tell jokes but it's weird to watch her wouldn't you love to go back in time and bang some hot lady from 1962 different back then yeah wild when was birth control when a birth control come out 60s so I feel like that's where people changed what they are because back then like there was this mad desire right but there was also insane consequences yeah you had sex with some really good a person yeah like this this this this drive this pole this cyclone of lust that leads you to this one person ramifications it not just ramifications but life-changing life-altering results and consequences right then the pill comes in you know the sexual revolution even started banging everywhere weirdness women were in control of their own destiny yeah but just what changed what it means to have sex it became this weirdness it became for pleasure it wasn't just yeah I mean it was always for pleasure it's always for pleasure but the odds of that pleasure biting you in the ass like people must have just assumed you're gonna have a few babies mamas by the time you get to a certain age right but as a woman if you had a baby out of wedlock you were ostracized yeah you were seen as you know that is crazy right yeah you were seeing the guy who wasn't there was nothing no reflection on him he wasn't even in the picture she's just like a whore fuck what a shit deal for women that is yeah yeah it's pretty bad yeah but there's some people that argue that the pill and that changing the nature of sexual intercourse changed the way women interact with men which change the way women sort of like view themselves yeah this this is not necessarily all positive I always found out to be a confusing argument and while the argument being that with like that it's natural for a woman to be very selective about who she has sex with and that it's natural for a woman to you know want a guy who's gonna shit together and all these different factors in place before she allows the man to procreate with her right but that the pill comes along then all sudden women could just have one-night stands and they could be like the chicks from Sex in the City and you know right just bang up a storm and have no consequences but like a guy yeah but this led to like a deeply unfulfilled narrative there were a lot of women sort of found themselves repeating it's a very tortured conversation because I'm not a woman cuz I don't know what their actual design now but that's also that also can be said of men I mean just that's just that scenario just to have sex just to just to keep banging and have no emotional connection I know guy friends that end up in a very lonely place because of that you know well think of this way right if you're 20 and that's the case yeah everybody's like guys having a good time right if you're 60 yeah and that's the case like haha the poor bastard yes yeah brings him back to his mansion yeah it seems do coke and they dance like [Music] [Music] Gianluca voci yeah that guy's hilarious it's great you know this guy is no he's in good shape well he's he got rid of that gal and got a couple more since then but he's 50 years old and he's like the super millionaire and he makes

that a human can contract leprosy from an animal leprosy is apparently 95 percent of us are immune to leprosy but you can get leprosy from armadillo oh my god yeah so if you eat an armadillo cook the shit out of it folks wear rubber gloves how armadillos can spread leprosy that is that's a dinosaur too isn't it yeah tank-like creatures are the only mammals besides us known to carry leprosy oh my lord yeah apparently though those things taste pretty good people people eat armadillos they do yeah yeah they open them up and it's kind of a fatty meat and you grill it and yeah people marinate it and grill it and so on your head I mean why is a lobster delicious and that thing's gross because it walks on the road you see its beady eyes at night when you're driving to Vegas why is it deer delicious then because deers walk in the road too they're not as delicious deer yeah I don't like deer so much area you like cooking it right yeah probably not how come you eaten elk that's a deer I'll chop that elk it's a giant a giant elk is a giant deer they taste different though well maybe in fairness I haven't had deer in a long time when they didn't know how to cook well also it's how people take care of it as a big issue there's things you have tarsal glands that exists on the deers legs that are particularly active when they're horny which is when a lot of times when you hunt them which is called the rut and those tarsal glands if they're not handled correctly while you're skinning the deer you can leak some of that stuff on the meat and it'll greatly taint the way the the meat tastes oh maybe I had some of that yeah also people don't take care of it like for the moment they kill it yeah how long does it take before it's actually cooled down and dressed this was like in New Jersey I'm sure nothing was being done correctly I was born born and raised I know exactly who killed it what parties may be born him I was born in Passaic okay yeah yeah yeah New Jersey deers probably none of them oh yeah they really I mean it's really they're everywhere well New Jersey has an interesting situation now because the new governor has decided to stop bear hunting yeah New Jersey's new jersey has the highest population of brown bear per capita in the country geez New Jersey does which people don't that doesn't make sense to the bears like wait a minute you say bear in Jersey New Jersey has enormous bear population huge am i that we were talking about it over the holidays my sister my sister had her dog was going crazy at this woodpile and my sister went and put a big tarp over it the next day the dogs gone crazy again at the tart at the woodpile and she's like why is he going so so nuts and she goes outside to get the dog and the a big-ass bear comes out from under the tarp this is just a New Jersey just starts like coming out she was so thankful it she didn't just like poke her head under there well we've played videos these two giant bears battling it out in Far Rockaway where they tackle over each other and they slam into these garbage pails and garbage goes flying they knock over a mailbox and they go right out into traffic and furs fly it's like a drunk fight yeah they're fighting for garbage they fight for access to these areas where these people drop their garbage are like turf yeah it's and this new governor because chris hawaii chris christie is such a slob like people hated him so much yeah and he was the republican so they hired this ultra liberal social justice warrior type new governor who's decided he has this ideological opposition to the bear hunt even though the bear hunt new jersey is like really strictly controlled by wildlife biologists they've done it to try to keep the populations healthy and there was also the situation that happened in rutgers a couple years ago where a kid was killed by a bear oh really you know one of the separates yeah Rutgers yeah sad way students was wandering through the woods with his friends and they got fucking attacked by a bear and a bear killed one of the kids oh my god picture of it before it killed him too this happened at the stress factory Vinnie brand was there she's really drunk sir but so the wildlife biologist put a number like you know the bears can be healthy and conflicts with people can be reduced if we have you know the bears reduced oh shit in the mouth like it's not an issue of they're in danger danger and they're not endangered in any way shape or form it's the opposite they're over abundant and but this is a problem with people with when it comes to bears or what my friend Steve Rinella likes to call charismatic megafauna and that people look at animals and they anthropomorphize them and start thinking of them as being Yogi and boo-boo and our little friends that live in the forest right you don't realize no these are animals man yep that you can't ya have animals they're giant predators in close proximity to human beings without monitoring and having wildlife biologists stoic calm objective people who really understand animals tell you exactly how many there should be in this area and when it becomes a problem right and so they're gonna have an issue in New Jersey the same way they're gonna have an issue in British Columbia they outlawed grizzly bear hunting in British Columbia this year for the exact same reason oh really and they did in Britain because they're not endangered no no no it was a ton of them not only they're not endangered but the people that voted on it are the people that live in Vancouver where there are no grizzly bears but we're even though it's the population center of British Columbia right where all the people live it's by no means representative of what most of British Columbia looks like rest of British Columbia's woods and wood forest and those people have to deal with fucking grizzly bears like a regular is li bears so they say they're not allowed to hunt them at all a lot of them anymore now and so also it's a big part of their economy because there's a lot of these people that made a living by guiding people on these grizzly bear hunts and it's gonna also devastate the economy when it comes to their moose and elk hunting populations too because a lot of people went there to moose hunt elk hunt and deer hunt but the Bears so why the populations are gonna go up the Bears are gonna start eating more moose and elk and deer so what's there what's the reason animal rights activists have been infiltrated the government and these people that are like leaning left and have sort of a delusional perception of what wildlife is they've decided to push these laws through that people didn't vote on by the way this is not like something there was a giant statewide vote and people decided to end grizzly bear hunts well what's crazy about the jersey thing is it he just got in office and the bear problems this year is it's been a problem yeah that's why you're hunting well I think that people are doing it for the right reasons I think they're wrong but they're doing it for the right reasons they're doing it because they think that hunting is cruel and they're doing it because they think that these are trophy hunts and the people that there's no there's no merit to it but what they'd understand is you're probably going to have to hire people to kill these bears anyway which is what we do in California you know California mountain lion hunting was outlawed in the 1990s but since then they spent millions of dollars killing mountain lions every year oh really not millions every year but what they seem like a crew to go send out professional hunters with dogs usually to go after problem mountain lions and the ones they go after almost all of them have pets in their stomach oh really that's what the many dogs really yeah that's a big part of their diet I mean it's fucked up ya know we're we're in their world yes but it's not their world anymore just like it's not you know right this isn't where the fucking dinosaurs live either we build homes change yeah and right now we live here and I'm more concerned about us than I am with the goddamn mountain lions and there's eight fluffy mountain lions a fluffy fuck are there a lot of mountain lions like I said the number is big or golf or Nia has good numbers yeah my friend works at to hone ranch and they have it on ranches just outside of Bakersfield within about an hour and a half from here yeah and they have a what it's called trail camera that's posted out in front of a pond and out of this one pond they got pictures of sixteen different mountain lions Wow do you run into him when you go up and down on your runs I've seen mount lines twice in my life one I saw in Colorado and one I saw in Santa Barbara I saw one in Montecito in a car I was driving it was driving yeah I was in the car and I saw this thing that I thought was a coyote it was running across the road and oh look at its tail I saw this big thick bouncy tail and I'm like oh my god it's a cat and I realize it was weird but I'm looking at something for a second yeah two seconds maximum right oh Jesus Christ Wildlife camera catches uncolored mountain lion roaming the Hollywood Hills oh my god that looks the size of that fucker that is like yeah that's like from Africa and this is just a couple months ago October 31st that's right by Pauly Shores house Paul short turns into that at night when no one's watching it so I go down hardly working sometimes you sound crazy that's like something you'd see on safari that's a big one too boy look at the muscles on the fucker this is this is a Halloween 2017 yeah crazy uncoloured mountain life yeah that means they don't even know where this one came from oh my god the Hollywood Hills it's like right next to people's homes well I just take my dog to a dog park up there a dog park that's awful Laurel when there's a dog park at the top Elora like right when you go deaf you're coming up over Studio City yeah there's a dog park out there if you go to the right and one of the big sign there that said be on the lookout for mountain lions if mountain lions attack you fight back oh my god fuck am I looking at dog taking my dog to the park I see some girls and throw the ball around yeah that's a lot of that it's just because of our attitude about these animals and that's also why you see very few deer in California so there's like pros and cons right right the pro is you very rarely get in accidents with deer right like you that's so uncommon in California it's true and it's because a mountain lion I always figured they just weren't indigenous to the area oh no they're everywhere these two be way more of them when I first moved here really yeah I moved I moved to the valley in 94 and I see deer all the time all the time seem in the Hollywood Hills all the time I have never seen a deer here I see I saw him a couple days ago out in like Thousand Oaks area oh yeah here yeah but they're very rare in California yeah anywhere else like this like if you're in Long Island oh yeah I mean there's a giant problem with deer there's every everywhere higher snipers go take care of them geez they do they're all over New Jersey they like a pass everywhere it's like mosquitoes and it's because they don't have any predators like mountain lions or coyotes very very few coyotes so the natural order is why we don't see him well it's because here they've kind of got a point and that point is you can let the mountain lions take care of the population right and when the mountain lions come into a problem when they become problem they can get something called a depredation permit which a woman got in the Malibu mountains because she ran an alpaca farm and these mountain lions one mountain lion killed like I think 10 or 11 al Papa and a goat oh my god in one session in one session and it was the same things like we were talking about cats with house cats it just failed it just killed him wait a minute no she's had a good old time I'll pack a pen couldn't help himself Oh Jack album but she's when this woman got a depredation permit to kill the mountain lion she got a ton of death threats from people they were saying you fuckin bitch I'll kill you you touch that cat and then she's like fuck this I'm not doing anything she's she felt like very exposed PA where she were then you were her farm was jeez yeah it's scary fuck yeah people get really nutty man when it comes to animals yeah they get a weird like but it's certain animals right like these people have this weird thing about that squirrel and then the cat came along killed that fucking squirrel guess what bitch you've been feeding that cat that's yours you made that monster you let that thing roam around outside which is just you're asking for it to kill everything it runs into yeah they do it's what they do yeah and it's probably super charged up about it too because he gets to do it all the time and the pride in front of its family to do it for the family that's what they like the most yeah that cat did that in front of you because that's what he wants you to see right Hey look at me it's scary hey I saw the tank you wanna try it someday yeah what do you wanna try I don't know when can i well we'll come up with a time we can come in we should I should have had you come in too early today you could done it before the podcast oh really yeah how long do you go in there I like to do at least an hour last time I did is a couple days ago I did two hours just float in there for an hour yeah climb in relax do you listen to music or silence I silent you silence yeah I'd like that yeah I'd like to try it yeah we'll do it next time yeah that'd be cool for sure this facility is amazing it's pretty crazy right it's so great I figured fuck it why not right so great to me who's one of those things where like all right if I could just do whatever I wanted to do what would I do right and then I go wait a minute I think I could do whatever I want to do just do it it's really great Jamie sold me a gym membership I'm gonna start working yeah it's pretty gym equipment actually comes this week it's it's it's insane yeah this is like a whole it's like a gym like can you I have an apartment well it'll be a real gym next week because rogue athletics is outfitting it like a real gym be a rowing machine there's gonna be an air dine bike there's gonna be a squat cage and she's full range of kettlebells and fucking steel plates so I mean yeah they're doing the whole thing well you can go to the gym and get annoyed or you could just work out here why not yeah come on by what's the sauna could you put the sauna in a house yes you could for sure yeah if you have the room for it and they have varying sizes of saunas that they do a big one yeah that is pretty quite honestly that but that one's too big for me I mean I've only got an Indian by myself yeah but you could have couple people in there in that one so the idea of that one was what was that room was like a closet before that we turned into sauna yeah yeah right we just decided like this is a spot like that why okay put it there okay and apparently they make them all sorts of different sizes so they do yeah and it fit perfect dude here's the thing I've been dealing with tendinitis in my elbow and it was it's really been kind of annoying it's really been Bob tendonitis is a weird one man yeah have you ever gotten it before yeah I have what they call golf golfer's elbow is the inside where tennis elbow is the outside it's been annoying me for a few months now and it comes from over doing chin-ups oh I was doing too many chin-ups oh really and I was being a meathead where I was just pushing through yeah you know like it would start to annoy me and I'll just keep going okay yeah but one session in the sauna significantly reduced like the pain in it and then the second session did the same thing and then I did it again yesterday I'm barely feel that tendinitis now for real yeah and just getting the inflammation out yeah I think it has a I think it just has an overall effect on inflammation throughout your whole body you know it's pretty cool yeah underwear you can climb in today I'm going in right after the show no [Laughter] like a personal and Freddie's are like probably 1,500 bucks I think or less house and they also make them where you you lie down in them that's ridiculous they they have one lie down in it like a suit and you zip it up up to your neck like see that one with the blue down there without ladies lying downs keep going slow down scroll down that one with the blue your cursors right yeah that that's ridiculous yeah you close like gold that's like the old Brady Bunch yeah but you can sup your body and it's apparently really good for you really you look like she looks like the blueberry in Willy Wonka that's our pussies for pussies oh my god it's fire fire look I like a nice sauna it's great hot I don't like the steam so much mmm I think there's benefits to steam too but the real benefit of the sauna is the fact that you can get to 176 degrees in the dry heat yeah your body can tolerate it but if you got to 176 degrees and steam your fucking nipples burn on fire right that you Drago the wet yeah you basically be poaching yourself right my friend really believes in the steam steam he's a big drinker and he steams every morning and it just all comes out of managing the big yeah you just got steam it out I'm alright I think sauna will probably help more if he could figure out a way to not I mean I think he's probably getting some benefit from like being in the steam yeah but I bet sauna would be even better for him yeah and it's again the same thing reducing the inflammation yeah I'd like to be less puffy from inflammation Russians love it five-time champion Teemo cow Conan had become adept at enduring the tournaments 110 degrees Celsius 203 Fahrenheit heat lasting over 16 minutes G thousand 3 but he died didn't he next guy not the guy he was competing against wow this is a competition right world sauna championship my god I'm the very best at cooking myself but not dying 16 minutes that's not long 230 degrees let me tell you something man I was at 210 degrees I can't even fucking imagine someone going 20 degrees hotter than that yeah like my nipples were hurting and I was like why my nipples so hard why did you do that watch I cranked it up and then I came in here to do my ads and when I did the ads I left it on too long it just got super hot this one guy goes in for bursts of 130 to 140 degrees Celsius I just looked that up that's 284 degrees Fahrenheit 4-minute bursts like John two hundred and eighty degrees yeah 4-minute bursts so he's essentially doing like the opposite of the cryogenic chamber it says you can get what's called hyperthermia if you do this in a bad way you this heavy bathers in favor of the hottest temperatures always wear felt caps and slippers because the wooden surfaces tend to get very odd that sounds adorable I cook fealty halves and slipper the Korean like Robin Hood naked Robin Hood cook things at 250 yeah all the time no yeah a lot of times you cook like a potato 150 pull it out of the oven I cook it elk steak I'll cook it at 250 and I put an internal thermometer and when it gets to 125 degrees and I pull it yeah that Jack the temperature up and I sear the outside 3:20 says 160 fahrenheit is 324 short spells 320 degrees so these people aren't this is a home their psychosis this isn't about inflammation this is not just what people do always a good thing going people that tattoo their eyeballs yeah why it wasn't good enough to write you only live once in your forehead eyeballs black you couldn't stop yeah you have to be like toad from x-men why'd you have to do that why are you putting things on your eyeballs no one wants you to do that but people can't help it they can't leave things alone you know they get one piercing in their face they want to get cheap piercings and nose purely this guy got his fucking eyeballs turned blue like you rember when you're a kid no one had their face tattoo nobody no one and now look at this another one yeah eyeball tattoo sole this and says oh my your soul is bro hey bro you're soulless you got an umbrella like Mary Poppins if she stupid fuck my microphone or razor blade what do you do when your kids start asking to have it shoes on their face to anywhere they said we want to be fierce do they want to I have two full sleeves I would be a massive hypocrite if I told them not to get tattoos yeah definitely tell them you really should think about the fact that you're gonna keep the skin free rest of your life yeah don't you know if you want to get a tattoo it should mean something yeah don't get anything done that's cheap no real artists think about it yeah you know yeah you can't control them I guess no I don't think not only do I think you can't control them but I think if you try to control them you're gonna do the opposite nose piercing noise piercing seems easy you'd get it taken out you put it back in it's no big deal yeah rather nose piercing that forehead tattoo but they're so beautiful marquita loca the forehead yeah I think my young one was like I like a little nose like his little nose like the little dot in the nose kind of thing I was like could be worse things in this life I know I doesn't really make me that angry but she's so perfect just like I get it oh don't do that people like decorating themselves though then we're buying something right this was when we were in New York and we're just walking around and then I was buying something the woman at the register was tons of piercings on her nose and her ears and like you know like 50 on her ear and I said I said did the nose one did you nose piercing hurt this is right off our conversation oh yes it really did hurt it was so painful and they had to do it twice and then it got infected and it was just a terrible no I got staph and angry yeah and this isn't even

wall he was watering a pot plant he was wandering a pot plant and I was like I can't do that that's reckless you know it's really funny pull the microphone down so I can see your face here so when we did this show for your buddy that helps the Congo pygmies Justin Justin Justin on the back of his book it's exactly my tattoo he's got that him with his beard I showed it to him that night when we did the show he was yeah he just sent me a text saying he's going to kill him he's gonna climb Mount Kilimanjaro oh my god yeah I like meeting that guy that was great it was the best part he's the chest that guy love that guy but do things for him oh my god he's just a just a gem of a human being I just wanted to hang with him all night it was from this podcast we've built more than 20 different wells in the Congo what he's built they built hundreds of wells there now it's amazing just because of this podcast alone more than 20 wells were build there Oh awesome he was such a good guy and just one of those people like instantly he just kind of you could tell yeah yeah he's a saint yeah like legitimately like a saint yeah his book is pretty great he's a fucking cage fighter yeah be a nice guy no he was really cool but yeah I wish I had a picture of the book it literally is my shitty tattoo is is him I've got two more got one up here and one up here those are good this was like this shitty spot or two it was kind of like a coward wave on your calf it's just like there is he's holding the thing yeah he's got a spear that he got from the pygmies and he's wearing a hat they made out of leaves Justin looks like my shitty tattoo what's on your shoulders my wife's name is on here and over here is like the Sun with this quote from Walt Whitman on it mm-hmm these are the these are the

friends from back home yeah I've got a real tight group from grade school high school do some of them not leave not go anywhere and you around them and you just you get to see what that's like um a little bit yeah it's a weird way of living yeah it is a weird way of living and I get nostalgic sometimes because I go back to that same place you know where I was a kid and on the one hand it seems like you know you could have made that choice you could stay and easy let's just stay there and be at the same spot and do the same thing and there's something very appealing and calm about it but it's wasn't my nature I couldn't do it yeah there's always something appealing about something that other people are doing though isn't it yeah for sure like you think about your own situations and the weirdness of your own existence you know I wouldn't be great if I just a fucking cabinet maker and here's this coffee in the morning he just makes his cabinets goes it's the same cafe every evening and has a beer yeah and he's embedded not even him and his dog perfect sitting at the bar I love his cabinets yeah he's like jokes it happens started baking this bread when I'm on the road I'll go see these bakers like if there's someone really good in a town that I'm in and just goes crazy so bakers it's like like if you were a martial artist you'd go train with somebody yeah I go and I go and check out how they make their bread sourdough yeah like hey you know I'll tweet out they're like I'm gonna come and then they'll bring me back and yeah it's great so what do you gotta find the good bakers in towns or a website that you go to no you just like you know through Instagram and stuff you start to see the ones that you really like and who they follow and you just start to see like who's doing the same kind of a thing you know because it's a certain it's a very natural way of doing it so it's not like just like a big commercial bakery that's just you know cranking stuff out like there's people that are real artists that are doing this stuff all around the country all around the right so but it's funny like cuz I'll come in and be like all bright-eyed and this is amazing so you're a baker and you just come in here and make this stuff and you I mean how great is it that you feed the community and everyone really loves what you do and you put your heart and soul into it

to eat sweets very often yeah but they have these fucking chocolate croissants that are so ridiculous the pastry part is so buttery and flaky and then the chocolate part is so rich so good I can't even I can't get coffee there cuz if I get coffee there I will get one of those yakun things and I'll feel like shit I know you don't like an hour later you're just like what rich chewiness there's a combination of the flaky buttery pastry and the richness of the chocolate and the sweetness and then you drinking your coffee the same time like this is perfect I didn't I don't need anything but this yeah that's it man it is the good stuff so it's not bad man it's just it's not good for you it's not good anything in excess right I found a little treat once in a while something yeah there's a company called no foods KN o W huh and they make waffles chocolate chip waffles and they make syrup with low glycemic index very little sugar in the waffle very and it tastes good what do mean they come like pre-made like they're frozen like an egg yolk kind of a thing yeah but they don't last very long so you have to look like edom you have to thaw about 8 grams of fiber 12 grams of protein 4 grams net carbs well on sine 4 grams that's right bitch and I'm putting the butter on those motherfuckers no way and then they have their own syrup no surface very little as well that looks perfect dude I'm telling you those well smart people that are healthy that figured out a way to make look at that Wow I had that yesterday felt great worked out afterwards felt a fucking champ didn't feel shitty at all like look at that you feel like there's no way I can eat that there's no way there's no way you got to get him online or do you get him in a store I ordered them online yeah yeah and then they they're very nice them they sent me a box of shit what a treat that we have some of their cookies here to try one of their cookies before you leave Tom Papa needs some of those yeah man there's some stuff that you can eat that people have figured out how to do stores were the places they stomp oh wow there's a bunch of places where people have figured out how to make food that tastes really good that doesn't fuck you up the United States of America let's be honest yes doesn't taste as good as that chocolate croissant well no it just doesn't well no damn good but you could have that damn four times a week probably yeah you'd have it every day but there's something about knowing that you're eating shit and you're like I don't care no this is part of it oh it's part of part of

strange reason a barefoot and angry look what did you say white man fucker I was reading a thing yesterday that had sleep patterns of successful people um Richard Branson Bill Gates people like that right Obama most of them six hours of sleep at night yeah most between like the 12:00 1:00 o'clock to like 6 7 o'clock in the morning I think there's a balance between productivity and health mm-hm and if you want to get more done I would say that's probably the way to go but I don't think those people are pillars of health for fitness and playing exercise is really hard and you know and really attacks your body you need more I think you need 8 you need 8 I do 8 you do 8 I feel way better when I get 8 yes 6 is 6 does not seem like a lot is this all the different people nikola tesla got to yeah but he's too busy banging pigeons he was crazy he was super super genius who was in love with a pigeon what yeah I never heard that he had a love affair with a pigeon Winston Churchill got like a hundred hours of sleep at night to Vinci he was just drunk all the time are those are those dots mean hours it's when they slept like so he slept every four hours like a 20-minute nap who did some somewhere to DaVinci do blue lines or when they were sleeping that's crazy and Winston Churchill just slept like a bear he drank like crazy Richard Branson seems like he's getting that's a six yeah 12 to 6 that sounds kind of reasonable yeah that's reasonable but 6 is early to get up for me well if he's one of those get shit done Donald Trump three hours one four one two four come on that's not where it can't be true is that real I mean he's on speed one two you know that was the speculation about Trump from an article that was posted a while back was that he had a prescription for amphetamines in like the 90s someone had prescribed him see we could find that Trump prescribed speed for diet and he stayed on it for like eight years really yeah it's been my understanding when you talk to people that love adderall and and those sort of things that you become incredibly productive when your right stuff and if you're one of those people that gets used to being incredibly productive right that stuff like eliminating that it's very hard yeah see 1993 Harry hunts unauthorized biography on Trump lost tycoon corroborated the rumors and went one step further the diet drugs which Trump took in pill form not only curbed his appetite but gave him a feeling of euphoria and unlimited energy the medical literature warned that some potentially dangerous side effect could result from long-term usage they included anxiety insomnia and delusions of grandeur what according to several Trump Organization insiders Donald exhibited all these ominous symptoms of diet drug use and then some the supposed drug Trump took back then was tenuous da Spann a drug with speed like effects it's not unlike dexedrine hmm these rumors sayst Trump stopped seeing dr. Greenberg decades ago but according to one source to our source the Donald Trump of today is on a diet drug called phentermine and has been since at least April of 2014 he does not look like he's on a diet phen-fen he's on fen-phen phentermine first gained notoriety in the US under the name fen phen a miracle combination of phentermine and fen flora mean another established anti-obesity drug the only problem was that patients taking the drug became began reporting damage their hearts and lungs apparently the combination destroyed patient's body's ability to regulate the amount of serotonin mm-hmm phentermine on its own however is still prescribed and while the US National Library of Medicine notes that most people take phentermine for a month or so at a time since the drug is addictive Trump has supposedly been taking continuously for over two years well listen when people get used to taking pills yeah and speed in particularly yeah they get used to that ramped up life they had they not thank you it's very hard it's just very hard to just go cold turkey and be that guy who's just dull now yeah right exactly so much energy he had while he was on the campaign trail like to constantly speak instant could never shut the fuck up it was really impressive I mean it's nonstop right 72 year old man 73 what doesn't it make sense yeah absolutely yeah Hillary was fall - she was on provigil what's that provigil is a drug that was first invented they were trying to make a drug that was actually a performance-enhancing drug and then they had to come up with a reason for taking it yeah because you can't just say hey we made a pharmaceutical drug that enhances your your energy levels so they came up with narcolepsy yeah I've taken it oh yes yeah it's great if you have to drive somewhere and you're tired because it doesn't give you it doesn't make you speedy and I don't think it makes you any smarter or fast or thinking or anything right but it definitely keeps you awake it gives you like a little elevated sense of energy yeah yeah doesn't sound so bad I mean you'd have to take something to keep up those I mean you know from just touring and stuff oh yeah what that takes out of you watch the how they just were non-stop and he was probably on dye pills right interesting and I'm getting skinnier I knew a gal going on that fen-phen stuff oh yeah yeah back in the 90s she was beautiful but she was a chubby she just had a bad diet and you know yeah like the booze and she's probably 20-something or something and got on the fen-phen and I hadn't seen her in forever I hadn't seen her in probably like a year and then I ran into her and I was like holy shit like what happened to you lost like oh then she was like 120 pounds and slim and gorgeous and I was like that is crazy so what did you yeah but then I start fucking with her and like messing her body up and you know like like heart palpitations and she's and then you know a year later she was bigger than ever geez well I mean if you think about like taking an ibuprofen if like if that messes you up mmm these drugs the impact is huge oh yeah man yes well I know so many people that are on adderall yeah I was just gonna say have you ever try to add a row never heard of it but I want to I know me too wanna try it Jamie's gonna bring in something for me you take it dealer may or may not sell it to children now I got a pill from a friend of mine that I want because I've never even used it and I still just have it yeah now all this stuff really works you ever do you ever take a ambien no I sleep easy I do too got no problem sleep I was doing a show in the Middle East once and my doctor gave me ambien he's like if he need help adjusting your time I didn't ask for it he gave it to me and I don't really take anything really but I took it it was I mean it just works you're just like pretty awake and then you just feel sleep just kind of calming over you like like an ocean wave and it just I mean how did you feel when you woke up not good a little druggie and fucked up yeah it wasn't like I woke up like oh I'm gonna be kind of tired and then just go to the gym yes exactly I'm just not into that drugged up feeling now it's all because I need then it becomes a whole cat house trying to adjust it and I had a buddy was going everybody was going through a divorce and couldn't sleep at all so he was taking two of those fucking things at night and everybody was urging him they're like hey man don't take that money yeah I think this stuff is not good for you yeah you're not gonna be able to sleep normally or you don't wake up you know yeah yeah take it and night-night choking middle of night and just here in the middle some crazy dream about being in a gunfight with the cops squirrel ambient people uh do things in their sleep yeah well got by ice cream I had a bit about it in my act about a friend of mine who made a turkey he got up in the middle of the night preheated the oven went to store bought a turkey came home made stuffing mashed potatoes and gravy cooked it ate it went back to sleep got up in the morning and call the police someone broke in my house and made a turkey the fuck is wrong with you you fat piece of shit to grips with your food problem it's real story it's a real story now I made a turkey oh my what the store yeah Alex bought a turkey dealt with someone at the register bought a fucking turkey drove his car my god so crazy yeah people are weird man I'm surprised no one's like killed someone I hope they have they have yeah yeah people have yeah people have murdered people on it and there was one guy jeez he I want to say he killed someone his family with a crowbar little boy it was like some crazy story where he was on ambien and he drove to someone's house and killed him with a crowbar and then drove home no idea even did it oh my god well people react to different things in different ways yes you can never predict exactly how someone's gonna react like heavy-duty pharmaceuticals that's what I was worried about I'm like I'm not taking this on the flight I don't know who knows what I'm gonna do you know the fucking ocean just wake up in prison you don't know why you know what you did heven watch the video of you kind of some businessman beating someone to death with a 9-iron pretending to fly I heard a nightmare it hasn't been around that long right like 2013 I sure look up there's something called the sleep homicidal sleepwalking defense that's been used at least since 1987 geez think it goes back farther than that here's the Wikipedia on it Wow sleepwalking defense hmm Wow homicidal some some embolism bananana or sleepwalking a sleepwalking murder the act of killing someone during an episode of sleepwalking oh man see that's the thing like if you were gonna kill somebody wouldn't you be like he was acquitted of killing the the murder of his mother-in-law in 1987 after using the sleepwalking defense now let me just put it right there I would love to believe this man however I have a wonderful mother-in-law she's a lovely lady but I have friends whose mother-in-law's are straight cunts it's a real thing it's just so contain this guy he didn't kill his children his wife drive to his buddy's house kill his best friend what does it say there reportedly got up from his bed still asleep and drove roughly 23 kilometers to his in-laws house broke in assaulted his father-in-law Dennis wood and stabbed his mother-in-law to death Wow Wow good on all this he managed to drive himself to the police station aside from a few isolated events the next thing he could recall was being in the police station asking for help saying I think I've killed some people my hands whoa Wow well that's what I would do to ya gonna go pretend you've gotta plan this out yeah something blew up for you know what crazy but you guys got to help me yeah look if you know for sure you're gonna kill them like there's no way I can not kill this person I need a fucking rock song excuse yeah what is this Namba Lamba lism we had wonderful Thanksgivings ever ever since then man stay married after that how does that work yeah probably maybe invite you probably quietly is grateful yeah the dad pulls your side and slips your torch some people do have weird sleepwalking things though sleep I did as a kid did you mm-hmm like him around kindergarten I would uh I would come out into like the living room just screaming and crying whoa and not have any record No then I did have recurring nightmares that I remember what were they the one very clear one was um it was a blackness you know sometimes when you're sleeping there's just the you can feel the the blackness the space was just very big and you felt very small in it and there would be rumbling and it would build and and I would feel kind of pulled back a little bit in it and and then the turrets of two tanks would slowly come into the periphery on the left and the right and you see like the gunner of the tank and the tanks would slowly start going towards each other from the left and the right and then they would fall down this hole and you get that feeling of falling and then sometimes I'd see the face of my father things yeah what's that supposed to mean that means that you're gonna get money up this tree hang on yeah what am i doing on the edge of this building what am i doing on that cliff so I wouldn't connect the dream to the sleepwalking but what do you think it is I mean I don't know it could have been connected come on dude you're a doctor but I I remember one time I was at my friend's sleeping over my friend's house and the next morning they were like Tommy can't sleep here anymore because I did it at their house where they're just asleep and then you got some kids screaming screaming in the middle and crying and screaming in the middle of the I've had kids do that at my house you have yeah you pick them up being are you okay yeah welcome to the bed don't have kids to understand this but like its when before but when I was on planes before I would be bummed out if a kid was crying yes oh fucking great there's a lot of fun yeah fucking loud stupid kid quiet your kid up yeah but now I'm like a poor kid yeah it doesn't it say you don't even hear it but it doesn't bother me no like like I'm upset I can't sleep it's like a little kid yeah once you kids so different once you have we and the parents use you have empathy for the parents like you're like yeah oh I've been there when you're going through that and it but it really is an instinct like there is there is no like when you hear baby crying a plane there's not that thing when you had when you were younger this just like get it out of here yeah that's a weird thing that people do have like I've seen it before where like young boys in particular do not like babies no they don't like kids and they're around them like oh yeah they'll roll their eyes and it's like today the instinct yeah and then once you have them you were just like but it's funny when you see like teenage boys around them yeah especially ones that haven't been raised around kids maybe it's the instinct that they're gonna have to one day take care of one yeah yeah the party's gonna end they're gonna track be trapped the party's gonna end in that it's funny because like there are these chapters it's like this is all coming full circle to what we're talking about with like Richard Branson on a boat getting his dick sucked doing coke but but here's the thing there's a cycle and if you hang in there long enough becomes cool again like if you're hammered and you're 20 and you're out there how about a party it's kind of silly and it's fun but if you're hammered and you're 60 it's kind of sad yeah but if you're hammered on you 90 it's funny again about you all just suck my dick which by the way apparently the latest in the sexual harassment Olympics the latest entry is Stanley from Marvel Comics really yeah he's 95 years old yeah he lives in some giant mansion and he has a bunch of nurses he's trying to get him all to blow him yeah of course he says it's a shakedown he says they're all just trying to get money from them may very well be the case she or it may well very well be the case that he is like a lot of 95 year old dudes with 20 million bucks in the bank and about six months to live just get me in on what do you do you try you go for it you swing those fuckin dice come on seven Stanley if he really can if you know I mean yeah if you're worth well hold on go back to that what does it say there he okay he bought someone then it was revealed that someone had bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge that was last week I don't know if you know what happened follow police report after discovering that someone had stolen $300,000 from him well using a forged check and then it was a reveal that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge if war came to light when his team did a full audit of his accounts following the forged check whether this is any way related okay this might be he might be being honest this might be in reaction you know shakedown the shakedown this guy has so much money that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name and he didn't learn about it until they were going over the books well until they found a $300,000 stolen check yeah that's a baller yeah Stanley Hall an out-of-control superhero yeah I'd like to think that he's not the guy who's trying to tell these maids to suck his dick yeah I doubt it I'd like to think that me too I want some heroes left couple of those guys whew but hang in there guys one more time Tom papa
