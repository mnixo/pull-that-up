keep joints in it but it's not quite big enough the holes come out like all bent and sad we're live yeah I tried to keep joints in there but it didn't just they all kind of were like it was like half on half smushed you need like one of those bubblegum brains mmm yeah I didn't want a fanboy out when I met you but I'm a huge fan just like you know I really love your music I think Dave Cross is the first guy who turned me on to you I think yeah I remember how I might just remember him tell me about exile and guy bill do you mean mr. showed yeah yeah he's one he was a big mr. show was in my happiest touring iteration like that was what we watched every night after the show we'd hit the bus and everyone would watch mr. show totally passed out that's a genius show I think it's like for Bob and Bob did great on better call Saul and Breaking Bad he's done a lot of other stuff it's awesome too but there's a something about the two of those guys together very unusual combination and their writing is just so bizarre and weird but they did a Netflix thing for awhile I don't know if there are they still doing that do you know he's doing those other shows no too bad anyway Dave Cross introduced me to Liz Phair well I am that's a nice that's a nice touchstone since it was part of my touring life there you go I feel very good about that so you got what do you have now you have a box set out yes it's a reissue of my first record exile and guy Ville um with the original girly sound tapes that I made on a four track in God late 80s early 90s was that when you were living at home yeah that was when I was recalled back from San Francisco having not gotten a job and run out of money and grifted my way across like the Bay Area I mean I had a place we we I was rooming everyone from my college class moved out to San Francisco basically from Oberlin I went to and I made these little cassettes that I forwarded to two friends and one of them got super busy making copies of these cassettes and sent them to every fanzine in America with this like glowing recommendation and all of a sudden I was getting I was living at home still didn't have a job and I would get these envelopes coming to me saying like please make me a cassette copy here's ten dollars and can you imagine what happened to the table how awful is that I truly just like I was like yeah like there's about like a hundred people that didn't guess that but I wasn't making the cassettes but anyway that's sort of Taiwan U is actually the person who made lots of cassettes and sent them around so I want him to think did you have a thought that you were going to eventually make it or be a big singer the dude was that even an idea not a clue I hated being in front of people like I would not want to I loved being in the studio I loved recording but I didn't I was super stage frightened and I couldn't think of anything I'd rather do less than get up in front of you look like music or do anything really yeah absolutely Wow but it was hard but you obviously have a love of music I love playing music I just I get very self-conscious with it you gotta pull this sucker up to you otherwise we're not gonna I get very self-conscious in front of a crowd still not so much anymore I do about two weeks before I hit the stage I will stop sleeping and then really yeah work myself into this kind of cold sweat when I think about it like can I leave the country and then like I get on the stage and it all comes back to me and I'm like I've done this a million times this is the best job in the world and just I can't psych myself into that feeling until I'm actually on stage maybe that's just cuz you care about it so much probably I'm too alert we should be smoking those joints that are not mahjongg hat I have some over here I know can't even imagine where we'd go with that we do it all let me know we're about ten minutes in you change your mind it's really rough if it gets really personal maybe only sometimes you have to just I'm a very awake person mm-hmm well that's a good thing that's that's like the more sensitive you are though the more you have to consider all the possibilities and that that's what could keep you up right we talked about that podcast yeah there's this guy that's coming on his name's dr. Robert Schoch and he's a geologist from Boston University and he's worked on there's some real scientists that believe it's entirely possible that the Sphinx and a lot of the construction in Egypt is far older than they think I know all about all this how much motion has occurred around the base or around the pit and it absolutely couldn't have been done depending on like the way the Sphinx is built where it's located the siting yeah where it's level is he's far older so yes they think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,000 plus BC because that's the let when back then the Nile Valley was a rainforest and somehow or another became a desert and this guy's you know legit Boston University professor geologist he's travelling all over the place but he's here for some UFO conference and the UFO people wanted to him to mention the UFO conference and a microphone in Christ with UFO conferences you guys don't have anything have you had something good what you gonna get together in a fucking Marriott somewhere and show some blurry picture of some fucking a hubcap that someone chucked up into the air like there's nothing everything that everything that they look at falls apart under scrutiny there's like a few videos okay I'm gonna push back please do please do let's just say what about do you know the discovery disclosure yes this closure project okay there was their first press conference when they got all that I'm I'm I tend to be impressed by the military you know ranking members I'm sort of like oh if you were if you were guarding missile silos and you say you saw something hover above it and deactivate mm-hmm you know I'm probably gonna check that out a little harder and there were just so many people that's you know in that press conference and said that they absolutely had seen evidence met extraterrestrials seen the crafts like in hangars etc you know and to me like I they didn't look like they had that much imagination they're the kind of people that I didn't think could really I mean did you find that convincing you no no here's what no no a whole bunch of liars a whole lot right the disclosure project he doesn't appeal to me as much as the people that he brought on who were mostly military yes here's the thing about military anybody who's in the military is a person if you get a hundred people together one of them's out of their fucking mind if you get a million people you've got a shit ton of people that are out of their fucking mind that are running around that want extra attention one of the best ways to say you one of the best ways to get extra attention is to say you've had some extraordinary experience that separates you from the pack it's one of the main points of delusion that people that are really out of their fucking mind well it won't want to point to I see things in people I can read or us I can tell I'm a psychic healer I'm an intuitive person they all have this thing that separates them from the herd without any work whatsoever I feel like a lot of these people are that they want attention and so they tell these extraordinary stories now when you said they're not creative that's a very astute point because they all the same fucking story because it's the same story that's been going on forever they just repeat shit they've already heard most of these people I think are full of shit I think it's entirely possible that UFOs have been here entirely possible to see people have seen UFOs entirely possible but a lot of those people my fucking bullshit Raider just goes off really yeah I talked to many of them when I did that television show Joe Rogan questions everything and I met with UFO people in Bigfoot people I was telling you before the podcast it cured me because I got to be around those people for hours and just talk to him no cameras around I'm like oh you're fucking crazy or you're delusional or your way of looking at things is not objective or you're talking to me because you want to convince me of something you're not just communicating the ideas that are actually in your head you're pitching me some sort of ass you're like you've got some sort of a performance you're doing for me I smell it and as a performer I smell it I'm like this is nonsense you telling me nonsense you know they would tell you well you you want evidence I'll back a truck up and show you the evidence I'm like where's your fucking evidence today I mean yeah well here's the thing did they seem as off-kilter in everything else they talked about relationships jobs they're all screw balls they're almost all screwballs the people that are most convincing are the people that see these orbs flying around the pilot yeah well the reason why they see these things is there's a real phenomenon called ball lightning it's absolutely real and it's caused by various weather conditions and they think that it even be caused sometimes by the right weather conditions in the shifting of tectonic plates that somehow another direction yes and that these ball ball lightning if you've ever seen videos of it it's phenomenal it just flies around they've even had it inside airplanes somehow or another ball lightning has shot down the aisle of an airplane while I was in flu vaccine it have you really I've actually never seen lightning on a flight that was struck by lightning wow it was pink and it sounded like a giant BB gun hit a tin can oh yeah you were in a plane that was hit by lightning yes holy shit that's intense who's very intense I was coming off the tour and I wanted to get back to my very young son I told him I'd be there in the morning when he woke up so I ended like up going on this Odyssey like planes trains and automobiles you know try to get to write nothing like I was like I will be there and it was terrible weather it's just like the worst on the East Coast and we kept taking I think twice we took off and had to land before we could get to our destination and get in the plane and go off again and me being a crazy mom I'm like so I get in this plane and it's very bad we're flying right through a thunderstorm but I've flown so many times I my parents took me a million places we traveled a lot when I was young so I've just been flying forever and the Lightning's going off and thunder and we're rattling around and it's not a very big plane and my seatmate I think I didn't know who he was but he seemed like a decent nice young man and like the Lightning just hit the plane you get this big thing of the you know the shock of the electricity just hitting it we drop about I don't know what I don't know what makes a big stomach drop but we drop far it's like 25 feet I don't know just like BAM and this pink ball of electricity just goes like woosh down the aisle in the center of the oil he pukes ginger just puked like until we were you know like I just it took about you know 10 minutes and there was like but that was intense and I made it I was there in the morning when my son woke up oh well that's not that's awesome yeah but it was incredible the pinkness of it is still really vivid to my mind and the ball lightning it was it was a sphere that just came whooshing down the aisle wow that's awesome yeah that's lots of crazy plane almost crash stories yeah what else oh there was a time that the engine was on fire and I could see it you could see it on fire yeah yeah where were you please don't say over the ocean yeah but not far we were just off outside of Boston we took off night time again after a show trying to get home to my kid I mean this is like this saddest mom story and it was night and I was looking at the lights the sort of I forget what they call it those orange lights you know that and it was over the bag to see the water and we just weren't rising quickly enough you know just I was like why why aren't we gaining altitude what's going on you just didn't seem right and someone on my left I was in the last row and someone on my left said something like the engines on fire whatever right as the captain comes on it says ladies and gentlemen we have a problem with one of the engines we are I have to make an emergency landing please remain in your seat did it uh and I look over and you can literally see flames shooting out of the like it because the the engine was about ten rows ahead of me but the sparks were visible behind you know because your do you understand like the physics yeah like it's a long trail of sparks thing and so we get to the point where we're gonna make our like landing and to see the flight attendants scared shitless was not a fun experience I think that frightened me the most like seeing their faces and we had to get into the crouched position you know that position the brace yourself position and the captain came out I think the last thing he said which was not reassuring was please brace for a very rough landing and I'm I'm thinking if you're crashing it doesn't you can't say anything more than that right ladies and gentle you mean like that's it please prepare for a very rough landing and what happened I know I'm like mono but like what happened to my body at that moment was I went into this only happened twice in my life full tremors like full body do you know have you ever had that it's different than like nervous shaking or cold shaking it's like full and your body is just like completely vibrating like at another frequency and I realized for the first time in my life that I didn't care if I was dead like in two seconds and I felt nothing it really upset me that my body my soft squishy body it was gonna be like pinned into metal it bugged me like I really thought like we're never doing this again like this it just became very very real that my that I cared about this arm and I cared about this leg and I didn't want like it to be completely mangled and like stuck in metal and we hit the we got the ground it was a very rough landing and there were fire trucks going like a hundred and ten miles an hour on either side of us spraying us with the D accelerant or whatever that yeah and suddenly like foam on the windows and are you ready for this so it was not a fun thing but we survived and no one was harmed and then we had to get back on another plane because I had to go home to see my kids so he literally sat there and waited and got right back on another plane Wow and flew huh well you probably like what are the odds no I just I wanted to see my kid right but like that was an intense you mean that thing you don't ever get to experience us unless you're like a combat person like even if you're not conscious I don't want this like all screwed up I don't want to be like mangled no one does and the reality of it was like right there right there and I don't feel it anymore I'm just as stupid and reckless as I ever was but like in that moment it was very real to me no fuck I haven't had anything like that that's intense I know what's more intense getting the hit by lightning or the fire they're both pretty fucked what about the Cessna at lost power over the Bermuda Triangle second you know what that is they think they think it's nitrogen escaping from the seafloor they think there's trapped nitrogen and massive amounts you know cuz there's a lot of like dead things and decaying things like vegetation and things like that and they trapped nitrogen pockets and those nitrogen pockets when they lift up they can go through the surface of the water and up into the air and if a plane is flying into that is methane is it methane I say it wrong yeah because nitrogen is here yeah cig 84% of the air but I think there's something about it being a giant pocket that you fly through I might be wrong it you're talking about the game and the tectonic yeah and it can like make a ship go down because there's no right there's no buoyancy for the ships and also for planes it makes explosions explain oh my god is how we roll I'm never leaving come stay you can come anytime you want this is incredible we can come and just talk about UFOs every week oh my god this is incredible explosions of trapped methane gas are thought to account for the mysterious creators in Siberia and this one yeah and so they think that it has to do something with them you know triangle as well so when biological tissue creates methane and when they have like massive amounts of die-off whether it's fish or whether it's plants or things like that they think that some of that stuff gets trapped in the bottom of the sea floor and then escapes goes up to the surface makes boat sink and even can bring down planes how would it make a plane because it was like 20 slot oh I don't know it really lost electricity would you hear that hear a plane lost electricity and I'm sure the pilot absolutely told us that you know what I mean like he's like I gets the the stuff gets little fritzy up here over the Bermuda Triangle we're buying it it's just a shitty plane he didn't shake service or you know oh my god killed my story I've been believing that like this whole time now it could be those planes shitting yeah yeah that's what they think that's the most prevalent theory I would think you die if that bubble hit you just from a lot of it right yeah maybe have you ever seen those underwater lakes of methane yeah that's creepy all right water under water right yeah yeah no it's the ocean is amazing it's pretty bizarre that it's just right there that it's essentially an alien world like I've always said like the ocean is really like space like space is like above us all the time but the ocean is kind of just like space if it's right there you can go in and that's a whole nother world it's like a whole nother world that's on our earth but we're just so used to it it's like oh yeah let's go surfing hey let's get in a boat you like floating around some fucking alien world it's right there with life all sorts of life that actually breathes water came from yeah well I was talking about it with my fro is that the lakes of methane under water that's nuts I just took a run round the shore that doesn't even look real it's like they're going around Silver Lake that's that easily just like cruising around silver Li but it's a methane like what was something like it's probably a methane like too but it's been other ways you know what was that movie where there was aliens underwater the abyss oh yeah yeah yeah she has to drown to survive any it's a resuscitator yeah right they were like aliens would assume the shape of water those are aliens in the deep I think it's probably the abyss though and there was sort of pink too they were the same colors my ball lightning remember that pink yeah the only guy that ever talked to when I was talking those UFO people that I believed about UFOs was a guy who was at skinwalker ranch that whole area out there has a shitload of UFO sightings around its some place that this guy Robert Bigelow owns and he's a what makes it compelling is he actually is an aerospace investor and he's got a company that makes all these parts and shit for different spaceships and different pods and things too why why does he do them it's his business but he also owns this gigantic ranch in Utah and we went out to visit him visit the ranch and visit some of the people around there that it and one guy that we talked to that lived around there was just regular dude I think he worked in a factory regular guy not crazy but super normal like talk to him not a bullshit artist at all and he's telling me about this glowing orb that came through the walls of his house and and floated around inside of his living room and kitchen and then took off through the wall and I said uh like the way he described it I absolutely believe that he was telling me the truth and I think that was ball lightning I think they have it a lot in that area and so I think whatever the atmospheric conditions in that area it's a frequent occurrence and because of that a lot of these people see things and then they start talking then people start looking for him and then they start talking crazy and then people start talking about like they were talking about a bulletproof wolf that appeared outta mist and like for real that was like even got that out front oh that's your greeter yeah this this guy was the only guy that made sense and I think he saw the ball lightning just like you do on the ground like that mmm just happened you know there's storm conditions but it does it occurs not just up in the sky it occurs at low altitude as well you know they say ball they don't know why apparently I talked to a scientist about this he was telling me that lightning shouldn't be possible like these there shouldn't be enough power to create lightning there's like if you do the calculations he's like but clearly we know it's true so what do we do about that we don't really know we don't know enough about lightning so when you describe ball lightning he's like wolf good fucking luck who knows yeah we don't know what the conditions are like what causes what doesn't mean there's not enough energy for lightning they can't you can't marshal that much electricity in the atmosphere I'm too stupid to repeat what he said and have it make any sense but when he was describing it to me the way he was explaining it and I think I read it as well he was explaining and what I read was that they don't really understand how that much energy is produced in the sky like that and that if you calculated like what it would take to produce artificial that shouldn't be possible again I'm a moron so talk now I wish the expert were here but was like that fascinate yeah so he would this guy was described was talking about ball lightning we were saying they don't know how to recreate ball lightning they they have no idea what causes it but they're sure it's a real thing wait we can't recreate ball lightning in a lab and believe so I don't believe so that's crazy yeah I don't think you know you're right because we can't generate that amount of power yeah we literally can't generate I mean maybe with a bomb but we can't generate that I don't know I have no idea I think we can't but I think that's what a lot of people are seeing I think these people that see things and then also the human imagination is so fantastic your memories all fucked-up memories terrible you know so you see something and then you decided something different you see it I talked to another lady told me she saw a Bigfoot and she wasn't a book she didn't seem like a bullshit artist she seemed like she was being 100% honest she didn't seem like she needed a ton of attention she didn't seem crazy and I think she saw a bear I just think she saw a bear way in the distance and she saw it very briefly because it was the Pacific Northwest he's a very dense think she saw a big it might even been on two legs cuz bears do do that and I think she saw that and in her mind she saw a gorilla it was why am I looking at a gorilla and she had a story that just got concocted in her head and she saw a sasquatch that happens I mean I I'm convinced of certain things and then I find out I'm completely wrong you know it does happen I told you you better back off the ghost um I used to believe a great deal I still pretty much believe pretty much I think basically this is my entire philosophy on all weirdnesses if you look back 500 years to what they knew scientifically then it's superstitious it's magic it's ridiculous that's ignorant etc etc I believe that that's exactly what we are now to five hundred years in the future so I don't consider it paranormal I consider it future science costar future science ghosts are future science aliens are future science it's all future science and I'm down for that mmm I'm ready to party with the future science I'm ready for that I accept that my problem is the people that tell ghost stories or those fucking ghost shows they're so faked they're so painfully fake I really believed it for a while like I really absolutely bought into it hook line and sinker it's like they're watching the little there the there's all different kinds of ghosts like the ones that look like Ewoks are not new bucks which are the ones that aren't the jet the first movie star wars and they like war their little robes and they were busy they were like oh you know the first ones yeah I don't know they didn't really have faces they just had like cloaks there were the robot cellars well apparently there are ghosts that are little cloak creatures and they scare the crap out of me the cloak ones do they move fast and I don't understand what they're doing here like but I mean you can explain demons you can explain demons if you think about like dog ghosts or wolf ghosts or lion ghosts that's a demon could be they growl they have like weird eyes they're hostile they scratch you mmm animal so you you have a real belief in ghosts the train car yeah like not 100% but but you're you have a no babe bump into them sometimes Rick and I don't see them but I feel them and hear them and that like I know go ahead little smile that little smile that's why I don't we're talking about it cuz we're on the weirdness podcast but like I don't talk about it cuz it just doesn't get a good response minded so when you bow I believe you you don't seem like a liar by any stretch of the imagination but but I have a huge imagination I'm sure you do tricking myself into something what do you feel what happens um I just bump into them like they just if you walk into a room I mean it happens maybe once a year yeah and you walk into a room you walk somewhere or something's going on and you just feel it and it's very very strong and you I just I talked to them I just say like it mostly hotel rooms let's just say if I'm in a hotel room on tour and I'll either move if I don't like it or I'll just say alone in that room I'll be like hi I'm playing a show I'm holding her for two days but I really need to get some sleep you can come to this I tell them they can come to show if they want oh that's a Larry I'm like this is what I do for a living and I try to like hear and think what they do for a living I would be psyched if I was a ghost and I found you I'm like this chicks cool get invited to a show go to the show I'm on my guest list that's nice you have to reserve a seat everywhere obviously you have an active imagination and do you think that maybe your mind fucking yourself at the time like what you saying what you're talking about a lot of you doing it because it's comforting because you enjoy it probably but but if you asked me on a lie-detector test whether I think I really encountered something I'd say yes oh for sure I mean there's been enough experiences in my life that seems like just part of future science hmm there's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake he's a scientist and he believes that things have memory he thinks that everything is memory things that's why people don't want to live in haunted houses you know one don't want to live in a house where someone died he thinks that objects have memory they can't express it but that they have it I agree with that it might be like we haven't I think it's less the object retaining it I mean it must be retaining something I think it's more our psychic ability to perceive the other past yeah that's what I think I think it's more like you see the chair and then you can psychically feel what happened in that chair I'm not really sure how to like you're not seeing the chair imbued with some aura you're actually looking into the past yeah that's what I think because I've had dreams that were like prefiguring I think you can dream if something is impactful enough I think you can dream okay let's say something really bad happens to you imagine something horrible okay I don't know this studio explodes okay a couple months maybe before then you might have a dream well let's just say something goes really really wrong or bad nothing traumatic you might be able to have a dream ahead of time that would be how you would synthesize that traumatic experience just as if it had happened before and you were dreaming after the fact mm-hmm before you've had that happen I have would you have it happened with I'm saving that for my book really is it okay yeah it's okay but it was a very potent shows over absolutely okay good but it was very convincing to me really hard to explain any other way have you ever had any other sort of psychic premonition yes really yes remember the last big fire we had in LA when it was like encroaching really recently yeah that one um the night before that fire I out walking with my son again my son he's like all over this podcast I don't know why because he barely speaks to me at the moment he's like yeah yeah fine good talk to you later and I just felt incredibly uneasy and he suffered from asthma when he was young and really badly so when it would be when there was a lot of particulate matter in the air it was just bad air conditions I would tend to be very worried about him and keep him home or you know in foreign the teachers or whatever it was just he'd get really bad asthma attacks and so I have a predisposition to be on the alert but this is the night before no fire had started yet and I just was very anxious very anxious and I couldn't settle down and I couldn't think for months I hadn't been like that I mean and I said to him I'm like I don't know what it is but I feel kind of unsafe if something happens tomorrow you have to like you have to be my witness that I sensed something was coming now you probably think on this horrible mother I never do this it happens like I think I think I've like said that to him twice in our entire life and I forgot about it the next day I forgot about I didn't think about it at all until you know we were socked in in a sort of brown muck as we are and like the Sun became the Eye of Sauron and ever you know everyone's like freaking out and we're looking at all these images and I was so distracted by all these images that I completely forgot my sense the night before and what I think that was until I remembered it then I called up and I'm like ah and I think it's more like I don't know something's coming but I have maybe time maybe the envelope of time is a little bit more mushy than we think maybe we perceive time is very orderly and very linear but maybe it's really not and it could be pushing back like the experience and maybe I had the experience before I perceive the experience or I don't know what that is but that happens to me a lot I've heard people describe nobody likes hearing about it by the way I never talk about this stuff in my real life because he likes it what do you mean it makes people uncomfortable and they look at you funny so I just never talked about it except for on the podcast what why would it make him uncomfortable just does I'm fascinated by that because I don't experience it and I've never had a premonition that came true but I do have a really good ability to know if someone's crazy I'm really good at that apparently I'm not no you're not crazy no I mean I don't know if someone's blind you can't pick up nuts yeah I don't have any psychic ability though I think you know though mmm I don't if you can tell if someone's crazy or not you might have some you might have some perception I think it's pattern recognition and data chunking I've seen I've met so many people then when I see things that are off little things that are off and you probe like you're talking little things are off more and you're like you see you're looking into the eyes you see calculations you're like okay something's going on here this is not a it's not a normal person this is a person putting on a normal mask like there's something off here it just smells smells fishy you know I just think that I just guess I mean oh yeah being batshit crazy what do you do I've had people on what I was sure they were pilled up for sure I'm like talking to them like this motherfuckers adderall to the gills like what it's like when they're at Uralla this have we're talking this is something about the way they talk they're not really let's face it that's not what it's about it's not about me it's about the future it's about children it's about the society what I'm trying to do is beyond entrepreneur I want to build businesses on they just start disinfo no no Alex Jones we got him high and drunk and he was talking about here on the show is that what goes down here look at this I am in a den of iniquity oh yeah we've got some like that's some something what is that do you want some but if I know god I don't know what will come out of my mouth good stuff but those are like Snoop Dogg type things right those are like what are they call their joints they're backwoods now they just have brown paper you don't have to have any oh my god we're literally getting high right here Jimmy do we do it all the time seriously yeah it's a podcast you could do anything take a tiny hit take a tiny head there we go that's it's definitely not crazy it's marijuana it's legal it's good for you it's a staple of civilization what will happen nothing I don't know you'll say cool shit cigarette stuff in it no that's a cigar leaf though no no it's hot just brown paper no good I'm gonna try this oaks at all settle yeah we small pot it's okay I saw putt I'm sure you do you just did I just proof does evidence worried I mean if we had a casual drink you know if we had a glass of whiskey or some plate no one would care but marijuana like oh my god it is weird it's like now it's okay like now it's finally finally it's okay yeah I agree thirty years of watching people drink really sucked yeah I was never much into alcohol no I prefer marijuana yes well you're a sensitive person that makes you more sensitive marijuana does sure really I think so for sure makes you more aware more considerate thinking about more possibilities mean that's what people call paranoia really it's like a lot of times people live with blinders on and marijuana just comes along and goes hey let's just take those over and put the spotlight and like look at the back of your brain whoa look at this shit you're hiding it's like shining a flashlight into your unconscious like didn't talk to it that is what the paranoia is I agree with that it's like people suddenly are like a self-conscious they see themselves in a new way and they're like yeah that's like 40 years of denial denial yeah and and all these different mechanisms that you've kind of like psychological mechanisms that you've utilized try to hide these thoughts from yourself or try to skip past them really quickly I've got that under control and just get past it move on to some new thing it's a common thing people love to do it that's crazy I do I feel I feel like mellow yeah it's good I like that knocked my energy down just a nice nice amount put you that's kinda what I need like about ten percent energy knocked down right maybe fifteen person yeah like a half a hit that's what you need like just a little just were you like okay yeah pause beat everything's fine eat fine I like that salt lamp that's the biggest one I've ever seen it's the biggest one I could find but it's um it's too big they don't look as cool as the small ones because the small ones there's not as much salt so the light comes through more it's one of those things it looks cool on paper and then you get it like got the awesome skull there of the long that is actually an Asian water buffalo is it's an Adam green tree shot in Australia that's really cool yeah he brought it from Australia for me when he was a guest on the part I don't he'd fly that he just put it in carry-on no put it overhead mine no yeah Chuck it'll fit it'll fit I don't know if you wrapped it up he must have because you wouldn't want the bones to crack or break get knocked around but he's being wrapped it up yeah that's pretty dope yeah he's a wild man bowhunter and he goes up to the northern area of Australia Australia all the animals essentially the large mammals are all invasive species so they have to hunt them cuz they don't have predators so he goes up there and shoots water buffalo in the bow and arrow that's cool dreamily I I respect that as opposed to other types of hunting I really respect the idea of like mano a mano right going out there and be like what don't you respect like just don't go kill them big yet trophy hunting can no fuck off yes I really it's a weird thing it's weird that it's it's almost like people hunted entirely for food and then they got enough food and they go want to shoot that thing too you know it's like they got into shooting things and it became a thing of not just shooting stuff for food but shooting stuff even if you can't justify it like there's some animals like there's certain hunts they put on where they kind of have to control populations of these things like grizzly bears and stuff like that when they started encroaching even wolves there's certain populations of wolves they have to control and then in the North West but you get to like elephants and tigers lions and like what are you doing what are they doing you're a man explain that to me what is what is what why does that make you feel important since you had a gun hmm I mean a gun you stand back mm-hmm you you sit in the bushes for I don't know eight twelve hours and then you pull a trigger just doesn't even necessarily make them feel important it's just because they can do it and it's exciting like if you were shot a rifle yeah yeah we go to rifle range it's exciting it's fun to just shoot paper put paper targets out there and shoot them it's fun it feels good there's something about like aiming boom and hitting where you want it to go it's exciting yeah and so once there was a real problem is in Africa it becomes incredibly profitable for the people that live there and then those animals are thriving because they protect them and have hunters come in and pay shit loads of money to hunt them so their numbers are really healthy which is really crazy cuz like for the longest time most of the animals in Africa that are hunted now in plentiful numbers were on the verge of extinction still are I mean maybe not extinction but I don't think that they have an abundance of the big five over there and it depends on yeah well it depends on where you are but Africa obviously is fucking huge ever see what it looks like when he took America inside but in Africa there's many animals that were 20 years ago on the verge of extinction that are thriving and it's because of hunting someone that makes a tiny little zone I mean the overall numbers you there's the other problem I have with people calling the lot of the people that hunt over there poachers they call it like poacher the poachers poaching me that's just people were poor it's all it is it's just like incredibly poor people that are trapping these animals and some of them like if they're shooting rhinos and stuff like that they're no they're not doing it because they're evil they're doing it because they're fucking desperate I mean they those are that is their game I mean it belongs to them it's their country it's their game if you believe people on animals yeah but but I think as everything like depending on your perspective how much of just like we were talking about when you get high and suddenly like your territory expands of what your awareness is same difference like this is their country this is their these are their native population of animals so it's there but like taking in a broader scope that should be utterly protected and expanding territory rather than like a little theme park for rich Westerners to come in and shoot shit yeah it's weird have you ever seen a you know Luther ruas he's a documentarian from the UK he's got a great special that he did where we went over to one of those wild game parks who stayed with these weirdos on these rich American people took over their shoot shit and he was over there for like weeks and finally just drove Lee got crazy the guy was just like breaking it down to him what's really going on it was basically just saying in this crazy accident Africa is fucked this is what you have to understand Africa is fucked this African guys explain it to him like this is the only way these things are going to survive if you think that you're gonna remove these fences and remove the profit right these people gonna come in and slaughter these things and they're not gonna think at all about the future they're not gonna think at all about preserving the populations or them going extinct they don't think about it at all they're just gonna wipe them out just like they're dealing with rhino on they know rhinos are worth thousands and thousands of dollars a horn so they just shoot those fucking things they don't care they don't their children are starving if they find out that they could sell this rhino horn and get X amount a hundred dollars or whatever they give them for it they just shoot it like that's their concern is not for rhinos their concern is for their family or their their extreme poverty I mean the the poverty that they have over there is spooky you know and in mass masks I have a buddy of mine who makes wells for the pygmies in the Congo in the Congo and he goes over there all the time and he's actually a fighter he fights for Bellator he's one of their top heavyweights and he spends like three six months a year in the Congo got caught malaria three times animal it's means Justin such a sweet amazing person but he goes over there and he says you you can't believe the kind of poverty he sleeps in a grass Hat grass house when he's there just like they do with these you know they sleep on the you know no floors this is him over there that's him with the people I mean he's just I don't know just leaves from some local plants they used to make their houses but he you know when he tells you what it's like over there and the extreme poverty and most of these people were dying because of waterborne diseases so he created this charity called fight for the Forgotten and he goes over there and they build wells and they've built a ton of wells we actually contribute to it and we there's one of our sponsors the cash app they every time you sign up for if they give five dollars to these people yeah that's amazing I mean clean water is the most essential yeah what a brilliant well there's a company called water for water for org water in the number for those people are also connected with him and they just do this everywhere they do this all over you know impoverished countries go there and just dig wells you can change the whole thing because all these people they have distended bellies because they're filled with parasites and they have all these waterborne diseases and they're just dogs don't go to school because they spend all day walk into the water yeah well nobody goes to school the pygmies like that it's they're incredibly uneducated and then unrepresented and not non respected or appreciated and discriminated against and you know this is why this guy who's this just big Hulk of a man so this is what I'm gonna concentrate on he's these small forgotten people it's really pretty amazing that must be so rewarding just to see the difference he's making yeah I always feel like such a loser I'm worried about what I'm gonna eat for lunch he's one of the fucking cargo to catch malaria he's had it three times who doesn't he just get the shots the totally stop it the problem is when you get it once it stays in your system he's gotten it again when he got home like herpes like he got it again when he got a cold was that true malaria stays in yourselves to him yeah he got it when he wasn't even over there god yeah and a finger changing my idea about my nile trip that i want to take my pocket last mile trip i want to get my little big house both things with like have you ever seen them they're like double deckers and then they have the top thing and it's just like a bunch of sort of like game zones like you're just like you know cool down on chairs with like covering it it's all very open air it just feels like you'd be having cocktails up there at sunset walking around talking all your family and friends you know what I do here's what else I do I'd make sure I had like a security boat behind me uh for the kidnappers and shit I'd have my little security boom that was like a really zippy fast one you know that would be good you would definitely need that for sure yeah fuck that place though crocodiles alone I have a friend who went over there he has a show called Uncharted where he just travels all over the world and goes with these adventures and they they flew him into this I think it was the Congo because this local village was having a problem with the people there can eaten by crocodiles and everyone in the village is like missing an arm they bite sticking out of their legs oh yeah these poor people I mean they live this is the only place where the water is they have to go they'll even create these little fences where they they like try to fence in the area so the crocodiles can't get to that spot they still get in there somehow and fuck these people up because they've gotten accustomed to eating them oh no oh no it's just territorial oh it's just like I know like a waterhole tension well animals are like they're opportunists and once they decide that your food that's when it becomes a real problem so there's really like man-eating crocodiles there's there's definitely man-eating crocodiles is this Jim shocky yeah this is my friend Jim and this guy is missing yeah it's in Mozambique this guy's missing and hand this guy's missing his whole arm defense will no wonder they Jim he's a lovely Canadian fellow who travels everywhere so they've he's a hunter and they flew him in to kill these crocodiles for them it's crazy I mean look at that fucking thing you imagine you're living right there and there's just goddamn dinosaurs everywhere no and furthermore if you can if you can get rid of the I don't know it must be a learned behavior because most crocodiles aren't doing that it's just that they're their people their brains are so small and they're so so reptilian that what they're just trying to do is eat and if it's a moving they're gonna try to eat it and if it's a person it's not like they're targeting people but they found out that they can get Pedro crocodiles I don't think they're just gonna eat any old thing I think they need everything they can eat their giant talking about eighteen hundred pound lizard that's been the same in exactly the same form for sixty plus million years you can say the same about sharks and they don't just go eat you they would if they could if they just decided starting with these sharks did people get eaten by sharks no they don't they don't ever no one's ever been usually they're like very occasionally no really they are not eaten by sharks generally we're not on taste for our blood is what you're saying yeah yeah we're not on the menu we're not on the menu but they will eat us they will bite you to get you out of their zone or they might mistake you and bite you they you because they think you're something else they don't you're saying eat which means like you sit down and you finish the meal right I think that rarely happens usually they just bite you in half and just go this tastes like shit you know and like I know there's some animals that actively target people and it becomes a giant problem like in India in India there's this river this place called the Sunderbans oh the bull sharks no no these are Tigers you post bull sharks are very aggressive and they do kill people but these aren't tiger sharks they're Tigers just the cat they kill a lot of people oh yeah yeah leave the shit out of you go sit down and like put the napkin in their collar and get like there yeah well they actively hunt people in this one place and they've been doing it for hundreds of years they said over the last 200 years three hundred thousand people have been killed by Tigers in the Sunderbans what yep over the last two hundred years three hundred thousand people have been killed by Tigers I don't know what to do with that number it's it's implausible it's insane well that's just so common first of all India is a billion people right and a lot of them are really poor and they're living by these rivers and these cats are everywhere and it's tall grass you ever seen that video of the cat the giant tiger leaping up and attacking the guy when he's on an elephant no this is yeah well shows you it shows you how crazy India is this guy's on top of an elephant and he's walking this elephant through this grass and this tiger runs through the grass and leaps up into the air fucks him up boys on this elephant I shouldn't laugh but it's kind of funny it's like California what a hell of a tiger they're they're insane I mean if a tiger was in a movie as a monster but when a scariest monster he's never like this on YouTube oh yeah we can't play it on YouTube but just yeah why can't you play it on you don't pull it down because somebody owns this they have a copyright so here's the guy so he's on top of this elephant now look at the grass and they spot it and then the thing starts Wow whoa yep it is on oh my god jump and it's going after him it knows that he's up there look at it's like bitch well if I were the elephant I just messed that tiger up tore the guy's arm apart the elephant didn't really give a fuck it's just hanging out look the elephant's like whatever bitch Tigers can't kill me can't even knots I just stomp on it pretty sure Tigers don't kill elephants but lions do and when Lions do they're really hungry and they get a bunch of them and they gang up on an elephant okay don't talk about because you're gonna talk about the baby elephants that get ganged up on first oh it's not even necessarily babies they'll take out a real elephant well not if it's not the herd right what is this trying to save a goat woman fights off tiger with a stick let the GoPro Chrysler kangaroo punching ones those that's my people mad at that guy but if you're an animal lover kangaroo was fucking his dog kangaroos those male kangaroos fight all the time they're always like punching that was just like a really fun dog so I would run right out there because it's got the dog they don't even seem real they seem to human yeah look at that burn off thinking about it BAM it's like yeah bitch I just love the kangaroo does not know what to do he's like doesn't fight you he's so good like fuck this what a weird animal but it bounces off like that went to a guy though right oh yeah for sure and also that he didn't follow up what do you think they were what was it doing like just fighting it or playing the dog was barking the kangaroo decided to grab a hold of dog and get him in a headlock and that's what they do which is really nice right like that's like generally giving you time to react a different way that's giving you a moment to not escalate yes sure because the dog if you see the beginning of the video he's running around this he thinks he's hunting he thinks he's like alerting his company in the car to the target right if you don't even seem like a real animal they seem like something from an avatar movie right I want to cuddle with them all when I see like was like all I want is to take them all home and just cuddle with them guy punch it right in the face look at the belly you know that fur on the belly is really like soft do you think that's a mama dude that's a dude I don't see I don't see well I think that's a woman it might because she's not very big well that also makes sense to that that's what that pouches were the tummy what's happening it says something what down there Tina no that can't be the penis tells huge right oh wait move it a second no that is a penis come on where's the balls maybe that's just like for the very developed kangaroo he's not gonna win many fights no he's sort of a beta there right there's some giant kangaroos those big scary walks look at this one knock on the door hey man hey man let me go oh yeah that's good that's what I'm saying when you put the dog in the headlock he could easily have taken care of that dog but he didn't he like you know he kept the head he was like I'm shutting this down I really think we missed an during I think we're misgendering that kangaroo I think it's a girl that looks like a dude see look the difference you see his car no I think that one's super kangaroo chases people because muscles is it really chasing people yeah cuz it has muscles maybe it's a female because a lot of cross the secret life of golfers like there's there's crocodiles on the golf courses there's kangaroos what else is like lightning yeah oh yeah golfers die yeah golfers they get their hold onto a piece of metal yeah how many golfers die every year from lightning strikes I say for a lot happened to somebody I know or my parents knew I was there gonna happen it he died there was like a they were all in the clubhouse and he must have stepped outside because he thought nothing would happen and yeah lightning struck wants to hear about that all the time right like people would have to come on how many people do you think Liz Phair take it guess what every year number every year well I'm gonna go with strikes over deaths I'm gonna go - I'm gonna say strikes I'm gonna say there's about struck by lightning at least a couple hundred couple hundred dollars a regular folk golfers just go just just golfers ooh I'm gonna go with worldwide United States just the United States yeah that seems unfair okay worldwide worldwide I'm gonna go with 25 hmm I like it I was gonna I was gonna say 23 worldwide I say 3 dasi night strikes average 51 annual lightning strike fatalities over the last 20 years one a year how many those guys have golfers that's what I typed in accidents how many of them are assholes with a kite with a key hanging off of it I think how many golfers die each year from lightning but how many people 5% of the annual ones happen on golf courses so factor 71 we overestimated yeah 10 to 2 and a half something like that not a lot yeah I said three you missed how bad I am at math if you can't be as bad as 51 is 10 there's no way you're as bad as me that's pretty bad yeah I'm bad I'm very bad I think that's inherited to my kids suck at math too I figure if you don't have to it's like if you can look it up easily like names dates math yeah I don't think you have to remember well that's what I'm saying to my kids I'm like look you see the phone the calculator learn how to do that I'm delegating I'm delegating that to Google yeah let Google figure it out trust in Google trust in your lifting I'm gonna do like the big picture yeah trust in your overlord what are all these that is a clock made by TGT Studios it's a guy who's a he's an artist and he makes these things all out of it's all hand made out of wood walnut and he gets these Russian what are those things called those things that are inside of it next to neck CTC Nixie tube and that's how he gets it to read the numbers and shit just 147 it's the time 147 46 seconds yeah he's badass he does a lot of really cool shit he's a craftsman he does a lot of like really fascinating stuff you got his Instagram page TGT studios do you ever check daily mail for like the hideous side of life I checked the internet for the hidden you check I do check daily mail it's like my horrible and I got this much every time I do there's a dude's website pretty dope right yeah it is really cool yeah he makes cool stuff so what do you like what are you looking for I really just want the gossip I'm just like going to the you know the well in the village I want to know what's going on it's exactly what it is but then they always sneak in something like utterly devastatingly just shocking and awful like you know they would they'd have Kim Kardashian next to like the Isis beheadings and it would be like side-by-side so you couldn't miss it and I know that that's part of like your friend the hunter the adrenaline rush I know it's part of why I go there because my might my system might be shocked a little bit yeah but it's it's a revolting impulse like that's the worst of me you get it's like a big tub of ice cream that's in your fridge every day and you know you shouldn't eat it and you're like what the fuck is wrong with me why did I do that every time I watch one of those videos after it's over I'm like why the fuck did i watch that yeah do you think that stuff like adds up in your brain like how much of our stress and unhappiness and all that kind of stuff that culturally everybody feels is because you expose yourself to things you just shouldn't know about I think for sure for sure it has an effect it's a matter of does it have an effect as far as raising awareness of consequences of devious actions or does it have an effect and that you're always worried about it and so it sort of manifests itself more often because it's constantly in your head the latter probably makes sense and then we need a cup of coffee a drink and a joint yeah just to just try to unwind X and find a group of people that you could hang out with the trusts that are cool to protect you from all those fuckers coming over the fence right every word about Russia right I missed I'm not worried I'm pissed do you see the thing that there are parking submarines over the power line over the internet lines I was wondering about that yeah I don't know like probably let us know hey fucker we could cut line with no problem if happen how fast do you think it would take before we got something back up again or how long how fast it crazy that there's a line that goes across the fucking ocean and that's how the internet works yes there are times when I will sit and dream about those lines I'll just sit there thinking I'll see this sort of greenish murk and then I'll see here the silence and that clicking sound that you're under you know with all the fishes eating snow picture these lonely ask cables just draped down the side of a cliff like in the great abyss and like I'll just picture their loneliness for a while wow that's intense whoa they're everywhere you imagine if aliens came here and saw that they'd be like what in the fuck are these crazy assholes doing wires I asked my son what he thinks we're gonna look back on in the future and think was like the craziest thing we lived with and he said wires I thought this kind of brilliant that's what a kid would say right that lives in this world today that is brilliant I was charged wires I could just play live and move anywhere around on the stage I didn't have to stand and from it the fact that we stand in front of a mic I know there's a great tradition and it's really cool and rock and roll but I personally feel very hemmed in by this mic stand I have you ever thought about going straight Bobby Brown I don't know it was like all my friends just took me aside but it works for Anthony Robbins he does it everybody he does it right doesn't he go Bobby Brown runs all over the arena though whenever it's anybody wears those it's Bobby Brown period like he did it he did it from my prerogative that's it from the rest of everyone's life yeah that's a Bobby Brown a Bobby Brown I know a comic who does that really yeah I'd fucking don't get it there's a happy Robbins look at him big beautiful son of a bitch at one point I bought the box set you know at one point I was like trying in my car to avoid my positivity look he's got some very good points he says some things that really can work you know it's like here's the thing Anthony Robbins is like any delicious meal you do not want to eat it all fucking day every day and if you hear too much Anthony Robbins like okay II fuck enough I get it be positive put out the energy it's weird too he's doing is he walking does what he does do that but here's what's interesting but we know why he's wet because he's fucking jacked and he's just running and sweating up a storm getting these people pumped maybe it's raining out yeah it could be but they do this firewalk thing which is essentially here's the thing cold oh my god I'm gonna try all this on the stage I just I'm gonna get wet yeah go for it with my Bobby Brown yeah if you have one of those you could be totally wireless right just hook it up into a backpack with a little free fare yeah free fare well she's tired that should be a t-shirt that just says free fare and it's just the Bobby Brown thing like a silhouette of your head with just the dark Bobby Brown thing of your face someone's gonna make it by the end of this podcast we're gonna put it up on to Bobby Brown I want a parabolic parachute thing over my whole stage anywhere I go don't they have that for sports now they have this like parabolic microphone thing where they can like zoom in on the coach talking or zoom in on Thanks I got this thing we're like it's very directional right a laser of a microphone so it can be up in the ceiling of the arena and then they just point it at somebody and they can go right in and hear that conversation that's like probably some CIA shit right they've been using it do you know that they can listen to what you say in a room by monitoring the window and the vibrations of normal human conversation has enough of an effect on the window that they can translate that into speech that's same whoa that's insane they know the noises you're making based on the effect it has on a window in a room you don't even have to be screaming just talking that's crazy that's crazy yeah that's real well don't you kind of just assume that we're being listened to all the dr. Shuren era where now after Edward Snowden all that stuff after you know the release ISM I feel like I've got at least two fans listening in to me at all times in your house just in know and like the NSA like to lose fares more yeah they probably poor like I'm gonna find a terrorist yeah I actually thought about that the other day cuz I screwed up my knees and I've been doing this thing where I like put my elbows into my legs as I'm sitting watching TV or something I'm gonna give myself a massage but if you were listening through the audio of my phone or anything you just think I was constantly master kind of like rubbing motion like she's never getting off she keeps stopping she's frantic like the primates that are constantly nobo yeah I mean we're gonna get to a point where everybody can listen in on everybody that's what I think I think we're only a couple decades away from that I think right now it's like content or you know service providers have the possibility to tap it into you maybe you know all these different government groups knows how to tap into your phones and tap into your TV and tap it in the camera that's on your laptop but I think it's gonna come a matter time but that's the the intrusion and privacy is gonna be the bottleneck to future technology and we're going to get to some virtual reality environment where it is so titanically bizarre and so incredibly realistic that whatever the fuck happens in the regular world is going to lose its significance it's gonna slowly lose significance to the point where we're going to accept that one of the ways to overcome some of these technological hurdles is to completely dissolve all boundaries between all people and information meaning you're gonna be able to look at anybody doing anything anytime and they're gonna be able to look at you and that's gonna be the new reality of human beings and this will be after we've accepted virtual reality so once we accept virtual reality regular life is gonna be so mundane because you're gonna be able to create artificial environments like Avatar world like you're flying through 2001 at Space Odyssey you're hanging out with the chimps you're gonna have haptic suits on to give you feedback it's gonna be tied into your central nervous system it's gonna recreate smells and feels and that's all gonna happen it's not a matter of whether it's gonna happen it's a matter of when is it gonna happen I think when that does happen the big bottleneck is going to be privacy and I think people are going to just like they're doing now with constantly putting up things on social media constantly showing pictures of their kids and constantly giving updates on everywhere you go and tagging all these things with geo tags I think that in the future we are going to just accept that no one has any privacy and kids today are more likely to accept it than we were and our kids are going to be more likely to accept it than their kids and it's gonna keep going on and on and on and three four generations it's gonna be life life is gonna be no privacy like if we were all living in like a big brother-type house it's fucking no privacy right there's cameras everywhere this people willingly do it how long before everybody willingly does it it's a matter of time right now it's it sounds impossible because we grew up valuing privacy I need my alone time I know anybody paying attention what I do but once human things are so incredibly valuable that once life changes around us and we know for a fact this is inexorable it's not going back unless Yellowstone blows we get hit by an asteroid this is life now we're just gonna accept it it's gonna go into the next thing and you're gonna deal with people looking at you naked all the time lol because you don't care cuz you're in the Avatar dimension riding a fucking dragon over a volcano you're gonna be living in a world that's so much more fantastic than the real world there's someone looking at your asshole in the real world you're like go ahead look who cares you're basically saying that we're putting ourselves in those little pods your matrix yes you're saying that we're willingly climbing in eventually to these little pods of goo and-and-and powering the whole machine age yes because we're just gonna plug in I think we're gonna be symbiotic I think we're going to become part machine I think colony yeah we're kinda like an ant click one organism with many many parts yeah I think I want to live in that is that okay you don't have to you're alive right now you're alive it you're alive in a beautiful time you're alive in the transition between when you were young and there was no internet to now you'd be an adult where there's internet this is the most amazing time ever we're lucky we're lucky we're the most lucky because we've experienced both we've experienced I mean when I was a kid we didn't have fucking answering machines no I know right you just called and hope they were home yeah and if they were at home you never found them even you open that door to your house you were a ghost you just guide be there to trust you you you were where you said to work you just went places you do whatever you want you know and that's the last wild ones that's what we are we are the last were the last of the disconnected you know we were disconnected and then we became connected in the 1990s though that's a totally new experience for human beings and we experienced both parts we were the last humans to experience no internet internet no one else will ever experience that the only way they'll experience that is if they don't have internet but the world has internet you know what I want to get back to what you said how long is the electricity down if we're attacked on the infrastructure that's what I want to know well we were talking about the internet but yeah look that's another that's an issue too oh that's all they're gonna blow is take us out too which is just as scary and probably easier to accomplish that's what I want to know about like how long is the recovery time because I do feel like Putin's sitting back there like well I think what they're really worried about other than Putin is solar flares they think solar flares have the real potential to take out the entire power grid that that's that's entirely possible and their life as we know it oh that too yeah yeah for sure that's only one thing Yellowstone's the big one that was like a STONER moment we all just stop do you know about the the caldera volcano and Yellowstone you know about I do that's the big one I do I know everybody should be fair I was worried about that although I know it's bulging mm-hmm yeah I think the Northwest part is bulging well it's just constantly having earthquakes they've had thousands of earthquakes every year for the last five or six years thousands there are thousands and a muscle of times that to me is not worth worrying about cuz there's nothing we can do nothing that is like that you might as well just the what I said they wanna know they want to dig a hole no they want to drill a hole and let some of the gas out well Wow I applaud their you know yeah they want to Lance's it and push some of the lava out what's crazy is is that that's happened to human civilization like many times over the course of history giant volcanoes blown up and killed meteor yeah bunch of that shit happened - yeah I'll be loving life cuz I'm small I think only the small thing survived right about the what hit the Yucatan is that we used to be like a mole like human beings they'd if you trace the evolution of the human being if you believe in that nonsense today if you go all the way back we were like a mole we're some kind of a mole that was the yeah literally 65 million years ago human beings are farthest mammal ancestor is some sort of a mole that survived a little big hit yeah like chicken thing yeah yeah and cuz all the upper predators get wiped out so then they can thrive because there's nothing to eat them and they live in the ground so that these things can live underground into the future like underground and one thanks for joining ours but I think we're just gonna go underground we are gonna go to Mars too though some idiots it's a poor Fox economy no thank you no thank you Pass why do people want to do that because we can you're done example and you can come back and have pie yeah it's dumb yeah and then you have to bring water or have to go get it and melt it down but you're there okay you're on Mars let's just say we're on Mars what do we do we're just Tara crying crying stop working Rock yeah I mean I just don't see the life there well I think people want to be pioneers and I think it's entirely possible that you're gonna wind up going with some really crazy people Yeah right who wants to be a pioneer that isolated yeah crazy pants right yeah see if I know a lady who lives in the Arctic Circle she lives like 200 miles above the Arctic Circle she's on that show life below zero you ever see that show but she can come out when she wants she'll come back she flies back she was in the studio not this one the old one but she was sitting right where you're sitting like you know she's a normal person I can't even take a cruise no no but you're gonna cruise in the Congo that's a river but I can't take a cruise though because I can't be isolated in the middle of the ocean with people I don't think are really on the ball like I can't do it I think that's where like the next plague starts I think does happen sometimes yeah they get the norovirus or whatever on a cruise ship and what if someone's just really into chucking people over the side like that's your move you just take a cruise I like those people that survive that I like the stories of the people that can cruise ship really and they get found who fucks finds them they're in a shipping lane they get found really I love those stories I've never heard those doors I always thought your fuck you imagine there's like almost nothing that can fuck you worse than to fall off a cruise ship but these people they they survive it you have to think of how long can you swim right I mean it's like 13 hours or I don't know monkey tread water well you can tread water longer than that sure you can I sing like a rock you'll be hallucinating right but you still be trending water you just be your tissue be tearing apart what I heard one guy talk about was how he saw like you know he had the illusion of seeing boats come by and talk to him and he like talk to people that were saying just hang on hang on longer who's all imaginary like none of it was real but he was having like a full sort of trippy virtual reality experience with his hallucinations that kept him alive longer they were like his subconscious but they would come in his mind in vessels and like stop and talk to him throw him something motivate him that's crazy I guess you could get that if you go know one of those sensory deprivation tanks or something like oh you do have one right over here shut up fuck yeah Wow yeah well do you do that regularly yeah do you have a loose Nations yeah that's right tell me the most extreme one I was in the jungle and there was some people that were native to this place they were dressed in western clothes they like t-shirts and shorts but they were barefoot which is often the case though unfortunately a lot of people that live in these indigenous villages they wear like Under Armour shirts and shit that they someone gets them somehow it gets down to them missionaries maybe sometimes bringing them but they were speaking in a language that I understood but it was in English and I don't speak anything other than English and when they were talking I was listening to them I was amongst them and I was listening to them and they were speaking in this very different language and then I realized like holy shit I can understand their language but I realized that in English and then poof I popped out of the spell like my freaking out about it brought me right it was all I don't know don't go away don't go away ah fuck it's like it was so extreme it was I could smell the the rain I could feel the moisture in the air I could see the leaves all around me I could hear the sounds of the forest and these people in the rainforest just hanging out talking this it was totally uneventful nothing was happening but they were talking in this language that I absolutely knew what they were saying they were going back and forth and communicating and I was following the conversation in their language thinking in their language and then I realized it and I woke up how do you interpret that I think first of all tripping balls right there's that there's being in that tank on what I think it was edible pot I've done a bunch of different things in the tank but mostly it's edible pot pot edibles has a distinctly hallucinatory effect at high doses especially when you close your eyes and you're laying back and just like just just letting visuals take place also I think it's entirely possible that we have genetic memory and I think it's entirely possible that like there's certain things that people pass down to their children like there's certain traits that my kids have that I watching them and I go okay how do you why are you so into this are you so into this because you just happen to be into this are you into this because you because I'm into this and some are another got into my genes and passed on to your little tiny body and now you're developing with this like hunger for certain certain types of activities literally in their cellular level of no no we don't know what's transferred we don't know how much of like what looks people have certain instincts right people are afraid of spiders afraid of snakes why why is that it's probably some memory probably somewhere along the line some memory got transferred into your DNA well the question is like how much gets in there until I told my nine-year-old daughter I'd I thought probably very little I was probably just like physical traits and that's it but her mind is so much like my mind like and especially her obsession with things I've never seen a little kid so obsessed with things like this is me and a nine-year-old girl's body like this is fucking crazy and talking to people that have musical talent or people that have artistic talent and their children seem to have an aptitude for this like an unusual aptitude almost as if they're trying to remember it rather than learn it oh I like what you just said I like that's immature I think there's something that gets trend I don't I don't know how much of it is readable data but I think there's so much information that gets through yourselves and then I think the child is faced with their own day right their own life experiences their own genetics their own hormones and all these different things that are happening around them but I think underneath all that it's entirely possible that remains some very very distant memories which is why people survived as long as they did because you could transfer some knowledge unto the kids I think it's probably less today than before because the world the world so safe everything's nerfed you know if to worry about getting eaten by leopards like it's it's a totally different environment we live in it so less if it gets in there but I think there's probably still somewhere in the operating system if you went into dass and start sneaking around you'd find some weird code from like different languages that you spoke ten thousand years ago or you know who knows whatever life expect why are kids scared of monsters those are another thing that they were talking about once and one of these things like they're scared of monsters because monsters used to be a real thing that you had to worry about cuz they ate people like cats like leopards and jaguars and shit like that was a real problem so little kids they're not scared of bullets or you know they're scared of fucking monsters that's what every little kids scared of the dark and monsters because that's in our genetic memory probably some leftover shit from when we got eaten a lot in trees yeah trees right so falling and appreciation yeah both so is that what you think happened like that you kind of access to memory cuz I was going more with like the what do you call it collective unconscious like you were seeing a present-day thing in another part of the world I doubt it no you're going back in your I think was just imagination more than anything honestly try to be really honest I think it was imagination I think I just have a very vivid imagination and it's particularly when I was lit on some okay i I've read a study where if something really traumatic happens to the parent and I don't know if this is animals or whatever even if the baby animal is born after this thing is over this traumatic event they'll have a fear of that thing mmm that was very poorly articulated I think the pots like gone through me know I know you saw I'm just like sort of I think I know what you're talking about there was a study that they did with mice and what they did with my says they sprayed a citrus and aroma inside the cage and then they electrocuted the feet of the mice their children when they smelled this is children that had not been elected when they smell that citrus aroma they had a heightened panic state yeah yeah that's what it is yeah but that's is that how they figured that out because that seems I can explain that with normal science that's easy right because they have this sense well they never they never experienced the electrocution they smelled the smell right but the smell never gave them a heightened sense of awareness and my fetus would be shocked oh you're saying they weren't pregnant no no they weren't pregnant oh this is before they're pregnant it's not even there right exactly okay so what explains that genetic memory it's a it's a piece of evidence that points of genetic memory but it's one of those things it's like if you don't understand go back to das or C plus or something like that some computer code I don't understand it if I read it's just gibberish to me or like those quantum physics guys and write all that stuff that's just gibberish so we might be just getting that gibberish going what is what's going on here no one knows right we don't know one day maybe we'll be able to read that gibberish but right now we know there's something getting passed down from these mice so if the parent gets shocked because they smell that thing and then the kids who have nothing to do with it they get shocked or they smell it and they think they're gonna get shocked something's being transferred to that that's crazy that means that we have components of our parents like right now we're reacting to stuff in our everyday life our fears our worries our neuroses yeah possibly things that our parents experience it's entirely possible that you didn't Orosz use of your parents it's somehow or another transferred into your body whether or not you accept them as your own because I'm adopted that means I have two sets of neuroses going at once I wonder doubling down on I wonder how much of my adoptive parents gave you sticks what is this Yehuda another study's authors were was an early researcher of trauma trauma and heritability her research on Holocaust survivors found that epigenetic change is not the genes themselves but how they are turned on and off by other molecules could be passed down two survivors children and change their stress hormones what is that how does it express itself though I not genes themselves but how they are turned on and off by other molecules could be passed down so you're going to be heightened they're gonna have a heightened sensitivity to threat probably probably they're gonna have like a quicker response neurologically well they say that about children that are in the womb when their mother is under extreme stress or violence sure no but what freaks me out is it's not even like a fetal baby that's reacting this yeah like complete genetic material transference yeah who knows I don't think we know enough future science yeah that's what you're into I'm way into future science I wish we lived in the future so that's where ghosts fit in I think oh I mean future science I think I just think time I think time is a illusion I think that I'm more do you ever see interstellar yes I'm more in that zone hmm that's macked of good science yes so when you say times an illusion you mean like the watch is real like if it says 4:30 that's when the movie starts right that's all real no that's just coordination mmm that's it's it's in within our species we're coordinating together we're working as an ant colony we're sending signals which happened to be time signals we're using math to coordinate but if you go into water and hold your breath for five minutes that's real five minutes no that's just when you run out of oxygen so that five minutes that is the counting of that time doesn't mean anything doesn't mean anything no it doesn't mean anything but if someone's five minutes late you like bitch you're five minutes late well I'm never mad about that because I'm always late okay hmm that's interesting well the only time supposedly is now and everything else is just our pathetic attempts at measuring it and trying to that's just coordination on like you know people like that's all we're doing like how old are you I'm and then that just means how crispy you are from going around the Sun that's not like really anything sorry yeah you're like sorry right right skin crackling you know like it's just kind of that and to me like time is just it's just space it's like how far are you away from this gravitational pull I think gravity is way more interesting I think time is just us coordinating with math well we definitely are but it's also like when the sun's coming up like check your watch 6:15 Suns coming up that's a real thing we're just clocking a spin of an earth that's the same thing with the lungs under water the earth spins I agree with you and disagree with you at the same time yeah that's fine I think you're right but I also think the fucking movie starts at 4:30 that's another human putting on a movie it's true you're just coordinating with me an example of time that is a manifest thing outside of human coordination well you could the oldest I don't mean like things happening but I mean time just time itself like is that helpful in any way other than for us I don't think it exists in the universe really well if the universe had a big bang and that was a what do you think I think we're looking at ok black holes you know say there's a train right weirdest weird a Depot ok I love that word trying to depose me pal like Home Depot or a train depot ok and there's like a giant butt of a train right huge I don't know 20 feet tall 18 feet wide filled with that likes that Shh that feeling of like oh my god there's great mechanical power and then it leaves the depot but you're still there you didn't get on it right and it just travels in the distance into a tinier and tinier tinier tiny respect until it's just a little point so you can't see it anymore did the train shrink no okay so when you see all this matter going into a black hole is it really hitting a singularity are we really can dancing matter to that extent or is it just condensing to a certain extent and traveling in the distance is it going somewhere and that's why we perceive it as gone it's maybe ever run this by an astrophysicist then they break out the wormhole but that's not the same thing that's not what I'm saying like and I think that big bangs are the other end of that process the under end of the process of coming out that's it that's a real thought they think that well every galaxy has a supermassive black hole that's the center of it 1/2 of 1% of the mass the entire galaxy so the larger the galaxy the larger the supermassive black hole the prevailing theory is that or one of the prevailing theories I should say inside every black hole may be another universe it's entirely possible that there's another universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with supermassive black holes in the center of them and you go through that one you go into its fractal it just goes on forever and ever and ever that's my philosophy and I think the whole universe is spinning I think the whole thing is a spiral deal hmm I think they think that and then within the spiral you get the eddies right which are the galaxies and uh your regularities and stuff but the whole shebang is also spinning that multiverse idea is like legit scientists talk about that now they're my different finit numbers used universes yes I agree with that there's so much more sense well it makes some kind of look the people that go all that's crazy what the universe is crazy that's crazy it's crazy that you look out you see forever that's crazy that's really fucking crazy and when you look up you're looking out you're sitting on the side of a planet looking in the middle of the whole thing yeah you're in the middle of the soup of reality but to think that that's crazy but that's the crazy as it gets like says who why would why wouldn't you think there's fucking the infinite numbers of these things out there that we're just a part of something that's so big you like if you looked at all the zeros on that number you wouldn't even be able to wrap your head around it you'd be like what what's a billion how many zeros is that how many billions is this how many trillions isn't a billion but there's no way that there's too much there's this enigma thing I love it so much and it's talking about it it has to do with why we haven't seen aliens yet the Fermi paradox yes yeah I think that's it yeah the Fermi paradox is like questioning why because there's so many different life I mean some different planets that could potentially support life there like if there's a hundred billion galaxies or hundreds of billion each one has hundreds of billions of stars how many of those have habitable planets and if if so why haven't in contact yes yeah and like the math is overwhelming that either were the first or they kill all the comers mmm or that we're like or we turn and go into the word is the the idea that we all go virtual that we become some sort of a symbiotic thing connected to this this hive mind this real electronic reality I can't handle self-driving cars I can't do that I can't no I'm not am I guess I am how can you die self-driving cars are real they're here and they suck right now because they're killed a couple of people that's insane there's like five of them on the road and they've already killed someone them on the road yeah no I feel extremely unsafe about that I reject that with every fiber of my being I Drive my own car good for you what kind of car you drive Mercedes do you rich chick I'm here partying we're getting deep we're going deep I think they'll get it down they'll get the autonomous car down the real problem is gonna be the thrill and the excitement of freedom just getting in your car turning the key and just going I'm good dude you can't do that anymore that's gonna that's gonna be a real thing that's gonna be one day no hmm I mean that feels extremely threatening as an American I feel like America to me is about big long roads and freedom yeah go where I want when I want kind of thing yeah if you've got the goods you can start a business there or whatever it is that's me as America is the I don't want to be locked into little channels going all 20 miles an hour you know like I need you want to be able to accelerate I consider driving kind of an art form it's kind of an art thing it's like a sport an activity and I don't want to relinquish that to be like a thing on a factory line well you might get lucky and die before it becomes meritorious no no no that doesn't dovetail nicely with my idea that they're gonna discover something that lets me live 500 years because I've decided that's exact perfect lifespan for 500 for me personally not for everyone what do you think that you'll still be getting after it when you're like 450 years old they'll have they'll have hormones for that they'll have everything you don't have everything for that have you juiced up my physical envelope we'll be okay it's the psychology can you not go mad you might go mad well it depends on if everyone else is living 500 years we have this conversation before we're talking about if you found out that you were going to live this life over again every time like infinitely would you be able to handle it no but why you handle it now you're living right now no would you be conscious that this was your fifth time we take someone's word for it back to the matrix Neos come back like five times he's still killing it right right but if someone came up to you right now and said Liz I'm gonna give you the reality of existence the reality of existence is you will do this life an infinite number of times until you get it right you're never gonna get it right so just gonna keep living this life over and over again hopefully fucking up less and less each time but most likely you gonna still fuck up and you're just gonna keep doing the same thing you'd be like no fucking way but if someone says do you want to end your life right now like no I love my life when you're on that plane and your whole body was shaking you're like I want to stay alive I don't want to die so why don't you want to stay alive and just keep doing it over and over and over no well is there transcendence is there a goal if there's a goal I can get with it hmm so transcendence meaning we have Groundhog's Day you know that wonderful movie yes 10 for me okay um yeah some other movies in but I loved um 90s 80s movies I like a lot of them too the genre that I really like I mean like Blues Brothers might be top 5 easily for me Christmas vacations good movie okay so there's if there's something that you evolve into I can live my life over many times and strive to be better at it but if there's no point to it all and I just have to keep living over and over and going high school again and again and again no well don't you think that human beings overall are evolving yes I think so I think even besides I think even our trials and tribulations and the things that go sideways they reveal sideways is an option to us and gets us back on track I have an expression that my mother loves onward and sideways that's good kind of gets you up in the morning when you're like I can't do it anymore yeah I like that and I like the idea of I'm very into as we sort of evolve speaking of UFO conferences I was driven in the back of Rick Rubin's Bentley when I first moved to LA my friend Norah was friends with him and he drove us to a UFO conference and I just remember sitting in the back of this huge Bentley and he wouldn't talk to me I was like not of interest enough to I kept sort of poking my head up to the front seat to like try to contribute to the conversation like no he's just like ignored everything and they were talking about the evolution of human consciousness at this crazy UFO conference it was pretty funny it was very organized it's just like any like name or something it's like anything yeah they have some good ones you know there's a business in it though that's the real issue with all the UFO stuff is that there's a business is that you get to a point where people realize you could you make a lot of profit if you just start talking about UFOs or talking about extraterrestrial invaders that are inevitably coming and when and and then everything gets murky sciences when you need to appreciate artists it's just it's not always pure you know like there's some people that look at it and that are like real researchers like there's a bunch of them that try to figure out what the fuck is going on and they make a lot of sense you know and they're trying to figure it out but they don't they don't point to anything in particular and say this this little fetus this is an alien baby and we're going to genes to prove it like you know they've found that little baby - thinking with the big head just a baby just deformed baby but what they're really looking for is aerial phenomenon right that's aerial phenomenon is one but phenomena the problem is not phenomena phenomena phenomena the problem is we don't know whose stuff that is right if it's ours it's flying around they don't tell you about it if it's some drones the government's working on that kind of maneuverability why aren't they using it what kind of maneuverability you're convinced they have they can move great speeds at odd angles is what I understand yeah I don't see us I mean they couldn't yeah well here's the thing they couldn't get here unless they were able to actually like tesseract what does that word tesseract from a wrinkle in time you know but like get my box set so they fold they fold time see event horizon no but I'm sure I'm familiar with the fucking movie yes Gary space yeah with who's in that movie Laurence Fishburne and a bunch of other people Sam the guy from Jurassic Park could those gentlemen damn it I want to say Harris but that's not his name wait the older guy the the grandfather no the one who was Sam Neill sam neill he was like one of the scientists or the top scientist that went there with laura dern who's like Laura Dern's boyfriend he's English yes pretty sure there he is there's a gentleman that's the event right he has an English accent yeah doesn't maybe just so proper I think he's English I think he's English that'll blow my mind that movies badass though it's one of the best horror / science fiction movies ever they combined like a demonic movie with space it was demons in space okay I like this so the aliens are actually demons sort of they punched through a wormhole in order to travel this far and when they did they open up a passage can--it rate the dimension Tom Tom Tom don't pay well hell being what we would do to extraterrestrials I mean think about who we are to an alien civilization let's just say they're peaceful there I mean like imagine us although we'd probably be like so evolutionarily backward right it would probably be like if we had a giant hamster wheel and visited group of armed chimps they probably would be really aware they were super violent shoot at them and sure they'd probably do something to slow that down there's no doubt right so okay have you ever been to one of my concerts no does that bum you out no not at all I was gonna ask you because I was assuming it was pretty early on I'm going out I'm gonna plug in myself now but I'm going out and I'm playing all these songs that I haven't played ever really live that I wrote grab that microphone sorry that's right people were screaming at me right now stay with me I'm gonna with um when are you performing out here soon I will be like eight shows it'll come and go kind of like a shooting star through the sky just you let me know when happening now Joe get down here um sure June okay I'm in but it's kind of an interesting thing if you play stuff that is from from a really long time ago and it was pretty rudimentary on stage can you trick it out with a bass can you trick it out with drums can you go back and like reinvent your early work do you think that that would be like with that upset an old fan you mean if an old fan wanted to hear it the way it was right like if you had an acoustic version do they want me to just exactly hit exactly how I played it probably right hmm I don't think that you can leave that up to vote because I think it would help my voice to be a STONER since I was a stoner back then it would help so you thinking about getting into being a STONER now I might you make a good stoner sitting around talking about black holes and shit ghosts you believe in ghosts like all that shit sober though now that's a scary part well I think most people do I don't think most people that are watching those ghost shows are high No yeah the Internet is like the paranormal yeah well it's library things that people are curious about and they're fun like if ghosts were real it'd be fun it'd be awesome you know it wouldn't be fun if they weren't real like oh you mean all those shows you've never been shared you've never been scared by go so you've never actually like even not I've definitely been scared I never fight humans or animals no I've been through the comedy store which was been apparently a bunch of people get murdered there when Bugsy Siegel owned it it used to be Ciro's nightclub and a lot of people that worked there apparently have seen ghosts like even my friends told me they seen ghosts you don't believe that what did they say they said they saw ghosts I mean maybe they were actually human look I've never seen an actual human opera some have told me they were grabbed Carla beau said he was grabbed and dragged he was in a dark room and something grabbed him and dragged him on the ground and then ran through the place and slammed the door outside you're kidding that's what he said could it have been a person could have been for sure people are real you know it's more likely a person he's in a pitch-black room might be one of his asshole friends decided to grab him probably drunk off his ass yeah laying down there I think you had a fight with his wife went to the comic stores like fuck this oh I live here I'm gonna make it I'm gonna be a big man and something like came into the room he tells the whole story on stage it's really kind of interesting the way he tells it cuz he he's very dramatic and goes through the whole detail of it but I've talked to several waitstaff waitresses managers that have seen ghosts their comics they've seen ghosts there but again people are full of shit right you get a hundred people one of them is a fucking moron and that one out of 100 might tell you some goofy ass fucking story because they want to be special but what happened to you that made you scared Oh normal stuff just being the dark you just freaked out to be there I'm more scared of animals than I own but anything else you need the real things you know I'm scared of real shit you ever seen a moose those are huge a giant I shot a moose I stumbled you shot a moose yeah did you kill him the first time yeah good for you I ate it good for you yeah that's true hunting yeah well it's the way to do it fucking huge they're like they don't even look like a real animal the first time I saw him one in British Columbia it looked like it was like a scene from Jurassic Park we pulled this we pulled the car over and we rolled the windows down were like what they're so big I think I could walk under it and clearer you might be able to I really think like their legs are you know you a little duck maybe at the worst they're so big doesn't even make sense like you feel like you could drive a car under him yeah yeah they're enormous so the Redwoods of deer yeah crazy animal grows giant doors on its head every year and then they fall off after they're done breeding the horns fall off and they regrow again did you did you have to wait for a long time to get it yeah we were we were there for like five days we got it on the fifth day and the fourth or the fifth day yeah same animal you saw it no no we didn't see one we're looking if there's a lot of wolves up there are you allowed to shoot their wolves yeah they try to get you to kill as many as you can I didn't I didn't I don't want to but if you're up there they give you an unlimited tag for wolves you could shoot 30 wolves but you won't you never get 30 of them they're smart as shit but we did come across a baby moose that got eaten by a wolf oh it's crazy pack of wolves was hair everywhere that was the most surprising thing it's just fucking hair I didn't think there would be hair everywhere but like of course they're gonna kill this thing they have to chew off the hair oh yes spit it out right every meal every meal and eet's has like held his correct like there's no one preparing it no knives and forks thanks to their shit to see ropes of hair and their shit yeah they don't just eat the meat like nice and clean like a bowl and chopped up meat no they're eating the hair everything yeah I used to look at those like wild horse videos so they would show that pack of wild horses and I would try to think like is it better maybe it's better it be like stabled and in a clean with nice you know sawdust or whatever I mean your pen like maybe it's not so bad to be a kept animal I'm not sure I'd like to be a wild horse I mean it seems really romantic but would it really be fun it's a great Rolling Stone song I think what it is is uh they're they're not the same thing that they used to be they're not the same thing you're right now they've been domesticated for so long do you know what to say with that genetic memory thing your day yeah do you know what scrub bull is never heard that expression scrub ball scrub bulls are wild domestic cattle domestic cattle that's broken down barriers and gone wild and is lived in the wild for several generations it changes their form they look different they look they're much more muscular they're freaky looking multicolored sometimes they've grown antlers or giant horns rather and it Australia has a real issue with them and they're super super aggressive when you think about bull riding people ride bowls and bowls go fucking crazy that's what a bull does those are ruthless motherfuckers they're just out there trying to have sex with cows and anything that gets anywhere near them they'll fuck up is their giant so these things just roam wild and they're a different animal now and people hunt them it's very strange that is a that's a wild animal these horses are still the same form as when people domesticated them they just got loose and so they're just running around trying to find something to eat they're not real wild wild well the wild horses are not native to North America oh wow horses yeah they were brought into North America the Native Americans did not have horses we brought them in from Europe I did not know that yeah well what's crazy is horses originated in North America many many eons ago but then died off in North America but prospered overseas in different places like possibly went across the barren land mash and all these different places where horses evolved and became zebras and all these other different animals like and then they the Europeans brought the horse back to North America but the horse originated in North America but then died off so these wild horses they're just domestic horses they got free so that it is kind of shit yeah it's kind of shitty they don't really they probably if you see a really well taken care of Horace they don't seem to mind it like if there's a place up here that has a stable and people ride their horses people come by and pet the horses the horses seem so chill they don't seem to mind it at all like if it's a loved horse and they're taken care of and you know they're just treated well and fed well they don't doesn't seem to mine how do they not mind that hugely heavy saddle and that hugely heavy human it's only hugely heavy to you those things are so high that a horse has do you deal with what is a big horse weigh thousands 2,000 pounds it's like you remember when your son was really little you put him on your shoulders didn't really bother you I think that's what it's like and then think of the mass that a horse carries around just a bone structure and the muscle this fucking thing that can jump over huge stacks of logs with a person on its back that is pretty incredible they're insane so what we are you know if we had a carry a person around yeah that would fuck it sucked yeah because we got school she disks in our back and our muscles give out and we cramp up and you know we weren't stupid fucking shoes and like a horse can carry a person for a long time I feel a little bad for them yeah they probably shouldn't do it when you're saddled a horse I don't ride horses no you have to pull this strap like really tightly around their barrel chest right no because they do this thing where they when they can tell that you're saddling them they like stick their bellies out Oh to try to get to sell some space yeah so that when you let go they can go like this and they're more comfortable so you literally had to like yank this thing and you're like on them otherwise you'll start to slip when you're riding you'll just start to fall like slowly well I mean it sucks that's why they're always farting when you on the trail just fart all the time anyway they probably do I just made that I'm just squeezing them but they spook like if they saw a wolf they'd go nuts oh yeah I spoke at a garbage can do you know that's why cowboy boots are made that way yeah well you feet going them loose and then they have the the heel all that is so that the heel slides on that thing that your foot sticks in what's that thing called stirrup stirrup your foot slides in and locks on that stirrup with the heel and then if you get knocked off the foot shoe just comes off you don't get dragged oh like if your foot if you have like hiking boots on with like 17 I holes and you get that pitch tied down laced in and you shove them into those stirrups if that fucking horse starts bucking and you get knocked loose you're gonna get dragged and kicked to death you're gonna be hanging on by your foot it's gonna bounce you off rocks and shit but if you're in one of them cowboy boots your feet just come right out I am now only gonna wear cowboy boots if you're riding a horse you should only work out what it's I haven't been but that's why they're so slippery that's why they come right off - they're goofy it's smart it is for horse riding yeah but like people that don't get that and try to wear like big-ass fucking mountaineering boots and ride a horse like your fuck I don't think anyone that's a real issue with people that go mountain hunting I always thought cowboy boots were first snakes that's why they were like so thick I bet that that's it - but they had to go up high enough so that a strike wouldn't get you know yeah that probably makes sense that's probably factor 2 but there's definitely a factor like with the way the heel is constructed is that your stirrup sits right on the heel and the way your foot just comes right off and the way the toe goes up it would just stay in zero you'd go flying it's really smart right what the point is tips who get stuck up there you foot goes flying out and you're done I know that was very vivid now that I'm high like to imagine my head bouncing along the trail behind the horse try to stay conscious grabbing your head or anything you're just a rag doll yeah exactly exactly no you're awfully silent over there does he give us he talks all the time he's a good talker really smart guy well we could wrap this up if you like yeah 45 oh shit spoke get out of here that did just means bye did you drive no no someone getting yeah okay um when can people find out where you're playing and when you're playing live what's the best way this is your website yes
