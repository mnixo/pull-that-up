go to the Jersey Shore three two one the great Tom Papa will be at the Jersey Shore this weekend you ever get to gigs down with flip-flop and a metal detector detector do you know anybody's ever scored through the metal detector no I mean scored like found like something bottom half yeah but civil war belt buckle or some shit never never I used I had one when I was a kid this is I used to go to the Jersey Shore it was orange and I would get TP and no here no air no uh your phones or anything I would just walk out on the beach with it never family what's the earphones did they tell you like when the frequency is different design a different sound yeah just go along so it's just like the frequency of the beeps yeah it's like hot hotter hotter hotter hotter and hotter burning aha you're there how many of those things work I've never looked into metal detectors I don't know but you know like if you take that to like the Appalachian Trail or like you know where the Civil War went down that kind of stuff like that you'd find stuff oh I guarantee you yeah I guarantee you see what is the most sophisticated current I just looked up this notice it on something couple weeks ago maybe two million dollars worth of Viking gold oh my god uh who's laughing now it's two million pounds what is that yeah twenty bucks is that four million as if double please like Dwight least one and a half to two times as much Jesus Christ Viking treasure hoard what has he got in that photo oh that's his metal detector Wow shanky look at metal detector - looks like salt duct tape together and shit it's like he's been using it a long time him and this dude found millions of dollars in Viking fines that's pretty great I found nothing I found like a bottle cap and it exciting like when you hear it's a DVD live it all the shitty film look at that vase look at that ring that's cool that's like The Hobbit ring Wow 10th century gold ring oh my god I call it the ring was saying yeah intense century gold ring that's pretty great he wore that you just got to walk in the right places I'm in the Jersey Shore you know what I mean it wasn't my dad lives in Florida on the Treasure Coast they call it which is like the Atlantic mid-atlantic or mid halfway up in down Florida like every time it's hurricanes the people are always out on the beach looking for stuff because Chicago Lana oh yeah the treasure chests are treks like in the Bermuda trying to the beach there's something about finding that too like if you want to museum and you saw a ring from the 9th century with yeah that's untrue whatever it is you'd probably like wow that's incredible that's raw that's a but if you fucking found it in the dirt and you picked it up and it may be likely I mean it's there's at least a possibility the last person that touched it was the person that died there huge huge possibility huge I mean that's an I mean how great would that the feeling would have been amazing so you ever find a fossil you ever find a fossil when you were a kid walking around not really a felling Arrowhead though legit Arrowhead weren't you yeah excited yes it was out in Nevada bowhunting I found an arrowhead oh wow and I'd lost it oh that's terrible I think you're actually supposed to leave them there so it's probably karma but I'm likely oh yeah this is a trail anyone's going to find it this is stupid like if you want me to bring it to meet here or something that's one thing right but just say just leave it there for call yeah someone else gonna come take it no one's gonna leave it there so ever tell you the story buy a brother-in-law who uses metal detector and his his uh friends married couple I think newly married went hiking in the Grand Tetons and she lost her ring she lost her engagement ring and he was going out there like a month from then and he went out and he took his metal detector and he hiked along the same trail and he comes back to New Jersey and his buddies in the bar and he just sits down next to him at the bar tosses the ring on the on the bar holy shit found it holy shit I can yeah wow what are the odds because of all the steps she could have taken yeah the places she could have gone I mean they probably told her what trails that he you know they took or whatever just still the whole trail and imagine someone telling you I lost my wedding ring on this trip somewhere you'll find it I thought the fucking talking about three on yeah the great move is not calling and saying holy shit I found it just yeah showing up at your local bar and just dings pretty gangster yeah it's pretty bad but it's like the state of the art consumer model metal detector maybe I should have a metal detector dude come on here and talk to me as oh fuck they do that would be cool because I guess it's got to be exciting right especially like places like the beach where stuff washes up yeah so you have to wear sandals when you do it give must write that you have they must have a certain body order to I was like a mildewy bittering sort of a sour milky you smell like a little like ham is it Garrett ace this supposed to be the shit oh yeah look how it popped up pretty high that goes on your moron right that wait so for 340 bucks you could find some another back here 2 million pounds worth of Viking stuff look at that thing it's Cape is that the best one see if there's like some fucking ticket lack of a member of the direct role model wool bro a look at a Camaro waterproof well ever since I went pro comes a lot of stance change Goldwater for Jesus Christ oh you went pro I went pro bro you know after the Viking gold thing right obviously I'm blessed so totally totally but was the meaning of a sponsor yeah bro Pro oh man make money off of fighting share a river you take it underwater whoa that's deep well it's actually pretty badass you know what though it's not all that bad ass there's something about the something corny but you didn't give me the best one it still likes me I did yeah it's definitely like it's in the fanny pack realm yeah I endorsed but it's like what what are you doing here exactly are you giving up just in $799 8,000 8,000 8,000 x9 go there you go gold nugget metal detector a mine lab so that alone gee open to the go up in Northern California with all the gold mines where that be oh yeah that's a move right yeah so how does that fucking thing work because that works different that only picks up gold set it on gold this other one had like on the top of the meter it has specific for like gold iron oh right like oh that gives you different readings and then this thing is called a pin pointer whatever that is oh well I'm only interested in gold see I guarantee you this is one of those things that there's a fucking rabbit hole and you start with this and next thing you know you're getting miner magazine and you're subscribing to these websites where people go on these these uh metal detector runs your wife comes into your but then and you have a miner's helmet with a light on it aren't you coming to bed wait a minute honey for real like what is it then you find out about a treasure somewhere and you go oh I can find it oh yeah that pretty I find well have you ever seen those documentaries on those guys that are professional shipwreck hunters now dude there's real crazy money in that real and if they know where a Viking ship went down or a Roman ship went down they know where they they're pretty sure there's some gold there's been several times that they have let's find out actually what the biggest bounty was lot let's take a guess we got to figure the technology's probably just improved right in like the last 30 years yeah right has made such a jump so why it's probably a good time to do it people have been probably trying to search but couldn't go down too deep or well they're really good at it now you know there but it's also the ocean is fucking huge Jenny find something odds of somebody else finding it without you telling them about it without somebody leaking some information so it's really touch and go right and these guys invest a shitload of money so they have the divers who are these people that are usually the people that are knowledgeable but they don't really have the funds and they meet somebody and that guy funds it and it's super squirrelly like who gets the money and how much do you get and his brothers like a coke dealer right someone's got a gun someone's got a girlfriend to tan and you can't everything's a super confusing she's really friendly I think so nice to me as you went to fuck this guy this can be murder-suicide it's all going to go down I watched this one and these these guys had found I want to say it was more than a hundred million dollars in gold oh my god they'd found at the bottom of the ocean but I might be making that like I know in this one this is a really good one I found their operations have to be really with the most discovery of the San Jose shipwreck in Colombia and 2015 how much okay let me guess it's really high to really really talk to him yesterday done that dude you shouldn't definitely I would have covered low San Jose I was gonna say two point four billion dollars a lot I'm gonna say one point eight billion I never would have said billion by the way you've been to it okay one point eight okay when I say two point something to avoid fourteen million what Jesus Christ to discovery the San Jose shipwreck has all the elements of a great drama international political intrigue a treasure of gold and emeralds worth up to seventeen billion in that accusations of lies everyone always project about emeralds everyone forgets about emeralds I sleep on emerald I sleep on them all the time I never take them seriously why is that Kling Kling think I might know it is like he's like yo look at my emeralds okay that's not even the best rock you could get is that weird yeah emeralds why emeralds and they're only for women they're just shiny everything other than diamonds are for dudes and diamonds aren't really for dudes they're mad for dudes are dudes no they're all for women mostly but a guy can wear some diamonds like rappers wear diamonds it looks fly yeah but it's sparkly girls like sparkle right but rappers can't wear a rubies right nice Ruby yugioh check out my Ruby right my red tail up they can someone's wearing rubies why you eyeballing my Ruby oh of course they are what about emeralds can they wear emeralds I bet Conor McGregor's where the fuck are some emeralds oh man you know I Russians yeah just a big yeah Irish is a passion yeah you could wear like oh like a chestplate leave out emerald are you looking at my am rose and if you're wearing turquoise and you're not native American I got questions yeah right if you really were turquoise and silver yeah slow down buddy yeah really from New Mexico show me your artwork show me that you're really kicking ass with some Indian artwork because it's not show me the guy on the horse I know you have you fuck let me see the dreamcatchers miss Allen dreamcatcher you oh my god man with a turquoise bracelet oh man yeah there was a little place called the silver man when I was in school it was out in New Jersey near riah high school and when I was first getting into girls that's where I would go to buy jewelry to give to my girls I remember being there like wonder what if I could wear some of this myself that I was aware of the silver man I remember there was a movie there was this great wrestling movie called Vision Quest with Matthew Modine and his friend on the shows this Native American kid turned out to not really be Native American ah turned out that was like his big hustle in the movie was that he was telling everybody is Native American talking about you going on a Vision Quest and your spirit journey and all this what it was I don't remember but I remember that in the movie yeah that is right there that too turned out to not really be Native American I was just bullshit well bad on you Matthew Modine for thinking that was a listen ativ American yeah little like a bat out he looks more like Culture Club now it looks like an Indian man come on oh that's the guy from sixteen Candles is it same guy yeah the guy who's really Molly Ringwald really loved oh really yeah remember that one you know too much about those movie it was the 80s I wanted to be that guy because he was like the cool guy but he was so cool he didn't hang out with the cool people and I'm Molly Ringwald fell in love with him that is the movie that wrestlers watch for inspiration quest vision quest that is D movie yeah that is that is an amazing movie is it really good oh I don't remember socks today yeah probably go back and watch it today it's probably like altered states a lot of synthesizer yeah I've recommended altered states to be blue and I went back or watching myself I had to come back on the air go okay stop oh really sorry why did you people I saw robbed you of hour and a half year life it's I remember thinking it was cool it wasn't the day yeah I mean it was really cool it was really cool when the movie came out I loved it yeah it was different now yeah unless you see like The Godfather The Godfather 100% holds up totally boring The Shining 100% holds a hundred percent 100% Caddyshack oh yeah Caddyshack is fantastic Blues Brothers Blues Brothers back to school yeah come on so that means that maybe culture states wasn't that great well it was different and there was a got by a lot on the different it was an intriguing story the whole thing was crazy you have this brilliant doctor and this beautiful girlfriend was also was she a scientist too I think I remember and so he takes this shamanic drug and it changes him he morphs back into a monkey and he breaks in the zoo and kills thing right that's right I remember right he was like you know in the with like blood on his face yeah he killed something in the zoo right the movie was based not really but based or I should say inspired by a guy named John Lilly who made the isolation tank director with American tank in it yeah that's how I found out about this movie I mean in the movie he actually goes through several generations of Lilly's isolation tanks and sort of an homage like he starts out floating with the the head gear on where it's like a scuba tank helmet on right that's the beginning of the movie and in the end of the movie he's lying down see that really did it in the beginning in the beginning Lilly had it set up where there was literally like a tube connected to his asshole so he could shit and piss into the water and it would be filtered out so he never had to leave the water well that would be good for road trips yeah he would uh Lilly would do it with ketamine he would shoot up ketamine which is uh like a cat tranquilizer I'm not really cloudy phobic that that looks cluster phobic it's not no no and I never had on that one I've never done that one the one I've done is later in the movie as his character evolves and as the plot evolves later in the movie he has like a more modern version the isolation tank where he's like laying flat and they don't ever mention that he liked figured out a better version or anything like that they just kind of put it in there right pretty fascinating pretty cool so it really was into it you'll see that the top one okay I guess the top one is the tube he's coming out of the top of the tube but there was another one we laid flat what's the actor's name again that was William Hurt lame hurt yeah he was cool he's a bad motherfucker him in broadcast news yes he was so good he's been in a bunch of great movies yeah he just came back recently in something I forget what it was but that John Lilly guy who made that tank yeah was a like a legitimate brilliant scientist who would take all kinds of shit oh yeah he would experiment all the time he was he was a pioneer and interspecies communication research with dolphins really have you young have you ever heard the story but the woman who was doing the research she was living with a young male dolphin and she lived in this place that was like waist high in water but so she would walk through the water to get to her furniture to get to where she would cook and the dolphin lived with her and swam around with her weight weight so she would be like up to her waist like yeah always and then she gotta come up to a platform to cook or she had some setup where she lived with this dolphin Wow they all they lived in this tank if ever heard of this is crazy and when she did it she was what they were working on these ideas that they had to try to get dolphins to recreate human words like but the Dolphins even if they're in it as intelligent as we are right which they might be you know they don't have the ability to make the sounds that we make today they have like they don't have led to that figured out tongue yeah they have a weird way of making noises yeah so they they would say the dolphin came super close to saying hello right came really close to it it's kind of weird when you hear it too there was a movie done where they were talking to the dolphins man and it was like yeah she had stuck the relationship you pulled that up I was gonna get to that Jamie mom loves pop do you remember that movie yes this is why they canceled it oh this is he says a woman in a waterproof towel so in 1964 a woman lived in a waterproof house with a with a dolphin called Peter try to teach him English and had a sexual relationship with him oh my sword of she would jerk him off did we get super horny and that's all he would want to do is fuck and he was confusing and it was interfering with the research right she didn't think there's anything wrong with jerking off his dolphin yeah I don't either look there's nothing wrong with it Hey it's like they live together but what why are we so weird about sexual pleasure like what the fuck is that man we're so weird it is a weird it's very complicated it's the driving force of all of us and you know you know it's it's a bent it and twisted and it's pure and it's nice and it's a weird thing right but if you have a friend like I had a friend who used to jerk off his dog with his foot three doesn't have that friend he figured I go free real lucky touch with videos had my sock on and I said what did you do he goes he's fucking doors dog horny so put my foot on his dick and I rubbed it back and forth and he came all over stomach I was seriously Oh No yeah he felt better and I go you know what man I think it's me I don't think it's you I think it's me I think it's me with a stupid problem in my head about it the dog likes it how come you can scratch behind the dog's ears where you can't reach and that's okay you know well he can rub his dick have you ever touched your dog's dick accidentally when you're rubbing his belly my dog has a vagina okay and I've never touched it no never accidentally no well no I don't think so touch my dog's dick a hundred times and the only five months old look it's flying all over the place mine's only nine months old and she's in the vet right now actually I got it I got a call her I left Anna it could have been a snake could it have been a snake oh she's looking swollen yes she's looking puffy in this little snake season this happens all the time you have a lab black light very possible she got bit my dog has been bitten many times really yeah my two dogs that had been bit are dead now but they they one dog got bit and I took him to the vet and he I knew got bit I didn't swallow up yet right I took it to the vet he was so excited because he'd killed the rattle stage was all fired up and I know he had killed around think oh yeah oh okay this is a disaster oh really yeah once he got it once it bit him he's like fuck you tore this thing apart I'm nice um those Frank Sinatra those my dog named Frank what a crowd that's brought on but uh he wasn't swollen when I brought in to the vet and when I got him home start swelling up like a half hour later it started swelling up and then it just gets like to these cartoonish proportions that have their faces hanging off yeah it's uh she was just acting a little weird this morning and you know really yards like I don't know maybe somebody got into the backyard I don't know but she all of a sudden her I was a little puffy and I said to my wife to look at her eyes does she look a little weird she's like I think she's having a reaction so he brought her into the vet on my way here and they rushed her right in and they're like good thing you got here early and they're going to work on her so I don't know what's up but we're trying to figure we can they get sick from eating raccoon feces you ever hear that I would not imagine be good for you I know it's because we have a train here that was like she's not eating that is she or I'm like no I'm is that a big deal I mean she eats everything right so I go yeah I'm like his that's the only thing I could think of because I couldn't well there's definitely got to be something in that I mean raccoons have to have parasites they're wild animals yeah it's got to have like some weird they're wild animals too and they eat animals so as soon as an animal's eating other animals that's when shit gets weird right you know like if a wild animal like you could eat a deer raw right and there'd be no problem at all oh yeah yeah the real problem is animals that eat animals and I mean even if the deer doesn't eat animals right so yeah the deer could get a parasite and deers have gotten worms before I've heard of people that in Lyme disease that had no no that's just a ticks cause severe inflammatory reactions yeah that's not really a tif account or many severe inflammatory will migrate to other organs including the brain oh geez oh well I've had dogs that had worms before they were coming out of there but like they didn't and as I would walking away you would see worms literally crawling out of their body okay and you're like I should have whacked you off when we had the chance you would be so confused let me put on a sock get over here Sinatra ya parasitic relationships it's like when you think about how many dogs have worms yeah is like one of the number one things you got to do your dog get it dewormed yeah I know off also often just eat and shit they eat everything everything my dog ate a magnet you know how they have those magnets we stack magnet oh yeah it's play with some toys dropping sick ass heavy mat yeah I found it in his shit oh I'm surprised it came out yeah it came out came right out I mean dogs shit racks it's made out of barbed wire you know things just go right through Chris so disgusting shits and all of a sudden a metal roll escape comes up to the shit just throwing anything oh man this dog I've ever in terms of learning eating his own shit this new one yeah he tries to eat his own shit one day doesn't anymore he stopped but I'm sure he has like recently but for the most part he does it's weird leaves it alone but when he was a puppy like when I just got him a few weeks old yeah he would take a shit and literally trying to bite this shit as it's coming out of his ass my turn me you'd have to like grab him to keep him from eating this shit as it was coming up with he thought it was like a Mister Softee machine so I can't believe it comes right out of my everything it's like look man I love you but you gotta stop doing this why Joe you won't get a cone get a cone come on but a good thing is it made me like really diligent up scooping poop up in the yard yeah I dive on that oh you got to get it up quick quick let them sweetly we bought like a special trash can you just you know my other dog same thing we're going through the same thing how old is he's a baby's five months old yeah we're at nine months yeah babies every baby one that's in the hospital baby yeah nine months yeah yeah I hope she's okay she comes home with like a mystery shit on her head it's like where did you even get this just walk saying all happy to see you with a big blob of shit are amaz on our head I killed a rattlesnake a month ago you did yeah really yeah yeah it's not a walk away like white where I was walking I like fuck this by your house yeah by a friend's house actually how'd you kill it stomped on it just went up and stopped didn't bite you know I got to it before it got to me oh really yeah wasn't a big girls night but it's dead what kind of shoe where were you wearing I don't remember it to be a nice booth it was definitely not a wise move no no it was just something in me like said like first of all my friend would want me to kill this doesn't want fucking rattlesnake in his yard wears kids live right and second of all um I think I could do it right now one of those things like you think this snake is slipping on me he's not looking it doesn't know because most people are not going to just stomp your fucking head of your rattlesnake yeah but I was like that is the move right now just try to yeah the rattlesnakes instinct is humans run from me yeah and it's it's like yet kind of you see some people tell you not supposed to do it okay and I understand what they're saying like I would not want all the rattlesnakes to die I'm not a rattlesnake hater but I have rules and if you get into my house if you're a snake near my house I'm going to fucking kill you for sure yeah 100% and it's not my house but I mean he was in front of my friend's house and he has kids that's a dead snake yeah kill that sex I personally would not have done it but it was a garter snake it was like I've seen those I don't bother them no they're not where they're gonna gum you to death no but this guy was little dogs to those dogs you get jacked maybe she got bit by a snake oh dude cease aliy easily happen I've had three dogs bit by rattlesnakes in California yeah they're all over I almost got bit by one I was well I was hiking down a little trail I might have said this last time I was walking down a trail and uh my wife was behind me and it was a narrow part and I just came around the corner and the thing just went oh just drunk right at me and I just backed up I just ran right past my wife just why are we running and he came back and it was pissed off like at the edge of the trail and this little bush and I just threw rocks at it and ran past it I could have got you I could totally didn't well this is now that's the thing and I'm still not clear on it were two miles up in the mountain they say you're not supposed to move or else you'll get it pumping through your system oh Jesus do you make a tourniquet I don't know I don't know I still I should have learned since then but the idea that my wife would have like carried me out doesn't make sense because you know go for help right it's kind of tough you know two mile hike down the mountain then back they make snake-proof boots you should look into them maybe snakes like you maybe like one those people they're like people like mosquitoes like mosquitoes like people yeah you know if I could be right nigga invited by all the mosquitoes everywhere I go there's rattlesnakes think about it you guys read you cook yeah oh I brought you bread okay now I know I I know you don't really eat it and I don't want to mess with your avocado and elk think I even occasionally but look at look at the bag that I have okay I have these bags now paper bag this is how much they're perfectly shaped for these bread oh look at that it does look really good but if just came out this morning look at that beautiful that smells amazing yeah but I figured his art into an art even if you don't want to eat it give it to your father now I'll need a piece of effort a little grit a little butter oh give it to a family tonight I've perfected my method since I was here last wow you know it's really intense but with that brand you ever hear with gentleman's breakfast know who comes from England oh yeah is it like blood sausage or something not as intense you take butter at night let it soften on the on the counter chopped up garlic and anchovies mix it all together into the butter put it in the fridge in the morning you toast some of that delicious sourdough bread a thick layer of that butter on it with some eggs on the side it's called a gentleman's breakfast oh there's something about first thing in the morning garlic anchovy butter dangerous haw it's so good it's a bold choice you don't just talk about your breath no you're not you don't want to be near people you don't want to be near people for a good ride eh you might have just eradicated your morning breath yeah I brush your teeth and then you got down with this it's sounds nasty but I'm telling you it is the most delicious thing I've ever had sounds amazing I want of amazing anchovies garlic and what else garlic anchovies and butter touch that there's three things to let it soften mix it all together chop up the anchovies and the garlic really fine throw it all in there do you know what ruin you if you get real anchovies like you've really had over you like fresh anchovies like in Italy no oh I mean maybe in a dish of something but I've gotten fresh anchovies and fresh sardines fresh sardines are the easing Sicily amazing you go with this women this is what a sardine DIAC it's not all covered in goo thick paint like oil yeah mustard yeah so fresh and chose I'm never who that would make the gentleman's breakfast even better I bet it would yeah like when you get like a really good arm Caesar salad at a really good restaurant they do it by the table the real old-school yeah it takes like 10 minutes he's there working on that thing in front of you that'd be like yeah that's a real old-school move right like tomato and Frank's type thing that's right they don't yeah I love Musso and Frank's Oh does that place 100 years old it's the oldest restaurant in LA yeah I think it's 100 years I think you're right it's like 1915 or so much yeah you get a martini in that place it is just it's just perfect yeah they know what they're doing oh it's all old-school stuff Kiwi takes they put it in a tiny glass instead of these giant glasses like they use now it's a smaller glass and then they give you the extra in ice on the side of your glass ma those guys and they look any place that has a seven-year-old guy waiting on you in a uniform look at that yeah that guy then you know you're in good shape let's go there come on go sure they clear when I go for dinner we should we should we should go before the store yes I go for steak yeah a bunch of guys together yeah isn't let a girl come now the problem is girls don't really like it there I've taken girl in there guy wife's included and not that into it they don't like an old man's pickle fingers giving you your meat so the top that turns the ladies off but funny though those places that still have that kind of there's like you can't fake that in a mall no you know to me shouldn't have like a new Musso and Frank's yeah there's like what's the REA Oz in New York it's like five tables hard to get into like where Joe Torre it's with Derek Jeter and Giuliana's the inside this is moose on tracks Moussa yeah god it looks odd I allowed us to have a bar with a couple friends I've sat in that booth like the curved booth at the back when my wife and a friend what's that one steakhouse in New York where they hang pipes from the ceiling is it called Keynes was a call teams played pipes is that the name of it yeah my saying the right name Keynes Kea and a phenomenal steak house and for some reason like back in the day like famous people would bring their pipe they would hang the pipe on the wall they would give you a pipe they would give you a clay pipe and they have pipes that from everyone that's smoked them there Einstein Patton Roosevelt all of these people and extend the place is covered with it and then I roll in there for the first time in 2001 when the smoking ban has gone into effect and you're not allowed to smoke a pipe in this legendary place I felt so cheated cheated like when I be like when I went through puberty and AIDS showed up you know what I mean it's like why us why can't I smoke and put my pipe next to Albert Einstein's yeah when I uh when I was like 16 or 17 if I remember correctly they raised the drinking age to 21 it used to be 18 yeah right so right that's right 18:21 just missed it we did just miss it Wow look at these Babe Ruth Babe Ruth's pipe pee-wee Herman no limits what ya got a pipe haha Wow

I like to have some I like a nice pipe once in a while what happened to pipe smoking where'd it go I don't know because they're they're so much more pleasant to people that are around you like a cigar drives everyone out of the room I love cigars but I like cigars so they're rude but uh you smoke a pipe the ladies aren't as offended why is that because it's more aromatic it's perfuming - gentlemen's craft I have a pipe in my in my little pencil case hi Brady I just take it out I don't smoke it I just walk around with it pack one in right now for you these guys with their pipes so the

of Jay Leno with his pipe in the old days when he was playing the improv like we are he would hi mo Brown he would carry his pipe around well could someone pull that off could somebody do that today you have to do a lot of drugs you'd have to be like that hunter arrest Thompson guy that does so much drugs let you have a cigarette holder Bragi number one hundred times he's to rock a cigarette holder yeah nobody else rock dust cigarette holder Dunhill's in the end yeah he did it because he was just so far out there that is like it's fine right it's real I guess you'd have to have really kick-ass material like you can be hacky with a pipe yeah Chris Rock you occupied yeah if you've killer killer material you could have a do whatever Chris Rock analogies divorce to go on stage one of those who have nerve velour jackets on a velvet rope a velvet jacket on a smoking jacket smoking pipe I have one of those do you get to read from Brooks Brothers it's nice thanks well give you deep pockets like you put all your pipes and your lighters in it how do you know do you walk around your house like in your underwear with a robe on ever uh yeah did you closed but yeah however I closed it's all girls in mine right in my plating is weird too yeah and what age is it inappropriate for you kids to see your dick uh I would say legit boys no age for boys no age the boys no age girls I'm going to say like three four like three fours are pretty really they would climb into the shower and and like point and laughter that you wouldn't let them look at it they can't see it now what if you climb another shower in there right there do you hide yeah like when I come out of the shower I've got to walk down this little hallway and that doors sometimes open and it's towards my daughter's rooms and I'm really conscious of and it's such a weird I catch myself a lot I'm totally naked but as long as I put everything in my palm of my hand that would be okay if they happen to catch me too much is that weak my seven year old stands from the shower-door points of my dick and laughs ah ah yeah my youngest is hilarious she's really funny man she's just like she also wants to do is go for the laugh like all the time just constantly just going for the last and that's her things that she's like really silly yeah and so it she's like really silly at school she's really silly at home that's my little and she loves having fun yeah good student yeah she's real good she's a great kid it's just really interesting to see kids grow up without the same kind of like financial pressure that I grew up with and probably you grew up with to not the same kind of weirdness in the house yeah there's no like when the dad isn't its its dad when dad's not freaking out then I got to and also you know I just think people know more about people now oh I think our parents didn't even have a chance no they were trying they didn't even understand themselves let alone understand time with you and what was going to make you feel good and most likely they were crazy young like how old were you yeah it's 20 yeah my mom was 20 or 21 when she got pregnant 21 when she had me yeah if I can go back and think about when I was 20 if somebody told me how to raise a kid at 20 yeah oh my god I'd have a grown up psychopath right now let me write a man dude I'm sorry I got the whole thing wrong I don't know how we can redo this I think about that sometimes you really have to let I left I let my parents off the hook all the time now just in my memories because like when my dad said that to me he was 28 you know what I mean he had no idea when he was 28 before the Internet yeah I think 28 today is way more knowledgeable yeah there's pockets of flat-earthers and shit out there that Rewa not curved but whereas that 28 today is way more knowledgeable I think than 28 of 20 years ago and yet so much more immature maybe some in some ways but I think that's generalizing I mean it's it's really hard to say people today they're talking about so many people you're talking about 350 million people yeah but you know the idea that people were like men and women were raising families doing all their hard work doing all that like very adult stuff right there's an adolescence now that's extended until you're like mid-30s that's true you know what I mean it's like they may not be as intelligent because they don't have as much they didn't have as much knowledge and stuff but they were grownups there was a distinction like I'm doing grown-up shit now do you think that's almost like an evolutionary course like life gets easier and then people learn more about stuff but they don't have the same sort of physical resolve that people did back in the old days they had to work harder yeah maybe and also kind of like the two kind of go together it all seems like there's a direction that people are moving into yeah think about it you know back then people were dying at 6070 now here's living to a hundred why shouldn't your 20s be a little more mm adolescent yeah you're going to live so much longer well apparently to live longer thing a big a big part of what the lived longer thing is they reduced a lot of infant mortality and a lot of is like the average of how people die it's also infections when you're younger : all sorts of things before medical science but the actual age that people live - hasn't really changed as much as people think really yeah I thought it did too but it's what it really is is that didn't Chris Ryan explain that to us I believe it was dr. Chris Ryan PhD hello author of sexathon a good friend Noam well um but I believe he was one who educated us on that that what what's going on is that you're counting in infant mortality like it used to be like if people got infection like a blood infection before antibiotics guess what you're dead right you know I mean you get septic yeah that's what you're dead yeah justice yeah you're dead rabies you're dead snake bite yeah you're dead everybody's dead but yeah but aren't people living like aren't there's more like 90 year old people aren't there I don't I would like to find that out let's find out Jim it also is probably cultural like you know when I was in Africa I was talking to a guy who was 50 and he was acting like he was at the end of his life just matter-of-factly just stoic Lee he's like I don't have much time you know and for people in the Masai they don't live that long yeah because lions he went around lion I say yeah yeah if you're 50 and you haven't been eaten yet you're like holy shit what a great runner gone the goods have smiled upon me I will continue Cecil has not taken my life says this is a March of 2016 said for the first time in human history I guess people who are 65 and older will surpass those under five so there'll be more people that are older than there are that are young so people are staying alive but are they living longer so what you don't say anything no no no they're not living longer to like a hundred years old but there's more people that are alive that are 65 so it's like people are staying alive but are they living longer like what is the long age that people live like if you don't die of something if you just die of old age what is that number and has that number moved yeah I think that number and the funny that we just fixate on that when do I die we have a manatee man you ever watch Netflix and you accidentally hit the remote and you see it like this 48 minutes left and you're like fuck now I know yes I could have just been locked into this movie I'm enjoying this what it is now yeah okay 48 minutes you know I kind of see should I hold it I pause it sometimes you feel shitty about yourself when you check you're like I'm really enjoying this why do I have to know because we're retarded I feel bad sometimes if I check my phone and there's nothing on it like why did I even do that yeah I got it like if you just obsessively like look at your phone see if you got a text why it's the word phone thing is such a life suck it is sometimes but again it's also something that just needs to be managed because it's a mate as a major connection to news you look fucked up now I get the Time magazine alerts yeah New York Times alerts I don't I don't have the alerts I'll have the swipe left and see it I have alerts for certain breaking news things and for days it was just Trump yeah so every time I probably vibrate I take a deep breath but please don't tell me we're at war amen like look at my phone please don't tell me he dropped a nuke please don't tell me that shit has gone down every day it's a new Russia shit every day it was it was so rapid-fire like those last two weeks before he took off on his vacation or his his world tour well you know his non-stop there's something that was just revealed that's really interesting that James Comey has said that he ended the Hillary Clinton investigation early because there was some evidence that was introduced against her that was clearly counterfeit and some in Russia yeah and so he didn't want that evidence to leak gives me now crazy is that I know well that's what I heard I heard some congressmen on Face the Nation say that he said this is why this is what is going to getting get get scary about all these leaks and stuff because they're taking the information from the emails from people say like you know the emails from the DNC whatever yeah and they're leaving ninety-nine percent of it perfect and they put just one little line in it says something that's heinous or says something about somebody doing something right tour it or something and they put that out mm-hmm that's more dangerous than just me in the old days you just try and like watch some big story now to just bury this one little item in this huge dump of information yeah how do you sift through that how do you yeah I don't know you made something and it's been leaked to WikiLeaks how do they know that it has been altered exactly is that something that they do checks on do you know find out that's what the only thing that it's like but it took a long time you know in the initial dump it was like just going through it now what's this right but it takes a long time to sift through it and see if that's really a true story or not does that what you eat is like bubblegum right now yeah I mean they're raised II though would be an amazing feat if they could verify 100% the veracity of these emails that are being leaked they can probably verify the sources yeah but whether or not they could verify that this hasn't been altered in any way I don't know maybe we'll go to understand the technology maybe they can do that they'll probably get there I mean they've got to be working on it what's a fuck back that's my hope philosophy with everything in life right now someone's working on that right well it is so crazy really clear away here we go so it's working on that but the app they have been working on that yeah I'm trying to figure out a way to use it for fuel it'll be cool they think they can do it too they think we're you know who knows how long away from using all of our nuclear waste as fuel Lou we're like I don't know a rocket ship I don't know they were talking about using making batteries with it out of diamonds remember that they were talking about using nuclear radiation from nuclear waste to charge diamonds as batteries and I'm my dier Trek stuff I know it sounds like great horseshit we have like this one little orb of stuff in my tire I needed a second Jamie a standby right now does it seems like they can't it just says like they can't actually confirm authenticity of the stuff they're getting they can't of the you know WikiLeaks so when WikiLeaks gets an email they can't necessarily guarantee differently confirm it but then they did at some point like it they couldn't with the Hillary stuff in the beginning but at a certain like now coming home yeah so Connie saying that one thing seemed to be counterfeit so one thing being counterfeit is like okay how do you know like what they're not going to release how they know yet right this is a whole crazy haunts imagination going to go on with him and this you know knowing dollars and yeah yeah it's yet it's big stuff it we gave time stuff it's weird I don't know how weird it is I mean I really feel like I feel like Trump was running he didn't that's no he's gonna win they were just like you know they were still deLee still a businessman they're dealing with Russia and they're doing with all this stuff they weren't thinking like politicians like this might look bad one day then holy shit he gets through in the momentum carries and now he's the guy how it's like oh so man afford probably shouldn't have promised made that deal with them and you know I think you know I mean like all this other he kind of got caught up because he just wasn't he was a businessman he was doing that stuff but he definitely wanted to win you know you don't think he expected to win I don't think you're on to it now he's still talking about it like holy shit i won he says that everything every time you ask him a question you'd be like so what do you think about palm trees who we save those I don't know but you know it's really hard for a Republican to win the electrical college but I did it did you see the map I just put up a map in my office about it not just because he likes to congratulate himself partially but he's also like oh I don't see it that way now I see you from him as extremely self-congratulatory did you not get part of his whole shtick like when he talks about a television show say how it's number one because he watches it right all the ratings you seem to have the guy out of the way what the fuck was that about he's the to him and I out of the way and then straight his jacket like a guy in a move and when he pushed my the way he grit his teeth like get the fuck outta here wow it's so nuts so weird who's the guy who pushed out of the way weird he's the leader of Montenegro who's just coming into the European Union so he's there like this is my first time with all the with the whole EU is my first time being here and they're coming down for a phony Trump shoves him out of the way and I like strange this thing like I'm alright the glowing the glowing or terrorism the top counterterrorism globe kind of find the feet you seen the photo from the other angle like which shows what they're looking at like all the desks and then crazy see it like no I just it's the fucking pictures preposterous that's everything that every conspirator back to theater everything every conspiracy theorist is fucking terrified of you're right there's a dude behind him who's dressed in traditional Herrera Arab garb Yeah right he's out a gun yeah the Saudi guy's probably worth a trillion dollars he touching the globe the other guy where's he from with his perfect suit and his Iranian face yeah alright he looks like Middle East and gentleman also yeah etching that globe then Trump with his expensive suit on his crazy hair he's touching that gov'ment and the light coming up from underneath like a scary camp the fucking Burning Man is a movie touch they're holding on to a globe at the same time it's glowing this so weird a comic book I know it really is a comic book this has seen Star Wars what the fuck is that it's so crazy why do that we need a mama one hole out of that globe no Lego ball be like hold on what are we doing oh the globe is glowing okay what does that represent I don't think we're gonna pass on the globe why is it why is it glowing raylene explanation for this exactly can we take this let's take a picture by the fountain instead fuck just solvent this is so hot it's so odd it's a big oil grab and now I understand why dudes are out there with the fucking metal detector man simplify life just looking for shiny rocks gel shit I am Telling You this bread obsession of mine is if things are going well I'm probably not making as much bread but to just go in simply and just be making bread with the news off and just put on some Bob Marley and just go and make bread and give it to my friends and family it's a calming thing in these chaotic times I'm not you know it's corny I'm not trying to be corny but I really believe that back to basic it seems like people are just like let's just simplify things this is out of whack totally let me just well bread is a task right now you've got your ingredients you know what to do and if you do all the things you're supposed to do it'll come out this delicious amazing food that you can eat yeah and yet it's elusive like it's you have to tend to it and into craft yeah right learn it right so this task it becomes this thing that your mind is fixated on and you can fill your consciousness with the nuances of this task yeah and not think about all the bullshit like these fucking weirdos grabbing globes exactly make sure weird oil deals off with all the other question we were asking about we were trying to was trying to double Jaime Montenegro well the deaths averaged out death oh yeah oh yeah I didn't really get to yes and well 78.8 is what it hasn't changed from 78.8 for men yeah but I think that's still based off that infant mortality thing added into it right yeah I think that's always added into it it's just like right out of like a James Bond totally this is like x-men that's like Star Wars like you just make sure the Vader to like be at the end of that and the guy comes in after his to give the report on what happened seriously though could you imagine being trump a guy who used to host a reality show on NBC he's a successful businessman you know he's a well-known guy but I mean how much of that is a ramp-up between you or i or a lot of people that we know that are famous how much of is like Jerry Seinfeld is Donald Trump a ramped up in popularity over Jerry's and so I guess he is now the down president but when Jerry was on TV and troubles up there kind of commensurate you could yeah he like Jerry Seinfeld being president is what I point sure Ronald Reagan go back to that original picture that we're just looking at just a couple frames ago now go and think of a guy Lee Alec disco full screen on his fuckin thing imagine Jerry Seinfeld and all of a sudden Seinfeld gets invited to this League of Nations said it looks like a superhero comic book scene in one of those movies I mean there's a goddamn picture of the earth that's a light that's on the wall all the light on the floor is blue there's little spot lights everywhere it's all freaky and clean and perfect is these little screens in front of every chair like what the fuck is this this is where all the world's decisions get made yeah it looks like the what's the Peter Sellers movie when they with the bomb strangely I look like I just changed radically look like it actually look gorgeous I mean why would we expect them to make more sense than us yeah that's the thing about world leaders like they're just people and they're people that have an extraordinary amount of power with not nearly as much oversight right in most countries right and most of these like Middle Eastern countries and most of these I mean they don't really have to fucking tell people what they're doing they do whatever the hell they want yeah for sure a lot of these places that we have relationships with if crazy human rights violations yeah I mean you get look you have to deal with you know good and bad you can't really another look at that man imagine someone like Seinfeld there imagine if he won like what if Seinfeld became president defending like this person what is it a globe what are we doing with this thing in the wall well I can't I mean my translator Trump is he's I mean we we always think of like politicians the same way I used to think about celebrities before I met a few of them yeah when you go I was just a dude he's just dude right he's just a guy yeah just a guy yeah yeah so happen to be there come famous yeah well I think that's kind of the same way with politicians we've always thought of people that's one of the reasons why we've almost like allowed them a certain amount of leeway when it comes to instance a you know getting caught in corruption and lies like with there's a certain amount like she's a politician right he's a senator yes what they did let it slide let a little bit of it slide but if it was like a friend that was doing that you'd have like serious problems with them yeah you know yeah but look it's things have to be a little dirty because you're dealing with everybody you know you're dealing with everybody there's so many interests you got to that's what a politician is it's a compromise it's playing both sides it's trying to get stuff done you know I think we've gone to this this absurd point of misinterpreting good for flawless you know what I mean right there are right there could be good people who are have a lot of dirty stuff going on no one's flawless the idea that based on the internet we're able to get all information on everybody all the time we can't hold people to a standard of being flawless it doesn't exist but I think you can be good while still making some you know you can if you set that that parameter that bar you're never going to have people that are good enough yeah and you're going to have these weirdos that have insane egos because theirs are the only ones that are willing to take the punishment of being criticized with Trump's taking it right now yeah you got to be but you know who's taking it away that no one's ever taken it before you could say he deserves it yeah I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not making a judgment call saying well it is absolutely fascinating the way the media and the way people online are treating this president the United States it may be justified I'm not arguing that it's not yeah what I'm saying though is in it's a very unique moment in time where you see so many people attacking the press well it's such a rush I mean you know you could say I was having a discussion with my teenage daughter about navigating online stuff and seeing what people are doing and it's almost like the president is going through the same thing that you're going through as a comedian that teenage girls are going through this is a flood of information and accessing the tax and praise and everything from everybody all the time 24 hours a day yeah so the same way we have to navigate you know with haters and all that kind of stuff the same way kids do the president has to deal with a flood that's never been this raging before yeah I mean it is an intense intense thing and it almost is like who else but somebody built for television yeah is ready for this job at demand not even him but what is that like politicians were always like a thing not like you or I but then all of a sudden they are a thing like you are I because now it's Trump and he might not be like the average person but he's like you or I you know I almost did a show when I was doing the reversion the new version of Fear Factor he invited me to do it and I thought about it for a while but I would had to live in New York for a few months and I don't want to do that the new hire factor was coming out the old low the old one like in 2011 or whatever hell it was and we debris did it again yep but I mean he was new I've been with him I got but it could have been hanging out with him you know I'm saying like came on the marriage riff yeah i sat with him on married trip we hung out backstage he the first thing he said when he walked into the dressing room was we're gonna get great ratings tonight we're gonna get great ratings he was so focused and he was impressive like he was tall he was a dominant guy in the room and yeah then I'm sitting on stage with him and we're all talking about married couples it was like a like a you would show real people and then you'd discuss their marital problems and the celebrities would weigh in and the whole time he's right next to me in the whole time he's making jokes about the girl's breasts he's just like you know nothing really just being funny he was being funny and he would be like well you know she's got something going for her and then he would look at me and give me a little wink on the side and it wasn't for the cameras it's just for me and it felt kind of creepy but it's kind of but it's like he was just a dude he's a gyrating there with me right an equal footing and that was the President of the United States think about how powerful there's not one human being I don't believe in the country that doesn't have the word Trump go through their brain whether they say it out loud or not all day all day all day or at least a couple times a day you know what I mean it's so insane yeah there's initial disbelief then there's an aftershock and now there is a waiting for the next shoe to drop everyday everybody is sitting around waiting for the newest scandal everyday waiting for the impeachment waiting for the lawsuits waiting for the jail you just want calm I mean you know you have a great joke when you you've been working on about uh this isn't a job for one person yes right yeah this she really should be a committee of people running this country it's too much for somebody and I love the joke but I think that what his job is what that president's job is more than anything is to just lead people you have he has power all those people in those positions they have power and what they say and what they do affects people not policy just the Reaganesque Pro carry themselves carry themselves make you feel good about the direction all occur and right now everybody's filled with anxiety yeah because he's not doing that part of the job well but he still goes on Twitter and calls people losers and you're like wait it's like it's like a kid like you're saying before it's like a kid hearing like having a dad be batshit crazy in the house the house is going to be crazy yeah if Dad is shooting heroin and anything on the couch is covered in Cheetos and yelling at the wife the whole house is going to be freaked out yeah that's what's going on but is that the price that we have to pay to realize that our system is ridiculous is there any throwing the card-table up and is there any value in that thought I mean other than the real issues with the environment the rolling back standards on the EPA and all the different things he's doing to freak people out yeah Dakota access pipeline which I don't understand enough to know whether or not they were going to restart that anyway I know Obama shut it down right and then Trump brought it back again who knows if they had made some sort of an agreement yeah you know who knows how that works who knows if they you know how that business is very dirty it's very dirty totally you know I mean it's you know you you could make a case that all of this is a big oil grab right I mean well the Dakota pipeline stuff is terrifying Dakota pipeline stuff the eat the head of the EPA is an oil guy the Secretary of State is an Exxon guy the people he favors more than our Russian more than our European allies or Saudi Arabia and Russia big oil business partners you could say this is just business as you and it's right and the thing is and this is what's so complex about it it's okay so maybe it's an oil grabbing these getting as friends rich but oil also is so much more than just what's coming out of our cars we are so deep in oil it's it's it's not I'm my whole my main thing is the planet in its beauty and trying to sustain it I'm a complete believer in climate change and all of that but to deny evilly say we can just shut down oil and be like we can all just move along it's so much deeper than that my nephew is a went to just graduated from school and he's big agro farming guy like that's what he wants to do with his whole life his revelation was that oil and food are so interconnected all of the fertilizer that's creating all of the food that we're eating every day is oil-based he said so you're trying to separate emissions and all this stuff but just the food that we eat is so tied to oil we need oil so I don't know how you fix that and how you try and make good policy about it well um there are alternatives to fossil fuel based oils um that they use to make plastics I know that I know they can even make class together hemp oh yeah yeah it's biodegradable and they've just started to make these biodegradable natural fiber plastic bags that are not they're made out of like a plant plastic yeah like in the supermarket yeah I put your vegetables in those yes opposed to they'd well they'll day will when they go into the environment they'll actually biodegrade they will become dirt again right so it's like a regular plastic bag which probably takes like a fucking hundred thousand years uh yes it's been birds you didn't die and choked on the plastic caps but apparently you can make plastic out of hemp and it's super easy to make in terms of like it regrows itself very quickly like if you have a forest and you trying to make paper like you know you try to make hey Bret uh you know you have a forest timber that you chopped down specifically for paper to regrow it to the point where he could grow paper again to two years yeah I don't know how many years for many years whereas hemp regrows itself every year really every year yeah well what is this right here Jen's uh edible plastic made out of milk protein whose a reason for food packaging holy cow not vegan yeah yeah but I mean under packaging like dairy products one not with it at least is what the video shows but that's fast this video yeah like two days ago well that's certainly something that can be worked on you know the idea of biodegradable plastics would be huge yes the scariest things is that we started making waste and never had a plan to do with anything do anything with the waste and then it's stacked up to the point where you know we're dealing with enormous amounts of waste being put out by human beings every single second I've ever seen it I was just walking I was in New York last week just work in the Comedy Cellar all week and every night I left the club just on MacDougal Street just between third and Bleecker the amount of garbage that's thrown out of these restaurants and these juice places and coffee place stacked weight high yeah all the way down the stir every single day you see rats darting in and out of them of tons of rats so tons of rats oh they're creepy yeah it's we are we are a weird creature man there's so many of us and we're not really thinking about that like you think about how many like on an average day how many water bottles do you come across in LA where she's like 10 of them here in this room I know I feel guilty drinking it I got gas this morning I threw a bunch out of my car I drew a little garbage yeah when I got gas you know through the garbage cans hesitation is like so many fucking water bottles I have my car it's crazy think about how many times someone had to make plastic and how many bottles of plastic are being made then that plastic has to be in a landfill somewhere or you know in the ocean giant island in the ocean yeah that big plastic bottle island yeah oh it's terrible apparently it's not quite an island they call it an island but it's really just like a floating patch oh yeah but it's disgusting it's horrible it's really bad so we just figured out a way to there's so many people yeah just I mean there's so many of us yeah like I'm well for farm-to-table and like knowing where your meat comes from right I get it I want to do it I'm trying you know but when you think about how many people are looking for lunch at the same time all those mouths looking to feed I mean you need like a McDonald's somebody's got to feed these people you know what I mean well she that way there's there's definitely an issue for sure I don't know if you need a McDonald's but you might you know if you need food and there's 20 plus million people in this area that are growing anything other than the occasional pot plant Rayburn I have a friend in the kitchen I'm growing my own basil I'm growing my own pepper I mean who the fuck do you know that grows enough to live off of I know you can't do it nobody you can't do it unless you live on a farm yeah nobody's grown enough food to live off I mean not I mean just the people you see like on the 405 just feed those people you know what it is to have like on this great Memorial Day weekend if you're gonna have some people over and have a little barbecue you bring ten people over you gotta you gotta get some food this is some serious amount of food you need to feed 10 people yeah billions of people and then they want to eat again in an hour yeah and they're all the other chips jiminee soda call in a soda do you have taking dumps in your bathroom filling up your fucking pipes there shit think about how much it is going on the bowl ah chewing on a rib and taking a dump think how much shit is going through under the city every minute comic store um has a bathroom there's a new bathroom they just put it yes other that's it backed up last night oh no yeah they have old pipes in a new bathroom I don't know what they did to replace the pipes but something went wrong hopefully and I walked by the bathroom last night I was like what the fuck is that oh no I don't talk about the smell of shit outside of the water that is just so lovely so Chris back to the dog thing this is my we're talking about our dogs like rolling and shit and stuff my cousin dog the other day they people coming to paint the house and my cousin's wife

podcast why I don't know they were tiring of it one other podcast they did he went to the bathroom and I guess it didn't go do a good job of wiping and then he reached back and felt his butt and then smeared his face like war paint they got taken off youtube for that you know I'm weird I would've followed YouTube would get behind that it's terrible brendan is so fucking you boiled his brain out

months man yeah I know vanished for four months without talking to anybody and then he shows up in flicker it's time to tape this TV show again yeah it's not a bad move well I mean I guarantee you he had some crazy stories there's no way he doesn't yeah because he's probably out there making stories happen to like knowing there's gonna need some story yeah script yeah all right now I mean his whole show is a story the whole story if you know it it shows one of the best shows on Comedy Central is it's really good I really hope Comedy Central never cancels I think it's either really good one of the best shows on Comedy Central yeah it was the best stand-up shows there is it really is good and I did it twice and I get more hits off of that than I do like stand-up sense well it's just different yeah they just see worries you're talking about stories and it's also different because I got cause like Henry Rollins did it yeah she's not even a necessarily comedy a great storyteller so he'll do the stand-up comedy storytelling show and just tell stories and the settings really cool looks good like at strip club yeah yeah really and here's a strip club outside of now I want to go there one day when he's not filming the show just go ahead and get what it's like when you really see it really like we're seeing like yeah side of it that's not real now you're seeing like Atlantic City in the daytime it's like it's a very different thing but like what happens when the Sun Goes Down Atlantic City in the daytime is true yeah is that stripper on the floor with him hey good bunch of girls jnanis fuck is this shit yeah it was it was fun when I was a kid there was no girls the wind strip clubs none zero now everybody's like ha it's like going to a sports bar yeah it's like girls who go to cigar bars yeah I'm kind of like you guys one guys right right right that's what we're here to not be with you right now trying to trying to test your resolve young Tom pop up trying to calm down they're trying to get you to come over their side slowly but surely they turn you know man she's cool she's different from all the rest how about the guy who brings his girlfriend everywhere how about that brutal motherfucker yeah gonna have fights over your house hey man you wanna come over watch the fights yeah sure I'm bringing Cindy oh you fuck you fuck anyone ask it's cool right guys who don't even ask just open the door you look good he's over the house laughs and people drinking pot smoking yeah someone's jerking off the dog with her foot and then she comes in are you guys never gonna grow up I I did that once in college I came in there and I was the guy who brought the girl and walked in and you could just feel from everybody the hate was so thick and they just got so silent and changed the vibe until you got her out of there there was no other way that there's a guy comic it brings his girlfriend to everything and then expects her to be able to talk on podcasts there's a special place in hell reserved for those gentlemen you know who you pussy whipped mongrels are you get your shit you get your shit together and don't you ever do that again yeah look you want to go to dinner sure bring her along you want to do it fine Mike's problem is that he doesn't listen to me enough I know that's so great you're here to tell me that that's not what I want to do right you see the same exact thing if we showed up for one of their Fifty Shades of Grey parties they're all wearing ball gags yeah ready to get to fucking tie each other up with stockings and we show up oh great you brought Jamie no yeah a guy going in with all girls you ruin the whole night room or the vibe man yeah so I put a Tupperware party all of a thing Tom makes bread I meant Brad ladies to seal on this knocking me enough keep my bread fresh ya know we ever see girls at your shows and there's like a whole table of girls they're so free and they're so they're laughing they're having a good time one guy sits at that table ruins it ruins it yeah because he's playing sexual politics with at least two different girls I too might have a girlfriend there he's a little too friendly with her friends getting pissed off you complimented her dress with torches your friends maestro's you look better now you say that you didn't have a fun ah yeah how you doing great uh stand stand by me just in your face if sometimes just need to it's you need a break you need to light a cigar and be alone mmm get out of that yeah well too much it's absolutely important for any friendship any relationship any time two people interact with each other to take time apart from each other so to space you know all the time like if you're on top of each other each and every day unless you're a really unique couple which I have met before they are they're out there they make you feel really bad about your own relationship you everything together and they're always looking each other and laughing yeah no we're great we work together and we play together well we just get along we finish each other's sentences while they're holding hands all the time yeah it does happen it does happen I hate them well you know what it is man it's just like they found that frequency that unique personality frequency because often times I am your frequency in someone else's frequencies just mmm they're just off yeah that doesn't mean you know love each other like one person might be the who and the other person is the doors right okay we got to figure out what we're doing here yeah this is yeah we both really like the Beatles yeah my only friend be and how can you believe I've no no no you're too hyper to ever really different I know what I'm doing and those two people are together for 15 years yeah but claw nature's throat's it's really interesting when you see people that are cloning each other's throats oh yeah yeah okay that's a good question who would you rather be around the couple that's stabbing at each other or the ideal couple who's making you feel like your relationship isn't so great well the ideal couple for sure I want your unhappy people yeah I want to be around people that are enjoying each other's company there's nothing more frustrating than being around to people that insult each other like slyly in public full brutal we know a couple of the Hartman's wife used to do that all the time really yeah they say shouldn't speak ill of the dead but when they kill your friend and then kill themselves I think you're a lot of talk shit absolutely there's no reverence indefinitely but they had a very combative relationship and she's to talk shit about him in front of us really Yeah right in front of him and us it was just like she was saying he's old and she would you know he's like one time she's talking about her car they were tough it was talking about a car but can fills a car aficionado what he knows so we were talking about a car I forget what it was and then she goes I love pickup trucks I want to get a pickup truck all my boyfriend's back home at pickup trucks and you just picturing her getting stuffed in the back of this pickup truck by some fucking farmer boy some dude thick wrist little catcher's mitt hands in here just laying his fat dick they let me take his pants off but saying that like I don't know it's terrible it's just weird and we're constantly like that she was always belittling them always tearing them down they would have these horrible fights man I never understand that it's like you're together like it's for the good like his success is your success and yet they'll still tear them down well people don't think logically yeah I know what you're saying but that's not a logical thought yeah I mean that I think they just didn't get along great you know for whatever reason still was really fucking smart - he was the coolest he was a really smart you're so lucky you got to know him yeah he was um like I mean he would do things like he learned how to be a pilot yeah so he would be on the set and during the downtime he'd be reading aviation books she's sitting there reading going through him he was the most studious guy can those discipline with his notes he would have his script and each one of his scenes that he was in would have a certain highlight like like a tab like a green tab or whatever the color tab was and then all of the scenes would be highlighted he have notes beside them traffic parking and he would just every time he would nail it every time use the incredibly rare time where he would crack up during a filming yeah you know I'm just having fun yeah it's never like you fucked up but he never fucked up right I mean everybody fucks up and laughs when you're not supposed to laugh because it's funny but he was on his game he was so professional because a very very very intelligent man well he was hard on to write yes did he start out like designing like design album covers for bands yeah yeah before he was ever even on SNL he was also one of the greatest for pee-wee's Playhouse right I mean he was on TV yeah he was on pee-wee's Playhouse and I think he wrote the first movie I think pee-wee's big adventures one of the writers really yeah what a great that's amazing so you got to hang with him a lot you guys hang all the time he took me up in his plane he did yeah it was crazy so was he gonna buy a house and he was suggesting on his different areas and he said what do you like I said I just like quiet I like peace oh I see things that are pretty alien nature and he's like okay because I think it is an area like right around like Thousand Oaks area won't you check this out fairly take me up in his plane Wow flying around and look who's crazy that I'm driving on the one I want to go and he had like a small plane and great freedom you have when you have a plane you ever want to do that fly yourself yeah but weird way to go when you know this fucking planes dying on you I've had cars die on me yeah no I know the mechanical end of it are you mechanical are you I'm not really yeah I mean I know certain things but it's like someone saying yak took karate when I was 14 right I ran my own stereo in my Toyota Corolla I did that right I wouldn't tell you that I can install stereos yeah yeah I know a little bit about cars I thought they loved them yeah I do too but that's the thing it's like I feel like if you're gonna have your own plane and you got to be ya know really knowledgeable and on top of it and you got to know your limits and that's kind of my limit yeah it was intense man the landing was intense a little tiny plane manages a little two-seater plane so me and fell and we're coming into this land my Jesus is right there like Roundtree crazy it's weird a small plane and knowing that it's like your goofy friend from the second yanking you in well he was always um like an older brother to me was in a set yeah he was he was older than me taller experienced at least eighteen years older maybe more maybe 1718 years older yeah and he was a star already right he's yeah he was a star yeah like when he was little great we were on the set he is in movies all the time you know he was just getting off Saturn line and you know and then of course Dave Foley was a big star from kids in the hall yeah he was a big alternative star to like everybody loved him and because he was so smart the acting was so good then Andy Dick was like a known weirdo and so it was a fascinating little great heroes yeah great crew I remember spending a whole summer just watching Phil's best of SNL disc oh so fine and stuff that wasn't even a hit like him playing the acting teacher oh I mean I was in a loop I could not stop watching it who so this is something this is nothing this is something this is nothing and then he was like she's been somebody it's like sir can I get out of my class it just it was on the money a hundred percent of the time yeah man he we always stand up to for the audience for fun oh yeah he would like warm up the crowd but we're good you know he was like putting together almost like a little routine that he would do well and we talked about his like I wanna go on stage someday well you just never I don't think you ever really did it though he could have easily done it and it's a wife to God well hey man she was troubled you know choose a troubled person and she was also on Zoloft and cocaine oh my god which apparently leads to psychotic thoughts and it's apparently a very bad combination especially for some people yeah people have their own particular sort of human neural chemistry they got going on up there and with some people and I do coke and zoloft together just makes them insane yeah those are the real one of the real losses as a fan of his is that he was the kind of guy that the older he got the better he would become oh yeah he was playing guys who were older than him he had that very fatherly intelligence older kind of vibe anyway yeah so his as a 75 80 year old he would still be killing it yeah I think I think there's a million different kinds of tragedies but the big one is those kids had to deal with the fact killed them and then killed themselves committing to two hits and then they went and lived with family afterwards whole thing's so dark it's so sad it is man it's the worst but I mean it was it it was all so it's just more evidence of what happens when people are in those combative relationships they just don't know it don't gel together well you know you have somebody look if you ever been around like just a toxic person yeah and it's like just one on one you leave you're like it's an energy that just drains you and then imagine living with that person yeah it's got it's too much work yeah too much work but you know he ever dated somebody it was really kind of toxic it's kind of exciting at the same time you know times the freaky ones are the the most fun in bed yeah really crazy ones yeah it gets a little crazy sometimes sometimes when you're young - sometimes those breakup makeup fights are awesome yeah you know when they come back you didn't think they were coming back next thing you know you're making outbreaks crazy if it's in then you hear the cops like what the fuck you call the cops call them before I knew we were getting back together Jesus we're okay you're okay no it's fine we're all right now I read an argument oscillating on the roof I saw a house on fire yesterday really yeah like up the street from me a hole like a house ablaze the roof was ablaze whoa it was up in the hills so they had to us bad yeah get the fire trucks up there but then they stopped it like it's still standing today but the roof is all but I've never seen like mmm a whole house on fire dude I saw an entire house out do you that's how we do it was a big white Oprah she's like a little but when I was working doing fear factor in like 2003 it was 2002 or three when they had that giant fire there was a giant fire it was like on the way towards Bakersfield up to five and we were filming up there at Tejon Ranch where there's a lake and we were dropping these people off from helicopters for Lake and normally without traffic it's about an hour 20 Drive our half drive to LA right from from Tejon Ranch but this day it was bumper-to-bumper and a guy died a guy ran out and got hit by a car and I saw his sneaker and I saw him laying on the side of the road like briefly as I was passing while people are trying to attend to him and I'd you know I didn't I didn't like see his head splattered anything like that but I saw his leg and then my friend Matt told me that guy wound up dying so and so that was the beginning of this eerie drive home then as we got closer to LA it was literally snowing ashes and the entire right side of the highway was ablaze she like as far I'm talking like a mile in oh my god far as the eye could see it looked like the fucking Lord of the Rings she's like I was waiting for demon horses to come riding over the top perfect like and just like really like the it was insane there was tornadoes a fire I mean it was fucking fire everywhere and you're in traffic at that point we're in traffic so yeah sitting there Lee removed from it by a patch of grant of asphalt God and I'm telling you man I'm not bullshitting that side of the road was like that for an hour an hour of driving like the whole right side was on fire yeah that's and so when we were coming from the 101 we're coming up to 101 towards like Encino yeah and the entire right side like over the crest of the hill over near the 118 yeah a Simi Valley area ablaze just a blaze it was crazy I got evacuated from my house really yeah yeah yeah threw the dog in the back of the truck that gun gravely and I opened some stuff no this is Johnny Cash and as well the side effects match was dead at the time but it was it was crazy man we you know they're intense here yeah people in my neighborhood you can see them like stuff packed to the roof and shit coming out like car rows of cars people pulling out of garages and shit was trippy man that's the problem stripping some of those like more remote areas it's like oh no he's surrounded by beautiful trees but after a couple dry summers and then some asshole with a cigarette yeah kablooey yeah you know so it was fire is fucking terrifying man because I talked to his fireman and this isn't scared to shit out of me because there's been a few of these big Rock'em Sock'em fires that have hit the LA area most of most it's in the summer when the winds kick up yeah with antennas yeah yeah one firefighter told me goes dude it's just a matter of time before one day of fire catches and it goes through the entire city and we can't do shit about it why should I go really and he goes yup he goes it's just the right conditions the right wind the fire coming from the right amount of angles to the wind taking the the embers in the air lighting more houses on fire oh my god he goes it's just a matter of time for one day goes right to the ocean I hate the it's just a matter of time guys rain the earthquake just a matter of time before this whole place just falls off into the ocean yeah that's like glass-half-empty squared yeah just a matter of time before the big plague hits takes us all out they do say that a lot a matter of time before there's no more food left just God but where do you want to be do you want to be somewhere you don't want to be a prepper right no you don't want to be the guy who dies of starvation because you can't figure out how to get by no you will you what you want to be you want a couple you want to try your best buddy they want to be Rick from The Walking Dead who goes through several seasons of horrific events and yeah basically a shattered man by the time I abandon the show yeah or do you want to be one of the people that gets killed early on so it's to wrap I probably go somewhere in-between get a little adventure meet some new people make some mistakes you think you got together and then wacko but isn't like The Walking Dead the ultimate existential crisis because if you do die you're going to come back as a zombie yeah like the only thing that can free you is I guess you shoot yourself in the head like you would have to shoot your in the head because if you shoot a zombie in the head they just stop being a zombie anymore somehow or another right button you know I feel like they're getting very wishy-washy with the zombie rules lately I don't watch anymore yeah me neither I watched like a total kill the zombies definitely aren't consistent in their ability to fuck things up yeah these to be able to tear apart horses and now they can like you just push them aside like get out of here yeah and they're like these bony little things and yet they're kind of strong I don't get it yeah and how here's my question what are the why aren't they rotted altogether by now like warranty just a bag of bones that's what's guess because they're not real did you see what happened a big sir what they're big sir Ventana whatever ranch can you ranch whatever is theirs they're completely isolated they've had giant mudslides and that part you can't enter or exit the town oh yeah they closed off like the one yeah you can't they're completely isolated right now and they think they're going to be able to open up the road coming from the north by like September what and they don't know if the south is ever going to be repaired oh my god yeah go go back go go go go it's crazy look at that but let me see what it looks like look at that what's the title you have the title obscured Oh landslides buries California scenic highway and Big Sur if you don't know Big Sur this is like the most beautiful part of the ride between LA and San Francisco oh my god the one look at the fucking landslide yeah they think that the only way they're going to be able to do it is to just build on the landslide it's that much dirt more than a million tons of rock and dirt fell double look at that it's insane the landslide extends a quarter of a mile it's just Mountain now the road is covered a layer of dirt 35 to 40 feet deep how many people are dead in there I don't think that many the highway runs through Big Sur which is a major tourist attraction Dora T's have closed all access to the highway and don't know when it will reopen I would get us fucking shovel all you need is 100 Mexicans it'll be done by tomorrow hey those people work hard metal detectors bullshit about the wall you have these massive let me show you that example we clean Bolivian metal detector yeah about that how you go crazy look at today I mean back to people died there's million-dollar there's a what is the Henry Miller museum and they make servant Anna all these beautiful places where you would drive up and be able to stay overnight and eat on the coast you can't those places are isolated there yeah they weren't covered in the slide you just can't get to them yeah so what you got to do is go buy real estate there now yeah so these would be panicking selling cheap you're Right Scoop up a nice nice scenic view magic that's your house sitting up there chilling and all sudden you slide all the way down to the ocean and that's how you died so cray just think I finally made it I got this beautiful view look at my deck okay Jenna come on over bring bread Joe you did I can't believe you did it did it buddy we're having a judge it's still moving we haven't be able to go up there like this it's still moving hey Joe is the Yard supposed to be moving like that it is we had geologists and engineers who are going to check out this week check it out this week and see how do we pick up the pieces the highways oh my god yeah thanks around the California coastline is a major tourist destination Cruz called the landslide one of a kind but it happened like a like a like a month ago and then there's just like last Saturday another chunk just went so it's like it's still in motion yeah man that's what keeps me things like that or keeps me from living on the ocean I know I rented a house in Malibu and one time I got super baked in and I went down to the bottom floor I was only in this house for like three months it was like oh it was the bottom floor bedroom was like the water would literally go under it right and at night guys it's fucking horrifying it's scary in the daytime it's gorgeous like I'm looking at me see that blue water and so inviting but at nighttime that water is dark and the sky is black and like oh my God he's like shows you what it really is I'm in the ocean you're here at the whim of this ever-changing see you are riding on a gamble yeah that gamble is what are the odds that it's going to shift now you know it's going to shift eventually that's right this house is probably worth like millions of dollars and it's just sitting on this water crazy you don't even have a front yard or your back yard is the ocean there my cousin has a place down down toward San Diego and all these beautiful multimillion-dollar homes on this cliff and they just keep shoring up the cliff they just keep putting in new planks got concrete rivet and they're just hanging on it's like someone someday is into out of mind when it goes down people probably man when you're sitting there at the sunset and you're though it's just you in the ocean yeah it is pretty spectacular might be worth sliding and eventually yeah I think you would you have to have is super baller money so you have that house on the coast and then you have a house somewhere else or you don't have a family and you just to do the surfboard like this is the perfect spot yeah if I lose everything so watch so what I rent a house somewhere yeah I've done it already yeah you could do that yeah that would be a good mother you don't want to you don't want to want your kids get sucked away by the tide how do you the minute you're enjoying that pipe I do it's good rank little buzz I wish I was a gar though I do now you know I was actually thinking about bringing cigars today I think I remember if you said we could smoke in here yeah we can well in the new studio the new studio is like a mythical place which you talked only once it actually exists people going oh he wasn't bullshitting yeah it's you have been talking about it for a while a new studio we're actually having ventilation systems put in the ceiling so that I can hit a button and it'll suck the smoke out of the room that was like race clays here dice likes to smoke I like the smoke he'll smell it doesn't smoke a pipe will make me nauseous that's awesome yeah and then you go home smelling people won't get secondhand weed smoke too so it won't put you under right people complain about that um no I would never smoke in front of someone that like has an issue right like that was a if you've had people have come on that has specifically requested me not get high in front of them they didn't know me that are like yeah that are in the program they're like please wear I have them do drugs in front me yeah that makes sense they get a little squirrely I Llanelli I'll bring I have a I have a big box of Cuban cigars was so nice strong they are stronger they're big-time Cohibas whoo so nice the head rush after is like yeah you might as well go to bed I used to like those Hoyle de monterrey double Coronas big fat post steak cigars yeah I have a big steak and mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives after Musso and Frank's you ever go to the cigar place next to the improv no I have not I know that spot if not I've never been in there if you were doing two shows there screwing around it's a nice little hang you want to get away from the club for a minute mmm just sitting there there really the guy runs it's great it's a good spot that's cool yeah I really like the improv man The Improv is a different vibe now I've been going there a lot lately having yeah it's a different vibe it feels good everything feels good now man comedy feels great it's a good time it really is last night was beautiful what did you do last night well one of the things I did that was really interesting I did a podcast with my friend Owen Smith you know Owen loved Owen he's a lair it really makes me laugh funny good good that's good that old holid guy good guy yeah anyway Owen has a new show that he's coming out with called something notebooks with Owen Smith and what it is is you find your oldest comedy notebooks and bring it out and go over your material and I found some notebooks from 1990 that's great I had a list a set list from 93 new material list from 1990 through March of 91 Jan was like needles through my soul reading off my line it's so hard terrible bullshit just I haven't I was 21 he is this is really saying something man I had I had orchestrated crowd work I'd like written in frog oh so terrible it was so bad I showed it at all I showed you the can it's okay you're learning I have a tape I have a cassette tape video tape VHS tape of me doing stand-up at stand-up New York like in my first year oh my like 93 and I am 30 pounds heavier tight jeans I think I'm wearing a vest a curly hair and I would lunge when I would tell the jokes like this Elvis kind of lesson come on baby and I would I was talking GERD to hear if they were gonna laugh or not that I would just go thousand miles an hour just yelling but I thought it was just like Kinnison without the joke I like catch you if you pause for a second not what I didn't give a split second I just went you know that one thing that some comedians will do especially in the early days where they like say a bunch of things in a row and memorize it the audience will like clap yeah and at the end they're big memorization it's it's the closest you get to a guitar riff exactly that I thought but I found with that in my opinions where dice had everybody beat in the 1980s because people would go to see him and I would repeat his lines they wanted to hear what's in the bowl bitch as we have the whole audience do it just like a fucking rock concert easy that you can't that's that's a one-of-a-kind experience ya can't replicate yeah I mean dice had something that was different because they were going to see stuff they already know yeah that he was a lil I'll hickory dickory dock fuckin crazy ha ha I'm still saying no weird out what I hang out with dice yeah to this daddy was a rock star well when I'm in the room with him I weird out I can't even believe those dice cuz yeah it's crazy though he was so big and my girlfriend learn 19 we're sitting in my car yeah I was dating this hot Nicaraguan girl and he see a great sense of humors hilarious but we're sitting at the car listening to this fuckin Dice Clay tape just how right laughing it was so so you're 19 that is like the perfect kind of comedy for you oh god you know sat on a tuffet little boy blue he needed um gerrae see him do along set back then was it i only so like short sets yeah like i want to seem live um I saw him a couple of times yeah then I saw him would he do that the whole way I saw in a store a lot in the 90s right and he's just sort of fucking around but when he'd come to the store it wasn't like a set like a concert set right it was like he was working on new material he was fucking around just working out when he we do long sets I mean everyone was waiting for the nursery rhyme so yeah so still does Nursery Rhyme stuff I saw him me and Jim Norton and Anthony ku Mia and who the fuck else was it I think Bobby Kelly and bread ban I went to see him in Vegas at the Riviera that's great which is just recently know obviously the Riviera is dead now yes I think it was probably five years ago maybe a little more but god damn we had a great time the whole set I saw his whole set and it was Craig's great he was a monster huh dude he was a killer and even the Woody Allen movie I'm sure yeah he's really good Islander yeah really good that Woody Allen movie weirds me out though that was it movies all weird me out now because of how crazy because of a guy because of who he is who he is yeah yeah I think he's still a brilliant director great screenwriter but it's just like you almost just certain things you know you expect you know uh he got hooked on pills that happens the eyes a boozer happens yeah it turns out he was gay oh yeah happens ah he's fucking his daughter happened bent told was she when he met her yeah she was - yeah oh that's that great a great joke by um emo Philips what is it Woody Allen adopted suni when she was four years old started dating her when she was fifteen patients of a saint honey did you start dating when she was 15 I rather like that I don't know I don't know it's Christ but you know you find out anything about an artist you're gonna not like them right but here's here's the question again is it me is it me is it the same thing about my friend jerking off his dog with his foot is it just on me I mean what if I mean it sounds gross but what if after all those years they really were in love with each other does that make sense seems like it now right I mean he's an old man it was that ol enough they're still in love and hanging out and was that unacceptable I don't know it's unacceptable if people get hurt no one got hurt well you can't do I mean there's a lot of dangers before and after yeah but I heard some of these are I heard there was some weirdness and somebody was weirdness here this is a little girl and he's with her and then he wound up marrying her but that's weird man it's just weird well he didn't make her well look he's not arrested he's not in jail so it's not a legal right and it didn't everything it wasn't there a case I mean didn't they investigate and find him find him innocent of all this I don't know man I'm the problem like I went on with these accusations to I mean you know the accusations of that stuff is so huge even if you found innocent I that doesn't compare to the charge mmm was he found innocent like did they go to court I don't know if he was criminally tried I don't think he did anything criminal so there was no evidence - even I don't think so I think there was a time where Mia Farrow was saying that he had done something to one of their other daughters right yeah what he was saying that the daughter was coached by Mia and that me is crazy right and that she's furious that he wound up with suni is a crazy it's all crazy but I'll tell you I can shove it aside and watch crimes and misdemeanors over and over and over yeah so when the great I know it's only a long time what was the one way it was the the space movie uh sleeper sleeper yeah I was a freaking movie Thanks so so good just what he's doing now and he's made two movies year for how many years I means to make two a year yeah doesn't ya the spring project the fall project you know it's really in vicky barcelona midnight in paris midnight in paris is amazing was really weird watching Owen Benjamin Donato on Benjamin Owen Wilson Owen Wilson Bailey doing with him yeah I mean he really was doing a version of Woody Allen and it totally worked it totally worked totally worked I mean Owen did a great job oh that movie was so good he was really like he was channeling like a Woody Allen like even the way he read the line that same vibe yeah just that just any exists is amazing and tolerating ridiculous shit you know like they were both tolerating ridiculous shit from each other and having affairs yeah you know just the parish exist isn't bad and you have a beautiful film remakes amazing work well he's a weirdo I heard it weirdos have weird thoughts I know that in the thing like some more creative I mean whatever reason I know and I just don't have the connection that like Ronan Farrow obviously has to it he can't watch those movies but Tom Papa sitting in is a place watching the movie I'm not connected enough for it to bump me out of watching the art yeah all artists are freaky if you'd get down underneath it I'm sure there's a lot of people that we adore who did some pretty heinous shit yeah what someone like David Carradine dies wearing a wetsuit with a dildo up his ass hanging in a hotel you know didn't need I am like an autoerotic asphyxiation yeah the guy from INXS same thing yeah like a lot of people died doing work really freaky shit and some weird stuff and people are weird Jesus don't don't dig too deep it's better just to know people on the surface or just let it go except yeah you know but that's just the only I mean I'm almost always willing to do that almost always willing to do that but the Woody Allen one makes it go yeah but the Bill Cosby one does not make me want to do that I don't want to that one is just like I got to write you off yeah forever yeah ever right drugged and raped 50 women yeah that one definitely that so that's a lifetime write off if he had made crimes and misdemeanors maybe I would never leave Albert just took that up didn't what about realm of the lansky Dee can you still watch Fat Albert all right Harry hay is like Fat Albert difficult to find I doubt it because it seems like Fat Albert kind of reinforces certain racial stereotypes that he might probably disagree with I became older I don't know there was a little moral stuff there and wasn't everybody getting along yeah do you remember that was always the the rumor that he had bought out the Little Rascals and then he had kept it from being aired because it was racist yeah because of the buckwheat stuff yeah that racist stuff in it was that true I think that was Snopes and I think they found it wasn't true oh really yeah that he bought it and bought the rights to it and wouldn't let it be shown yeah find out that's true there's a lot of racist stuff back then dude we're talking at the Comedy Store last night about how people in the old days used to smack people like how often you'd see a movie of where like Humphrey Bogart would smack someone in the face yeah and then why not make it out with her yeah it's just how it went smack each other yeah women would smack men men with black women smack black I love watching a it's a mad mad mad mad mad mad world whose are you never seen that oh come on it's one of the greatest comedy films of all time who's it Buddy Hackett Oh Jonathan winters Jack Benny Mickey Rooney Henny Youngman really I mean Milton Berle Wow I mean it's endless it was just always Spencer Tracy all put in this crazy film about a trying to race across from the desert to Santa Monica and Phil Silvers all these I mean great it was like the comedy film of its time and it still holds up still great to watch you would love it you have to well the thing I love is everybody screams everybody it's just yelling at each other you moron you idiot you got me into this one who are you oh it's so cathartic in a time where everyone has to be so reserved and say the right thing everyone's just like you're a moron slapping each other in the face it's so much fun people just harsher to each other back then oh it was great I mean it's a different world right that's a totally different world not that long ago you would little rascals in Bill Cosby did Bill Cosby status false it says origin Spanky alfalfa buckwheat Darla just a few the easily recognizable names were a fun part of the childhoods of generations of kids beloved characters blah blah blah this is the rumor that started around 1989 when you get Little Rascals now you can practice by it online I don't know if it's opinion on Hulu or anything I didn't look for that this is it's been in licensed in the syndication since 1997 Bill Cosby has never owned any part of the rights to Little Rascals oh so it's bullshit another one the popped up had said he tried to block Amos and Andy from being on TV to or something yeah and CBS with Guler syndication no Amos and Andy Ted Turner had bought up the rights the TV show The Dukes of Hazzard to keep it off television because of his demeaning put the demeaning portrayal of southerners that series is cool this is old that is it's currently syndicated on TNN it's not anymore neither realize but that's not true either they don't um they don't air it anywhere anymore right isn't that the deal like they didn't like digitally remove the Confederate flag no there was a something today about the Confederate flag oh man what was in the news today about the Confederate flag well some the mayor the mayor of New Orleans has given one of the best speeches I think of our lifetime that guy did the mayor what else did some terrible today oh really Civil War Museum closes after spat with Confederate flag that's not it it is Beach you something about someone refusing to take down the Confederate flag Confederate flag comes down accusations fly there's something no no I don't think that's that there just be searching he'd be searching but it was some another politician who was refusing to take down the Confederate flag and you know Mississippi has it as a part of their state flag oh really yeah maybe state flag is like a Confederate flag in a corner right the mayor of New Orleans forget his name gave this eloquent 20-minute speech about the removal of four statues in New Orleans robert e lee Civil War era things so eloquent the points he makes it's really about togetherness moving ahead we have to realize that this was a part this is a wound to our country and it never healed right and this is part of making it heal right and taking down these statues try and explain to a five-year-old girl who lives in this city of what that means yeah but it was put up right after the Civil War to let people know this is the way thing it was a white supremacist supremacist movement to put those up there you explain that to a five-year-old girl how are we going to move forward in the culture if we don't get these removed this is about hate this isn't about revenge is about moving forward he twenty minutes in a time like we're talking about a rush of just news and constant noise and chatter and tweets this guy takes 20 minutes eloquently calmly makes the case in a way that my paraphrasing doesn't do it any judge that's all the proof it's a bulletproof case bulletproof it's so great yeah you know I think the problem with the Confederate flag and even some of the figures in the Civil War they get connected in a lot of people's mind to southern pride yeah like where they're from like southern southern pride yeah Leonard Skynyrd you know that kind of shit I mean like Iran and he always had that fucking Confederate flag in their shirts Ram I know I mean it was it wasn't just a racist symbol of white supremacy but it is a racist symbol of white supremacy it's both yeah you got it right and you got to kind of give that up and have pride you can still pride in the South you can still be a kick-ass southerner who loves the South for all the good reasons you know what they need to do they need to come up with a new flag like there's nothing wrong with the South having a flag yes long as the South recognize it's part of America like that that's just something that replaces the Confederate flag but includes everybody right like something is not connected to a totally meant to try to keep slavery that was one comment he made to is this was a move a flawed movement this wasn't fighting for America this was fighting to tear apart America right and we need new symbols you know the perfect example is the flag of Texas with the star yeah badass that's that's its that's like Texas might as well be its own country right yeah and that flag like that means something yeah you know they it's not about right supremacy it's not about Texas is a badass place that's a badass flag you have to have a mentality to live here and it's inclusive mentality if you're a Texan you're a Texan it doesn't matter if you're black or way yeah I know they really gotta let that go man they're coming and you know made me think that the I was always kind of back and forth on the Redskins and the Indians and now white pride is the thing it's just like what because you and your grandfather used to have held a horde and the Warriors it is very to you yeah here make sure your first football we used to go watch those games together me and my grandfather ran wide you're telling me we can't be the Redskins anymore with a few liberal pussies my friend made a great point he said just it's a business man you would just say if you own the Redskins all right we're changing it all that old merch people are going to be paying through the ass to get then you have this new logo everyone's gonna be buying the new stuff just it's going to be a windfall just from the merch yeah just I mean if if you if you're not if you're not think about the socialist you think of it as just a dollar issue and go for it people don't want to give up ground in a sense because they're worried that crazy liberals are going to come in nerf everything it's not liberal it's just being nice well I know in their case it is but it's one of the things that people worry about yeah they're worried about giving up ground if we're so ridiculous today they give up a little ground they'll go fucking crazy no more Taco Tuesdays cultural appropriation yeah I can't serve sushi if you're white yeah I know people start getting really wacky we can't believe it up ground doesn't feel like it's running out of steam a little guess I feels like it's becoming more and more preposterous like penis yeah justice warrior is a really ridiculous thing at this point they really feels like it's become so absurd yeah I mean from that I think there's a correction that's been made I think there are people like taking more things into consideration about other people and now we didn't really think about oh yeah for sure those families are with that group or whatever but yeah I've been done yeah good you know I mean that's how it always is the tide goes out the tire goes in you can't explain it yeah now right that pillow ride yep no we don't remember that mmm was one of the worst arguments he ever had on a show is talking about how he's putting his chips on Jesus because you can't explain why the tie goes in the tie goes out he's talking to some guy was an atheist who was he talking to Dawkins no it wasn't Dawkins David Silverman okay it was so dumb maybe she saw Margaret Mason you know you can't explain it but you can't explain it according to here you hear so stupid that's a scam no I don't know you know I'll tell you what and you know built by and I'll tell you why it's not a scam in my opinion all right tide goes in tide goes out never miscommunication you can't explain that you can explain why the tide goes I go there Todd going to water the tide comes in and it goes out mr. Silverman I may be always going on top of Mount Olympus who's making the tides go away that's great look in his eyes like yeah I can explain that yeah what's fucking the talking about and there are Malone it gives us gravity right it causes the weight come on man it's terrible you can time the tide you fuck yeah I know exactly when it's coming it's such a bummer being smarter sometimes as a bummer it takes away yeah he's not dumb I think he's deceptive I think Bill O'Reilly just crazy yeah I know it's amazing that he got kicked out of Fox a millionaire they kicking everybody out hannity seems to be holding on maybe he's like one of the only leverage noticeably dorjee's yeah yeah they don't have enough starid on him selling crazy fuck party over there all they do it was I tried to get laid I feel Riley's beating off on the phone I read some article about he call women up and it did beating off he's talking I'm like whoa remember when the transcript came out he was like I want to be the loofah on your body fuck the workplace boy yeah so disgusting the wood but odd right yeah you know I know that that whole place was running like a it was like the Cosby thing is like once the one came out was just rapid fire yep well when you have a guy who's got that kind of power yeah is that you know it's just so weird you had to get bored you mean again the weird sexuality thing right like to manifest itself in this guy in this way and those opinions abusing these women those fucking shows to like all these shows like when we really think back like we look back at 2017 from the future and we looked at the state of the media today yeah and how I one side whether it's Fox News or whether it's CNN if we so heavily leaned in one direction or the other so obviously editorializing what's going on the news their opinions of the news well it's all just entertainment it's so gross I mean you know when that horrible thing happened in Manchester at the at the concert it's like okay that act is heinous and what happened that night to those people is heinous but then who does that all of the other work of scaring the daylights out of the rest of the world CNN running it non-stop for 48 hours this grainy footage of young girls screaming and crying so much more powerful than what that schmuck did blowing up those people in that place they're they're just as negative a force for the public then the terrace but they don't care they're just trying to get attention there's one if it bleeds it leads that's right it's a big story Harlee know that people but what is their responsibility isn't their responsibility to report on the news because that's a news story that's a giant crazy tragic event and sure it would be remiss if they didn't report on it right you can report on it but you don't have to have me walking with my daughter through an airport and having it blaring out of every television set the girls screaming you could have grown up sitting there and analyzing it without sensationalizing it but it's entertainment it's as big balls out Entertainment Network it's heinous I think that's a real good argument that when people watch it and voluntarily look at them the air can't escape it yeah I cannot escape it I was trying I was working on this book I was at the end of this book I had a deadline I'm just head down not trying to follow anything but I was traveling at the same time Wolf Blitzer is popping out in bars in restaurants at the gate Wetzel's pretzels more breaking news Trump did this now in order that you can't escape it so much presh there's no responsibility about these like you know be an old man be an old what happened like the news reporters being like a shitty guy but just can't I deliver the news like a grandfather with the news they're running ads now in CNN of them like Wolf Blitzer and another couple of them walking through the hall it's like those ESPN ants member yeah an ESPN would likely be walking through the network through the offices via and making jokes with a mascot that's what Wolf Blitzer and kamau Bell and all these people are doing on CNN what are they doing I don't want me there walking through in the like Hey look there's Anderson Cooper what's he doing in the office and it's not a bit yes these are the people that are supposed to be delivering the hard news tell be rationalize and make sense of the world Hey look at him he's in there what's a magician doing in there and a punchline yeah well you know what really disturbs me when they do that podcast thing where Anderson Cooper does that 360 where he's sitting into a desk and they'll have four people to his right for people to his many people there's nine people the last time I saw nine people yelling at him eight people and everyone's talking over each other right and some people never get a word in edgewise and people are just jumping in and just it's the worst it's all entertainment yeah it's but it's also enter editorialized too it's like how can a person just relay to you the information is unbiased as they possibly can I know is that possible today but in lowliness Pb Pb s is as close as i can find it yes it's kind of just factual they just put it out whenever they have they have shields and Brooks on it's a snob Brooks & Dunn it's now shields and Yarnell it's and they just two guys who would never be on any other network is their funny-looking and they have the conservative view in the liberal view and but it's very matter-of-fact and factual and not sensational not shitty to each other it's it's as evenly balanced calm as I can find as PBS newshour but who is Sean Hannity arguing with when he was telling Sean Hannity that he's bad for America was it Ted Koppel yeah Capo's Ted Koppel yeah totally is bad for America and you know and Churchill saying something along the lines of don't you think America's smart enough to make up their own mind which is just so ridiculous well so candy-ass of him is that he backs out of it and says well I'm not a journalist I'm a talk show host means you think we're bad for America you think I'm bad for America yeah you don't in the in the long haul I think really and all these opinion shows head no you know why is that because you're very good at what you do and because you have you have attractive is significantly more intelligent our let me tell you what let me finish this anomalously you do it with all do you yes you have you have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts oh that's what you need those old dudes should be really tell Joe Reilly he ruined journalism to Ted Koppel's on a goddamn rampage and he's so mad way to loofah sponge bitch I got something to say I've interviewed number times not an easy interview how would you do it you know some bill you and I have talked about this general subject many times over the years it's irrelevant to how I would do it and you know who made it irrelevant you did you have changed the television landscape over the past 20 years you took it from being objective and dull to being subjective and entertaining and in this current climate it doesn't matter what the end of you are asks him mr. Trump is going to say whatever he wants to say it because how gracious is it maybe okay but you know your old network ABC does interview mr. Trump on a regular basis and in our job whether I'm a commentator or a reporter is to get as much information number one and to show the viewer who the person really is so again I'll go back to he's sitting on Nightline you're opposed right opposite him how do you do it well the first way you do it is not in the end of you you do it by some reporting that's it's an old-fashioned concept that I think demonstrating who and what mr. Trump is and what his various policy is really amount to is something you don't do in an interview he doesn't answer the question you pointed out it's a whole different ballgame on cable TV commentators like me have just ruling the country i I cop to that it's true right I've ruined everything it's true it's entertainment like just give us the news but there you know there's so much money in it and it's not I mean why do they have to here's the question why can't they just put on an entertaining show that makes money like whose responsibility is it to relay the news to the people is it Fox News responsibility I mean don't they have some sort of a out that they're an entertainment program yeah but they're not I mean are they what are they whatever in Louisiana okay laissez use let's say you decide news I understand but let's say you decide to call the show the Tom Papa news and you start talking about the news like do you have a very specific need to like if we know you as an entertainer and Bill O'Reilly was always an entertainer he was a entertainment news reporter on hardcopy before he was ever on on this right so we know he's that guy would you have a responsible who has a responsibility to tell the news in an objective sense like if you can editorialize you can write things out and you can decide which stories should get the most coverage like during the campaign CNN was all about the sexual harassment cases against Trump and then Fox News is all about Hillary in her email scandal right I mean they just decided yeah once I was going to go like who's to say what you can and can't do when it comes to we don't really have like a hard fast rule when it comes to television journalism I mean we think New York Times we think you know in certain newspapers that have a great you know we have respect for them right they have a certain amount of fact-checking yeah and reliability responsibility rather you can really reliably assess that this is going to be the news right to a certain extent yeah I think it's you know it's once you start a 24-hour news station mm-hmm it's a beef that's got to be fed and how do you keep those people attracted but it didn't even really a 24-hour news station we think about what CNN is they have W kamau Bell show right they have Anthony Bourdain show they used to have that Tim Ferriss show they've got a bunch of shows that have live at the Morgan Spurlock show right nothing to do with news yeah yeah I mean other than you know you haven't seen the show before right this is new like you might be talking about some information you might not have a heard before but it's not like a breaking news yeah but I think I think that I mean what a CNN stand for cable news network yeah and Fox News I think once people once you know the people are looking to you as the news there should be some responsibility I think that there's somebody some grown-up has to be you know in control that but you know these are stocks you know these are these are parts of giant corporations with stock prices and the people running it I'm going to meetings and get raked over the coals when they're ratings are down and what are you going to do about it Jeff Zucker maybe it's going to be like when WWF how to change your name to WWE yeah so they'll be C and E yet yeah I mean look if you put an old man new station on yeah right and we'd be like okay finally this is like old measured and good inside all sides and this is America first before party probably deep dog shit ratings you know I mean it doesn't have all the other people going crazy on it yeah you know it's just you just hope that little kind of muddle through it and end up it just want grown-ups in charge yeah what's the dude the CNN - dude the GQ guy that's in his basement again it's a the resistance keto vermin so somebody's got a it somebody's got to put that dude on TV yeah Comedy Central let's just let him write his own shit I saw like a clip of him it really looks like he's he's on cable news network somewhere he doesn't have a make a person anymore he's just just how to make this and these incredibly verbose speeches I insulting Trump over and over yeah yeah saying it's a coup when you sold out to the Russians and this is an invasion McDonough State founded we are the resistance look super intense yeah I know but it's got that weird cable-access feel to it really does like he he used to be like with all these people around I was down to printing his own pages collating his own scripts yeah somebody somebody tweeted about the other day yeah but what fucking nut he is oh really I didn't you know I hadn't been paying attention lately he's hard to find well he's not I mean he's out there on that GQ page yeah I don't what they're doing there's a sax coming in yeah my you know my dog is it's in the emergency room what did they say is it a snakebite Bella can come home between 4:30 and 6:00 well that's good so he knows we're on the air so she doesn't want to disturb but I want to find out what it was yeah oh it wasn't a snake bite snake Venom's expensive a snake antidote very expensive so if you're on the trail like I was in the end and the snake bit you in the leg tighten your thighs find that out what do you do good question that could happen to us like that's one of the things we really should know tonight I ran over a snake once I was running with my dog he was like neighing no this one I didn't run over like hit yeah this one I just saw in the road I was running and I jumped over this stick and as I was jumping over the stick I realized it was a rattlesnake really big one stretched out who flattened out on the road on the trail completely lined up and it was you know the length of my arms yeah it was a big ass fucking saying snakes thick like my wrists around it was a fucking sick old snake that's a lot of venom that would come out of that head I guess I've heard of I don't know if it's a myth or not but I heard that the young ones are actually more dangerous because they unload all their venom whereas the older ones just give you a little zap the old ones like dude relax although they're Morris they're smart that's Nate's like victim victim calm keeping them still in quiet restrict movement and keep the affected area at or below heart level to reduce the flow of venom remove any rings or constricting items and clothing as the affected area may swell allow the bite to bleed freely for 1530 before cleansing create a loose splint to help restrict the movement of the area contact medical help as soon as possible see below evacuate the victim immediately by hiking to a car a helicopter or medical staff monitor the person's vital signs temperature pulse rate of breathing and blood pressure if possible what does it say you do so so number 6 evacuate the victim immediately by hiking to a car so does that mean that the person has been bitten high level with it do not waste time hunting for the snake and do not risk another bite if it's not easy to kill the snake while they're trying to tell you to kill it after it has been killed a snake can still bite for up to an hour so be careful by transporting it holy shit yeah that's that's scary that's kind of they're kind of like saying look I know you're going to kill this fucking snake I looked it up for a hiking because yeah do it here in a house to give any other information right like specific for a hike yeah still doesn't say if you should move or not and it definitely says you're supposed to stay still but if you have to walk a mile to your house yeah pill yeah you got to go I guess the splint is a loose splint to help restrict google what do you do if you get bit by a snake and you're hiking alone it's a lot of words yeah yeah my dog is a we have no information the doctor will tell us when we get there I understand it's need-to-know basis what's that have to show you papers first feds are the worst my glass Cassatt died it was like we don't know we're gonna have to run a test okay fine run the test it's going to be $1,500 okay granted $1,500 okay that didn't come it's inconclusive we have to run another test oh why oh if you want to try and save it you're gonna be up to three grand all right around the test then alright now we're three grand in the hole we didn't find out there's no way to cure it they put the cat down and then they say you want us to do an autopsy why sure what what you doing on the moon another two good this is my snake questions on reddit okay no first aid it is much better than performing bad for oh no first aid is much better than performing bad first aid cut a tour around the side of the bike don't compress the bitten limb with a corridor a tight bandage don't attempt to interact or neutralize venom using electricity fire permit grant perma-grin granite and that's just perma granite Hermann granite Hermann granite salt what is that I can Arnall see black stones mouths mud leaves etc all snakebite kits are dangerous and should not be used Wow this was also confirmed by the snake snakebite poison line a lot of snakebite patients injured themselves by panicking directly after a snake bite by tripping over a rock or a tree trunk or by falling off the cliff side of the trail staying calm is important after snake bite walk about 20 to 30 feet away from the snake find a safe safe place to sit down ASAP the venom can rapidly diffuse into your system this can drop your blood pressure to low to pump all the way to your head while standing low sitting down reduces your chances of fainting within the first few minutes if you faint shouldn't be more for more than a few minutes remove any ring any rings watches or flag-raising well it scanner us well up yeah anything else from the bitten limb because a swelling will make a lot it's a lot bigger soon take five minutes to calm down and plan your evacuation the only effective treatment for a snake bite Eve ennum a ssin is the right anti-venom to neutralize it do not wait for symptoms to appear if bitten is important to get in touch the emergency personnel as soon as possible to get you to a hospital if you have a cell phone and service great call 9-1-1 or the park ranger if there's no service think about the last time you had phone service phones man that we didn't have a cell phone that was the other thing i was like now we're going to disconnect look at this you supposed to circle a location of snake bite write down the time next to it so when they find

fucking leg act as like a little little slide you want to do it doggystyle at a blue-collar concert at a State Fair I must take fair state fairs are odd ma'am they're really weird a band of the State Fair even if there's a lot of people to stay fair the caveat is always that as a State Fair yes yeah at the State Fair yeah I go to see Ted Nugent at the State Fair my pack yeah I'll test here you know I once got an offer when I was first starting as a comic to do the offer was geta you would drive a van with with all the stuff for the stage in it to the State Fair helped help the crew build the stage load everything onto the stage stuff and then you drive at the end of the show you know you do a little comedy host a little and then you drive to the next you break down the stage load it up then you drive to in the next city and the routing was like starts in Buffalo next night in Phoenix next night Charlotte North Carolina then Rochester then back to Tucson Arizona I was like I said to my girlfriend at the time is now my wife we should get on the motorcycle and just drive all these places without these State Fair shows yeah that's what we eat honey yeah then they pay you but it was not much right that was terrible so we ended up that's what we did we took the motorcycle went for five weeks today around the u.s. yeah an older cycle yeah that's pretty gangster me who was gangster we'd only been dating for like six months whoo that's a show a gal you care that's yeah it's a good show a gal you care move you're really invested so what we got trip with her got back from that we were like all right I guess we'll get married because that went well that's Bill Murray's advice Bill Murray says if you're thinking about married someone travel the world with them yeah you'll be hot and miserable you find out what they're really all about absolutely I've lost some friends we went on vacation to it really yeah the fall apart on yeah they get shitty they can't go with the flow they get all pissy you know cuz the car didn't show up or you missed the train you know it's a little stressful to travel yeah that is a problem with some people right yeah just don't know how to keep it together when things aren't to go on the best they're pissy yeah but that Hannity move when he's like really ten really not that sad that guy you don't want to travel with that guy he's a silly boy you just get pissy that kind of like the kid who's been picked on kind of thing but you know what the problem with those guys is as many problems but one of the big problems is there always in combat they're always fight always forcing their opinions there was pushing their opinions with a lot of energy and emphasis and they're always resisting anything that is contrary to their opinions you never considering them never going over it like yeah really right objectively it's always this this intimate which is natural not that natural knee-jerk reaction that all of us are subjected to yeah we're all subject to that kind of unfortunate defense of our ideas the initial idea there's a book I do not know the name I'll find out and post it but that my friend read and he's a conservative and it's basically about that it's how to take hear something recognize what your initial knee-jerk reaction is because of where you stand what you believe yeah and evaluate it and give yourself a beat to say wait maybe I'm wrong yeah and try and work your way around the argument and he's but really believes in this book it's like we're so all naturally set for these trigger words like you hear Hannity or you hear Trump or you hear Hillary where you hear Clintons and everybody has their preconceived beliefs so you just back up whatever those stories are yeah and this book is about breaking that down and trying to be more open and more logical I've definitely tried to work on that a lot during my time that I've been doing the podcast yeah I've gotten way better at I'm definitely not the best at it yeah but it's something I'm Way better at now than I was when I first started doing the podcast so yeah yeah because you realize like how much it gets in the way of a good conversation right gets in the way of understanding how other people think yeah and then you know sometimes you have to dig your heels in and defend your position because you think the other person is being illogical yeah and that's okay too but I think it's also important to look at what someone else is saying and try to make see if it makes any sense at all and it might not yeah but give it a chance give it a chance to attach and ya know it's great I try to when you look at someone from someone else's point of view I try to go okay so where explain it like where you coming from let's try to I try to deal with no judgment I try to just like really get in the ED so when you when you do take opinions and you do analyze it and come down and say you know X is wrong I believe X is wrong do you read your Twitter feed just like because it seems like any time you're in something public and you side anyway you know one issue and you go this way or that way you're getting attacked do you have that you would definitely have that yeah I've got got that and do you take it to heart or you just like now these people just exist and that's me and I analyze myself I mean I'll listen to some of it yeah if it's valid I know I definitely know I fucked up before sure and when I have fucked up before I've read things and people said that it didn't feel good to read it yeah but I knew that they're probably right right and so you just you know when you're doing a live show and you're just kind of free balling yeah and a comedy on time and sometimes comedy and sometimes it's just sometimes gets heated sometimes there's booze involved I think yeah there's all of those but um you know I mean it's just are you trying to get better all the time trying to do it better right you are this is just a part of the process right and there's value in feedback yeah but there's also you have to understand like how many people would you know how many people just trolling you how many people don't like you for whatever reason how they just you go I've gotten people's pages will say something insulting and you go to their page it's just them insulting everybody right I noted again I know there's some people that choose to do that with their time and hate this is America you're allowed to do that yeah but I think overall the more time goes on the less I spend looking at any of that shit yeah the better off I am so I'm less likely to look at that shit now that I ever had before yeah it's just uh yeah cause like so like you say like you some of it you want to see and it is good feedback and like you know there is a good rapport like with you know and then other people just like they make it almost impossible to find the good ones because it's just just because you said one word yeah look you know we're comedians we're just curious people we're always trying to figure stuff out you know we're very similar in that we're not down on either any one side any one team we're really trying to figure out life and try to figure things out so you're allowed to try and be like I don't think this is right or I don't think that's right and then but the team's people from the team yeah just pounds yeah well you can't take that way well I'm trying to figure it out I don't know if this is a an oil grab I don't know if this is but don't you think that what makes social in social media and interaction with people so interesting is that people can throw their opinion into the ring yeah throw their hats the ring is a word you know like they read something that you say or they heard something that you said in a clip and then they they argue with you about it if it's that if it's if it's a smart argument yeah not just a knee-jerk you know I hope you die because you said that I think you know I mean you loved it you know I mean that's some of the best conversations you can have or when you don't agree with somebody and you're just kind of like going back and it can get here or it's not insulting yeah that's the big key and it's also you when you explore why you believe something and I believe something different and you go back and forth over if you do do it respectful and you do get to understand where that person is coming from you know sometimes it makes it even more obvious to everybody listening in to you that they're wrong right or that you're wrong right whatever the fucking honest answer is yeah it gets it gets sort of illuminated and it doesn't get illuminated when you get locked up in this battle right there's people that will form sides like but if you can get to the objective battle gate what what makes you believe that that is true right and then they tell you and you go well that is actually not true let's find the facts or I didn't know that right now I'm looking at my initial position differently and don't be married to that initial position because it's just an opinion but opinions to us are almost like markers of our self-esteem if you can't if you can't defend that position then you fucked up initially and you have in your your flawed so people like dig in and they try to defend that position even when they know logically right it doesn't make sense it's like to get married to it and even if you you're with somebody and you're engaged you know having this real back-and-forth about something and you both are dealing with the facts but you still have your opinion that no I'm still siding with this way and I'm signing it that way you can still respect each other yeah it's when you go when it becomes as personal insult is where you lose it right I mean I don't know people in my family people you know that I work with whatever who have total different views vote differently act differently do whatever but I love them they're just great people and you can't there too you shouldn't have to dissolve relationships because of a political point of view about a certain issue right there's you know that's what's so great my whole family was like my grandfather was hard right my uncle was hard left and they would argue in I but they loved each other and everybody kind of got along and just ate their potatoes after the argument some people can't do that right thank you if you don't agree with them you can't hang out with them yeah about everything yeah about and then some people will have like these crazy arguments where you just you can't be right or wrong you don't know what you're talking about and you're still like climate change how many people have you talked to that would just go hard one way or the other on climate change yeah and then when you start talking about it like you actually ask them what makes you think that climate change is just a cycle and that human beings are not involved in right now it's been shown that it's been a lot of the data has been hoaxed and a lot of it and then if you just go deeper deeper deeper down the rabbit hole you find out they haven't looked into it that much right very few people arguing pro or against the man-made climate change have really looked into it and most people are just sort of taking the consensus view that they hear from scientists or from pundits or from people in right and if you're on the Left you're most likely thinking that we're in deep trouble and if you're on the right you're more likely to dismiss it yeah I mean that's why back to why we need grown-ups to like control some of the news and give you facts so you can kind of decide stuff it's because you don't have the time to research climate change on your own you've got kids you've got a dog that's got a you wants you to whack off with the chocolate there's a lot going on in your life so you depend on others who are really who are invested in giving you the right information so what do you do do you tell them that they have to just say like okay if you're going to call something in news should we have like a thing where there's you have to like meet a standard of ingredients like we looked at your ingredients and you have trans fats in your news right you have all this other bullshit like this you can't sell this is food right right not news yeah you can't make this should be yeah it should because like for like Hannity to say I'm a talk-show host that's fine then more power to you but then there should be a thing a little logo in the corner that says opinion show right a little oh and then there should be an N on the top of the whatever show that's just giving you facts for the day right the problem really is calling it a news network and having opinion people on the news now we're right but that's the same with Anderson Cooper when he's rolling his eyes at Kelly Anne Khan yeah the thing they same shit it's the same stuff writing shit he's just doing on the other side and maybe he's correct that what she's saying is ridiculous but he's clearly editorializing by doing that yes it's all opinions as you know and then you need somebody Don Lemon you need it all you need Ted Koppel's who sit there with his little face and just give you the boring news and put an N on it and then he goes on a pinion shows he lets them know ya means letting these guys know okay you're ruining everything yeah I don't have time to watch anything frankly good for you but where do you get your news do you just read articles I read oh yeah I mean stuff pops up on my phone read the times I read the times look at the Times delivered every day look at you look a real man yeah to have toast gentleman's toast yes I do the gentleman's breakfast gentleman's breakfast need the van Gogh is this great brainer this great retainer has this great had this great quote about what it takes to do good work and you have to have you have your smoke your pipe have a fling once in a while something like and have a moment to yourself to have coffee to have your coffee by yourself mmm and I really try and carve out every day it's not going to make me Van Gogh but I really believe those things like to just sit with your coffee for a couple of minutes and just in peace just have that those moments like you when you're talking about making your bread yeah as moments make you more of a person those moments of thought and careful consideration what you're doing really and you sitting there and eating the bread just having a slice of toast and a coffee and just sit for 10 minutes and before you embark on whatever madness you're going to do for the day you know that's what a moment the important it's one of the big rituals for backcountry hunters bringing coffee guys will you know wait is a very big thing right over your back country hunting and hiking like when these guys go deep into the backcountry you know there are several miles deep into the woods you know I used to do those and they a lot of guys will bring like a little jet boil and packets of coffee and they'll cook up some hot water and they'll sit together and they'll like have a moment to be a person again sit down let's have a cup of coffee interesting and they'll they'll use these little plastic UPS and you know they pour their coffee and they're sitting there drinking the side of the mountain and then I feel like I got a moment of pleasure a moment of relaxation and there's other stuff they didn't put in the pack sister they could have that yes right well they just carry that extra weight especially the diesel oil jet poles probably pound or so yeah you know you're carrying water anyway so you just boil in that water and you pour in those you know they have those Starbucks little virtu yeah I think they're called yeah the you have all those Starbucks you have little packet or all the thing was it goes of reason on that yeah that was called verismo yes like you like a little packet like instant coffee thing was referred to what is over to that's something right they make an absolute electronic or something but yeah the whatever those starburst does it those starburst so Starbucks instants are really good yeah they are good yeah I mean it tastes like real coffee I'd like to make thing it out how to do it now they scream my shitty New York apartment because you do yeah because they didn't have a good coffee maker I was like these this will do me well dude if you want to make coffee if you're at home all you need is a French press that is the way it has a way to go it is the best it's a little mucky clean up yeah I guess but it's that's we're not at that but it's a few steps but yeah the oils from the coffee yeah if you're a person who enjoys the actual flavor loving me no milk no nothing just give it to him in hand like I'm man that's how I drink at these days and I get way less complaints on the podcast about me clearing my throat oh yeah I was a problem before why cuz you had stuff in the coffee drink to bulletproof coffee with the butter and the oil and it was making you Flemmi that butter coffee makes you super Fleming I'd be like what am i drinking here block Crawford is black man coffee the best sabertooth roast it's really good come to him Savage it's good I know that those moments are really important in life I really believed like those little quiet things that have been passed on like if things have been around for thousands of years and people have figured it out the cocktail hour the moment the quiet moment you know before bed or in the morning when you're having your coffee those things are figured out for a reason they're people have figured out this is a way to live this yes you know it really is it really is the way to live yeah and if you can pull it off and they're so small and they're so deep and they're so valuable yeah you know what I mean it's not a giant trip too vague it's not all I've got to make a million dollars it's sitting with you pipe and a coffee that simple little thing is so much better for your soul then all this giant stuff that we end up chasing yeah small yeah I was interviewing dr. Robert Sapolsky yesterday a famous scientist and one of the things I was doing is going over some of his work listening some of his previous eat interviews and reading some of his articles and stuff and he had this thing about meditation oh yeah essentially one of the things they were saying about meditation is like it can be effective but you have to do it all the time right it's not something you do once a week like meditation is something that should become a daily part of your routine then you can it'll help you mitigate stress I think it's a twice a day where can you one that I didn't specify you know he's talking about the different forms that it takes to there's a bunch of different kinds and is not necessarily one that works best on one might but I think that what you're doing when you're making your bread I think that's a meditation I really do yeah in a way it's not like when I really meditate and you sit for 20 minutes right you don't slow like it slows your heart rate it's right and you're not asleep it actually calms you deeper than sleep I used to and I still do call martial arts moving meditation because martial arts make you think so much about the movements and about what you're doing so much intensity and so much danger involved in them that they make you have like very singular focus uh-huh and then in that singular focus there's some sort of a cleansing that happens right with your mind yeah I just you're going hard at these things it relieves stress in a way completely that uber focus on anything right like it when I used to when I had a motorcycle and my father still does it and you know I mean it's his thing like you know I've comedy and other things to put my mind into but he still does it and i get it i mean when you're on that bike it's your survival where's your dad live he lives in new york city no upstate new york so is he in a place where you could ride a bike and not worry about yeah it's not like left out yeah running you over whether text somebody goes everywhere goes like these trips like excuse me up all the way in the mostly east coast but he's done all of Europe he's done all of the UN you ever wipeout no never wiped out never wiped out Wow no that's incredible yeah how'd you do that you're the only guy I've ever heard of really I don't know everything I was over safe is you know as I could be you know you're still dependent on other people but the only only time I fell over was my wife and I pulled into a Days Inn in like Kansas and we'd done a lot of highway just straight you know hours just going and we pulled up to the Days Inn and the routine was we'd pull in at the end of the day and she would go in to check into the hotel and I would take care of the bike and we pulled into a Days Inn and she got she hopped off the bike and I just never took my feet off the pegs because I was so talking and I just like Benny Hill just slowly tipped off to her now the the bar kind of caught it just feel like a snub that's pretty good yeah as far as like all being rides no you know I talked I went with a couple of friends yeah from fear factor we were all taken at the same time motorcycle safety course oh yeah and while I was doing it to people I know got in car accidents on motorcycles really yeah and then one person I know saw a person get hit saw someone today out on their phone ran into some guy from behind I'm flying through the air just just hit him yeah just bang it's terrible I know I I was lucky but one time what came out here I had in New York City for a long time which was kind of manageable I would do like spots me and greg Giraldo would go between clubs and it was night so it was kind of a little more mellow and it was alright but once I came out here like there's no way I just had kids and yeah my career was starting to go okay and I'm like this too much to lose I mean this place is nuts with driving as it is and everybody drives out here too as a bride in New York those are professionals that's right yeah you're right you're right it's not that they're better at it but you know a man I was in San Francisco a couple weeks ago and I went into a Ducati Triumph shop oh god it made me want to shit back guys ah they're so beautiful I've never ridden a Ducati bus me there's a bunch of them oh and these are like the touring ones like I wasn't even interested in like the real crotch rocket like if that these touring ones that are so beautiful that ass Ducati's have a cool sound of them too they really do very distinct yeah yeah I I do miss it for sure those fucking things yeah the new triumphs they're made to look like the old Triumph Stan those look great I know looks like so much fun so much fun ah look at that fucking bike yeah howdy with a double tailpipes oh my god how could you not want to just leave everybody go it's probably so fun yeah apparently those things kind of have like self balancing properties to them really as well as I rose well they have like traction control some of them do now and there was one that Jamie showed that some bike from the future that holds itself up w said who made it is some new BMW bike that doesn't really make any bike you've ever seen before it looks like some total Tron shit to some space-age shit and this bike is I think it's right it's a concept right now go fullscreen so we could look at this shit yeah what BMW is doing um but if this happens Jamie was saying they were saying you don't need a helmet this is what I said so really I mean I'm just repeating what they said so look at these goggles Laird you don't even need to wear clothes look at the Gospels they have on she's got these goggles that are like virtual reality headsets go back so you could see those goggles before she puts them on look look at this look at this fucking bike man Gordon this thing will become cruise in the yeah look so she can see like the speedometer and everything comes through your vision look at that look at that this is crazy it's got big fat Batman tyres that's going to look it's got a navigation system it's showing on the goggles around this is crazy that's amazing this coming soon I don't know if it's ever Canon really it might be bullshit no way all this stuff always comes out but watch he stands off of it and it stays up on its own god of course it's coming but she look how hot he is she's hot she'll totally would be with me hotter thanks you're hotter when you're on a bike oh my god I follow on Instagram it's look at that thing I think it's that man motor a list it's just fuck it's just beautiful girls on these old vintage bikes it's the sexiest thing I've ever seen look at guys like she doesn't even have to balance it it balances itself no I she's so hot a little hot it's her pussy it's your pussy gyroscope that's such a gravitational force that the whole thing I stay centered she's so hot you put a girl on a bike it's hot mmm you know if you put a girl in a place where you don't expect you could image she goes up and right any bright girl on a golf course grow at a boxing gym with her hair pulled back oh my god a girl on a crew with just a full belt yeah girl on a golf course yeah they go up now always fat guys right do you think a girl on a golf course just looking for deck what do you think they actually like golf some completely play really entertaining my question so there's all types real real consideration mmm probably all this looking for dick oh yes I like it it's like guys playing with dolls do you really like to play with dolls yeah no I if you're out there on the links playing you know she can play shopping some girls that couldn't play at all we were just flirting with guys at the driving range would he show me here Jamie like hottest arguably female golf's a million followers on Instagram of course she does female golfer and shown her but imagine that was a male golfer standing like that back up one okay male golfer standing like that show's over okay yeah but she can do that you can stick our butt at you yes well you got to work with what you got hey well I'm sure she's got more than that you son of a bitch now she's talented sexist I can't believe my friend that's going on here she's hanging out and she's wearing a little tiny skirt you got to work with what you got I'll come to Zone trust like that when they hit balls seems weird because we don't lose we don't have those bodies our bodies are gross it's always looked like that if we're sleek and thin we really thin smooth hairless smooth ah not offensive no appendages dangling yeah no cosseting Ling gross gross yeah hairs coming everywhere everywhere oh I get hairs in my ears now I have to shave them some new thing so I could older I get hairier I got neck hair now back in the neck here yeah dear here nose here I'm covered I'm gonna bear except where we want it yeah exactly I might i had a barber an old italian barber who shaved my ears when i was 15 whoa just put like you took lotion i mean a shaving stuff and put it on my ears and shave the great razor head yeah and ever since then just weeds growing out of my ears yeah i totally work that right i think it just grew that way anyway no that's why we shaving your ears of 15 most kids don't have to get the fucking ears ears just to you your goddamn little wolf boy like Michael J Fox and that movie yeah but it was soft little fluffy hair now it's like cacti don't think it works that way man I don't think like when you shave it it doesn't grow back thicker I think that's a minute I don't think that's true I think it definitely grows back thicker really yeah I don't think it does man I think this came up the other day I was on here but yeah it definitely grows back pretty sure it's a myth when my wife started shaving her mustache ah it's now it her pussy's a Chango but it's a war we will win we hack away I've got a I've got a trimmer that goes inside the ear and the nose I got out of the nose one thing I shave with my regular razor as I'm shaving my face I shave the back of my ears and my hair a mess sometimes when I'm driving in my car I'll grab a finger full of nose hairs and ah yeah come out by the roots feels good that's very satisfying when I look and I see oh a bunch of hairs that I pulled out of my nose you gotta get a trimmer yeah I know I do but sometimes I can grab them I just like to grab by one my one part of my back is hairier than the other side fact or fiction if you shave or wax your hair will come back thicker and it may look that way but looks completely ready to see this science bullshit with the suck of scientific America bunch of liberal nonsense that it's simply not so there are several reasons that the myth continues to flourish one is the limitation of human perception people are just not very good observers but there is no science just no science behind hair growing back thicker says Amy McMichael first of all it's a girl yoshino chair of the department of dermatology at Wake Forest Baptist Health which is kidding Amy I'm sure you know a lot more than me there's also the power of coincidence indeed pervasive myths if a young boy shaves his mustache will grow back thicker are grounded in a kernel of truth it might but that's because the shaving may overlap with the timing of natural hormonal fluctuations in his body that are developing his adult facial hair not because of his hair removal right here grows at different times and at different rates for everybody case closed and Papa I had little fuzzies on my ears and now I have cactus Barb's that hurt my wife in our sleep whoa it's a hairy mess I had a birthmark on my left side of my back when I was young and it faded but what's remained is hair so my bright side is not very hairy has some hair but this side is just like agile a patch whoa I used to have a song for it when I was in high school what wasn't Sammy on my back Sammy on my back what you doing there with all that hair Sammy you got a name for it it was Sammy I see how my body's called Sammy I'm one of my friends named it Wow that's right my back some weird fucking album we use a jerk-off - what what'd you do in there with all that hair Sammy and on that note ladies and gentlemen we just didn't know three hours we did yeah it's the best show ever Tracy how the fuck's that happens 4:30 already

shit big it's just a dope pellet smoker holy cow it's made in America what do you keep what's pellet inhale it it works on pellets meaning hard wood pellets so what they do is they take you know when the lumberyard cuts up like maple or oak or some hardwood they take the pellets they tape rather the sawdust and they compress it and the natural sugars compress down into pellets and they tell us hold together and they pour these pellets in a hopper and the hopper feeds into a worm drive that feeds to a heating element so it keeps it at a very consistent temperature and and and how do you light it well it lights itself just just a switch yeah so you like that right that's what it looks like and if you Jamie see you find my head and odds dope I love these things and there's another company called Trager that just came out with a really super high-tech one that's thick and insulated like a Yeti cooler it's like their their best model yet and you can control with an app and it has digital thermometers that are built into it so you can tell the temperature your food what here what's your signature dish off of this thing well mostly I eat wild game because I write I shoot I try to shoot in elk a year which is right 400 pounds of meat plus I give away a lot of a li 400 pounds but it's a foreigner comes meat but this year is a good year yeah I shot two deer I shot a pig I shot an elk cheese so I shot a lot of animals this year so I've got a lot of a big fridge if they have to commercial freezers in the back here okay I have two more commercial freezers at home Wow yeah but I gave away a lot of food to my friends yeah I'm very proud of get food to Duncan Trussell I gave elf to Gary Clark jr. oh yeah one of the greatest guitarists of all time ate my me yeah that's great it's not a wrong a real guru but yeah so Traeger has this new one what did the Timberline that's it that's a good one Beuerlein is their new one and this new one you could see like it has this crazy convection oven cycling of the smoked knife and the triggers got this really thick door yeah my friend John Dudley has one of these I think there's some sort of a discount that you can get and buy one with his I don't know I have a gas grill thing though and you just don't get that not the same it's not the same I'm the same this is this is no gas this is just would see the pellet plant no chemicals in it oh so you just visit no client or anything no no no no no it's just electricity heats up that heating element and there's a fan that blows air on the wood chips while they're getting cooked and then it's just smoke smoke and heat it cooks the food dude I am I am sold there's another company a really good company called Green Mountain grills they actually gave me a grill back in the day they were the first ones that ever tried those are excellent too and you can get a good one that's not not even too expensive Camp Chef has another really nice one too so I was not I'm not trying to tell anybody to buy anything but I'm saying if you're thinking about getting a grill I would look into one of these pellet grill that's pretty badass well it's they're super easy to use too you just pour the pellets into this hopper and then you set the temperature how often you have to refresh the pellet duty builders they're so they're so economical like it doesn't they don't they last long keep the exact right temperature or real close to it were a few degrees up or down you like the hopper I filled it up like every four or five cooks and if that was like charcoal it would last for one current you know I can't like - that was desperate looks like see those thing in it looks like like some sort of a brand cereal right doesn't it like one of those yeah it looks like gerbil food yeah so what it is is just hardwood sawdust and they just smush it and the natural sugars make it stick together because you could break it up with your fingers like you could yeah you break it up easy yeah so you pour it into the hopper it grinds down to that worm drive below and it feeds down to that thing on the right which is like where the heating element is and so it just catches fire and then the flames make smoke and then it fills up that chamber and the heat comes from the smoke so when you put a an elk steak or something on there can you cook it like in just couple minutes or is everything to go slow it's a long time so like the way I do it now I've done it a bunch of different ways and all of them are delicious like elk is my favorite meat it's a delicious really healthy meat but yeah my favorite way to do it now because of this guy Chad whiskey bent BBQ on instagram was my friend John Dudley's buddy he's a world champion pitmaster like one of those fail yeah bad motherfucker yeah grill guys hate it as don't ever cook meat above 275 degrees he says when you're cooking you should cook it slowly and don't allow the meat to dry out and use a meat thermometer so since I started doing that I've been very happy with the results right if I get it to 130 135 degrees somewhere around there then I pull it and then I reverse sear it the way I do it is on a frying pan I use butter in a frying pan right garlic and i sear that shit I have it on each side real quick like 30 cents you bring it into the house yeah bring into the house den and I wrap it up with aluminum foil and I put it in a Yeti cooler and I seal it up for 15 minutes Riya let it slowly keep cooking cuz real slow cool down and then I open it up and I let it sit for another 10 minutes and then I slice into that so what should I do with the gas grill ha we'll talk throw that thing in the fucking Cuba to homeless people back throw it in the LA River to see the red of is when you can do something like that and you get good at it right this is the bread thing it's like you're in yes well for me it's I love cooking yeah I've always loved cooking and it's not there's a little bit of a manly thing that I like more we're cooking with lump charcoal over a charcoal grill smell something then Gary manly about the aerial fire I know but honestly as far as like taste and as far as ease-of-use and repeatability it's hard to fuck with these pellet grills yeah because you're cooking with real wood fire yeah it smells great it tastes great like when you open the lid up smell of like maple and see it has a different you know you buy a bunch of differently Applewood all kinds of different cherry over a buy all kinds of different pellets I need a bigger yard they're not even that big man no no and again it's economical like I know Green Mountain Grill go to Green Mountain Grill they have a pretty small one that is only like a few hundred bucks and my mother-in-law has my old one it's great yeah they're fucking great man it still works I've had it for years really yeah and that one has a built in thing it's called the Daniel Boone yeah you know one thing I took off of your Instagram was the eggs and just throwing the kale on top of it oh yeah love it's a life saver I mean that's such a simple yeah crazy morning oh it's the best so is what I do is I take some kale I chop it up and then I chop up some garlic and usually I do jalapenos to the end I get some butter cooking I put the kale in the butter i saute it and once it really starts getting darker it's ready to rock I just crack a few eggs and right on top of and mix it all up put it on a plate and it's fantastic you mix it up they look like they were sunny-side up kind of sometimes I do that too yeah sometimes I just put the kale right next to the eggs right sometimes I cook the eggs in the kale yeah I've just been throwing the kale on top of the eggs great - great rave yeah great so fast yeah super easy the best what's this one have you tried one of these I have yeah is a gravy sous-vide yeah I have I don't think I have that one I have another one like it what is that yeah what you do is you vacuum seal your food in a plastic bag and then you put it in a pot with water and then the hot water the thing will heat up the temperature of the water like 125 degrees my question would be like is the plastic leeching yeah to your food they say it doesn't and it's a good question though but how do we I mean you can't microwave plastic if it's a certain temperature maybe the plastic needs to hit a certain right amateur to melt well they say you should never drink bottles that have been in your car in a hot day and I wonder about that recently I was like hi and thinking about that where did that score like maybe come from maybe the glass bottle water people are putting out false who's getting a glass bottle water barier and all those are all glass bottles they started off yeah yeah with a little like trend on it I think these actual science behind it I'm just wondering with all I just get it's bear yeah you were high that's what you're saying this meat is good I have actually a blowtorch that I do with sous-vide oh yeah so I do sous-vide and then I cook the outside of it with a torch yeah to get that brown on the outside I've done that but I don't prefer it yeah I preferred that the Traeger style in mountain grill Yoda grill those pellet grills yeah again there's a bunch of different companies I'm not trying to endorse one I like Green Mountain grill well my friend John Dudley loves those triggers and that but that new Traeger Timberline is pretty revolutionary and it's supposed to be amazing in its ability to insulate I think actually the best one too is another one called a Memphis Memphis grill supposed to be really good at that someone told me if you have a gas grill to put a cast-iron pan on it and you can do your steak that way yeah that's a good move yeah yeah to get that that seared Ray flavor from a cast-iron or even it's getting a little more a lot of big-time steak restaurants still use cast-iron pans patterns pretty bad if you know you get iron from it too you get your dietary iron you know Wow yeah yeah it was just crazy you don't really clean them good for you you like it's good to cook even vegetables like cooking vegetable in an iron pan you get a little bit of iron oh really yeah that's good for my wife so true mistress he's a little low iron I feel like I might be lying no I think you're right I've heard that who cares I don't know my dad and you know many things that I've said that are not true and then I'm trying to see you for nothing we're doing our best I'll do my best I am doing my best Tom Papa working these fine people

it'll be ready and I don't was a clock on it it's really like when is it ready mmm but if I'm already at that point I feel like I should crank it out yeah I'm on the exact same schedule yeah yeah a
