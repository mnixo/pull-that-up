well the results 5 4 3 2 1 boom and we're live ladies and gentlemen to fight companion it's me Brian Collins on the way but it's his birthday and he's old as fuck and sometimes you get all of you lose to your keys and you don't know what time it is a check test Eddie motherfucking Bravo and Brendan Schaub is up in this bitch and we're watching Bellator hope no one into us you guys mad but it's a big fight this is an important one we are right now this is the heavyweight finals is gonna be Fedor vs. Ryan Bader I'm excited for that I am excited about that of various I like Ryan Bader at heavyweight he looks fucking fantastic of them he's bigger than me right now dude how many of these guys just should have done that a long time ago in to stop cutting weight went to heavy weight just crucifying their body Chris Weidman I think is kind of one of the main ones I think so I think he's gonna excel at light heavyweight he's got a disk replaced in his neck yeah he's fucked up but I'll figure it out the worst nightmare though for a fighter in wrestling or MMA is just being overpowered by somebody that's why they're killing themselves they just wanna they would rather go in there depleted then get thrown around it's so old-school it's such an old-school way of thinking I feel like it makes sense though a little bit I mean to be the only and in wrestling it's it's an hour but new ash all look at TJ Dillashaw oh yeah but that's hard to say let's go talk about that fight because I watched that fight several times I'm of the opinion that was a quick stoppage early start is for sure stop it and here's my here's my other point with that when they're 125 pounds you can let it go on a little longer than if they were heavyweights I'd hear more on the side of let it go long yeah - 125 could be a thousand pounds each and that fight got stopped quick let those fuckin fight especially we're talking about a legacy I was 69 bucks how about TJ that's C fun right that guy rained his body to get down 125 pounds hey don't get me wrong though Henry cejudo is a bad motherfucker he's probably let's beat him anyways maybe but for people that are paying for the the event we want to see some highlights shit definite knockout we don't want to you know I thought the ref whoever he was he was just in the beginning you could tell he wanted a stop it her like there's guys that they just they just want to get in there like save their life he's a really good save anybody's life made a mistake look it's fucking hard to do it's a hard job I am so glad I'm not a referee because when they make a mistake they can't say oh I fucked up let's do it again remember they used to be able to remember what Big John McCarthy stopped the fight between Marilla Bustamante and Matt fuck Matt Lindland Lindland Matt Lindland tapped and said he didn't tap and Big John McCarthy let the fight continue mattli taman I got him in the arm boss I got the sound him oh we missed an armbar that was some serious jujitsu right well we'll see it in the highlights we're just warming up yeah let's get that was nice he's got some fucking high-level fights now man they are like on on the way up there as close to the UFC's you can get right they have the biggest prospect in the sport and in Pico yeah I'm taking it back a little bit what about Conan so Vieira versus Saka fucking robbery did the fight yeah the whole fight got read it blew up it got stopped down John - and then they decided you know what let him fight again Big John he got he later that night Conan hit Sakuraba Sakuraba dropped and went down for a single yeah and they stopped the fight he's like what the fuck you do but that was in Japan they pulled them aside in Japan as a Wild West bro like no I don't know why they don't let Big John's court around that's tight I don't know why they don't let him chime in on officially with a scorecard and tell everyone how it's going doesn't want to do the problem with that is who does when I did it the problem was when they announced the unofficial scorecard and if I was right and you know the general consensus was on my side and they flash it yeah if if the if the other fighter wins dude those judges get trash yes nobody helps responsibly so but this is this no this is what it was though you know in the beginning the UFC was you know bending over backwards for the Commission just you know just you know because they had to well they still they had to what boxing's they don't have to do that boxing doesn't have to bend over backwards for the Commission boxing was around before the Commission word so to kiss-ass to the Commission the UFC had to because there are a new sport and the Commission could easily just shut it down so it was a different dynamic rights but the difference is you were doing it as an independent meaning you weren't doing commentary so we were doing commentary and you were coming in in between rounds it was very educational if Big John was doing it the problem would be that he's actually doing commentary while he's doing it that's very hard to do I'm not a fan of doing that because when I'm doing commentary I'm telling you what's happening but really what I'm trying to do is be entertaining I'm trying to give some life to it I'm trying to like put some emotion to it but I'm not really scoring no I'm not saying that but I'm not saying I'd like to say you score and then also do the fight I'm saying maybe have him outside of it because they have 17 commentators was there big guy though now it's Goldie and Big John well yeah Frank Mary of Chael Sonnen yeah yeah lady but while the fights are happening with them voice you're hearing on television is Big John there's no way he can do that in my opinion I don't feel like oh that would be a big do it Jimmy Smith used to do scoring in between it was good it was good Jimmy's very good at what's it gonna do now I don't know man I'm not happy I'm not I'm not happy that the UFC got rid of him I think he's really good I get it I understand it they have a lot of other people Eve Bellator on bad terms and good terms I do not know I think they were cutting the money it was a financial thing I don't think he left he's still on good terms he but they offer him less money because they have these other dudes series like on the UFC's officer dream job but they signed a one-year contract did you ask anybody why they let him go they want to use fighters it was in a fit they decided it fight yeah why do I see fighters want UFC fighters you know what that's how the NFL is yeah NFL you know that the the color commentator is always a former and Tony Romo way Tony Romo best he calls exactly what's gonna happen before it even happens he is all right this is people kind of dislike it I love it he goes this can be a run to the right get ready and then that's sure enough that's what they do he reads it before it all happens then they even check your sorries go to a slant in the top left higher that fucking dude store last night they were talking how insane is common of them there was the best Tebow was saying his best commentator and offspring did he commented he did the I think you know he did the Brady game the patient's Jesus that game I notice about MMA oh fuck dude hey Eddie talk us through this by the way here here's the he's going for well let's call this guy's name out too because we didn't give this guy's name he he was um to counter the takedown he goes for Kimura and he just he rides that Kimura all the way o to an armbar and then he kind of swims with uh with the Kimura still intact the arm pops and bull fucking beautiful huh that's some tight ass submission there super powerful Kimura yep yeah are amazing amazing powerful because the Kimora's aren't just for Kimora's Kimora's are for back takes and for straight armbar setups you know what I mean so yeah the the traditional Kimura is probably the heart you know when you take the arming you crank it behind his back that's probably the hardest of the three you know it's probably easier just to use the Kimura grip to take the back or to turn it into a spiderweb armbar Adel Alta mean me me Adel al-tamimi aka Chris Pratt's friend Chris Pratt's in there with them it's a comedian no Carlos dude he's the guy who controls the philosoraptor is brother fucking guy from Jurassic Park dude I don't want guardians of the galaxy she is the gal thank God I walked out of that as soon as that fucking little little animal thing with what do they call it what is a big diesel voice what is oh my god as Chris Pratt right things with the guy the whole way what is happening now this is a little go overboard guys Chris so intense I love you buddy but get the fuck out of the picture he's translating sense and that shirt is suede dude I come from a guy like me that's that's how I like to wear mine no you don't sir no fuck yes especially for my CV it's a midriff not onlys belly bomb I'm doing push-ups before I get up there I'm gonna do some fucking some dips on some chairs that's a beautiful armbar though dude let's hear Chris Pratt get on the mic shut up you're not turning up it's okay cuz i I don't want we should tell people with what the timecode is do we have a timecode yeah but it was so quick and tours idea maybe they think hey how about we we have celebrities walk out with these fighters say I'll try anything bro they'll try porn no that's porn no heat fighter porn they're doing well I mean if this is paramount no no no no did that's was a disaster they've done pay-per-view it was a disaster hoist Gracie one they made money on that what they think that was pay-per-view wasn't these do well I like the the Paramount's do well they get good ratings am I wrong I think the hoist Gracie one was not pay-per-view you can't shamrock well I don't that's not patreon that wasn't pay per view in 1996 it was they can't do a favor and shoot on did you watch it I watch about all I was excited I was excited by I could I watch him all my lab Rob chuckle Adele and Tito Ortiz did 25000 buys no way dude that's so my dude you could do 25,000 buys I could piss into this bear candy at 25 five designs great you could show a fuck you do a seminar on flat earth and you would get 25 I mean it is it is fucking crazy that definitely got 25,000 is it crazy no the card was so poorly done Thunder card was so fucking terrible the production was awful their intros were ethically bad yeah ethically fuck in bed it was kind of a shit show to watch I enjoyed it because it's such a shit show it was just a decent products and on this farm is the Oscar De La Hoya I look like a so bad dude if I look like a thumb does Jay Glazer look like a big toe big toe hard dick please freedom here dude I'm losing it Oh Kalin needs to fucking let it go let's be real his chair is when we see you home I showed up with a bald head counted hair hair transplant - so he's got a scar back there no soul I probably didn't tell the world oh yeah I know I would never say it if you did you know as the best fucking hair piece is pivot that shit I had no idea you know she used to play George Costanza on Seinfeld because he had the same fucking birdsnest thing well he had a bunch of surgeries I thought oh now that thing is dead meat up there I think it's fucking I think is sewn into a skull I have no idea how dare you this is live Oh what people are listening I'm just saying yes fucking great no I'm saying good good fake hair yes there's no prompter you know it's no issues I'll probably do the same shit yeah yeah it's not the 80s though cuz in the 80s man if you had long hair and you were losing your hair it was basically a death sentence like I had Newsome I had to have a shaved head back then what was the only guy we allowed him shave his head because he could sing so great we just said okay he was also allowed dressing really weird you know with his fucking biker blood like he dressed like people in the gay community dress came out with the leather and the motorcycles and a hot-shit and I words all the kids thought that was heavy metal so I wore all that shit and I always thought in the back of mine I thought it was weird that gay people were the same shit coincidence we've talked about that in the podcast before that Rob Halford conned a whole group of people and addressing gay how about how about Freddie Mercury was telling everybody he was super gay he was not trying to hide it from anybody but I thought oh he's just a rock star his style is dope his name was queen but no one thought he was gay no one thought he was getting probably you know some people but does everybody know why yeah if you watch the movie like the documentary yeah everyone's like what we look like a fucking joke you know what everybody yes how about Elton John well forget all of them Bharath she's the crazy they were like Liberace when you're gonna find a nice woman and settle down glad keep looking I think Freddie Mercury's a little it was a little crazier than no Liberace bro the name of his bed was Queen it's true a lot of stars rock star look at how she played a piano and came out and no fucking gold Royals Royce you had fucking pigeons coming out his asshole tell you normal yeah did we talked about this before why there's such a disproportionate amount of gay singers know why because so whose dude if running the music business a lot of gay dudes and who's gonna is that true I don't know anything about that it's true it's no big deal I run wise your business did you know that bro I don't know who's down the suck dick oh is that what we're than a gay singer wait a minute so you think the reason why there's so many gays singers are the ones that suck the dicks to make it to the top because there's guys who's just that there isn't it possible to Jerry hold on but let me just let me know okay sing let me offer you an alternative explanation think about theirs wait hold on here's the alternative explanation gay people feel lined they feel like they're left out they are sad because of this they live hard lives they maintain all this emotion inside of them and they want to express it some way so they figure out a way to sing and to entertain and goddammit change that shit behind the candelabra is the best movie I think I think you know they're bullied and you know they're depressed and the the people that are the most like pushed out in society those are the ones who become comedians those are the ones become singers those are the ones they become actors even because they regulation there's something to get out and outlet gay comedians think that many know there's a couple no there's a gang of them there's a lot I know I know quite a few I'd say there's more gay actors in the our singer know saying go see his name's name some few singers the biggest ones are gay or five well we that are dead to me Halford still kickin Liberace died of everything he had the full career outside all just everything ya hear that dick implants luck to all the dudes Joey Diaz used to have a fucking bit and we played a little bit of it one time on the podcast but it's not the best version of it of beyond the candelabra the fucking HBO movie with Matt Damon I love that movie and Michael Douglas do you remember Joey Diaz is a bit yeah I saw him in San Jose probably one of the best sets I've ever seen him do in San Jose he had that whole bit down San Jose improv ya know it was a monster yeah he's still a monster but I mean that bit

let's do in England yeah I don't know that doesn't make any sense they're probably that bomb it's such a big fight you do it in England the time zones are all fucked up no the problem is the problem is riots those fucking soccer hooligans they're gonna go crazy this time zone the UFC's in england are some of the lowest rated strengths they kill it in England Mendes like Josh was just tagged your boy with the right hand not true yes he did he just clipped him as he's trying to close the disc confirmation bias on my house here you I have no confirmation bias I'm not attached to this guy other than the fact I am friends on Instagram sent him once and that was a great fight oh nice jumping Frankie I know anyone so no matter what I mean Instagram friends with immortal technique now with attitude thing I'm like it's uh I'm like fanboy now he's a good guy man you never met him never met I'll introduce you next time he's in LA I'll try to kiss a mortal technique who's that he's a rapper yeah bad motherfucker very very good talking about doing a song what's this what's his real name what's his rap name who cares calm immortal technique conspiracies the rapper he slipped that oh let's tell everybody with Taemin is on the clock it's 203 - OH - 201 - two minutes and this is the first round if you want to sync it up but you probably can't drop in level come on I like that beard though he's going wild like he's very kinetic like he's he's making these big leaping movements and he's doing it in the first round if he tries his shit in the second 1/3 like he's gonna get tired the movements are slower and more pronounced let's start wrestling yeah he's gonna have to because he's not that good at closing the distance with his striking his striking is his big movement see that these are these big movements and a bent day has a good time face breaking time these big movements and Posadas he's hurt he's hurt bad he got he got hurt earlier to a clip with the right hand oh there's a takedown guillotine stuffed stop push that left hand off he's already lost his hair but he's still in the fight with the left hand there too Bendis is no joke Mountain playing turtle right now and he's just decoy looks like a dude I said I'm thinking about growing a beard once I shaved my head fucking said great head of hair just crappy break it down yeah what's this hair thing man you got great hair stop let him shave it no looks like the hairless misery no let me tell you something man this is why because I think people that take propecia and stuff I think you're fucking your body about let's take that I think that stuff's terrible I used a compression labardi had depression oh no no no no he did not who did not everybody shut up to his feet he was exhausted now that Joe Benavidez did like two or three times in his last fight like that is dope bro legit hens Oh does that a lot that's huge yeah yes hens oh did that in his last time I may fight I'm sick of this yeah [Music] this was a movie every time what's her name I forget something Amy Schumer nice be nice I am dude she's nice whoa no she's a good actress what's wrong yeah she's filthy bro um well restock my all propecia and our yeah you don't think he you don't think that here I kind of had a touch of the dog no he didn't you think it's all truck and I dealt approaches and it's one of the side effects one of the side effects is severe depression really Brian propecia is a DHT inhibitor the reason why it works to keep your body from losing its hair is because dihydrotestosterone which is a derivative of testosterone is suppressed by propecia propecia was originally pross car and Pross car was something they used for people with prostate enlargement so you get on that stuff it inhibits DHT so your hair stops falling out and it grows back a little bit but it also fucks with your body your energy levels dude for me or some paper this is what yes for me for me it wasn't very good for my boners I still got them but this is what what happened I stopped taking it because I ran out of it and I forgot to get a new prescription how that goes in my dick was fine it was just like that huh and I was like what is happening with my dick and then I realized oh my god I'm not on the propecia dude then I realised propecia was fucking up my boners a cat could not keep going right now and you

do I get for it is he 45 pretty hard to tell I'll tell you what though your boy is game and hell of a fighter he's a fighter five you know what man if there's one school that nice head kick right there the eight yeah if there's one skill that a fighter should have or it is wrestled yep right it mean goddamn if you could dictate where the fight takes place everything but it's so these days if they keep showing him getting lit up Brendan I know you're against kicking to the knee foot next foot stomps it's just it's a bitch move I remember when guys don't like you just like come on but it's like a it's like bro Kodiak what the fuck you doing we're stomping feet we kind of bit stomps up foot what are you doing bro it's obviously not gonna affect the fight just a bitch move it doesn't affect them not really you can't feel it you're so amped up now afterwards your foot your foots fuck but during the fight like what are you doing dude when you do it you think you break a foot maybe if you're fucking Bigfoot Silva and stop Marco who osseous to do that shit yeah there's Neil so hard I'm sure if you're a real bitch you could do practiced if you were a real bitch ass bitch what if you broke someone's foot if we stomped on their foot and snapped their meta cars okay you want by foot stomp Congrats Wow yeah yeah right a lot of time I know exactly what you're talking every stompy when I fight who knows most people don't those guys don't John wick used it in the bathhouse scene ooh stomp the dudes foot Oh shot on the chest that's for the title that's how quick switch gets a shot at the title well it's cuz it's the welterweight tournament so anyone who fights Rory canyons a shot at the title it's pretty dope yeah he wrestled fuck Paul de Leeuw and then he's immediately getting a shot at the title it's a good fight this is a shot great it is an interesting fight and especially if I like it in belt or because they're a little more lenient in their substance don't get detection sir yes sir yes well Fitch said tested positive before no he gives a fuck about look at his dog to it Rory Tom looks like he works at Google right there holy fuck he works like a girdling

think you're an asshole dude this might be my ballerina roundhouse kicks me in the face I'm like I'm hanging around with the wrong girl I get the fucking right not me I think this building kicked me in the face filthy TMZ you ever had a girl hit you PLC I don't know swing at me once back when I was fighting and I saw her hand come up and I saw her shoulder go back and I saw her right hand come my way I'm like I don't believe this is even happening mm I ducked under and I just grabbed her I had a girl receptive the right hand grabbed her I don't even think about hitting because it was so ridiculous I had a girl reach down grab a boot I said you're being dumb I didn't say your Johnson I said you're being well that Donna is trying to hit you she didn't just try to hit me she reached down she goes I'm dumb she didn't say I said you're being done I say you're dumb because I'm dumb and before I can get out she fucking she was athletic she reached and grabbed my boot she grabbed my boot by the you know and and swung so hard and I remember I ducked I just saw I come and I just went I ducked and it made a it crashed into my closet you know I just when you die that's true sir that was the house yes Brad's house he has no doorknob yeah like that is a hole yep I pushed his door this dude and I go bro you don't have a doorknob he's like I gotta get it fixed so one day a homeless lady walked into his house and started make it breakfast I had two pitbulls - he was asleep a homeless lady was making breakfast in his kitchen got a really nice house it wasn't save I came home and the neighbors were freaking out they'd call the cops come in and she goes and I'm in there she's making me a whole meal and I came in stand and my dogs were there and she's like honey you got it going on you got it going on and the cops game you want I was like no no it's fine I go thank you spilled or no you called the cops though no doorknob yeah she was making me a full meal it was fantastic sense not terrible I mean if you a little less like a year before the crack epidemic yeah dude one night when I first started training the girls I would date because I was trained out of time would whenever we can argue they'd hit me not in the face they'd always punched me or push me because you're so big I hate it I get away with it correct it's like hitting a punching bag not just know if he was gonna come their way correct and then I remember I was living in this basement with all these roommates and me my girl at the time we're fighting and I was like lifting a lot of spie 265 at the time and she did something that horrible I forget what but it pissed me off and there's a couch and I wanted to leave and I remember I was like just fucking do it I lifted up the couch and to me you know I thought was a heavy couch but it was like one of those like Kia couches this thing went and fucking hit the ceiling bland on the wall she's like oh my god like oh she got hot no she wanted to call the cops I'm like you're throwing us so far I didn't mean to launch this shitty sofa you get intro ever thrown a sofa I don't think you can think so if the cops came you'd be like I didn't throw it I have to arrest someone if it's a domestic violence call so even if it's not true they got to take me away yeah but if it's not violence if the cops come has to end no Greg hardy but if the cops come and you say I didn't do anything violent to her I just got mad I threw the sofa over there yeah but then crazy bitches go yeah dude dude I know uh I know a guy who did that with a girl he started clawing his own arms oh yeah he's kind of a pussy just his arm that yeah I talked about that that's my joke where I talk about your you sometimes you get so mad at ago that you want to kill yourself I don't think that's what happened I think he did that because he thought that she was gonna fuck him do it to him he thought she was gonna call the cops they were screaming at each other and they probably thought the neighbors yeah why like I'm gonna just fucking her he just started clawing himself yeah I told you I told you the story right I was breaking up with her oh I told you it stops I you know that story I told you that I was breaking up with a girl she was moving out of my house she started opening my windows going stop hitting me oh yeah I was like close look at this fight they're sitting dude look at the jeans he looks like the fucking guy from Orange County Choppers he's gonna fight in those jeans just so he can get dressed quick on the way out yeah this is a here's the fight ready takedown ground-and-pound stoppage in quickly yes yeah this is a setup I don't like that when that is debut it's it he's never fought haven't fight in a smaller organization or not just feed him to these fucking vessel he should be in jeans it's not disrespectful to him and it's not disrespectful to the support but it's disrespectful to a large-scale organization to have a guy who's a guy who's coming in from pro wrestling's got a big fan base do it the right way and then eventually make your way into a big organization Thomas Cole main event on ESPN how'd that go how'd that work awful we watched it together yeah it was a joke was it Joe I knew that guy was was fading quick we were talking about in your green room yeah I was like he's fading I don't like the way stepping he looks exhausted he tired out quick then he hit that dude with the illegal knee do you think he's still gonna be in the UFC after that 100% they've invested too much um Dana said he's and you have another fight interest a bomber but that's the life we live and what do you do with them what I do with Lance's in God wouldn't hit dirt I did give him Derrick loosing him the fuck gather go like real women here's Derrick Lewis who came from a domestic-violence home he's pretty good enjoy this oh you wanna be a fighter here's Darren Derrick Derrick but no he hasn't matter how many fights is Greg Hardy had was as that'd be his fourth he had three on the white so with a guy like that it was a Pro Bowler really athletic wouldn't his learning curve be very very steep I would oh quick wouldn't you wouldn't he he has too much too much there's too much to download especially at his age he's 30 so that you got downloaded information so maybe he's working a lot on striking but you can't cover jiu-jitsu kickboxing wrestling bono it doesn't matter you know take Herschel Walker it doesn't matter if they're that great of an athlete takes a fucking while to learn the scale ramp well Herschel Walker was a world-class athlete and a lifelong martial Iraq different animal yeah different but I'm saying even if taking athletic like LeBron James would struggle you through the UFC I firmly believe that Herschel Walker would have given a lot of dudes a hard fucking time in his 40s even as Fortis I think he was such a fucking freak stud of an athlete he's such an outlier give it a lot speed he had 235 he's running he was running Olympic speed he's in the Olympics yeah I mean it was such a freak unbelievable n a real martial artist but you really had skills like when when I first saw him fight the UFC I was like or at Strikeforce rather I was like oh my god like he can actually fight like dudes are scared of him like he was he was moving in the right way it wasn't doing anything wrong who's taking guys down smashing them and the physical power that he had was just his body stupid ridiculous for the team he trained with it he did it the right place yeah and they gave him the right fights yeah it was good yep but if you started younger you'd have real promise if you wanted to be an actual it's interesting because it is you know when you get like elite athletes how many of them actually want to fight who's the most elite athlete he's in the UFC I think Noelle Romero yes 100% and he's a wrestler Cuba yeah either boxing or wrestling remember you I'll remember you 3000 it's gonna be 62 years old walk on the beach with a dick like a fuckin Quaker Oats box yeah dude he's fighting a fucking homeboy the other die yes yeah Eddie Bravo fuckin tweet it's hilarious private shit it's fucking great I didn't make the me mop who is this guy you would never take that JW guys I don't do means he's some guys about to get fucked up run don't need to download his information yeah we got coming up Jack Swagger's the guy spray take notice though okay I'm not I'm not mad at the Bellator girls not mad at all dude Mercedes my matter and all night yeah Wow Paul Acosta and yo Romero for sure have the best body pound yeah but Luke Rocco is longer and thinner he's beautiful model is beautiful but there's a big difference he doesn't want the gorilla look at this your Marilyn said that today we're not make them didn't make it with it I agree with it I sent it I the UFC try to get fired this week to do fucking the breakdown shit fight breakdowns I think you shot a test two more I think this dude's got a Bellator tattoo in his back oh shit he does it's like slash belt oh sorry very Caribbean slash 300 movies health imagine if a guy at all giant Depp's tattoos that'd be sick now the other guys a pro wrestler I don't know anything about it yeah anyone wanna bet bet ten bucks I bet you the dollar that I lost on Brian or 20 bucks 20 bucks 20 bucks all right all right did I take that dollar actually took it that doesn't think CM punk should have gotten a shot and now you're you're you're favoring well Oh see that's the problem maybe CM Punk doesn't have any amateur background this dude became Velasquez twice in college oh he's a wrestler yeah I don't want to take your money he's gonna be okay Jack Swagger beat Cain Velasquez in college Reza

he's gonna listen and that guy's fuckin tough that guy fought that guy's I mean he gutted it out for as long as you just don't look at who I'm saying yeah Brendon soft glare he's bred is giving you the soft clay call that the song it might not be the most skillful and he definitely couldn't handle this probably didn't huge top-flight in there with a guy that athletic and strong hey Brendon let me ask you this how many guys you know that have fucked up chipped up elbows that's a super common thing right here yeah loading around and he'll bone shit yeah and I was in a big elbow game just life did you ever see that picture of Jacare would jock ray went to the hospital to get bone chips yeah no fuckin no it was like like you know the attainable they put like a little cup of nuts yeah on your table when you go to a nice restaurant that's when you're on the airplane macadamia nut airplane yeah they drop the nuts off that's what it was in his elbow what just mean that's it right there oh no that's all the shift from jock Ray's elbow what the fuck yeah bro listen when you just won't tap like Jacare did you ever see that was it up it wasn't Abu Dhabi what was it was it the Mundi Isles when he got arm barred by hogr and he wouldn't tap and hard you're broke his arm and he tucked his arm in his jacket and won a decision right do you remember that got elbow elbows the hydrotech disarmed was it hard sure Hodja tucked his arm again oh I'm wrong yeah who tapped him though wasn't wasn't Jacare was it no was it uh boosha boosha well somebody you did hear if the same thing happens Jacare though I feel like chakra got his arm broken he would not tap and he wound up winning the fight I know that happened with that Vinny Magalhaes in Fabricio Werdum that's true probably so had a big shock raised arm yes thank you Jesus Christ don't ever question my fucking goofy memory that memory that makes no sense Roger also tucked his away too yeah fully snapped and just would not fuckin suck all right oh how could it's hogr how just breaking his own heart the best I mean he would y'all stop there looks like you almost tapped so he gets out and when he gets out his arm is fucks Ville so they stay in the back up again now watch when they stand him back up again he realizes his arm is fucked and so he can't use it so check this he talks it in his fucking belt dude savage savage wouldn't tap wonder decision to Chuck race such an animal animal but to Dickens I'm a fight I think Jacque raised fighting soon I think he's got a good foot to good fight right was it who is Jesus head he's gonna just what you might as well Kentrell it is his birthday fuck he already believes that the moon landing is real so it is a good point yeah do that bad out of that yeah we did we did I just want to talk a little conspirator that MLK teen youth what do you think of that because you're kind of a government I'm gonna have to Mike Baker I like Mike Baker I didn't hear him anything about that that's later towards the end I was one of the last things I want to ask him the last half hour show there's a lot of YouTube videos on that by the way l MLK that being a you know conspiracy theory that's that's just one of the conspiracy yeah I think most like there's the John Lennon one too sure but but just MLK for sure he was disrupting this he was bringing people together in a way that could disrupt power masses different than the body types this is ridiculous looks like a before and after and then there's well Marcus what king was was just a shill there's one of those where there's pictures of him and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers we're hanging out dude they said he's dead parties and fucked just white girls well I would too if I was him that's what this is my really that's another but that conspiracy theory for sure he probably met those people because for sure they probably wanted to meet him it's not like you're either in or you're out with a group like that right two pictures I mention it there's YouTube videos on MLK in the promo being um let me hear that something here this Z screaming what do you say something said Oklahoma stand up but there's no one in there in LA so it's done yeah Oklahoma stand up you got like two dudes in the audience and two lion lion that they're from Oklahoma yeah we drove through once Big John McCarthy good answers trying to slow everything down his mind you know what a guy like this you almost wish he he got into ten years ago you know yeah you can do some work a belt or a heavyweight though he with that wrestler you probably win the whole thing if he can figure out a way to not get hit you know he's huge try a Viking what does he weigh Brendan do 35 to 65 fine let's try and listen to 35 I think they said it I use 240 something he's a big fuck dude do you think there's a point of like where you're too big do you think like people think 265 is like 2 bit too big real 240 look at lead all that champions a steep a 240 contain 240 JDS 240 you know depends on how you say door 235 you could be 300 pounds guys you can't talk over it sorry come on bro you could be 300 pounds and athletic and the problem is in my opinion as far as jiu-jitsu goes the bigger the guy the less training partners he has to really get real roles and so they end up like not really training right right and that's why generally speaking the bigger the guy in jiu-jitsu the less technique he has because he's used to rolling day after day just using his weight in his power it's not his fault yeah you know I mean but if you get if you got AB dude this 285 pounds and somehow he had like a billion billionaire backer and he just got all these big guys like every day he had 1520 big guys the roll with hooch at chug yeah the gold see that's an example boo shush is a big motherfucker and he's super technical yeah super technical moves like a cat yeah so it just it's just the bigger the guy the the shitty or the training yeah you know with the big dudes you just have put together a super camp big big guys come through and they quit jiu-jitsu often because no one will roll with them I think that's a big reason what why DC's as good as he is and Cain's as good as he is hotter those two fucking superheroes smashing into each other every day fuck yes you are correct Luke Rockhold told me that that when Cain was healthy without question baddest guy on the planet and gave all of them all of them there he was a nightmare for DC said - healthy heals brother beats all of them yeah and this is awful everything is dude I'm telling well we never seen anything like healthy came nobody can't fuck with him no one no DC said to me that he goes if that guy was healthy he goes I really watch Kane train with Kane I can't beat that dude who said I can't beat that guy and DC was saying it just with a 100% humility up and just saying look the guy was the best me wish I wish there was a way to find out who really was the best the most accomplished his steep a and he doesn't get in the picture enough and it's not his fault Oh Aaron Pecos fight next fuck yes because with steep a steep a look he did what he had to do he won the title but the guys that he fought in that time period were not the best of the best it was like he fought Cain when Cain fought JDS - oh my god that was not fucking wise bro and that was prime J prime J dias was a mother for motherfucker also argument at two fader went undefeated for what seven gamers that is a mr. Pico yeah and I'm saying like they did all the Pecos so yeah everything he went on to feed you don't know what phaidor did but we know that they definitely let people do things so whether or not he did anything or didn't do anything it's just purely speculation I'll leave that up to you I mean I bet my life on it but not a big deal but some people over there were definitely doing stuff and they were encouraging all the stuff and we know people that went over there would they encourage these people to tell yourself so whether he was undefeated for seven years at that level but it was that take everything aside leave all that go what fate or has that none of them have his that motherfucker will catch armbars off his back like a lightweight yep that's the one thing that separates him from everybody people would throw him through the air he would hit the ground and five seconds later he'd have you in something but also his technique his technique was so unconventional I yes it's not you can't train that like with his hands down at his hips and shit in swing position so he could take a shot I mean the Fujita fight remember we went on rubbery legs my feet got fucking rocked man not to mention I'm the biggest thing dude had dadbod during all thick all of it didn't give a fuck run to the mountains with laughing trees ate all the gun that's weird shit on the side oh here's something about fate or they people told me you know it's a favorite restaurant what Red Lobster that motherfucker loved Red Lobster no it's you know it's favorite clothing store what Abercrombie & Fitch well it smells good in there what's up now drop jams Red Lobster well fuck you can't get enough the shrimp scampi I guess I guess if you're from another country you don't know any better well so you don't think sounds like raw this place is all just not bad like we're all on the road if we were in Kentucky and we're just driving through some weird fuckin truck stop and there's a red stop Red Lobster great in every bucket is a Red Lobster it's pretty tasty some crab legs fuck up Lobster exactly what did water boil it to my Potter and live in Russia absolutely nada cuisine gangsters we're no but some organisms correct Salt Lake life soul-shaking in Utah I don't some organisms I don't know I don't think it has fish nothing fatal can install flats puppets it says it's it's Salt Lake City's try it's actually surprised yeah but there's a lot of water there in Salt Lake dude can you imagine a lake you ever fly over when you go to wise guys you do that you do I'll be there March 1 and 2 I love see there 100 is my favorite owner out of all the clubs okay the fucking best Keith is a great guy last time I was there I was hanging out talking them after the show the staffs all super cool he Key's know sports like a motherfucker was a offense coordinator at Alabama great lake Great Salt Lake is too saline to support fish and most other aquatic species several types of algae live in the lake okay writing shrimp and brine flies can also tolerate the whole sentence though Brian trip eggs are harvested commercially and are sold overseas as prawn food dude can you imagine phaidor comes here meet some hot girl it takes her to Red Lobster an Abercrombie & Fitch she's like why go ok goofy sweater of honor on that sweater of victory but he thinks just a baller move ya doesn't knock tops yeah but bulletproof cars pull up to drop them off there your silly these bulletproof Suburbans with solid rubber wheels and shit and armed he just smells like your house fucking cologne from a twitcher car smells like your car hey does this crank Glazer did he play for Jay Glazer did he play football or train MMA or any mm but he's a tricky standing I think yes isn't he an MMA coach sometimes people say well it's yeah yeah Johnson Frank Trigg oh oh shit peek over again dude oof look at that guy he throws a nasty left hook man he's a bad motherfucker remember one amateur wrestler in the nation came out of high school and he's so young fought in what is now 23 oh my god 222 that's so Freddie Roach is he's the only guy Freddy Roach co-signs like this is he came to 10th planet right yeah I was trying to I was trying to convince him I had no idea what his his background his no his strategy was it for his MMA career I had no idea all I knew is he came to me and he was just fucking monster Oh Eddie Horus is a debuted years ago did you roll with him let me tell you this let me tell you the story so he shows actually Joe Texas go hey dude there's this fucking beast named Aaron Pico new dude coming up he wants to train with you like they were like looking for my contact info and I said yeah yeah yeah I have him have him text me and then he text me and to be honest seriously when people come through and they tell me they're gonna be a fighter gonna be a champion and they wrestled 12 years seriously but here Peter I didn't I didn't know who he was at this point I didn't know it was he just homies just stole signed from Rogan though it I'm just coming I've ever sent you how many guys uh shit I don't know not a ton right no it's I don't know I don't know where guys like super legit and I'm like dude dude yeah so he texts me and and to be honest like that doesn't I just go to I just go to my class every night and I teach my heart out if you want to join in on the class come on down if you you know I don't want to hear latitude is why you're so fucking good so I didn't too excited you would usually a high school kid the same way you treat a college right just wasn't excited I'm like okay I got I got a bunch of motherfuckers I'm training right now I got a lot of shit that I'm that I'm working on right now there's so much it so he texts me he goes hey Joe gave me your number let's you know I want to come down I said yeah sure come down and then then I just kind of like flaked on some texts or something and then he finally just showed up and he showed up and then I looked him up and like oh shit okay okay so I had no idea that he's been working to on being the ultimate like version of he's our LeBron James like like strategically as a fighter Liddell yeah like Chuck the bell in his prime he wrestled so it's very hard to take him down in there and if you did very hard to keep him down and that's what he uses wrestling for but Chuck Liddell was gonna come out and take heads off I had no idea that's what Aaron pecos strategy was so when I heard about him I like I pulled him to the side and I told him I said listen don't listen to anybody trying to tell you that you can be like the best striker in the world I had no idea that he was trying to be Chuck Liddell all I knew is that he was a stud Rustler so I was like one this is the best advice if I was on my deathbed this is what I would tell you I would say fucking rest so take dudes down pass their guard mound i'ma smash them choke them that should be your number one strategy you're such an amazing wrestler don't let anybody meanwhile get raised on what the fuck is he talking about cuz I'm gonna do the opposite of what you're saying he didn't say anything so I kept reminding him this every time he gets just wanted to learn jujitsu he's a nice guy has he ever got taken down and he ended up on the ground he had no intentions of using his wrestling to take people down and win the fight on the ground you don't know it but every time I'd remind him I'm saying the same shit over and over you know the guys he trained through it they say them I fuck her you know the guys who trained with the best of the best he does not the last cuz you know if anybody's in it in his first fight he got caught with an uppercut he got staggered and then he got guillotine correct he fought a bigger guy sham and fan you fuckin die oh so you can't eat YouTube him wrestling international guys like from Turkey Iran whatever when he was 16 but like 30 check this out so she's free so I'm just let me just finish this story so even up to that point right after that loss I still didn't know that was his ultimate strategy I didn't know so after that fight what I said was like you know what it was almost like I told him let's turn your ass into that khabib that GSP that unstoppable takedown machine where you smashed on the fuckers on the ground and you fucking choke them out let's do this shit this was after that first loss and then I didn't hear first cuz when he get clipped and he got hurt then he got submitted have you alright so for me I was like say we should we should just watched all his fights yes yes mile issue with him he's because because he trains with world class guys and like I said doesn't ever lose rounds he show companies like do this isn't TJ Dillashaw this isn't sky girls I'm gonna smoke this guy so his respect isn't there yet and he just comes in because he's knocked down miguel cotto train so he comes in i got clipping just doesn't give us yeah okay before i forget only just finish this so now once I realized that I was giving him advice that was the complete opposite of his whole training in all his coaches all his coaches were wanted to use the rustling to keep the fight standing so he could use this is a striking you know what I mean so I then I finally realized that then he witnessed his own way and then you know it took me a couple two or three fights to realize the damn never right shit this motherfucker can I was wrong it's just Mikey's son that he's fighting no no this is the top featherweights oh now at this point I just want to make this clear now at this point I realized damn holy shit they did have the right strategy is an amazing striker I just went I was just going by that's your thing like no no just like the odds like dude we already know you're one of the best wrestlers in the game we already know that that stick to that but you know what I had no idea that is striking is extraordinary so to fight for him this is a fighter Eddie cross is a very good fighter this is tough fight by far but like I was talking the belt or guys to the insiders like it's not don't expect them just smoke them the first round which I always think I think you finished in under four minutes but like no no this is a what I think that I think is critical for a young fighter that's coming up is to not rely on any one thing now if you're talking about a guy who doesn't have to rely on any one thing you're talking about Aaron Pico you're talking about a legit world-class wrestler but if people know that you want to stand and they know that you even though you're one of the best wrestles in the world you're not gonna threaten them with the takedown that becomes an issue because there's certain guys like Gaston bolaños or the certain there's certain boxers or strikers they got some nasty shit for your ass and you if you they know for a fact you're not gonna take them down if you're standing up with Paul de Leeuw okay and he knows for a fact you're not gonna take him down he's gonna launch a left hook from the moon he's gonna hit you you're probably there planned this LAN P would be gone it would be but then that someone I'm saying goes it's not going good on the feet please let me finish the most important thing if you can do all those things is that the other guy has to not know what you're doing that was George st. Pierre's greatest strength correct he never knew when he was punching you or he's taking you down and you were always you were always behind Koscheck face yes jab and he's like so fucking good at that here and that and he's not the best wrestler and he's not the best striker but he was the best at figuring out how to do things you didn't know what was coming next where were you oh you're loaded you for us a hobby and him were a phenomenal combination because feroz's so intellectually so smart and he's thinking rationally he's not like you're gonna go in there and you're gonna fuck him up none of that it's all about overloading his mind is all very rational very technique based very psychology based but the reason that MIT what made that GSB so good also is he you didn't know what he was doing but he was facing that high level competition classic Matt Hughes picot all these guys he goes oh I don't need to use my rest I'm not going out the bottle shot right this guy with Henning Krauts you're gonna see the best version here in Pico cuz he can't just sit there and fucking box to them you see his wrestling I bet you're gonna see some different mix it up do you mean up in pushy Dominator do you remember what John Danaher told us the secret to GSP is do you remember was that what we're eating at that restaurant yup and he had hair John under he goes he said the secret to his success is it's super simple he's gonna either faint easy they're gonna faint jab or he's gonna actually really jab you or faint takedown or actually take take you down so that was always a feint before everything yeah because he just he's always so we never know so you never know when that shots coming charm our Pico well that was the whole thing for aa sahabis just so the two of them together worked so well because they both have a great check of their ego and an understanding of the consequences and you right-handed Nate Nate Marcus Lenny right and the release man they're both really released neighbor told me cuz he's to turn with him all time said that he's an amazing chess player George yes and so George is an amazing so he's really strategic I feel like he could always find me shout yeah empty where where are you where you had a weakness near yeah that's where he well he was super open-minded to men yeah I mean didn't he like learn back kick from you were like yes like he just had a DC place yeah I felt so embarrassed that I'm like I just felt it was ridiculous that I'm gonna show him anything yeah there's video on YouTube of Joe roses other than GSP yeah but you know what I fucking kicking lesson kick your back because well I knew I would never have tried to sell it to him if I didn't have anything but when that came out of that same meeting with Danaher we were in the restaurant Danaher set it up cuz he goes I'm looking for and he told me afterwards that he set me up he kind of heard so he's like I'm looking for someone to teach GSP how to throw a turning side-characters technique is off it's like we're gonna fucking James Bond movie or something yeah with his accent so Corrales is 10 years older there's no partying yeah it's a tough fight for Pico I still think Pico gets it done well it's it's all about where's Pico at right now it's all about where's yet right now because one day is gonna be unbeatable all right yes it's like he's 22 what did you 545 is it 45 45 yeah he's on this streak that if he can keep up this intensity and he keep up this mindset he's gonna be a world champion the only thing they could stop him as a grave injury a grave injury or some sort of a mistake in his thinking where he starts taking things for granted yeah find someone else to yeah well I'll do a hot girl train for humble no he's on it is super nice you know what he's good at though the one thing that he got out of training at HQ is he's pretty goddamn good at twisters twisters handle this shit dude he lives for this shit the thing is how long can he keep this up right now he's doing whatever right now he's 22 he's making money he's a fucking Savage come on he's something special it's where he belongs right he saw look I mean he's just he does everything so well everything from his defense to his strategy I mean dude he looks like a world champion boxer when he's got his hands up it doesn't mean he can't get caught doesn't mean he can't get finished he can get a little reckless this motherfuckers got to keep your hands getting he's gonna be so good he hit so fucking hard yeah body shots his kids tell you when with the Dutchie Oh with a bit a little bit definitely got hit this is a real fight you know morales hank crawle assertive pico also has a crazy 6-pack to under for bro oh the left hooks coming there's 1,000 sighs well he's little concussed across his little concussed don't stop it Morales Morales okay wow so Raymond Corrales is not the home needed the body too bad Oh Brendan just fell out of his fucking chair Oh No that's what happens in fighting that's what happens in fighting that's what happens that's what happens in fighting holy shit speechless I don't like seeing a young man get hit like that that was crazy watch this watch this again why is so reckless a savage but do this Luke he's 22 he'll learn but watch this John Jones didn't do this so he just he just Wade's in and you could tell the Corrales had recovered look at this body shot body shot hurts them they're out cold out cold two big bombs look at this one more time [Music] that's all she wrote dude everything goes on the drake of mms you on the way down - on the way downs head is not this again look at this boom perfect shot shit the lights go out in Georgia one two on the way down and then a third one when he's already out cold holy shit that's some killer instinct right there that could stop you here you time I got this progression that is not cast as well yeah the first time he doesn't know what happened he's trying to figure out what happened now I mean he was come Freddie's going fuck this MMA so let me understand my deathbed confessional now yes astral traveling your your deathbed confessional you're correct he could have taken him down who's gonna stop Aaron Pico from taking to keep them all khabib him he has a date why not to marry you but here's the thing you can do all things you can do all things but if you're standing in front of a guy all the time if you get that guy hurt the way he got that heart that guy hurt if your objective okay it's easy to be Monday Monday Morning Quarterback right but objective looking at right now I would say shoes hey Kim - yes he's hurt come down smash them up because and then you take no damn ha no chances it's all variables it's all about mitigating variables you close all the variables down when you take guard down to mount them and start dropping elbows on his head you close all the variables if you can maintain the mount position and keep punching and you already know he's fucked up it's all it's a matter of whether he's gonna tap the strikes or you gonna get a choke I don't like seeing that it's a such a bummer it's a bummer it's also not a bummer for Corrales it's like this is a game it's a heartbreak and everybody needs to see that young guys coming up need to see that as good as you are you got to understand the mind you can't let yourself get sucked into this path for glory where your wild and reckless and you're not keeping your hands up and you're not respecting the power of the guys especially when you have to technique though there's no reason to play look he's a fucking killer man he heard them and then just he's all blood and was like fuck it don't have the experience okay yeah and then just came in and what buddy these 22 and he thought he could just smash that guy and he heard you look like he was going to think he was going any probably would if he fought technical but he abandoned ship spirits his prize yes yeah baby yeah yeah caught on a clinch and this kid had him here and he was hit well the kid him to the body twice and cross and he clipped him on the chin with the perfect punch perfect right hand I mean his neck snapped his fucking head spun around it was perfume was out cold before he went down and on the way down he clipped him two more times one more time when he was down I gotta buy a do Nick's all right suppose you listen all three of you I got to go to my rap party have to come see me and Austin miss the face faders neck I gotta go fight you sure you don't want to stay for the face it's definitely not gonna go more than one round nope and Joe or me Brian I am out before you but you gotta hear where Jamie's gonna be there to recording it has a record he has a filling in his - that hurts when you record things dude enter Peter right now it's going what man you know I don't think he totally understands even what happened peezy B well champ I still think he'll figure it out he certainly could anything can happen here's all he just needs to fucking this game planet you gotta fight technically always and there's there's moments where you have to open yourself up but the guys who do it correctly I'm gonna give you a perfect example style bender that motherfucker when he gets you heard he he goes after you correctly yeah he doesn't defense a fuckin yeah there's no way you're gonna get knocked out from the mouth no you could knock a guy out from the mouth but he can't not talk about great all-time MMA strikers let's talk about Anderson Silva Anderson Silva when he would hurt you he would take his time he would take his time and he would stay focus and if he knew you were fucked up and he knew he could just walk in and smash you then he would take advantage let's see this i watch this so so now he uppercut see yeah perfect he gets the guy hurt falls back and but look at this he moves towards like he can't hit him like he's can't hurt him and look at him he just stays in that clinch and Pecos right there when the right hand hits boom because he stood right in front of the guy he even when he was getting hit with shots he never adjusted he just was bullying his way forward see he's bullying his way forward I mean look he got clipped and the guy launched a perfect right hand but my thing is Pico really shouldn't be standing in front of him right here flipping a coin okay because maybe it's heads maybe it's tails judge took upstairs yeah two to the body went upstairs but my thing is if you're Aaron Pico one of the best wrestlers to ever do MMA why wouldn't you shoot right there you've got that guy in a position where he's throwing wild shot so you want the knockout that GSP is looking for that duck under right GSP he's got a duck under shot take you down and then you fuck is gonna beat you up when you stand back up you're gonna be bewildered and exhausted he's gonna hit you again he's a young guy man he's a young guy young lion phenomenal talent but this is a lesson take ego and take your personality and take your personal identity out of this and look at this as this is these little pieces that are moving around on a board and these pieces have properties they have values and they have their power and they have weaknesses and if you watch these pieces play out like you're looking at a mathematical algorithm you realize when there's flaw when can it go wrong here's when it could go wrong we stand in front of each other and just do this it can go wrong for everybody everybody that's ever lived gokhan Saki got knocked out by Khalil Roundtree with a perfect left hand right go Khan sock is where the greatest kick boxers of all time doesn't mean Khalil is not a great fighter he's very very very but even high-level fighter it's just anybody can get caught if you're standing in front of all can only take yes think about all the fighters in MMA history that have been known to have rock-solid chins all of them have one thing in common for a while that I never got hurt they never got rocked right for a while so like damn he's got a great chin he does he's never been rocked and he's been hit solid right right so we know that guy has a solid chin it's probably gonna fall apart later you only get so many of the shock yeah you know already with Pico he got rocked in his first fight and in this fight he got rocked obviously got this fight he got flattened we know now so we know now that damn you know he's not he's not gonna be known he's more to have the ultimate chin for sure I think he was hurt already I think it was hurt and even though he's moving in for the kill I think he'd been tagged a few times in the mix there and Pico oh really yeah I think there was a there was punches that landed and maybe they didn't take him out and maybe they didn't even make him buckle but all those but when you get clipped have you ever walked into a door and people don't know you walked in the door and you can just keep walking but your heads like fuck now imagine a fight with that your phone I just bumped in yeah yeah yeah thing shoved right into my earlobe hurt or my like a bitch but if if you get that many Kos that early in your career it's not a good sign how about pink oh yes it's dangerous fuck - that doesn't help either boxing sparring it's koto it is the age it could be yeah I mean those those things are luckily luckily for Pico he's such an amazing wrestler he can actually he has the choice to go you know what I could go to go to my next in the next fight after that and just you know trade fucking blows and just it's like Russian roulette yeah you could do that you can keep doing that or you could just play it safe and go you know what I'm gonna use my wrestling to take this motherfucker down mount assassin could be these motherfuckers four by Brian one round dude one runs gonna have to bid day one right maybe ten minutes maybe be safe for ten more minutes do you tell me where we're going move you're the life of the party when you get there anyway this party's gonna go on forever I bet most of their yet dude the last fight adverse fighting right no you gotta stay dude all right we love you man love you happy birthday dude happy birthday yeah here's a 52 more Eddie I think what you just said is very important thing you said it's very important and this was a really interesting thing there's two choices keep doing what you're doing or go khabib style but this is really interesting what happened with just happen well there's three choices one is mix both of them up like GSP the thing about GSP that's so interesting is it wasn't Jessica Beebe style it was who knows what's gonna happen no he was the reason the only reason he was striking is cuz you just can't go in there at the Bell and take a guy down you got a set so he was always just setting it all up he was throwing jabs setting shit up but the number one mission in his mind was to take his opponent down and play it safe and mount him and pound him her ground if you forgot what should the that wasn't a blueprint with Josh Koscheck yeah well this was a boot plant with Johny Hendricks you with Josh Mikey jab the shit out of members right but in the double like every fucking body down GSP didn't take it not because he didn't try it's hard to take down he tried a few times but he was in success - Josh Krajcik the game plan was literally to get him to move forward so you nimble are you I remember winning ESPYs fights you are designed to take the fight to the ground they got real born to us fellas but no an intelligent way there's no way and I say so intelligent as far as entertainment just a view that was fun he'll blow up a pay-per-view yeah for sure Bisping look great phenomenal she's in LA right now training with Freddie yes they said he's real thin too looking at a 55 fight Wow and even though even though khabib does stand a lot and and play on his feet a lot his his main objective is to take him up yeah yeah that's the main fuck around and throw some strikes why are they still talking about a Floyd Mayweather fight it's embarrassing I don't know what the fuck they're doing is just talking about I know he goes I live three fights left if it's up to me it's Tony dize PG SP and Floyd Mayweather when I hear that want to throw up but what do you think you just want to see Johnny and get the fuck out do you think he thinks he could beat him cuz he's such a savage yeah they do Mike you can't beat like you don't think Floyd can knock him out they're in for a rude awakening well he's certainly bad are you I mean maybe he lasts all 12 but they get battered the fuck up it'll be awful yeah but could be I mean if that's what you want do you get paid in I much rather see him fighting GSP yeah me too but I don't think I don't think it's I mean it's a terrible move for him to fight Floyd Floyd would just look Floyd is the best box or maybe of our era maybe of all time maybe he's he's undefeated here's the problem the UFC let Conor do that once now he's Conor we can barely get him to fight he's worth 100 you Gillian dollars right and they're like do please fight it not make so much money off whiskey and this yeah I'll fight when I'm ready they're not gonna let that Evert you're never gonna see that again what I don't think you see they're crazy now that now now that the frittatas don't own the UFC and now like this corporation owns it now everyone is no no wait what are you saying I'm saying that Conner has so much leverage now where it's not a good thing so you think you're gonna make someone a giant star who could be a giant star because they're worried that person's gonna have leverage no they'll make them a giant star in the UFC they're not gonna let him jump over and do a co promotion with Floyd Mayweather again maybe put that list in the car they keep doing it who else would they do it with this that's the better question here's the thing if they had another Conor they do it the same way it's a way to make money it's a smart way to make money it was a fun fight we watched it we got to see it's an education it's an education for people that appreciate martial arts because you really got to understand what a world-class top of the food chain may be the best of all time boxer does to an MMA fighter and you think we're gonna pay for it the general audience and for that I'm not one saying what I'm saying is is it was up it was good for the it was good for the sport and if someone comes along that's different someone comes along it's not Floyd did someone else and the same situation arises again and there's another opportunity to make a shitload of money they're gonna do it again Boyd Floyd's 40 years old he probably doesn't want to do it that many more times the only thing that would fuck Floyd up is his extravagant spending isn't it a bad look for MMA too so let's say Floyd's 27 at this point and he's won the greatest and we go here's Conor smokes him here's khabib smokes him here's style Ben smokes him hmm at what point is he like this is a bad look man our guys can fucking torch what depends on whether or not it's obvious that they had no chance like with Conor the interesting thing is like he landed a couple of shots get up and you go okay if this guy could take this guy down or even just kick his legs if Connor could just kick his legs it would be a wash and it's interesting to watch someone even fail against someone who's way better at their sport the real question is your ever are you ever gonna see a world-class boxer by the time we saw James Toney he had been like really late in the game when Vince Phillips fought Masato and k1 he was late in the game they were on their way out looking for money right after thoughts right after for the most part for the most part do you ever think you're gonna see like a Crawford step into MMA Aloma chenko step into MMA in their prime I don't think so why would you wrestle how much money I know they need to make it so cuz they're at that level to make you so much money and you why would you risk going into the think about in 50 years how awesome that posters gonna be of Conor and Floyd gonna be 90 and framed and I have that shit'll 1 Joe Lewis Max Schmeling I'm all good on that see I saw that it was a great spectacle I love being part of watching I'm glad killed the pay-per-views mm-hmm I'm out man if someone else does it it's not it's fun I know what are you talking about so if someone else comes along so you tell me the same person even Conor alright sake could be even Floyd you like well you're talking to degenerate I watch it I watched women fuck in their underwear be like okay me to be like yeah I'm saying the masses I don't think are don't worry about the mass I don't think I don't think you're right well that's what do you have seen I think many more people could be stepped in and tried to fight Floyd right now right now they set it up in two months I guarantee you it would sell at least a million pages Connor you would like I said a million I said it doesn't million or more something like well here's it be private million its Floyd he doesn't miss when who was who was Floyd's last was it Pacquiao and then Tim Bradley if I pack y'all then Tim Bradley never retired right and patio got the Giant the most pay-per-view numbers ever but then Tim Bradley if I'm correct only got a few hundred thousand like three hundred thousand yeah wasn't that right yeah that's right so then afterwards he fights Connor and he gets like two million whatever the fuck it was so giant paper you say Andre Berto Audrey burger kill that's right so he fought my apologies Tim Bradley so then he fights Andre Berto that only gets three hundred fifty thousand or something like that pay-per-view buys then he fights Connor fights Connor in its millions of paper views if he fucked a beep it would still be better than fighting any of those other guys agree a hundred percent Bradley like you've saved he had a fight with Bradley or save no it's tuna no baby that manny pacquiao fish for email is probably you can get that that's a big one that's a big one especially Manny Pacquiao now after he Broner after you look good that Australian do look good it looked very jealous Australian guy lost a pound it's right but he see him that Matisse and then and then that Matisse Oh for forty forty okay he's still gay ya mean I asked prime but yeah no disrespect Jeff horn either I fucked that one up he's a math teacher he is a math teacher he's even Crawford fought him whoa that's me realize how good Terrence I realize he's the math teacher whoa Crawford is if he's not the best in the world he's top two or even Freddie said that I asked him who's the best he was that it'd be tough to go against Crawford right now notice nobody calls Crawford out so good shit up to everyone challenge them no one really fucks with I'm so good at switching to switching stance good win well because there's a promotion it's a fucking that's what's wrong with boxing Joshua Eddie Hearn yeah interesting Bader's gonna take fade around I think so I agree it's shown massive signs of chin deterioration yeah well Bader's in his prime I really fully believe that I mean when I saw him beat the shit out of MIT Rio and take him down at will I was like I am so impressed dude how about a starch King mo in like 30 seconds dude he's a different guy when he moved over to Bellator to something happened and I mean it was almost like you realize like holy shit I'm not even in the UFC anymore I got to really make something here when he built beat Phil you know he's beating some really good guys man he's any really good guys when you look at him like everything about him like technically the way he's moving the way he fights and he's a good example what we were talking about earlier you don't know what he's gonna do he's gonna take you around he's gonna strike with you he's doing everything and he's mixing everything up and his mentality yes fucking in his mentally probably the other thing he was telling me is uh so he was trying to negotiate with belt or his contract this is his last finest contract so I'll hold up you're gonna be a free agent and be a double champ champ because that's your risk in that like holy fuck if you own the light heavyweight title and heavy wood town you bout to get paid yeah and I said oh how about a super fight with DC whoa double champ double chin well the thing is although he's famous in you know the Bellator circle how many people know who he is outside of Bellator I mean how are you FC though a fighter winter bro forget in terms of pay-per-view buys people forget do you see you there if they don't see you there they go where's he been you don't talk and sell double chamfers double champ you can sell it if you willing to acknowledge Bellator they never have they never ignore fade or they never acknowledged when he was fighting and pride like they never thought they'd they literally didn't even want me to say pride yeah they don't wanna acknowledge other organizations yeah especially back then because pride fucked him over remember they had that whole sneaky deal like they gave him Chuck Liddell and Vandelay is supposed to come over here and then they've renege dit was a disaster and I was still as a person who's a martial arts commentator you have to bring up fate or you had to bring up Vanderley you had to bring up a lot of the people that were making big noise over in Japan and he was one of them you know cool if they had opened up so we could see who's the absolute best in the world Bader is really good man he's really good and I really would I would be very curious to see how much better he's gotten because sometimes guys turn a corner and then all sudden they just become the best tough to tell you that his his opposition right now because Mitrione right he was in there but he was never a world beater in the UFC I mean he was at a top five guy you know I'm saying like you've never contender rely but until Phil Davis no Phil Davis guys leads a lot of fucking good people and Phil's another one who looked better once he got to Bellator he looked better like he like he turned a corner as well and then I was like there's a new chapter in your life like that you got to rise to the occasion in the King mo King mo off the old earners career yeah and then phaidor oldest shit in his career so it's like we I don't know what Bader is that you know great wins though yeah and you know what heal right now in the UFC there's no button once anyway once Bellator stars started signing with the UFC like with Chandler and Alvarez Alvarez Albert well in that way and now Ben Askren yeah you can't you can't say shit about Bellator no more no exactly you're trying to take when Bellator fighters are being signed at UFC based on their stardom Bellator is legit as fuck Oh super legit especially certain weight classes for sure one of the best on the planet you know yeah Hebe Woodley I mean muchassi Mousasi is absolutely one of the best on the planet hands Chandler is beating Alvarez Alvarez one of the best on planet Chandler's one here's the other he'll never go to the UFC well he likes being over there here's argument to Ben Henderson UFC world-class comes the Bellator it's been a struggle it's been struggles he fought chorus cough which I don't think was the right move terrible idea to me like this is not his weight class I'm just a five pounder and I love Ben friend of mine but he doesn't look like the same Ben that you know compete against Frank Jaeger and that's true but you have to remember that he's been fighting world-class competition forever so B's yes rice rest true yes but Eddie Alvarez was later he came along his career was hard and rough but it was later in in the in the time period than been underground King yeah Henderson was like WC write the Showtime Showtime you better remember he was a champ then yeah so Pettis takes his title with that crazy kick to close out WC they go over to the UFC he beats every it means fights everybody he fought so many fucking tough guys so many guys you know and then didn't he fight he got stopped by dos Anjos when dos Anjos was on his up come when dos Saunders is on the way to the title that was the big fight was him in Henderson ek Odom yep he was a motherfucker back then dos anjos for that time period there was a time period of like two years where I think dos Anjos was just a fucking Berserker like one of the best light weights of all time and then and it's not I don't know it could be a coincidence then you sada came you want to lose I'm just I don't know you know one thing that will never go into 70s a fucking monster 70 he's not as good at 70 as he is 50 she's fucking that's every arrow the guys like kymaro Oman it's gonna be probably the guys like Kobe Kobe undersized yes oh well to a big strong wrestlers degree problem of our time to fight no matter fighters go from Bellator to the UFC or UFC the Bellator no matter what in that debate the one thing will never change is the level of prestige and the belts like the UFC belt yeah dude the UFC its king do a tougher road to get it yeah well it's also it's not even like saying a and B it's like saying a and F there's so many separations between a Bellator belt in the use you're talking about the pristine yes that's a prestige but when you talking about town Douglas Lima in my opinion is one of the best welterweights on planet Earth Rory MacDonald who beat him in a very close decision where the best welterweights on earth Eggert Musashi is one of the best middleweights on the fucking planet these are these are all realities Matt for anybody who understands MMA because it's just different you don't go you crawl through the same shit that you have to if you're in the FCO to give you UFC champ dude you better be you're you're the best yeah hands-down the best yeah you walk away 55 you walk away you know Chuck Liddell is always going to be a former UFC champion horse crazy UFC champ it'd be champions all these chant UFC it means more it's always going to mean more it's like q-tip swab it's easier with you tips it's easier to get signed to the UFC and fight in the prelims than to go from the prelims to the main card that's to get it man just get on the road ahead Lord you know how hard yes 145 pound woman and then they'll let you right in yeah exactly title WWE Superstar what do they have cyborgs right now if a man in Nunez decides to take time off a fighting it for other way to her she knocks out cyborg who do they have cyborg fight they fight and get a second against you want to fight but how crazy is the way she won what are you gonna do what you gonna do right but she'll fight again you've got to do a I read I work on the sidelines and not enough space think you need to have like a technical foul and accidental foul and that's the end of the fight because if it's if it's it's a foul if you poke someone how the fuck is it not a foul if you're if you smell a punch if you throw a punch and as you're throwing your right hook your thumb goes in someone's eye and they stop the fight they look at the replay they say it's an eye poke the referee says it's an eye poke you get disqualified how is that any different than you throwing a round kick and the toe inadvertently goes in your it's not it's just stupid it's not Megan's fault I mean she did what she was supposed to do she's tracking her down using a range lands a nice kick but she caught her at the toe toe in the eyeball but also cat turned her back and wave like but she has to say it's overshare fucking eyeballs popped weird how weird is it that there's a shortage of big women you think you're on the amount of the NBA no they all know a punch in the face think about it there should be a shortage of a hundred and fifty a hundred and fifteen pound girls it's like about this Frank is a shout out to Frank Trigg you get it Valentin is just where you go it's we get a Valentino to them Eddie if you get a Valentino Shevchenko and Amanda Nunez or Ronda Rousey this is like a hundred of those on the earth you know the ones who can only beat yours on know the ones who could really transition from kyo passion or kickboxing more time know there's some badass Muay Thai girls but they might be wrapped up in Muay Thai they might be Mariam Nakamoto or something yeah they're never gonna go back to MMA she's trying just get some injuries man she's like 41 I think you know and she's working her way working my way back to you babe she's she's a beast and as a Muay Thai fighter she's a monster and there's a few of those girls that are that way with MMA or that way with jiu-jitsu it's it's finding them all in MMA you're it's less than a hundred do but girls what's uh the weight class fuckin rows fights in tuck in ass warrants the motherfucker tucked in as well fights 25 and 1525 and lost to Valentin and good fight good fight but Valentin it just seems to be stronger more physically powerful just a little sharper a little more suited to 25 she's almost like a tweener it's like Yoanna is like not quite 150 not to 120 to some cash in a weird way with that little man five pounds means a lot more than ten pounds monster 185 dude faders walk outs are always epic yeah what could his sneakers so you just found those someone put these on can't go barefoot definitely not Reeboks we know that what do you think they are sokka knees shots yeah probably not even TSA New Balances he's always got that wooden cross man kisses it goes through the whole deal I did someone the media asked him a favor Christ and he said once Wow yeah once I did chopping onions I said fuck man well you thief he loses probably last time for him huh you never know man I mean he might just be like really bored with everything else in his life and willing to take the punishment this is the real question when when a guy's is great as phaidor it has had a career the faders had and still wins every now and then like knocked out Frank Frank mere detail some detail son and he still can win right he still can beat good guys and be you know real quality UFC fighters that have transitioned over both those guys you know Chael Sonnen was a quality fighter to frank Mirza quality fighters a heavyweight champion who's to tell him you can't keep doing this this is probably the most fun he ever has every all day what does he do he doesn't say anything in the eat ice cream he draws pictures you give him a chance he gets into that cage and he sorry reignites the fuel inside of him that led him to be if not straight his head world of all time in my eyes top three top three well see the thing is about time period it is about time period but it's also about what happened when they fought for Breezy over Doom's got to be in the argument he's gonna be the but then saw us so to steepen he I do for ya Duquesne can say bedroom door yes yeah I think those need a particular order just the four times that's Mount Rushmore of heavy weights the argument for Fabricio Werdum is very strong cuz he beat them off so great on steep a ko'd him in the first round he got reckless the street baked a odom and then a Volkoff Kayode him to your point with fader let's cool he gets up think it's sorry you're cool with Liddell Tito keep doing it but there's a difference between them first of all because Fedora stayed active and I was cool with Tito what I was one was not cool with was Chuck it didn't look right he didn't look like he was prepared you know I don't know he didn't look like he was prepared on the Mets I don't know where he's at I don't know where he's at physically I don't know what damage he sustained when I see fade or fight he wins or he loses like metrion K Odom but I think that fight though it was a good fight and I think that shot that Mitrione K toad with he is chaos a lot of people it really touches anyone on the chin you're gonna see me freak but in NFL for six years he's so light on his feet and he's fast it's like a champ yeah so he'd knocked out Derrick Lewis in like 15 seconds when they're still took it to him yeah I don't think it's indicative of phaidor being done so yes that about me is as resilient as used to be mouth and I was an underrated boxer Maldonado touched him up and he's a Brazilian zombie but he have he's really should be fighting that 170 if you didn't eat all the acai in the world fucking fade or everything you had them on that fight tried to fucking reverse it yeah sure they're like what do you got your fuckin mind it's Russia yeah he won get the fuck out here he's trying to like get him to do a yeah in Russia on a Finnish trade or do facials best friends with our Putin for fuck sakes you know I can't shit reverse there well yeah why are these Marines coming in right they come in for bigger was in them all they're doing a national anthem oh they're doing a Russian national anthem and oh my the scarran feet or with guns they brought a gun in the Octagon or fuck appalling but how weird is that they bring guns into the Octagon that is odd right to ritual I understand ritual this is not a ritual he has shoes on too right they got shoes on to a point what is happening are they gonna shoot those guys with a medicine for the troops shot holes through the ceiling that I would celebrate that but they do a whole thing with like giving back to troops and shit is that what they're doing yeah yeah okay so he says oh shit check out this great more jeans who's that guy is he singing AMERICA AMERICA let me hear this shit well they gots a doors right yeah well this guy's gonna sing both of them but he's gonna sing the rush one all fucked up oh shout out to black rifle cops Jamie the galaxy key came out stand up hot topic we can only hear it if you take your earphones off Jamie I know I don't have it I can't do that on purpose it's not fed into the right but you make it a little louder barely keep going there you go dude now we have to sit through those I'm just gonna get recorded oh okay okay alright you can kill you do you think you know the restaurant - that's a such a big honour it takes so long well we were talking to your Showtime buddy about that likewise levites I know when it's Rohnert and Pacquiao far they had to do both anthems takes forever it's like 10 more minutes oh look at that that's star-spangled banner' you mother fucker look at that flag flying in the background do you know who this gentleman is Craig Morgan it's just kinda Apple watch on how dare you that's right he's a veteran as a country duty at Apple watch oh yeah that seems like I'm not buying in you're not buying it I'm not buying it be faking bro yeah is that an apple watch as Apple watch do you also those are those fucking Chris Daughtry wristbands he's wearing that ain't fuckin bear country country's a different thing now Georgia line yeah a little bit country a little bit 21 forever yeah the mayor was 21 you know what and I dig it and I take it you like those kinds of pants yeah I love that not his pants those bootcut sir all right give me some predictions I'm Ryan Bader tkl second round gun oh Jesus Eddie committee respect brother knock him out in the first round baby no really wham and he's been on one tonight though yeah maybe right I hate to ruin it for you I think if Ryan doesn't respect for it phaidor he can get cracked well you can still here's the thing about bay door to as much as he loved you know Bay Bader I'm high I'm so high remember when in his big fight psyche hasta it Rumble Johnson John Jones like a lot of the big moments he's caught up sometimes Johnson he's shot a bad shot and fuckin he bounces head to the moon so this is the finals of their heavyweight tournament tournament that would make Ryan Bader be the heavyweight champ champ champ champ champ champ any owns the light heavyweight one right now - yeah what's up John Jones trying to run a back bro those years ago why you bring up old shit is that he says well you bring up old shit mmm run it back is that he said nope that's what I'm saying like that shit right hey bro yeah that's honor started now fucking wants to do it well there's a few guys who can I like that I love it yeah it ties up the division so it gets a little messy but I'd love to see could be vicinity so and would legalize the belt than 45 there are 35 gonna go out there it's here's anything I really believe this I think if some this is an egregious error and there's a fight that stopped prematurely I think you should almost put it up to the vote of the Internet I really do I know you had your gob euler vote yes popular vote did you say most people like 70% of the population of dummies no right succeeding it's about it a popular vote okay but let's say how about we have insane how about we have an organization of esteemed ladies and gentlemen an organization of maybe 200 accepted martial artists world-class martial artists people that committee of a hundred yeah they're doing you're gonna get the decision right every time that's a great idea if you have so much better than internet trolls voting John hackle mins and John Donna hers and philosophize and Duke Rufus Jackson Hughes's Mike Winkeljohn Zimmer Whitman's and you got a committee of the whole if you if you do have something like that Dwane Brown Street Fair if you have those Tom Segura Bert Kreischer yeah if you had all those people in like a database and they all put in their opinion you would be 100 percent probably an agreement specially if they're experts yeah are here we go phaidor looking stoic ever nervous I'm kind of nervous for Ryan well it's scary go fight man he's fighting fate or Brody and he comes out the gate you know as he's older he definitely don't give a fuck anymore he just wants to take your head off he's a second round hammer on my watch broke him he's looking for that hammer got that right hand veto it's just got that left hand loose and that right hand balled the few I think Pico is ever gonna lose again so I haven't I don't know what's gonna happen hey man anything could happen it's still one of the greatest heavyweights of all time and Ryan Bader is a better fighter than he's ever been and and really slick man he's smart he's smart and his approach [Applause] Oh Ryan Bader what's up bro that was beautiful one shot told you - holy shit is ready but call it dude dude he's got a sneaky left hook it's done this this fucking tournament beat Mitrione fucked his starch fucking phaidor - no one starts its fatal to the last look and it was a weird left hook like it was almost like if I could start out as a jab turned over at the end Arizona State left hook like how rows knocked out you wanna rag so yes I want to see that holy shit call it the top shelf guys where's manse cookies they try to tell you guys top shelf damn look at this watch this left 10 ok it's almost like a jab he looks like he was gonna you know had faked the single yeah look at that again Bing so crazy good for him to shot gosh yeah hey that was almost like that Danny Anderson Bisbing shot exercising do you think that's sad that's evident watch this against that evidence of fader just can't take a shot or is it a perfect punch it or is it both either that's heavy fuck I think it's both now I think yeah a little bit of that it's a little bit of both but damn it's a perfect punch he he dropped his shoulder down like you almost like he's gonna jab to the body right yeah but yeah it looked like almost a shot jab yeah I am dude fuck I was about to get paid so what happens now he's free agent they gotta pay now look at the heavyweight ko is light heavyweight champ hail shout out to be a left right shout out to Ryan babe yes man as part of you sad to watch fade or get cracked like no interesting well just because I'm up haters my buddy wouldn't listen you did call a dude Eddie's texting he's texting everybody told you bitch told you motherfuckers nice it's hot at a certain point you just can't take shots yeah get hit that wasn't a that was a nice shot but it didn't appear to me you know that it was the heaviest shot ever I hate to say I told you so to anybody but two young fighters this kind of shit is what I'm always trying to point out don't get caught up in the moment don't get caught up in wars because every one of those will eventually there's gonna come a time when that credit card bill is gonna come and you got all these charges and it's just you don't have the money you can have to pay but it's gonna have to pass yeah there's no way around it and if you fight a smart calculated fight like like who the fuck gets hit the least in MMA well you could definitely say I wonder boy style bender gasps current well wonder boys been dropped for a long time so yeah I think aspirin is probably the number one but he's never fought anybody at the caliber of the UFC like in their prime he's gonna he's gonna now we're gonna find out but just avoid it whatever you can do again Jon Jones really doesn't take damage either they so calculating just such a fucking beast for the young fighters - the other thing is is you trade you do all that work in the gym all that work and then you're and you have these advantages those even out when you're playing Rock'em Sock'em yeah and all that work you all that yes game playing your coaches you're disrespecting them because now it's level playing field whoever lands first it's fucking hard versus newness yes there you go same thing didn't respect the game thought she could just steamroller walk towards her she's gonna blow her out of the water pinned her up against the cage in núñez Kaka Raptor correct and that's what happens learn this is this is one person fighting on a narrative and fighting on emotions and trying to just overwhelm someone in Pico and the other person responding and catching someone weathers these openings Aaron Pico same thing I mean he was pressing forward pressing forward and he gets it gets hit with that fucking haymaker of a right hand dude you think that fader side piece or is that his translator she's with him every translator she's a translator I'm you know I'm very impressed how can you not be impressed it's up next for Bader though how much bait how much do you weigh for this fight 230 240 was e 240 I think 2:30 let's find out see if Jamie can throw weight it looks good looks articulate do he's solid fucking 2:30 I'll tell you that that's a legit heavyweight I mean he can definitely make 205 I know that's what it has he got to see official Bellator Williams see if they have it there's his wife he is super pumped about his champ champ now Scott cold I mean use this free agent better himself what is that he's the heavyweight Grand Prix chip 227 okay so two thirty kind of a light heavyweight kind of light yeah all he's got three belts what happened there I don't know you gave another one have another one broke because that was awesome oh that one has jewels on it that one's better than UFC belt the new UFC belt do do yeah I wonder why they changed it just to mix it up but why I don't know I knew shit and now here's the thing now if your champ so let's say Tony becomes champ and he gets that belt they don't give you another belt this add another stone to it budget cuts was a real that's that's the word that's the rumors you don't get new belt they just add stones to God I wouldn't negotiate that in my contract but you got to give me another factor well I want the old belt I want a legacy belt those old belts are so sick yeah best belt of all time maybe I just don't like change but I look at I'm like God that looks like we want to step back it's like one portion went from the 993 to the 996 yeah there was lights the [Music] understand what the hell of that and then force like this hundred lot more you know what's great about portion of my bat let's round them up again guys like those we're running over get UFC goes fuck that you guys gonna take this shit yeah we gotta get them down the fucker you love the URC love to go see ya not the belt though how can you not love the UFC um our belts necessary I like him right of course when look how he did that look how I did that very interesting how about fatal dink throw one punch I caught him perfect man I want to see that Walmart watch Oh does this I really like this dips his left shoulder and loops we're darkman watch this boom like half a jab half a hook it was like this right wasn't like this it was like this long and he caught him at the very end with hair what'd he say yeah I don't think they'll let us I figured on things like DC you fucking pussy nice mr. Pico go get some just drops the ultimate fuckin yeah I think he's proud I was hims real humble I think I'd probably say I'm super thankful and thank my team and it was an honor to fight phaidor thanks a lot not a me smile a me no he's too smart and look good-looking guy articulate he's knocking motherfuckers out like phaidor I mean that's a real heavyweight champion you want that guys you champ dude he has so many belts on him right now that one has diamonds and I want to put those down so you could use your hands no don't dude I'd wrap them all around my necks I can't see put one on your head like a turban yeah and put the on my face and talk hey you guys want to go you guys want to go see fab Lee server do versus Gordon Ryan I can't come back it's Mexico no it's not New Mexico it's in LA we lose a chance to go when that be Friday February 22nd it's gonna be on fight pass it's a great fucking yeah and Josh Barnett it's a four-man tournament Josh Barnett Rustom Jersey of who fought Gordon Ryan in the finals of EBI six that's where EB that's where warden Ryan was born that's he won the absolute vbi that was EBI six that was his first tournament this is combat jujitsu combat that's about to slap up yeah so it's Barney not do come on Gordon what is your man crazy it's an amazing tournament yeah it's gonna be crazy dude cuz Josh Barnett just got beat by Gordon Ryan T right he got triangle dunno it's could be a rematch there and Rustom now he was in the finals and Gordon beat him in the finals of the absolutely be no six so there's two retention rematches alone but then on top of that you got Fabricio Werdum versus Gordon Ryan and round one dude I think I think Gordon Ryan Gordon Ryan is off C's the best thing in jujitsu but he wants to MMA to his person and his skillset I think he's gonna take over him MA - he's a motherfuck well it seems like Jonna harassing him the right way - Danaher is telling him like you're gonna learn how to strike first you're not gonna go in there without any skills enjoy a favorite at his gonna be you know to be good for him it's gonna you know what he'll be fine because if you watch his last few fights he likes to Mau he's not like this big leg Locker leg Locker he's an expert at leg locks he's got that whole system down but he likes to mount under jack and get arm trials and that's perfect for mms the arm triangles in MMA is one of them that's you have to be a savage with arm triangles if you're fighting a man plus his personality you got a star yeah he's a star well he's a handsome kid he's got a 28 pack two on his chest Miami is ridiculous six-pack of all time here's him and Wiz Khalifa should have a six-pack off which belief is the size of my he does but he's got a ridiculous saying that the starving kids in Africa shredded are you guys everywhere 22nd I think I'm in town I if I'm at 170 Ison's gonna be there he's part sponsor like ranch well the guy that's his partner in that mmm owns copper gel uh yeah they gave me some of that yeah so copper jealous sponsors legit look at things back that's what I'm saying I'm not lying no I know he's shredded but you computer wiz khalifa ain't we don't count stop stop and give them manners propers let's see Wiz Wiz Khalifa which is super no no no not like Wiz no Wiz has muscles like thick ass beyond that TNT program I don't know [Laughter] damn repack but they're like jumbo ounces but they don't separate in the middle there's a solid system they just they're so dense all he's doing is more time he doesn't more eat I like crazy put on 30 pounds of weight the moment I do that - yeah you gotta go to the right taco shop fuck yeah but Gordon rides doing the more impressive didn't know Gordon - 200 I just have to go chocolate body you consider that that's true what does he weigh now he's probably 225 do something crazy - 170 like it just within a year or two ago well yeah he used to be he's defined at 170 that's great yeah and then we decided to bulk up how many Pete goes all about it no comment who's testing nobody's tested he says that's a thing though if you got Pecos in your USANA your goods the thing when if you are a young guy and you're indulging in various ways to enhance your physical recovery and then you get off of that stuff you're gonna have an adaptation period and that adaptation period I mean this is an issue hold on why is it an issue Joe it's not an issue well the issue is your performance is gonna suffer if are you saying if you're in off it if you're on it and you get off of it he's a young guy if he's on it we're assuming he's on we we don't know Gordon yeah I don't know yeah what would you say I just have phenomenal Jags yeah okay all jokes aside if you do find someone no not him let's say someone else let's say you just take anybody else yes someone else that does if they do do it and they're doing it in an untested form like like submission grappling correct which mostly you can get away with whatever you want correct Eddie Marsan aligned generate general J's test like in speaking completely honestly we we know for a fact that some competitors are indulging I don't know that okay also well I'll say from I would say yes okay I'm sure some are okay every G weren't there though right not just you - we know for sure some are right you know what don't accuse any individuals but we know for sure some are sure if when when you do have that such raishin where someone is on something and then they get off of something then you have this adaptation period where their their body's not producing testosterone as much anymore they're gonna have to get on something else in order to kick-start it back up but you can do that you can do that but here's the thing too you know with this John Jones thing and the picogram thing and he did test positive out with vada right and they still on the fight well now let's say you are a Jitsu guy who comes to the UFC and you did do stuff prior and those Pico gant picograms get flagged right what he intends entirely on what your what you're doing it depends and Tyler who you are Joe well no with USANA does not it depends entirely on what you're doing no Joe in terms of whether or not you get punished twice for the same crime so if they can prove exactly the same way they prove with John one of the things that's happening is that the testing is getting far better so they can test you for stuff now that a year ago is absolutely impossible for sure so the threshold right now that they were saying this is where it's confusing to me the threshold that they tested John was supposed to be more stringent than vada yes and then the night of the fight this is where it gets weird me the night of the fight the Commission tested on all the same period same piss commission you sada and vada all tesam same piss you sodded didn't report anything Commission report anything right and if either you clear them to fight but then vada did does he forgot to have better testing now it's all the same so how's that possible so you think shenanigans with you sada yes I think it's shanae's here's the other thing Joe and here's what no one talks about with you sada in the rulebook no matter if it's Pecos whatever is if you get flagged it doesn't matter if it's from residue whatever is you cannot compete until that is out of your body that's the rulebook black and white it doesn't say well if it's picograms are still good doesn't matter right but do you understand that he's not testing positive for the actual steroids again that doesn't matter but in the rubric it doesn't say that says if you test pilot is we can I further Mattacks yes we cannot grant you the license to compete interesting which is interesting to me well now I'm not saying they should this is why they don't suspect this why honestly think they're doing this because they don't know exactly how this is happening I think they have their their theories which you know it works right now but ultimately they don't really know what's going on so if they were to suspend John and he's really not taking shit who the fuck out of him so I think that's well there's that and then there's also this concept of double jeopardy that they've already punished him for having the stuff in a system is no indication that he has recently taken it that's not the only had Joe I understand but they're making the rules up as they go along which is in issue because if this was Corey Anderson phenomenal fighter not the same drawing powers John what happens together that's the argument the Ethan if they're making it up as they go along the parameters are changing so the ability to test things is changing so if someone takes say you take creatine the creatine is tainted and you have some forbidden substance in your system and it's supposed to only stay in your system for six months if it's this certain stuff but now the testing gets better and so now instead of punishing you for something that you accidentally took and then they test you and they say oh we can prove that you accidentally took it so we're only gonna give you a six on suspension but then after the six months is over they could still test it in you yeah why because the testings gotten better what do they do now because in the past they would have said well you you it's time served this is the only argument for the the John Jones thing that makes sense is that you don't want you want you don't want to punish a guy for something you've already punished him for if you've proven that it's this is what he took with it but the rulebook is it so you can only compete when you pass the tab you read this rule yes yeah yes yeah discussion the smart with me and channel my back forth untag but how does she feel about this what does he think he should be allowed to compete because it does standing because still shut no matter what you meant to take it or not the rule is if you do not pass the test we can't grant your license to fight that is the rules as explained to most all the fighters separate the real problem would be is what if it's proven at some point in time let's just say a big fir if what if rather what if it's proven one time that they can tell if you've ever taken anything ever your whole life and they just disqualify anyone forever even if it's a test but if that happened I know it's a problem you don't have a sport this thing is a weird thing this pulse here is we're thinking of your metabolites they don't really understand here's where it's weird it makes no sense with our you thought of testing so you sada testing their parameters are based off Olympic testing right based off suspending guys two to four years you know fucked up that is to do a fighter like Josh Barnett that so how small is your window it's not we're not done Olympics don't come every four years right it's such a small window you should spend you guys for two to four years right it's fucking silly right but here's your basic do leagues but if a guy does juice and he hurt someone and gets away with it and then you catch him like you've been trying to catch him then you catch him how much should you suspend him for say if you got a guy who's hired some Victor Conte type individual back when Victor was doing this with the the clear yeah and he hires some guy and this guy gets him on some shit that no one knows what it is and he's just running through people and he's looking like you well Romero and smashing people but meter billing it and everybody's like I don't buy it something's wrong yeah and then one day you catch him you spend a four-foot station have a career ever again I don't know what she did not other what years that's ridiculous because we're going based on Olympic cricket what's the real question is like how many people are cheating right and what should the punishment be should it be based on how many people are cheating or she'd be based on the philosophy we're trying to get cheating out of the sport I don't know you ever can get it out and she's not the answer cuz obviously some question do you wish that the Japanese were super crazy strict about steroids back before pride no no no no no as a fan no bites yeah what have happened right so Anderson was making a point the other day in a rational point for letting a guy like him take something so that he could recover you know cuz he's 40 years old he still enjoys fighting but his body doesn't produce testosterone the right way name correct who's been trained he's beaten whether they try that for a while remember they made that leap it was legal for a while to I fucked it all over in Vitor there I got a peppering didn't have a testosterone use exemption Vitor did heat or did it legitimately Dan Henderson to legitimate so a few other guys had a veto like right yeah it's way worse buddy no it was like it was totally legal just like insiders no we knew there's a guy in our gym they're like er trt pass right fuck man yeah I have to be in with Dana and Lorenzo yeah like you can always be a guy like what like if they have like big veins on their bicep and on the shoulder they had like that little spider vein you're like that motherfucker so jealous TRT you get it like you got to know someone deep yeah but no one believed it was like a conspiracy theory it's like no way they allow it goes yeah dude if you have a doctor's note you could fucking do TR and why not and no one would believe it it was like dude you're full of shit it was a tinfoil hat conspiracy yeah no now I think the conspiracies all with you sada such a show it just got exploited and everybody was crying on that doctor's note would TRT yeah for a while there it was fuckin legal sure was how crazy and it was all he had a doctor's note but it was awesome and now it's two straight and it's fucking things I'm guys have to do other shit and they're getting caught how would how would you like it if you got to be the president of MMA you sounded kick rocks it's just making it more complicated we'll put the money elsewhere and obviously not what do you do a steroid testing you do how Bellator yeah you just how does Bellator do it that just has the Commission do it so basically means you got to be a moron to get caught by the Commission so if you're gonna do shit alene great a man I didn't know so if there wasn't a you Sodom and state and have their own the Commission would be responsible for it correct and what is it they just don't know how to do them right they don't do it as strict you get tested you know they don't do it weeks before they don't come randomly you get tests that you know when you weigh in or the day of the fight in the after fight and so what if what if fighters used to do that they could get it out enough yeah a reward but there are certain states like LA or New Jersey were super strict so guys like jail Sony got cotton California oh I don't know Keith Thurman EP fought tonight on Fox is that over it should be over it started at 6:00 maybe not maybe there's some fights on before it there was but it's night it's midnight in the East Coast Fox's see Keith Thurman it is was it on Fox so what it was what was it he SPN it's over who won the fun what you guys talk about Japanese tweeted your boys back tonight Oh Keith tweeted that yeah retains title yes good fight for him for god sakes now everyone to see him verse Earl Spence better Oh Spence FICA taxes Brendan if he was the king or the president of MMA how would he what would he do about the steroid situation and he said he would get rid of you sada correct seein words and then have the Commission see you have the Commission test which basically means that all you got to do is just be you know it's a stupidity terrible yes you're still gonna do shit but neither the fight you're clean night of the fight of the fight with that well wouldn't that clean from a piss test okay III think I think you so those Marines is that how they used to do it well that's how they did it when I fought when Alliser fought Brock he was clean you know tested clean yeah cuz it was a very simple urine test it was like quest labs type shit he got a job at UPS and I checked you for mushrooms so that's how Bellator does it they just don't really hey let me ask you this did anybody ever approached you and said hey man I think we can we can get you on some oh yeah oh yeah they said how do they say it it was like locker room talk like they're like oh I got this guy dude he's great he does this business I cannot afford it a fighter saying yeah that's how it starts the fighters yeah or a coach would would be like a man you know you could do this this I can afford it though how much we talking I don't know because they were going through like a doctor and I just remember air doctor I don't think he's still in business and I remember they're like your insurance won't curse you got paid cash romera asked and I read tums I got fucked that's a car payment man there's no way I can do it what I've done it probably yeah probably a short window man wonder what Bob Sapp is up to lately good question fucking girls in Japan he's on weedy boxes and trusted so dude he had a real problem in Japan you know he had to leave Oh for the k1 fight and they wouldn't let him sign a contract before he fought he's like I'm not fighting without a contract and they said first you fight then we give you contract was he like yeah so he walked out on the finals and it was the end of him see Bob Sapp had become a huge star in Japan and I don't think he's in America completely understood I mean he was like he's on glitter cereal box yeah big billboards yeah he had fucking figurines made of them I mean what what he's like what is a comparable celebrity in the United States as a super athlete maybe you know a girl who would be big right now he was so big and he was such an oddity because he was literally 370 pounds with a thing about those little Japanese girls just sucking them on good lovely it was luck God he probably yeah you imagine sketch that we wrote yes we wrote as look at him so he's still fighting this was a couple years ago yeah I didn't if you if he's doing well here to prop he was a prom but it still looks big no he's still Jai he's giant again does his tab from Mount no I think he was guy on this fight he was always a little bit of a dam he's got a belly but dude when Howard O'Gara he was about as fucking scary as he did he almost broke guy Tim that guy's in shape that he's fighting he almost broke no gears back dude he landed him on his head remember that piledriver yeah yeah for life the AIC sale fucked up for me he really hit some prompts that's built through and I mean really Bob Sapp was so big so ginormous such a nightmare like what do you do with that and because he was on everything his fucking cardio wasn't the worst like that best fighters heart but he's just such a fucking monster yeah we're yeah but if the fight went for a long time yeah that was an issue yeah well you know and after a while he took a bunch of beatings it gets a good eyeball now yeah do it croak up smash his eyeball never one eye was open and the other eye was because you get that Orbital's fuck man when people get their orbital smash they almost always like there's anything more we're sorry one eye but I caught the sniper you don't want the fucking one eye bigger than the other you make the other one bigger I don't think so is there sir jeez don't let go in there and fucking straighten out that eyeball don't let the sniper bro yeah I thought that was Theo von for a second general haircut son gender neutral you don't know what I am that's Marky Mark aren't enclosed oh this is for brothers good movie all adopted mom what gets murdered and they have to avenge her death in Detroit Michigan I remember this movie dude you're like I am DB that did I know my guys database I know it's useless I get 90s reference for four days so we wrapped this bitch up I think so man pinch around me out phaidor well the it didn't bum me out about me though it sucks for him for sure suck them off so hard before that fight but for Corrales it's a great thing and for for martial arts when something like that happens every young fighter gets another little piece of information in his database of experiences that he can at least view maybe not have but view and put that in your mind okay this is what happens when you throw a caution to the wind and you just slug it out with somebody when you just slug it out you stand right in front of somebody sometimes you get knocked out it's a bad idea and you know I mean he was winning the fight up until that moment he cracked the guys it hurt him he looked amazing and then BOOM he's standing I mean he's so good but he's still human and that's just the reality of being a human being that's fighting and I'm bummed out yeah I get it cuz you know the guy I get it I can't say that I think those those experiences it's not good for him right because it happened oh yeah knock down he got hurt anybody got hurt bad but it's it's valuable for all of us to take in what happens when you know look Eve every time a guy gets knocked out believe it or not it's valuable for the overall database of martial arts yes even even a striker like Mirko Cro Cop mm-hmm has decided on at least two fights I think when he decided you know what I think I have a better shot taking this motherfucker down sure throwing elbows on the ground from the top soccer right you know to mean that was like a strategy they didn't thought you know what I'm getting clipped every now and then it's like Russian Roulette even he's one of the greatest strikers of all time yeah one of the most dangerous motherfuckers out there and he even got to the point where he was like you know what I think I have a better shot taking this motherfucker down and smashing even Wanderlei Silva did that once or twice sure well you know member when Cro Cop fought random and random and coyote huh and Brandon was known as more of a wrestler but you know he's a fucking stud athlete this is literally what's the best part well it's certainly the craziest to watch people Pico got knocked out we all jumped out of our chairs I fell on the gun we all walked around on the ground like crazy it's great it's a crazy fucking sport man a crazy sport you know how crazy is it that we all work in it somehow like what happen they're like my family is fucking still confused fuck is anybody paying you to fight this is not I left my family as a musician not a there's as a pussy who never got into any fights I got in a couple fights but I wasn't known as a fighter right you know what I mean I I wrestled a couple years so I thought I was cheating when I would fight I was just double legged dude and punch him in the stomach until the teacher broke it up I was never ever considered a dangerous guy at all by my family by my closest friends that I grew up so even today they're like they still like man how did you pull that off dude like what though I'm like dude I don't know I got lucky pay attention to it you know I got fucking lucky good nap though because it shows everybody that if you really just learn something you get good at it you keep getting better at it you keep acquiring information testing yourself really being obsessed with it you eventually one day after years of training you become a fucking wizard at it whatever it is in comparison to how you were when you first started it doesn't matter what you do like stand up like you you doing stand up to your dude you did two years in you did a fucking Showtime special me and Brian we're in the backroom we were shaking her head is like two years incredible but you put in the fucking work you started out you were uncomfortable at first you got better and better you kept working on it you chipped away at it you were constantly constantly doing sets constantly going over your material and you pulled it off you had to Mme work ethic with comedy he has an ax pro athlete work ethic yeah yeah but it's it's that thing that's good for people to see I know it feels bad if you're not doing anything in your life and I was one of the things that people do when they hate one of things people do when they hate like if you're kicking the house they get upset because they're not and they're looking at you like you're not that good or you're not that this you're not that sometimes those criticisms are valid but at the end of the day the reason why they're expressing them is a gate as exuberantly as they are is because they're fine flaws in their own life that they don't like to address and when they see someone that's doing well they go after them they shit on my favorite role it's natural it is natural I'm not what I'm trying to say though is for all those people if you just stop putting any energy into that style it doesn't help you I've done it before I did it when I was younger a hundred percent I'm guilty of what I'm saying but it's a waste it's a giant waste of time if you just get better at stuff just find a thing whatever that is you if it's stand-up comedy there it is just find that thing and keep going just keep going my favorite Raider getting better my face here we go Rogan righteous shit like yeah yeah wrote about the hour for me I had the time to do that yeah he's given my perspective and he's writing you fucking that's hysterical that is impossible impossible comedy doesn't work that well you know who did do that though for a lot of guys will definitely did that for Chris Rock was Richard Jeni Richard Jeni would tighten up dudes material he would punch it up yeah yeah you yeah he would go do sets and he would sit in the back of the room and he would watch but hey you gotta drop that you gotta drop that to get rid of that just you start it with this and go into that and he would give you this and guys are just listen to a chemical like a cut like some guys have done that you know well I cry sure we're like I told him my story he's like your but he doesn't say do this he'd go you're you're too long here right right right focused on this and do this yeah be meaning like he's done that yeah back when I did those few open mics like 15 years ago I remember I bombed so bad just once that in the or that you just grabbed me said follow me tell you was high and I have to tell you why was it because when you're high like thoughts they're slippery you maddio's never matter yeah I was never mad no no I was not disappointed but I recognize what that was cuz I'd done it I've done it before you you went in there it didn't go well and then you just crashed and burned yeah but what happened with you which is interesting is you got really good at talking publicly and as you got better at talking publicly and doing classes and teaching classes then a transition back to Emma to stand up comedy actually made sense because now you weren't nervous at all because before you were always really funny but the hard part was you being yourself on stage yeah and that's a hard it's done and I had no public speaking experience that is HUGE I mean I joined heroes zero public speaking experience and I knew it and I thought you know what I'm gonna have to really spend a lot of fuckin time with this if I'm gonna do it right and I just didn't want to spend the time so I decided you know what I can't do it let me just focus on jiu-jitsu you know you could do if you give sewing someone's gonna do it eventually but if you could get Joey Diaz tip for it that his comedy to come off on a special like the same way he had all of us in the back of the comedy store I'll doing some of that story I'll tell you after the show I'm telling ya after the show I thought I broke my rib the next morning I was laughing so hard I was in tears yeah we have a play no it's my rib oh yeah Ari and I were literally just texting right before the show started watch Netflix special not that name things Ronald he's still a fucking monster but if you could capture that man get that game over the best in the world those Netflix specials what they're doing is a half an hour set they're doing with a bunch of other people that they probably don't work with a lot and they have two shots they have the first show and then they have second show and sometimes it doesn't work out as well it's hard you're under pressure it feels weird you're not used to the crap maybe the audience is lit up in a weird way it also gets lost in the shuffle though because there's a there's a ton of them on there you know I'm saying like Joey he's in with a bunch of other guys you you can't fault that because the ones that stand out I mean look at whether or not like that none that thing from Hannah Gatsby I still haven't seen it but I do doubt a lot of people like for difference all right okay but there was other ones that didn't stand out for that but they stood out because people really responded to it Tom Segura I mean Tom's selling out of these places because people responded so well to hispano no I'm not sitting know if Netflix is amazing unless I'm saying how his was released in degenerate there's eight thirty minutes it's a package so doesn't matter it really doesn't you think it's yeah there's a lot about Neal Brennan special from people that watch three much oh he was on the medians of the world I yeah I want to say anything about his new stuff because I'll give away the premises but he's murder impressed with Neal Brennan I was like whoa this is the funniest I've ever heard him I love that oh he's hot but mom very good it's very good he's definitely the best one I've seen so far on that one on that special he's very smart man he's very smart and his new stuff is excellent analysis his analogy of Isis don't tell ya your favorite comedians shit he punches up yes Ellen's he was Dave Chappelle's riding partner you know for the Chappelle show yeah yeah I was back when we were friends with him he hadn't even done stand-up yeah I remember that yeah hung out with him in New York yeah Eddie came with me when I did the fear factor Chappelle's sketch yeah 2004 it was a long time ago was it even it might have been three it could have been three was so the we fly out to New York and it's they're filming all day in this fucking old-ass warehouse with no windows and it's freezing everybody's in winter coats and like one of those burner here things those portable like inferno your things did he and I were fucking huddled by this and everybody was the cameraman the grips and the hook he did the crackhead character Dave Chappelle he stayed in character the whole fucking day and he's trying to tell him about me like he introduced me to Def Con because this guy he just tapped Hoyer Gracie and he was like hi Gracie damn oh yeah so all everytime we ran into each other throughout the day he'd look at me cuz you tap y'see he would say the same shit I wonder why it took Neil so long to get into stand-up he's such a brilliant I think he sat back and watched it and probably thought he could do it and then said no one let me just give it a shot and just took to it like a duck to water yep yeah but uh had a good conversation about standing up with him last night I just special yesterday last night Sebastian excellent dude it's so crazy that we see we've seen him he was just one of the regulars at the or would go in my ready to this new salon for shows at Madison Square Garden incredible you know many people that I was rattled 18,000 people a show a show yeah sort of for top ten right for most yeah I ceramics oh yeah comedy well he this year he probably gonna be number one if I had a guess Seinfeld saying hold my beer no no no can't do that he can't sell out for shows at Madison Square Garden like that he might sell out one foot for thought for is crazy there's guys like Louie CK and capsule Nell but louis c.k effing sold out two in a row I don't think he ever did like four like that should help get right to it huh that's a weekend dude you sold out for that yes it's insane it's insane it's almost unprecedented dice sold out Madison Square Garden how many Travon heart I don't know I don't know Kevin Hart or about dice that you always have to give up is that dice was numero uno nobody did that before nobody did anything like that before with dice done what he did he would sell out arenas when nobody had ever heard about doing this before Nassau Coliseum at even anymore nice dice dice Murphy was close all right it was until he stopped doing stand-up but he never quite reached the heights that dice did dice was absolutely without a doubt unprecedented cuz I remember it was happening as I was getting into stand-up but so as I was getting in a stand-up dice was selling out arenas and he would sell them out like two three nights in a row and they just he'd done hundreds of arena shows all over the country nobody had been like that before ever before everyone was doing like places that I used to like a different version a newer like cleaned up version of dice sort of you know they used to go on the road together yeah yeah yeah the Joseph story about not doing a lot on long enough set have you heard this now Sebastien talked about this he's opening for him and he's supposed to do 12 minutes and he did eight and it came to the back and dice just fucking tore my new one like what the fuck are you doing Wow well yeah do your shit do 12 nice I guess also ask is mine right yeah went too early on I did a show with the guy once I went to the green room and a minute and a half later he came backstage it was great I go right great I go what are you doing he goes he just goes I can't do it do it you're done yeah I'm just I can't so I walked out the green room door onto the stage and the audience is looking at me like what was in the UK yes yes yes I remember that I remember that shit was oh yeah a guy went out yeah and then the whole night you were trying to coach him back he's like I'm done with it I quit I'm never gonna do this laughs he's just well he did a crowd it's like what happened he used to do stand-up and then he stopped doing it like it he had a regular job too and he wasn't it wasn't doing it as much and he I think he was drinking would I know him what I know no no good guy though I liked him a lot it was a bummer hopefully figure it out but look it's fucking hard man it's even harder in England man you want to make it in England it's not as far as easy as it is have you ever had like just a nightmare show like that like it was just horrible that not one of my not not at one of my one hours like if I'm on the road no if you bought it there you know I don't know what you're doing but at the comi story I've ate all the dicks in the room yeah see you coming to see you there that's why I'm saying when I'm on the road it's that's most of my people but that's why the promise or laugh fact you have a tonnes of dicks those are so important those weird shows like there's 15 people on the lineup and they might be there to see daliyah they might be there to see crew scary shit that's the other night and you know it wasn't my crowd like I could notice right away there are old people in the back it's kind of you know they're all pills yeah whiskey's fucking good as good whisk it's good whisk you want another one I got a drive okay who's faster how funny is doing stand-up it's the funnest shit it's the funnest shit ever when you don't bomb yeah yeah Pete goes great it's it's too much fun you have a nice Saturday my special so Rogan introduced me I come out in the car so awesome oh and I strike an emotional like that my eyes start to fill up with tears like fuck dude fuck do not cry do not fuck so definitely use the edit of the second show because I didn't get emotional Wow not to find my way in that first one it was a great crowd - man they were super high ridiculous fun yeah count what happened you like 10 minutes I really stepped off the side and a proper ending up yeah it was awesome we were so proud of you yeah it was so cool yes so cool it was so fun man that's like my life man it's a super positive man did I drove all the way the fuck down all the way the fuck back I can tell you did that I drove a five and a half hours down and two and a half hours back eight hours of driving son it was rough time I got home I got my hand oh just imagining how good that bed is gonna fuck you you just like far too bad I told you I get you a room whatever you want a bird a flying a helicopter but he's like not your back dog it would have been great great how much my helicopter might be I don't know I had a drive my daughter had a gymnastics event and so I was gonna get back yeah how do you back in the morning I got emotional before the thing cuz obviously you shown up Brian my boys and then Co send me this videos heartfelt video daliyah Bert Thompson girl like I'm like what the fuck Joey Diaz yeah like what the fuck man yeah with you was like hey man you know you don't have to come like listen motherfucker I'm coming yeah I'm like I'm coming oh my god I'm not I'm not gonna miss that I need to see that I need to see that it was fun it's a good night it was very positive positive vibes I was beaming like half the way home til I started getting tired I was super happy yeah I'm so happy oh I'd say May May or April so you got a tour now and then try to work in new material while you're touring here's the thing I don't know I'm not going on the road to March I have in you me like you're fucking idiot I almost have seen because I record this special I'm done with that man so I'm trying to I still do obviously I have to do certain bits go the store but I'm trying to get at least 30 minutes before well you should but it's not a bad idea to do the road while you still can because you can make money doing clubs and pushing theaters and all the different Arab and the the strategy that I always employed it's not the best one you can do whatever you want but what I like to do is do a bit that I know works and then some new shit and then a bit I know work that's not it is a new shit I make some flashes yes I make shit sandwich correct yeah I turned that shit into beef jerky and then I eventually it's a steak yep just takes time yeah but that's the best way I found is to you got to give them some stuff that's a hundred percent legit or and have to I do I definitely still do workout sets like in town where there's fucking around but even now it's like what if I do a work outside of the store like a lot of times it's mobbed man I mean there's a story yeah I can't do mom no mom good shit and god station they go fucking crazy like yeah they've got babysitters bro I got a plan it's not horrible anxiety literally the next one I will commit the worst things I didn't like I come up with all new shit I don't I got a plan because I feel better about I don't bump people but I understand it because with a guy like Chris Rock or louis c.k or a lot of the guys that would would when I say bump it's not thought of as a negative thing it's not of as a negative thing if you really don't deserve it right like if you're a certain person you try to bump people and people like this fucking guys bump in people but you know if Chris Rock shows up generally most people just let him go on stage and it's Dave Chappelle perfect example just let them I think it's a complete respect but what it is it's how they manage to try stand-up when they know it's not their audience if they're famous so it's almost like every audience is Dave Chappelle's audience home games for them but that's how you develop material because if you if people are coming to see you 100% then you feel more inclined to do new stuff whereas if you just dropping in you feel like you could work on new stuff better but if people come to see whether he's you you're gonna you're gonna do stuff that's tried and proven I caught him last Tuesday night he was in the o.r I was leaving and I passed by and I'm like oh shit Dave Chappelle's on stage and everybody I mean there was so much goddamn loving positive energy in that room because and he was just sitting on a chair smoking a cigarette and he was standing really he said people lost their fucking mind like one line he would he would just sit there don't ever tell your wife's gay friend shit funny information that's a funny premise yeah it's like fucked he's so good so confident he's just he's like the fucking Yoda you know of comedies it's incredible he's as good as anybody that's ever lived yeah yeah fucking yeah and he's got his own style to this laid-back you know so confident dude just calm and silly and it's gonna kill composite I love how he wears his own clothes you know the same like like so this is a Gucci fucking shit right he would have that Gucci sign taken off and it says Dave DC he has his logo on it all he's just to see right is it just let's just see it's just see it's just to see on all his clothes his jeans you notice what does he get those clothes made I think it's his own line I'm not sure but I don't obviously I'm a weird fashion dude shirts shirts all the time like we designed a shit like he like his Jean Jack we'll just have his logo on it his chain will be his logo really shirt will be his low smartest fuck he's like why am I gonna wear other people's shit well it's also like you don't want to get caught up in that designer name trap where people are trying to work Gucci everywhere and all these different you know I'm saying like people get caught up in that where they have to show that it's fucking stupid yeah Giavanna goat no Dolce now okay what is good Gucci is Gucci Louis Vuitton in probably six months with Virgil's release he's the head creator now they're gonna take all that fuck did you just say no Jamie understand do you understand Jamie he's on black Twitter Gucci what what it what else is the shit Gucci off White's huge right now Prada still good probably good well it's like certain watches that guys try to wear Rolex is always killing it oh this is never gonna go and it never goes anywhere you gonna iced up Rolex and you're a rapper you're a winner yeah yeah right Zoe's but Daytona's class if you like but if you're like a floyd mayweather you got a ticket to a two level meet on controller louis vuitton oh he wears a Louboutin all yours Gucci all the time Gucci's key like hot in the streets across over how do you know this because their style it's just you see in the magazines it's like it's just like honey it's out there I don't know it's just you have your finger in the pulse forward yeah where's the what magazine do have to repulse is like what magazine the pulse will start with like what's the website yeah this is this is him with this is millions of dollars with the watches play this because it's so preposterous start from the beginning in place he's so ridiculous he's got like 30 watches with him but he do it from the beginning what's that I can't start over okay look at this do you know the kind of security he has to have this but you know what you know what was crazy these days 31 10 more days I take 10 more watches Jesus Christ it is but then I say fuck it if I want to bring out the one and only you're not bringing out the Washington cost 18 million Oh that's so preposterous eighteen million dollars under risk that's insane let's press play Jamie really fuck you do for your mother fucking hates today don't fuck off fifty thousand dollars I got shit else to do you motherfuckers money mate oh I motherfucking gay that's the end that's right man retake yes he's a ninety million dollar watch 50 cent or is that an act it's a good question that's the real thing I think they're really mad at each other yeah I don't think 50 cent in a lot of people get in little scraps yeah yeah uh-huh Floyd gets them scraps well you know I mean when you act like that that's his nature but the problems like Adrien Broner tries doing the same thing but he doesn't win so it's tough you know his his Club is I think his slogans about billions Adrien Broner a be about billions yeah yeah tough sell well if he was lighting everybody up on fire sorry well Jamie's mix it in shit a DJ Jamie James a black

like he's got a bunch of parties he's doing he's oh he's on power right he's on him an hour those are shows a launch party so he's got a branded the Figge owns that Club yeah I think he's doing parties I don't think he's necessarily like rapping there no he's not doesn't rap anymore right does he ran out he's an actor right he's on power and then he made a shitload of money off vitamin water they say yeah although that might be a rumor cuz they said he's bullshit I think he might be investor in Bellator yeah he's a co like what is he doing with involved in it they it's almost like he's doing that same shit that uh was the girl Carmen Electra did you know a like a celebrity remember when she was uh connected to the UFC Carmen Electra was yeah you remember Oh spider interviewers oh no

look at that picture crazy that was current culture so Carmen Electra was like you know she's a hot celebrity content honest and she would do these interviews and she would talk about the UFC yeah
