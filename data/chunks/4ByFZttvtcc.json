hello freak bitches so you now have taken some time off yeah from fighting because of concussion that's right and tell me about that so yeah it was actually I think you were at my last fight it was I thought Mark de Bont you know rest in peace and member we talked about yeah what happened to mark did they find out what happened to him I don't know a lot of the stuff is coming out is in Dutch in Dutch newspapers and I'm asking all of the Dutch community kind of what's happening and they don't really know you hear different things in rumors but I don't want to listen to rumors right I don't want to hear it from like a concrete source and he went missing and then promised bombings and they basically found his wife yeah so why or who knows but really great scary bro he's amazing an actual and excellent fighter you know and here's another guy but boy you know you look at him he looks like a computer programmer yeah you don't immediately it's it's a it's interesting how looks can be so deceiving a super super high level guy yeah but now that was my last fight and from there was actually a really tough I never really opened up about it to be honest with you and it was a very tough experience you know you got to think I just win the World title I'm going home to Canada which my concussion was pretty bad I shouldn't have even gone on a plane home and next thing you know I'm at home and just the concussions got really bad I had to be you know hospitalized for a few days and I was in a dark room for three weeks then I could not get out of a dark room for three weeks I couldn't walk I guess something with the concussion started causing some neurons and some nervous you know your nerve damage jingyan that could be me some almost yeah so some nerve damage effects I was like in a bed man couldn't even look out I had a little red light on my phone charged it was too much reality that it was bad then red light on the phone charger would hurt your head I couldn't even look at a thing so it was at that point it was like man it's like I just win this world title it was a really tough time and this is actually the first time I've really opened up about it but it was a tough experience and being in that you know down state where you're basically in a dark room for three weeks doctors were just you know handing me over shit-ton of percocets and oxycontin eel with the pain and it was a tough time man and it really I think what was the hardest was what was happening mentally I'm sitting there being like man I just want a world sir I want to get back in there I want to you know do so much in this sport and my goal is to be a legend in this sport and but you know and then it got to the point I saw my family and how much it was affecting my family and that's when I decided that you know what let's put this unrest for a little bit so you win the fight and after the fight is over was it immediately that you knew something was wrong it honestly I had some adrenaline rush and I did the post-fight press conference everything was fine I just when I got back to the hotel room and I was throwing up and couldn't leave my room and I was surprised that even got on an airplane home the doctors in Canada hg on an airplane home that those scary times then and it took a lot of good mental strength to get out of it and now I'm actually in a in a position where I'm super happy and I'm loving it I got that whole color commentary roll of glory which is incredible but you know the I think the problem was that saturated fat was demonized well was demonized in a very corrupt way which is the recent New York Times article that was released which is a mind-blower which detailed how the sugar industry had bribed scientists to release data blaming saturated fat for heart disease and obesity and all these issues when it was in fact sugar that was causing all that so they were literally rigging the system and paying scientists and it was a horrible article because that propaganda and these lies that they spread I believe it was in the 50s here it is how the sugar industry shifted the blame to fat and it's if you get a chance and you want to feel sick at what can be done with money watch or read that because it's just it's awful it is really awful and it was an internal sugar industry document that was discovered by a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco it was published it said Monday when this was out I believe it was a couple of months ago but it was amazing it suggested that five decades of research into the role of nutrition heart disease including many of today's dietary recommendations may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry and propaganda and money they spent money to literally bribe scientists to release false data horrible it's really nasty but I mean the thing is not got much money either here's a go back to it here they paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of $50,000 in today's dollars to publish a 1967 review of research on sugar fat and heart disease the studies used in the review were hand-picked by the sugar group in the article which is published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine minimized the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspirations on the role of saturated fat even though the influence-peddling revealment documents dates back to nearly 50 years more recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science you know I'm obviously a big easy target for a guy who works the door here he's going to destroy me you know it's like of course how the mighty will fall but I still think it would be fun anyway what does it feel like knowing that you roasted the President of the United States you roasted Trump is it is totally and totally a weird feeling and I saw him a couple weeks ago I saw him down in Florida and exchanged pleasantries and when you were just talking about that on stage I saw him in Palm Beach at a golf course what are you doing in his Golf Course having lunch what we always say in your life Jeff Ross's life is like nobody else's I follow him on fucking the Instagram like every night he's in a different city with a different set of cool people well when you're a successful man you don't have children Yeah right not married you do whatever the fuck you want Jesus what a life yeah you you really do have a good life in that regard you're free as a bird it is cool I'm fucking you managed to not get tied down I'm ready to get tied down I ready I wish I did they say that the waiters media could who could do that they say that when they're around us yeah I know that's not true I would like to settle down really yeah I haven't met the right person well how come you haven't met the right person I'm in a new city every night you fuck nicely travel maybe yeah maybe I'm in the wrong way do you think you can close a couple times do you think you'll have a little Jeff from die really hope so yeah we hold in a lonesome 50 a jelly one and it's all my cuz you come as bad I really think so Tim potatoes probably better so I know friend yeah don't freak me I already told me that the Bruce Lee video wasn't he saw the Bruce Lee video Bruce Lee playing ping pong with nunchucks he thought that was really did are you serious they're round don't check the round and glue fuck exactly thank you time it Kate up that high like the ping-pong you it's not like a paddle that's like a rigid thing where you can kind of hit it get the time to swing it a thing I thought he was a badass but was definitely about us no doubt about [Music]
