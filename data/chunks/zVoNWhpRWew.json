hello freak bitches it is interesting how the fat patterns to shrink up yeah there's three major fat distributions right you got your depo fat that's like the love handles or with women sometimes it's the saddlebags and the side of the thigh sometimes you see women in the upper back or the tricep area with guys that's usually the belly yeah or the belly or they love handles for most guys you know then you have internal fat that's the dangerous stuff they enter abdominal fat that gut fat that's what that's what can kill you then you have subcutaneous fat it's like the smooth fat underneath the skin like like an insulation layer and then of course they've identified that brown fat also it's like a active fat it produces heat in the body it's like part of the survival mechanism back when our ancestors had to tolerate a lot of extremes and temperatures like cold you have this brown fat that's like it a metabolic active fat and it's it's kids have it but by the time you're like 12 it almost disappears because you know we have this regulated temperatures all the time people don't expose themselves to cold they're always bundling up and the homes are overheated but what a lot of people are saying now you can actually get that metabolically active fat the brown fat cells go on which helps keep you lean and helps burn the other yellow fat so cold showers cold water treatments exposing yourself to cold really good thing for develop that and the brown fat and builds your immune system and you you have a much better tolerance to cold and much less likely to get innervated in cold weather so you don't have a tendency to come down with colds or flu and stuff really brown fat yeah about that I've never heard that before and what is it created by like what it's in your it's some of it's in the peritoneal cavity some of its up in the neck area and it's just something that nature provided to help temperature regulation help me tolerate cold so is that like more common with Inuits and folks who live and oh yeah for sure they have well develop around fat it's but you and I could do it too we just expose herself a little bit more to the cold he's a narcissism thing this
