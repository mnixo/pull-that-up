the gyro can experience a lot of times man and people don't think about that way because you think the morning is like when you have to go to work it's right on the box it's probably wait who is here less oh it's probably Duncan's did you imagine if you do you want a podcast with someone you watch them trim them over somewhere in this area is scanning the rest of the table now try to find that one who smokes joints with random strangers fuckin weird fecal herpes you're passing around Tonio and my friends bong once Andy hit it posing as a friend you're a terrible person it burnt and smelled like hair once you go to met you call going to Mexico yep see you when I get home and that's part of it too right part of it too is like the disconnect unplug unplugging and then you know recharging your brain and being out there and that desolate surroundings going 140 miles an hour over bumps what gives there's another side of the two that gives you appreciation that you know I have I have a kid now but I know my brother says it too you see you down there you also see the people how they live there are kids amazing kids and they live in chicken coops right the blue chicken coop down by a host they live in chicken coops and I'm not kidding I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop that's what it is and there's kids and I actually called this is my own little story but I there's there's a there's a the kids that never grow up always come out of ojos so there's a little road after you turn down the blue date the blue gate on the right hand side there's a chicken coop and it looks like every year for ten years the same kids come out they never get older they don't have shoes they're smiling we hand them stickers I stopped him give him I give him candy I talked to him the heat signs autograph you take pictures you go back the next year they look the same age yeah and they and they live job telling you chicken coop I can draw it for you right it's it's a fucking chicken coop it looks like it's it's a chicken coop but it's not funny but you appreciate you come back and sometimes you look at your kids and other people kids like you have no idea how easy yeah and then sometimes those kids and chickens will go to the dump and that's where they they find metal and they find scrap and they take the lumen of cans and they get their money and they're happy to they're happy they don't they're not negative they're not pissed off I think part of the reason I was lucky is I tried to put myself in a position to get lucky which is by playing more and believe it or not it's van Halen that influenced that on me they were playing more than everybody they played three blocks from my house in a backyard now money I paid one dollar to get in you know the singer Oh Roth was blowing a tube inside of this guy's drums and oh man these guys are you know I was I thought they were great and everything they were playing cover songs and I played a couple originals I think but what I was more impressed by at least at that time was how often they played they played every single night and I go we got to do that if we're gonna have any chance you know because my thinking was if we play more than everybody might have to play free a lot but if our name you know we might be able to brainwash people and thinking they're supposed to like us you know so and that's what happened though it was that persistence it was that playing free getting our name out we just happened to be at the whiskey one night playing during the week not even a big night or anything and and the right guy was in the crowd that light and he came up gave us his card and before you know we're recording were we got air plague we don't even have a record deal I mean we our record deal was literally borrowing 15 grand from some guy named Fred hey Fred you got 15 grand yeah okay sir but we had a distribution deal so but this manager we had called Ellen Niven he was from England used to work for Virgin Records he had signed Berlin he signed motley crew and a year before this and then they would sell these bands off to big labels well he got us on cammy t when we had no deal and no local bands were on K mu T and kala West with no deal it was just unheard of and but that I don't know what kind of connection he had so it was just a matter of you being persistent playing all the time and this guy saw that's such an important lesson for for young people who are thinking about doing something sure opportunity presents itself when you just fucking Buster and dream it and dream it so this is one of the things especially talking to college students that I love bringing up which is that and I'm the first to admit it like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing 99% of the time Evie especially when I got started I still don't know and I've come to realize like and I've got I've got been lucky enough to meet some pretty like successful impressive people but like you think under the surface we're all just hacking it like we're all just for your expertise experience those things I'll help but like every one of us is a fallible human all the conventions and rules and status quo we know were created by other fallible humans yeah and there's no reason not to look at that and go huh does it have to be that way or why is it that way and if the reason why is well that's the way it is well that's a terrible reason you know and and when you see the world as being that hackable so to speak like you start to realize all right well let's just let's actually question stuff and and for you know I remember I was a freshman at UVA when 9/11 happened for this generation of Millennials coming up we we moat nearly all of us at one of our first really vivid memories of the world was 9/11 this awful tragedy and then we get into these two wars and then think of all the authority figures we've had in our life since that moment they've all at one point uh they're either mislead us this sort of deceived us you've got the financial crisis you've got the housing bubble all these conventions Oh trust us we know we're doing this is the thing the American Dream is buying a home go to college take on that student loan debt don't worry there's a job waiting for you every single all these conventions from from all these people in power have not held up and so I think in particular Milano Millennials look at that very skeptically because we're like alright you know it so the conventional stuff didn't work out for anything like we have no choice but to realize you know what we're all just hacking it so let's let's really let's dive into the passion let's let's figure out a better way to do something not settle for it's the way to always been
