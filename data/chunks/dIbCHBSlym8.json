stage Joey goes into the back area there's like this backstage area that's like us in the OL are there was a small room it only seats about a buck fifty but it doesn't have a stage with a little backstage area so Joey goes into the backstage area he goes to the backstage area it takes off all of his clothes and he waits and so she's doing her act and when she gets to her punchlines she hits the punch line and Joey opens the curtains and shakes his dick and that closes the Muppet and the people go crazy and you see the spark in her I like working like I'm finally doing it you could see a relaxed and every time she had a punchline Joey would pop up with that curtain and the people were fucking just stomping their feet laughing slapping their tables she had so much confidence the next time remember the lasted the next time we saw her on stage and the same jokes just just didn't didn't work the same this is just she had the magic but she had for one night but the weird thing is remember when Alison was on and we had talked about being a open mic comic and how a lot of these guys are doing these tricks and one of the things that Alison was talking about is how this guy wanted
