hello freak bitches because I think the ability to communicate an open debate is why we've advanced to the point we're at in the first place the suppressing of that is almost always someone who has a bad idea that they're trying to shelter so when you see people that are chasing after someone because they're trying to communicate about something like you who's doing it super respectfully but when you see that what you have is a bunch of people that are trying to defend a bad idea and defend it with a crash exactly right and and but if the more you kind of become a mirror image of whatever whatever they're projecting you reinforce them in their position as well and us from doing other stories about extreme religious beliefs like the Westboro Baptist Church I know from people who I met who were in the church when I made my documentary and then subsequently left that what short-circuits their beliefs what allows them to see something bigger than what they're in is when you treat them with kindness you know and and instead of shouting back at them or hurling abuse back which just reinforces their view of viewers an enemy of God or suppressive or however they characterize it if you actually behave decently an attempt to robustly present your position but in a respectful way and with a kind of succumbing from a place of caring and empathy as opposed to soar since aureus or hostile attitude that actually can be much more effective absolutely you know as well as being humane I saw this pregnant woman on the L train in New York but she was one she's one of those what she didn't she just looked like her stomach was bigger it nothing else effect like perfect makeup just dressed nicely in a nice dress she'd have a wedding ring on I wanted to I just wanted to ask her if everything was okay if she was with a dude like she was so beautiful I kept looking at her I know she felt me looking at it I probably weird her out she was so beautiful I started picturing myself arguing with the real father five years from now I started picturing myself on the train I started pitching myself five years from now at yelling at this dude outside the house in Jersey hey dude you had your chance yeah you like your counties you just a sperm donor you're looking at her beautiful I'm a real doc I'm the real dad you're calculating the potential for future joy being with that person with perfect bone structure you want me to take a chance and put your whole life in oil how was this Darrin just like oh my God look at it was you okay Hey Baby you okay that's what I was saying okay we'd say I'm her here go ahead if I'm looking down I'm just shaking my head I'm just like every now now I just go like this my hands she's only three come on the Train hey see this is the thing yes I wouldn't uh even if you on the train on a train if I don't have anything organic like I was I something crazy happened no dude I'm not asking for real life this isn't law and order I know this is like all right okay I'm the girl ready girl sorry I just accidentally put my face in your pussy Oh whose baby is that in there I'm financially stable not quite emotionally but I'm getting there yep I've got family members again this is not my family of my wife or kids but the family that was born into that have never apologized about anything because they come from a cultural landscape where to apologize to your child to somebody younger it's to lose face a parent is always right and I mean that might work when you're two but when you're both now adults I think you sort of have to get out of that and realize that we all make mistakes and we all have to own up to them we all have to apologize honestly when we make a mistake and yet some people it's super unhealthy and it's healthy for the person who doesn't admit they make the mistake too because then it puts you in this position of being in denial of what you know to be the truth right you're gonna run around pretending that you were right all along when you know in your head that you were wrong so it diminishes your own personal opinions about yourself right I must say you're not ready on this exact point okay so I'm having a chat with a family member an older family member of my for my family this is the problem person this is this is one of the key problem for people with my family and we he said something to the effect of oh you know those ancient Greeks those Christians were really anti-semitic or I came up with the exact details I said oh well you know I'm sorry I don't mean to correct you but those ancient Greeks were not Christian as a matter of fact the way we mark that era as we say BCE before Common Era or BC before Christ so by definition those guys were marked as not being Christian so when he's now faced with sort of historical evidence that suggests that he was wrong what do you think he does it's it's so grotesque that I'm not even sure you can guess what he did I don't want to guess so he basically says no that's right that's what I said I said that they weren't Christian and you said that they were Christian so he looks at you in the face that's that's called if you don't wanna be saying on air that's mind-fucking right yeah he looks at you in the face he knows that you know but he has enough in Arabic you say what huh it's that it's this kind of pathological pride right mungyu right I'm gonna look at you right so rather than saying oh gee I didn't know that thanks for correcting me he flips what our original points of disagreements was okay you can't talk to that dude you gotta cut that guy loose well maybe I have oh maybe you have like I said that long story short listeners Joe was kind enough to I was interviewing Sam Harris for my podcast and Sam was like we really should just do more than just a one-on-one because ordinarily in my podcast is a but as a panel of people a bunch of people sitting around talking about the news and so I texted Joe and I was like his only chance of doing it your studio and being the gentleman that he is he was like sure just come on by and we'll just tape it even though he had two shows yesterday so after those late at night Sam Harris comes over and Hannibal Buress is still here I was about to call an uber yeah I said once you stick around yeah we were drunk that's the way we drink so much whiskey the best decision you ever made inviting him to stay so Hannibal Buress and Sam Harris and Joe Rogan and I have an interesting episode of my podcast which will come up so in if you're listening to this now or watching this now subscribe to where the people live just search for We the People space live you need the live and then when it drops you will you will see it it was an aiding epic hour-long argument between Hannibal Burres a drunk Hannibal Buress and Sam Harris regarding statistics we'll just leave it that yeah you don't give them more statistics that may or may not involve black lives matter yeah until you shooting x' and just the reality of police violence versus that perceived reality of police violence so arguing about the statistics rather than the emotional that's right connection and the difference and I mean what was interesting is how we have conversations about things that are so touchy right I mean part of the reason why I wanted to talk to to Sam and you on my podcast is because I think it's important for us to find ways to have the sorts of conversations that you have and that Sam has and hopefully I have where it there's not a lot of kind of opinionated bloviating it's more about actually trying to understand each other right actually trying to take each other at face value not sticking you know what a sword in the sand and saying like I can't believe that you offended me or you know having tripwires that if someone transgresses that or says a certain thing then all of a sudden you're gonna get cranked up the outrage machine so much of that so much of that so I wanted to talk to Sam and you about well how do we have conversations that are they're more reasonable but of course you don't necessarily have a conversation is that reasonable when you're drunk an emotionally sensitive a drunk Hannibal Burres that says that he's smarter than Sam Harris and smarter than I think anyone didn't he say anyone he definitely was smarter than Sam Harris I mean Hannibal is a smart guy he must be successful and he's he's compelling and good comic just not smart enough to know that he shouldn't say Sam it was drug but what's a really drunk and we kept drinking - you hit it well you hug you like the will bounce back quick I'm healthy yeah so I stopped drinking also what do you say head up a little healthy so we're gonna play exact what I said you heard me and about an hour before the end of our Potti of me and Hannibal I realized I was drunk so I backed off right an agent that knowing he was referring himself huh not like half a half a wine glass of whiskey yep yep yeah it was deep we went deep so he can't be held responsible folks
