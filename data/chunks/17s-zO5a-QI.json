people you can still be innocent and fingers just me and my mom at the house yeah yeah I was okay I was okay I wasn't crazy then why grew up in Jersey the PIL was too geared more towards boxing when I was in New York City it was a it was a place that they had like a box in they had a pool table they had you know solders and shit like that activities you made like ceramics and shit depending on your age and Jersey it was more mr. gammy Oh mr. gammy Oh was a Cuban dude and he ran the boxing program and I just noticed two sons Julio and Caesar they got me a job at putting in a few and they were like listen when you get the job you gotta Rob putting the fuel is right by Secaucus all four root three it's dirty truck people go in there I lasted about three weeks before they fired me but I left there and after three weeks to the guy at night was a half a mo mo his name was Freddy my mama song is so we robbed the one that we go listen we're just gonna be Freddy we're like sophomores in high school we'll put masks on me and DD Quintero and when he comes out because in Jersey you pay the gas guy you go into a store you know they pump your gas so if you rob the guy you basically robbed the joint do you follow me only or again in New Jersey is where people pump your gas everybody else you walk in with a card so we were kids were like let's rob fucked up Freddy you know when I worked it I got to know Freddy Freddy's wife looked like honey Boo Boo's mother Freddy was a little guy but honey booty his wife was like 400 pounds and the only way she would let him fuck her as if he brought blow home he was a skinny tiny guy like Eddie Bravo she was like 390 and she would actually put the bikini on and they they were such white trash they lived in a studio apartment they would rent the jacuzzi and put in the living room and they have black Marlo she was the only black girl in the neighborhood black Marlo I don't know what black Marlo is today but she's the real Martin Luther King she was the only black girl in a white neighborhood in Jersey that girl took torture she got tortured I always loved black Marlo Marlo was tight with me my mother was white something happened houses fucked up that building was fucked up so I used to go with her selling blow and I'm in the Freddie opening up the door and they were like a robot and he has his fat wife and women with heels with a bikini on and he's like thank you for bringing it to me I'm nice like he really was like when you brought him the blow he was fucking thankful that you fucking like thank you man tonight like she would not give me my hand job if either had blow so finally finally one day me and Dee Dee Quintero we decide let's go down and rob this motherfucker on a Saturday night let's wait till about midnight when he's got a grand on him because you don't drop do you get 2000 so every mm you make a drop in the floor safe and you can't get back in there so me and Dee Dee went behind the building by C Clark and it was right next to this hot dog place that bean appease the rumor was that's where the Ice Man killed somebody and put him in the tank by snapping a piece now this is a real fuckin area Jersey this is heaven across the street was one of the biggest strip clubs in the East Coast not when I was there robbing Freddie a couple years after that like the army base so you remember if you lived in New York they call this in the Air Force Base so bass is some shit but when we were kids we went there like at 12 when we took Freddie down dog we just tacked with him estar like kicking them like they kicked the whatever his name is in that De Niro movie in the bar we took his little personally ran away and he guessed it like it took him a week he's like you guys robbed me last night because we had mats climbing shit like Freddy it wasn't us he saying yes it was I heard your voices then he came back to us he's like listen I let you rob me once a month but you got to split the money when we said goodbye an Eightball to fuck my wife so once a month we go diving you've steady Freddie ups and we did it like eight times given black eyes bloody noses some of the stomach a couple times that we need them Leon belly I didn't know what it was no video back then either no no leave marks on him yeah you have like take them a few tried too much of a heart so I always hire like I had to bring like one of my crazy friends every kid in Miami today that every time I place South Florida he shows up with his girlfriend and he gets fucked up he tells the story when I knocked on his door with a diagram on how we were gonna rob Freddie and he goes that's when I knew that you were fucking for real he goes I was eating with my family you knocked on the door and had a sketch like the deal how you were gonna kick him and run into the weeds and go right to the coke dealer sounds like I had a plan we had done it so many times but I had to keep getting different partners because I couldn't hit Freddie all I could do was tackle him I was good at tackling and then we want to go down I have my friend kick him a few times it's fucking horrible but when you're 16 jail what the fuck you gotta have a good time you know bro we would rob them once every six weeks and finally it ended I didn't bring them the 8-ball what I just did as a boy people take the time knowledge that shit but we are in the ocean well it's you know but also know shut up right no people on both ends like you're choosing to get upset about some really ridiculous there's a reader tweeting you go that person's paid he go I get it person once I read somebody's tweet and I go to their main page I get to put I can add a bright in one minute I get it I get where he was coming from I understand why he said that he's a musician he's dad he's a politician he sells this he writes like to display somebody hit me and I ran he's a Paul Reiser fan I get it you're a fucking Mook you don't saying I never met a Paul Reiser fan just of your Paul Reiser fan I'll shoot yourself in the fucking mouth right now wondering what somebody's I guess if I go to somebody's page music and I know the music sucks that's where it ends

drugs is when my whole body was in pain and it's not pain that you feel it's just this pain and it's well it's also you did it for so long when your body became accustomed to using beginnings but in the beginning why is the main reason we get down why is the main reason a guy like you handles you have pain in your life we all do what made you different than not doing it you know when you uh when you first get involved in that your body hurts man hmm I can't imagine when I was 17 I go home at the end of the night wait how was in school I don't go to school at 7:30 sophomore high school junior had to go to school and I'll come home and sit in the corner in the dark with earphones on with an eight-track Chris no drinking just do coke in the dark what possesses you to do that Joe Rogan Oh was

totally can I kidnapped you know I call him a lot now well I'm guilty I'm really fuckin guilty of that because I saw something when I kidnapped him that it's not Joe Diaz I saw him suffering I saw him at one moment on the floor handcuffed and I would never want that for me you know I'm saying like I always dread that that happens to a friend of mine for what I did and I always felt bad I had him call on the podcast and I apologize to him and I always call him up I call him the ID and we're talking he told me you know every time I talk to him he tells me more about his life bro you know what happened since I kidnapped him I bumped into him a 94 I kidnapped him in 87 I bumped into a 94 and I bought coke from him he was all fucked up at Sarah I'm pearl Street down in Boulder and then he never remembered I think he blacked out that's how bad a shape he was and I asked him the last but not this time though at the time before I asked him to human me buy and blow from you he goes I remember seeing and I remember hating you the next day but Levi didn't knock you the fuck out because I caught him off guard he was at a bar oh fuck that was it the guy who kidnapped me the guy who

liquid cocaine he jumped out the window okay on the other side of you steal a bottle of liquid cocaine from the hospital you already got probably oh my god kidnapping him you know we laugh when we giggle meet kidnapping them it makes me feel like maybe I contribute to that but I didn't he had his own doom why didn't I get fucked up you know I mean I got fucked up in different ways I paid in
