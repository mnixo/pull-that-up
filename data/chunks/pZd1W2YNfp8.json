school years yeah that's almost like 15 that's crazy yeah you need to scan all this shit yeah you are a hundred times better than I I was and I did it all the time this is like this is like from when I was a kid it is a super cat huh oh shit like some shit that I drew I used to draw a lot of loosely I used to that's what I really used to want to be is an artist for kamekona so yeah 1982 so I guess I was 15 1982 yeah I was eight years old I love how all your shits monsters because they're scared of monsters man that's why I was so bummed out that Benicio del Toro movie fucking sucks because it did fucking like it didn't happen is that waterfalls this might been some that project that I had to do for school I got like in trouble all the time because when I also drew the logo for our our school like t-shirts for a Newton saw the headline so I drew the line I used to do that too worth the Worthington Kilbourne official bungee jumping shirt wasn't cardinal bungee jumping yeah that's from a picture from there's an old I think it was long Chaney jr. or no which one which we're moving it was Oliver get it look in color you got any color be but before our Humpty Dumpty Humpty Dumpty the ax murderer I drew a lot of yeah I'll do something with it that's amazing I was fucking obsessed with werewolves for whatever fucking gay reason that's hilarious I just always though wasn't like your father I think I was an angry Kid and I was always obsessed with the idea that you could I think represented to me was like you know that you you could be calm and normal and then some shit happens and just you know maybe that's what I wanted to do I wanted to fucking Hulk out on people and turn it to a werewolf motherfuckers I don't know when you're an angry Kid it's never good but I totally wanted to be a comic book artist but my high school art teacher was a douchebag he was just suppressive and annoying and unhappy and had no joy there was no happiness this man everything was serious like his art was serious and you know he would draw on I didn't think he was that talented who's like he would draw like boring shit you know he would like draw like pears and stuff you know a bowl of fruit bowl it's always a faggot you know I got a camera if I want to see fruit right I'll take that let me see it you got a photo of Wolverine fighting spider-man you know shut the fuck up cuz that's what I like yeah and he was telling me that what I like was like juvenile and then it was like foolish and I'm like my cut and I was like you're just suppressing what I like you know I like watching you know fucking monster movies I like reading comic books is there something wrong with that it's just entertainment I hate when people pretend that their entertainment somehow or another is like more valid or more sophisticated just because it's like serious you know like people who love serious movies like I don't like you know comic seriously whatever man are you learning something when you go to see like like you know some depressing Sean Penn movie are you learning something when you go to see those Mary Nikki at my emotions joke it was that River movie whatever the fuck river runs through it no the the Sean Penn one bomb is the great very Mystic River that whatever but it was like you know whatever is like it's such an important film like what what film is important yeah okay they're fucking movies man you go to a movie enjoy yourself you have a good time it takes you someplace gives you some thrills you know you use a lot of shit you don't know what's happening things get resolved house it's gonna what's gonna go down it and the idea that your entertainment because it represents like things that happen in real life is somehow another superior to like superheroes or monsters like please just stop it I had to get our teacher that guy it's funny because I get C's Indies in every class cuz I would sleep except for art which I straight a-pluses took every class but my teacher was cool in like a lot of my paintings I look back and I'm like wow she let me do this that one was called pool table on acid and she gave me an a-minus and it was just a pool table with a monster coming out of it and everything was melting I didn't have to draw birch and it made me do i my teacher used to say shit to me like you know and well you know what if you get a job where you have to draw a baby for a diaper commercial I want to see you draw a baby for a diaper commercial I'm like dude draw a baby for a diaper commercial like is that my future right what I have to look forward to yeah drawing diaper ads like he was like really like my dream was to do comic book illustrations and he was telling me basically you need to have skills because you're not gonna reach those dreams and what if you have a job that's just you as an illustrator doing boring stuff well you have to drop boring stuff I was like you fucking buzzkill you know and this guy was just a dumpy physically out of shape unhealthy person and he was just just depressed all the time and so I killed my effectively I went I only went for two years to our class I believe it was 14 and 15 I think by the time I went into my junior year of high school I think I said fuck that guy I'm tired of this yes annoying so I just drew on my own from then on and that effectively killed my my wanting to go to school for art I had like was looking at our colleges and shit and had you know scholarships lined up and trying to figure out where he goes that's the only thing I had a chance of getting any sort of a scholarship in yeah you know you don't realize what a gigantic fucking effect having a good or a shitty teacher can have yeah but they're you know they're cutting their salaries over and over again I just saw their cutting it again yeah and I think it's teachers to be one of the most important things ever you know like up there with doctors yeah that's gigantic yeah it's it's amazing how we were so shorted when it comes short sighted when it comes to that yeah what is that you're raising the child from the beginning that should be the most important thing it should be huge people that can influence your children and people that say mean shit like I will never forget I had a math teacher in high school it was just fucking boring and the class was boring and she was this black lady who had a black accent like she would mispronounce words all the time say terrible grammar and yet she would like shit all over you if you didn't understand her her math problems and she was in there doing her math problem and I was bored and I was like drawing or something usually that's what I did in class or draw or my notebooks something yeah and she goes she looks up and she sees me not paying attention so she goes mr. Rogan would you to come up here and do both of these problems for the class and I said do you want me to do both of those problems and everybody started fucking and so she said go down to the dean's office right now I said okay but when I get back I'm gonna do both of those problems and everybody was laughing she goes go ahead laughing mr. Rogan mr. Rogan ain't going nowhere he's going nowhere live and I'm like at least I know how to say both that was like the beginning of my time as a stand-up comedian because I felt like I was defending myself I would do anything to you I'll just sit there scribbling in my notebook you know I just wasn't paying attention because I was bored out of my fucking hat and I had problems with authority but she just you know like to be the the lady to call on you if you ain't paying attention you know I see what she would get mad but I mean meanwhile this fucking bitch couldn't even speak right she said both would you like to come up here and be do both funny I will never forget it's like in my mind it's like a movie playing out because the anger in my head that this fucking dummy was trying to make me look dumb in front of everybody just because I was scribbling and I wasn't paying attention here my opinion on math was always like okay math is very essential but don't you have calculators now we do and it's never gonna end with supply batteries there is done like I'm done there's only a finite amount of things to pay attention to in the day and I don't give a fuck about these wacky equations that you're making me solve and figure out I know how to add I know how to divide I know how to multiply like is it or we got done here don't have to keep going is this really gonna it you're you're making me be a fucking square peg and fit into your fucking round hole you know it's like I'm not I don't want to do what you want me to do but this is nonsense it's weird nowadays I can't even imagine going to school with Google cuz I'd be like no I don't want to learn it I could just search it if I need it I don't get what you that was a problem I used to watch a lot of documentaries even when I was a kid and I got in trouble again like people were say like your comedian were you a class clown like I was not really class clown what I used to do though is draw a lot of cartoons about our teachers of getting involved in shit and there was one teacher that was really annoying mr. Holman and hol maa very serious but he was wrong about a lot of shit and I was you know I was fucking 15 years old and I was in class and I was again bored out of my fucking mind here is science class but at least science class is a little more interesting he started going on about Lake Erie Lake Jerry's a dead Lake and this and that I started talking about all the pollution that's involved in Lake Erie and I said well actually I just saw a documentary that was on PBS it was talking about the resurgence of Lake Erie about how Lake year they weren't very hard to filter out the water and they've done all these different things to cut down the pollutants and they've seen a resurgence and in the fish population and he fucking mad at me and I was like have you seen this documentary goes no this is not true and I'm like my true it's on PBS I watched it last night right I'm like oh man alright so you're just like them so the next time we're in class he had like these things that would pull down like projections drains and I pulled the projection screens up and I drew cartoons of him so he went to draw on the chalkboard and as he pulled the chalkboard up there's all these fucking cartoons of him like saying wacky shit and you had this thing that he would do like he would do this this crazy thing with his hands we would move his hands like this then I had this other teacher mr. white and he was only like 5 foot 2 so I drew him all the time but every time I drew him I drew him standing on something he was a boxer Stanley got a chair a stool and I drew it just like him and I had a one and anthropology teacher who was obsessed with Jane Goodall and the monkeys you know Jane Goodall the chimpanzees so I drew this one kid was this football player who's a nice table he was always kissing her ass because he wanted her to like him so you get better grades so I drew him banging her and like I can look like her it looked like him and I drew him bangin her say you know she was like oh give it to me monkey style and passed it around the class no like I got suspended on two separate occasions for drawing cartoons that's I got sent home that's the only thing they get in trouble for them I would do the same things but with overhead projectors I was like that's all I did some penises there was an Indian guy in our class I always make fun of his farts because he had really bad farts and then one time they poured the whole class out and they're like all right Omar has really bad gas because of his diet and it's not funny and if you guys make fun of it anymore you guys are all gonna be in trouble and I remember this speech so of course then I only drew Omar for the rest of the year after all this like Indian back part and now people and stuff like that how ridiculous is that you telling kids not to make fun of farts cuz it's not a fact I know how disingenuous is that you cannot tell someone that farts aren't funny as soon as you say fart I'm funny I'm not listening to you right now cuz you're not being honest yeah you could say farts don't smell ya can you imagine if he loves to non farts there's people to do that's life fart porn have you ever seen there's fart porn where dudes get their head right and gross faces and gross fart in their mouths
