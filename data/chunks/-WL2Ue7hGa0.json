Kelly loves fly-fishing right isn't he a big fly Fisher yeah yeah yeah maybe he liked to do it shit that his body shouldn't allow him to do hmm yeah it's great when he was skinny that's nuts I see that video that picture of him the head shot the calm reseller I'm like that's that guy dude he was like my size who's like a normal sized person it's not to me it is nuts yeah when I met him we were working together yeah and he lived in a home with special-needs kids and he was I take care of him I was he was like a counselor or some some sort of a teacher something with special-needs kids and he was totally normal-sized Wow like you would see him like let me compare him somebody he's a fat fuck now I haven't seen him in a long time I mean I let me just trash him for a minute about his big overweight I'm sad because I really liked that guy he's a sweetheart yeah well enjoy him while you can oh he's a kid too right yeah he's a kid great yeah well why is he allowing himself to eat himself to death okay well I think a little bit in the attics mind you don't really have it you're not really an addict you got it's like the replacement things real yeah replace one with the other what was his attic before I think coke and and and booze yeah that's a thing man that's a real thing and so now it every time he tries to get in shape he that does a month and then like it just falls off a day and then just keeps falling off mmm he's fatter than ever now yeah I saw a photo from that cruise that Burt went on with him Oh God yeah they couldn't let him go anywhere but the middle of the boat otherwise who would liked it that's crazy sharks and shit we like Bobby we have a chance to eat all those well you can't be on a boat with those fucking buffets two men those buffets are brutal I gained 12 pounds on a week on the joker's cruise last year I believe it oh yeah buffets are rough man we in last time I was in Vegas I ate that at the buffet and they're great just ate crepes all kinds of shit I never eat I'll go for thirds sure small a small portion fried chicken and waffles and it's like your friends go your friends go you want to eat them like now I'd say like four hours ago like what come sit with us like okay I can saw some fries I'm gonna get us some cupcakes how rich you get it's free just take whatever yeah you have to open your wallet it's such an easy process right there I could just grab it do the best as these fucking Filipino and like these immigrant type like employees that are clean are you guys done with us like oh yeah I'm done they're like this could feed my whole village what you're throwing away yeah it's like they keep their smile on their face when you find out the real statistics of like how much people make in certain countries you know like I was reading something about how much people look at the average salary of a person who lives in Thailand yeah it's like $1,000 a month did I was I was at a bus from Indonesia to East Timor it's crossing a land border and some guy was talking about how much people make and I told him to wait what I came across of living his way higher he's like that's great I should have a $50 bill he was like lost his mind Wow how many how many ha I forgot how much their currency is how many is this worth and I told him is like what yeah I think I'm wrong - about $1,000 a month $1,000 yeah that's possible it might be like 1/4 of that a lot of them also don't use currency that much they're like yeah we farm we trade with our neighbor mmm milk I mean like we don't need currency did we took these lessons on how to how to grow how to like take rice plant it and like they take you through the whole steps in Thailand they give you the outfits and ever maybe that although the people that farm rice we're but you realize like before industrialized agriculture what a process it was to actually get rice I fuck that it is a giant process yeah it's crazy how much work is involved yeah you see them up to their fucking wasted water yeah yes I saw a dead dog and a rice paddy what's facedown ever like oh that's just they're still serving that rice I'm sure yeah they're not gonna waste that rice yeah do you think they wash it off at all Oh like maybe the villi whatever dog you're gonna put that dog on it anyway yeah Oh Sun cook it's so wrong well the thing about the rice is like I thought that least when you get the rice you just get the rice off the plant and then you could boil it and eat it no no it's like a husk and you gotta beat it down and break it open and then the actual rice is underneath it I'm just finding this out wheat I thought you just pick wheat off a plant smoke it no you gotta cure it and draw accurate what you know what's the worst female weed is what you want right all right but male and female we'd get together and they if the male weed and the female we'd get together it ruins the weed yeah like I don't know it's kind of like real life kind of like I didn't know that that that plants like I don't know jack-shit about horticulture or agriculture but they they breed like there's a male and a female version of these plants was like what like some kind was a grower was trying to explain it to me like how they isolate the female plants like wait a minute what Pete knows a lot about it of course he does but like yeah it's like what are you talking about the roads on my plants you're wrong yeah no their plants they don't have vaginas you fucking idiot hey guys this thing I've never researched kind of way more about this guy who lives like that I looked into it I I was stunned I was like there's a male version a female version of a fucking plant why yeah dude it the more I've researched plants because I had on this guy who's fascinating man you should really if you can get him on your podcast he that's the guy who lost damn its yeah yeah I heard him on NPR oh you should have mine yeah okey guys up okay you would love it especially when he finds out that you invented shroom fast you know he would love you yeah but when he was explaining to me the system through which plants exchange nutrients and information with fungi and that fungi you have fungi actually supply these plants with certain nutrients and they they there's like an information network of these mycelium that's underneath the ground yeah that's how I've heard about this how like what trees will do is communicate with each other once you dine they'll send nutrients the other yes it's fucking bananas oh yeah and it all underneath the ground I mean underneath the ground is this whole almost like information exchanging network of fungi Wow and like this we needs help yeah man they they know when others need more resources they have like a socialist network of allocation of resources it's fucking crazy well and and they communicate with each other when they're being eaten then please help me they know they know that other ones are being eaten and they'll change their flavor profile they're actually they actually make their puller leaves more bitter to avoid predation because like someone's here I'm fucking put up their defenses it's so crazy that you can have the sound of caterpillars chewing leaves you could play it like on a recording next to a plant and that plant will change its flavor profile Wow yeah they become so disgusting that giraffes won't eat them and they'll starve to death because it's gross because I just when they're trying to get kids not to eat their nails I paint them with that stuff that tastes gross yeah stupid kids fucking kids eat their boogers and you're like what the fuck is wrong with you go for boogers God put them in a tissue and you'd be gone with them you don't eat your boogers you savage I know we're on our boogers well I had one of these two areas I have this one actually in my house oh nice I got one of your crazy mushroom shirts which tour was that from do mushrooms tour I think it was two specials ago nonetheless it was that one and then there was the other one with you your tongue open with it with a that's that's the 2012 that's a 2012 story twelve yeah that's the coolest shirt I might now bring those taxes I fucked up and didn't do a shirt this year you bring that back just yeah sell it you should just sell it period it's a cool one I like the idea of going like cuz cuz uh Iron Maiden had that with like a shirt per year yeah you can show it off at the next Iron Man concert but you had to be at that concert otherwise you're fucked that's the one that's my favorite yeah I got that one in the hot black chick on top Ted Park did that that's the I did the Korean zombie shirt oh really yeah damn he's good he is good oh that's a great fucking shirt man yeah and your eyes look efficiently walked out really wise Marc Maron your shirt or the Grateful Dead matches Marc Maron went the other way super drugs oh yeah gave up on sobriety just went all mushrooms he's totally the other way that's a variety going Marc oh good you should ask what the fuck am i doing avoiding all the best parts of life yeah that's that's teaching me this sober October thing is teaching me a lot to my bartender last night I went to O'Neill's wedding Reiner knows wedding and I was like do you mean it's out of brewery right and uh I was like - every non-alcoholic beer like I was saying like it helps us socially cuz socially it's okay fuck everyone's drinking you know and he goes yeah yeah he goes sober October I'm like yeah but he didn't know a lot of people know this contest but he was just like I'm doing it - did you know about it before last night no we were gonna do it earlier or later but then Bert had an Australia thing I'm like there's no way you're doing in Australia you can't be sober in Australia and you can't be sober for the Joker's cruise right and that was November I think first we can remember some and so we like just settled on October so we just stumbled upon it mhm and other people have been doing it for years apparently uh-huh how long sober October been going on for a long time yeah Jamie says a long time off Mike because he doesn't realize what Paki I share a while it's apparently been going I was doing it completely lucked into it dude somebody I was at the Jets game somebody sent me a beer and I was like what and then I turned and there's a I was like I can't and I guys like I was trying to catch you do from the stands diese things Birds drinking he does Wow yeah really he was I think Bert's drinking they look guilty he wasn't looking at me I think he's drinking Joe Rogan I've wanted to so bad I actually needed a break this time I went to sushi I told you I went to sushi and when was I was like oh yeah get a nice hmm I've been fuck it's October god damn it it's like earaches you realize now it's not just casually drinking that there's moments where booze really does go well with an experience steak in a nice glass of red wine yes yeah November 5th son we're going off November 5th we're on our fifth that's what I'm gonna do the recap podcast we're all going off so Ari and I have been battling for first place recently until today when Tom Segura snuck in a second place with his 400 plus points today that really puts a pressure on me it really has hurt me to not I finally joined a gym because of this have to blink it's a small gym but it's like right near my it's seven minute walk from my apartment like a pass on the way hoping the seller I can get a workout in right then if I want that's good yeah it's 24 hours as far as weekdays mmm so work has a crazy fucking life there's a crazy life in New York - everything's 24 there's so many 24-hour things restaurants pool halls yeah I passed by that place we went a bunch of times which place all the time I was there that place until - oh really yeah but it's still pretty late there's a few real sketchy joints there 24 hours but if you go in there you get a bunch of creeps that want to gamble with you and I'm just trying to hit some balls yeah I don't think I mind off things yeah they're cracked out trying to hustle there's very little of that anymore though it's New York has cleaned up for the worse or the better I mean hustling pool hustling its chances just kind of died really he has like pools dead they have like legless house yeah you know yeah it's like well I mean that's good I'm just happy if people play it's a fun thing to play but it's dead in terms of like the way it used to be in Manhattan where there was just gambling everywhere you have to turn the century there was a thousand pool walls in New York City what yeah 1900s there early 1900s did you ever see that the pool tables like outside in Thailand when you were there no I didn't but I'm here in the Philippines it's crazy yeah and it's just like there'll be some like an awning or something or just set up kind of like a people who go tailgating those kind of tents and we'll be under that and you can just pull over and be like play and they'll be like white guy for sure let's play no gambling just like having a fun time really oh yeah I saw one in Chiang Mai in that downtown marketplace area yeah how fun was that fucking Thai kickboxing pretty fun Thai fights so cool and they played them of the instrument right fun is that yeah that's pretty wild I've been to those out here where they play it but Americans get real bored with the Wai Kru the dance they do uh-huh yeah they do dance for their for their own dojo yeah well they do everybody does it and there's a real logic behind it the logic is that you warm up and then you relax yourself okay I can see you're kind of performing in front all these dance moves yeah and also people are staring at you so it kind of wears off your nerves there's a reality to that it's it's actually really wise well no and you loo you limber up your body too like a lot of the stuff they're doing is you know they're getting down on one knee like a lunge and they're bouncing a little bit and so they're limbering up their body and then on top of that they're actually doing this dance in front of all these people and it calms the nerves a little bit Wow yeah John fix we're always talking about that about like the idea of people watching you is actually a big thing and the UFC is like a bigger people watching you then oh yeah anywhere else it's a tougher people watching you is fucking I mean people watching you shoot a free-throw you know go ahead dude go dude but you've watched fuck yo here we go that's real even if it's just like five your friends yeah yeah pressure the pressures are fucking real man I mean that's what everybody's most terrified about what we do public speaking mm-hmm I had somebody that we were giving a talk on Shakespeare or some it was a group project we each had to write one paragraph we wrote three paragraphs at each one of his read one so I think I read mine just reading it okay I was paying attention this the next set he's like and then later Shakespeare how did they go I'm just looking at her like what the fuck and the teachers like okay okay okay it's alright let somebody else rage I was like what the fuck is wrong with you it's crazy his weight was a stand-up but like yeah make any sense I used to panic when I would talk to bank tellers what yeah I used to go to a bag dog get super nervous right before I'd have to talk to a bank teller why yeah well when I was a kid I've really felt like a loser I really did I had like serious low self-esteem issues up until like high school you up until martial arts and then once I started doing martial arts and getting really good at it and then teaching it kind of calmed me down experience yeah and then it kind of like was it believe it or not almost like a natural path to stand up but I remember before that being very awkward talking to people like very nervous talking to people I didn't know you know I just didn't didn't I get back I still get that where I'm like I don't know how to talk I just you're a stranger I don't have to talk to you yeah I know right especially if it's an odd thing and food you know that's when I know you to and they ask you questions are so broad what's Joey Diaz like Oh was he like yeah that's hard that's hard hey man I gotta ask you a question which I do for a living trying to get my shit together okay fired fired truck operator yeah you should make ladders yeah like what about you what are you talking about yo you used to be a carpenter but I don't wanna do it anymore okay I think you're doing stand-up so I do it like definitely no go for it no but you want I say go for it sure if you like yes if you want to do it do it yeah but everything is like that but if it doesn't work out don't get mad at me no I might be responsible for this so you told me to become a fighter no I'm all fucked up you told me to Gigi so I got a broken arm now bro who's gonna fix this huh huh you bro that's the actor you motherfucker fix that shit go get it fixed yeah I was talking to a friend of mine who I want to name his name cuz he's got a pretty significant injury and we're talking about his injury yeah it's fucking bad man you know he needs surgery and he the his bone is changing shape because of arthritis it's building up in his joint I'm like oh fuck and he's a young guy and it makes you realize like the fucking punishment these guys are putting on their body and it's like totally below the surface like that people don't know it's behind the curtain yeah no one knows about it and they've got like these devastating injuries that they're fighting off and then competing against world-class fighters with injuries these torn ligaments and Felicity talked about with 20 Ferguson's like he doesn't look comfortable in that leg no I mean it's like yeah it wasn't you know what he went six months from catastrophic knee injury where the bone literally separated from the ligament the ligament tore off the bone did you ever see the the the picture of his surgery Oh Jamie pull that up pull that shit up James it's a crazy surgery because it's I'm not exaggerating it might be a 12-inch scar it's enormous that big and it's all jagged and shed and it's just he ripped it apart they had to open him up like I did about 12 months not even six months six months I mean yeah insane I don't understand how that guy doesn't clearly get the title shot he does he does we should talk about that look at that wow that's crazy and the thing is that was just from a trip he just tripped whoa fucking bananas yeah yeah what's the second image Jamie different angle oh the other side yeah way worse angle yeah yeah the the extent of that injury the the fact that he came back in six months and what's really interesting is he came back in six months he didn't spar apparently really to talk to him about this and I'm gonna have him on with Eddie he didn't spar he just prepared to train with out there yeah he's one of Eddie's black belts wow really yeah damn he's a black belt you should be I think he is he's good at fighting I'm pretty sure Eddie gave his black belt after he submitted Kevin Lee he did yeah yeah he's he's 10th planet guy wow that's pretty cool it's pretty badass he's got a nasty Darce choke yeah he should clearly get the title shot there's it doesn't make sense to me even that when he came back he shouldn't even gotten stripped mm-hmm in hindsight I agree 100% and then it's like you have khabib who's the title holder fair-and-square I guess but like you never beat the champion well he's more of a legit title holder in my opinion than kebede yes before Connor because he'd be a like winter who wasn't even supposed to be fighting for the title whereas Kevin Lee is a way more like Ferguson get it from well Ferguson fuck Kevin Lee right for the interim title because but on our left but Kevin Lee prepared for Toni first and they met they fought for the interim title and Kevin Lee is like a top contender right he's a fucking tough guy obviously we went five rounds of khabib Connor couldn't go five rounds with khabib and he you know he put up resistance it was it was a good fight he said he would never bring in a title shot no maybe he was never in that discussion well he's fighting Kevin Lee if he beats Kevin Lee he that's the next play maybe he'll get mad look al Iaquinta is fuckin legit he's very legit he's underrated like really underrated in my opinion yeah I think he's the way he got up from khabib taking him down nobody's been able to do that he got up like pretty consistently took very little damage on the ground wasn't wasn't Kebede was never able to pound him out the way he pounded out Conor if you go back and watch a like winter versus khabib and O'Connor versus khabib you realize how fucking good a like winter is now so just tonnage there's nothing on the ground well he didn't in that fight he's really this is that's when Mendes took him down on two weeks notice mm-hmm and it was like if he didn't gas Mendes would have beat him it's true it's like he can't fight on the ground well he did very well on the ground gets max Holloway which was early in Max's career max is only like 21 at the time yeah but I agree with you that's definitely his weakest part of his game and the strongest part of khabib game my point was just that Ally Quinta did not get beat up on the ground like that did not really close to being stopped went full five rounds and could beam clearly won the fight but Alec went to provided resistance and provided more of a struggle than Conor did I honestly think some of the reason that's holding allied Quinta back from the fans being from them taking up him as like a top is his name it's just not he has the name of someone who'd be like in the early round of Mike Tyson's punch-out you but if he started starching world champions nobody would give a fuck about his name sure if he went out there and destroyed khabib and fucking head kicked him into another dimension true good point good point nobody would give yeah when they talk about like how hot like celebrities are like you wouldn't say that if he wasn't in nine movies mmm like ooh I don't know like Ryan Reynolds pretty hot yeah things like that really yeah the moon guy he's in the moon movie right or maybe like day even like Dayne people like he's good-looking like look yeah but like even back then it was like but it's like no he's fine for a comedian he's fine but for a comedian yeah but super successful so you like oh this guy's hot it's like not really not like jeremy renner I remembered him when commercial day oh it was like good-looking guy but now people like he's so gorgeous and so that success is on that that's true yeah for gals yeah funny that doesn't work like that with girls at all at all a matter of fact it makes me like a little gross well if they're if they're hot if they're more successful yeah look man super successful and not that good-looking like you know it works the opposite if they're gross looking and then they get successful like Joan Jett bumfuck Joan Jett now Joan Jets hot yeah Joan Jets always been hot but in a Jay Harvey these women without their fame are like get away from me really we're talking Joan Jett yeah I love rock and roll yeah another dime in the jukebox baby yeah get out of here go put a dime in the jukebox you're disgusting I'm saying it's only cuz we're Fame just grow I always thought she was hot I know you did but when I was in high school yeah well she was hot when I was in high school like Joan Jett probably 155 years old yeah she's playing like Dewey Beach next week the club what'd she look like now hmm she looks like okay well it's a little issue that's Sharon Osbourne yeah the wrong photo no that's her I know yeah well you know fuckin father time fucks us all in the ass damn it father time you know anyway the reason I want to come on here talking MMA yeah it's because I had this unique experience that a lot of people like I mention it sometimes and like oh you've been to a UFC I'm like dude I've been to like 50 of them and they're like wow and it was just a cool thing where I guess in your contract early on you got this deal you get a free companion flight and a free companion hotel and then you started inviting us and then we started doing comedy shows on Friday night after the way ends and then it became like a thing yeah and so we'd these weekends we do one big show and then go to the weigh-ins and have and have the actual UFC the next day which is this fun weekend full of like doing something stand-up and also having fun well how about the classic example of you and Duncan kissing when CB Dollaway right it wasn't boring it was a fucking wrestling fight it was boring into the camera KY airs on the grout it's Nate Marquardt that's who knows yeah Marquardt was fighting somebody oh yeah we were given Illuminati sign Duncan doesn't sit up there normally frosty was always really cool with us up there make us feel welcome you know frost he's great yeah great guy love and uh and then Duncan was like let's give Illuminati signs he doesn't really care about the sport so we're just looking at the monitors saying that seeing the fucking technique of all available it goes into like the fucking filming of it joint Illuminati triangle [Laughter] they're really really dumb people they think you guys are really in the Illuminati the house that people have been saying like you're in the Illuminati I know you are you and Rogan I get people all the time saying I'm in the CIA that's great that's great what a terrible operative you are if they uncovered it could you imagine if that was the secret to my career like all the other stuff was just so I could just portray a normal person yeah history of martial arts getting in with the UFC becoming the commentator or some public no to be a CIS just to be it's like so I can go deep deep undercover and nobody would buy it yeah yeah it's like would you just be better to be the garbage man no one respect this there's people that just want to believe the dumbest fucking conspiracies period yeah the dumbest conspiracies like there was some fucking guy one of those Infowars guy that was promoting something recently that Hillary was 50% reptilian 50% I've heard 30% believe but 50/50 well half yeah see if you can find that someone said she has 50% reptilian blood well you know that was a David Icke thing for the longest time the reptilians yeah remember he was saying he won't talk about that now apparently he's angry when people bring up reptilians cuz it's embarrassing cuz he was like I shouldn't believe that yeah what's a fucking fool heart will hit and then he became way more mainstream and then the internet came along remember that fucking reptilian thing that's a crazy she used to have an answer for that either oh yeah I was just making that up for for whatever when I was back when the early days of internet I believed it right or like I believe that now I realize how crazy that was yeah yeah you can say that but now I don't bring it up yeah there's I mean look there's fucking there's a real conspiratorial out that journalist that was killed by the Saudis this week uh-huh that's real that he was killed yeah they finally admitted that they killed him Saudi said yeah I said that they killed him in a fight which is if you see the guy like far this guy's not fighting anyone yeah like and some of the the crown prince's top people top security people have been released apparently probably gave him a fucking hundred million dollars and said go chill on a beach somewhere Wow somebody said one of them two was like died in a car accident this week what unquote they kill a lot of journalists man no not a journalist Infowars real news Twitter band after MSM outcry over Hillary satire so it was a satire piece I just found I was like there's no way they thought it was satire can I just tell you about about Hillary Clinton this is DNA test proving she's only half lizard person oh yeah like she's joy she releases it clear her name do you know Elizabeth Warren released that thing that says she's got actual Native American blood but it's literally like one 100,000 24th fucking million trillion Wow she has like the smallest amount zero ben shapiro tweeted but what he said oh fuck Jamie we've tried to find it your great-great-great-great great-grandfather yeah but and there was something else but I forget what it was see we could find it and I think I'm 1.6 percent African I did one of those DNA tests are you really yeah and I'm done I think I'm at least ten times more african-american Wow um that's how ridiculous it is I might be wrong with these numbers cuz Jamie and I were trying to work it out and we were both stupid as well I did she released that is like see instead of going like I guess I'm not she was lying and she was also lights you probably her family's like we you know we have Native in us I'm like oh that does happen yeah people do check like Jamie Jamie thought he had a gang gang of Native American in them he's a suppose they do it's hard to prove is from what I'm trying to find out right I can't wait to do one of those tests I just have it to see if I'm over ninety percent seven percent Jewish seven percent Jewish mine is almost exactly what I thought it's mostly Italian it's some other European like Irish in English you've got to be part monkey yeah there's some did some Neanderthal I found the answer yeah there's a seven percent more than the average person is you're the South Park on that no he's trying to prove that he was minorities who claim victimhood yeah I noted I think successfully swabs your mouth so of course he found a Native American just started making out with them I'm gonna swab her like came up kind of weird there like 98 percent Native American so we gonna need a blood test at this boat fuck sir approved he wasn't any minority except he was like two percent Neanderthal and he goes you want my people out you raped my people yeah Stan Marsh is a great character yeah so anyway there was drunk and then so we're doing that we keep trying to get on film Minotti yeah he could see the monitor you know the monitor on your table yeah and so he goes you know next time we have to kiss and that was like because as a person I'm like I don't want to do that but as a comic I'm like oh I have no choice yeah obviously that's the right move it's like god dammit so alright I'm watching this fight tell me when it's time and then a minute later goes now tongues I mean yeah we wrapped around a little whoa gotta enjoy it no I don't think we such dogs maybe we did I think you might eventually I think it was a real kiss frosty just watching the monitor he's not even looking at us he's like I wish I'd held it along over yeah you grab his face too like you really loved him oh yeah I did put his hand on your shoulder and sort of like a submissive stance I look at Joe Silva hmm this fight is interesting Joseph is guys hands crossed totally oblivious to the homosexual activity going on behind this is back when the fighters could actually make a living in a sponsorship oh yeah short sponsor yeah yeah that's a big selling point for Bellator for a lot of fighters come here actually make some cash well there's a lot more money to be made if you can get sponsors I mean Shah was making more than 150,000 dollars of Fighters short answers yeah yeah and that flag behind you afterwards a flag behind you the shorts they quickly rush to put the t-shirt on yeah and t-shirts around the week of the fight like you know people would pay you to wear it for all your training footage oh really yeah I remember when the sponsor I remember they did away with it the fighters going hey come to fucking you know whatever nightclub come to shush we're gonna be short I don't fuckin nightclubs they have in Vegas and then they're like hey guys you can't do that anymore it's gross I think that came out of the time by the way I remember one of the earlier ones in Sacramento I see I got to see luckily not from when you were in the UFC but from this middle range to where it is now of like all the fighters would say the same hotel mm-hmm and like we'd have the after-party there yeah we'd all hang out yeah four or five fans would show up who knew about it but generally it was just a way you can drink with Keith Jardine and all these guys in late time great times I remember you eventually had to make a decision like I can't be here anymore to come overrun with fans but for a while it was awesome yeah you linked our girls to things changed one cell phones with cameras all the time that changed because you used to be people just want to say hi then was everyone had a phone out and they all wanted to take a photo and they would wait for you in the elevator Bank so you would get out my elevator and there would be 50 people there and you couldn't go anywhere you're always so late to the event like I can't I have to go yeah what about the fence I'm like I'm doing my job yeah about do it for a million fans so you for don't really matter how much running to the fucking weigh-ins these guys are starving to death right now and I gotta get there I can't be late for the Wayne's it's televised no people would get so angry if you didn't take their photo but it was such good times I remember in Sacramento there was a hotel bar yeah or all at it was like this is fraying awesome hanging out casually you happen to get into conversations with fighters yep trainers delle grazie people like that you just talk yeah it completely changed it completely changed as a well 2005 is really when it changed because that's when the Ultimate Fighter came on and when the Ultimate Fighter took off and the sport became it just became much bigger like almost within a year it was like significantly bigger and then it kept going and then 2000 like was an iPhone 2007 six ish that's when shit really changed with the cameras on the phones men then 2 8 9 and then I was like I can't do this anymore I have to cuz we would do show remember you was like I gotta go to Dana's hotel well there was no way it was just too crazy it's like you would get stalked coming into the hotel you get stalked leaving the hotel people would find your door and knock on your door but it wasn't like that and I'm so fun it was so fun yeah we were there in the fucking salad days I remember you doing the weigh-ins once in I believe fort lauderdale and this is we were walking to there with the tap out guys yeah I remember scrape telling me scrape and mash saying like we found it this is before the iPhone actually because he was like we found a way to crank text people what you do is you put in ten different contacts of a text mm-hmm all the same number and they say hey how you doing and then they would just get 10 individual texts just keep doing that yeah they would take pictures of people but I remember you doing the weigh-ins and going and it was back then it was only the camp showed up yeah it was small yeah it was just in a in a you know like hall you know not a hallway but like a like a banquet hall and you go re I almost brought you up [Laughter] nobody stop that no there would it be like haha I would have gone up there waited like a lot of the stoic imagine if the UFC was gonna hire me today yeah and then they like watch one episode of the podcast was getting fucked up did you clean it up a little bit yeah William Morris wouldn't allow that sorry Emmy like yeah I mean they'd like you gotta be fucking kidding me there's no way yeah let's get let's get Jeff Probst yes he knows a lot about MMA does it really no no okay and that's not Sharon Osbourne yeah but it was such fuckin Wild West crazy shit and I was just getting it as just start training with Eddie you started paying for that and so I'd see the Billboard at the Hyatt now the on does looking over the Comedy Store I remember seeing Liddell could tour too I think yeah and people like oh it's a fight I'm like Oh what does that mean who are those guys and having Tate and you go like yeah they actually fought an epic fight or two it might have been three I'm not sure and now they're gonna have a rematch I'm like oh cool I didn't really know anything about it I remember rolling at the old bomb squad and having people talk about I'm like what is this thing that you guys were talking about I remember hoist Gracie but I don't know who any of these people I don't know the terms you're using get them on the ground and like it's all it's all a question of matchups mattress makes five more oh I'm just like trying to get a half guard in I forgot how to do that a rear naked choke defense doesn't good fast do you got pretty good you got pretty good I remember you tapping people I remember looking over and watching you top some guys going damn there was fun fucking jujitsu if you brought if bodies didn't break I'm doing jujitsu it would be the most fun thing to do if bodies were way more durable like next didn't give out and like Eddie's had three surgeries Sam inside of the last year he had knee surgery he had his back disc replaced in his back and then he just had shoulder surgery it's like your body just gets blown apart right well my meniscus I had a surgery on didn't know what it was for the longest time your buddy dr. Steve Steve Graham yeah he was like oh MRIs get false negative 20 time just tell him to sculpt it because I was like it's showing nothing because it's probably it's probably that just telescope it they went in there and found it and did it right then hmm but um when they did I was like they were like um what do you do what might hurt it and I was showing her Jitsu high guard just like on the table myself and he was like and so I pulling my leg back like that you know and he's like what why don't do that and I was like oh that's I have to do that's part of it like you why would you bend your leg like that it's like that's every day man that's always a week they don't know what the fuck they're talking about that's just a flexibility issue yeah that never bothered my knees really no no if you're flexible I think was kettlebells more than shit sorry yeah cuz I remember we were doing some stuff like you were doing cleans and presses and I was like for a guy who doesn't ever lift weights this is a pretty explosive movement yeah my techniques not perfect so then it's like really opening it up to like well damage it's also when when you get sore from doing something like that you really should take a long time off like the real hard thing for people that are just starting to lift weights is the building process it's like one of the things that we had talked about with this fitness challenge was lifting the most amount of weights and improving your max weight over the month I was like okay guys let's be let's slow down here cuz you guys I mean I know Tom lifts weights a little you don't lift weights at all no I do not I lift weights a lot and I'm like listen if I'm going to improve my max and things we're running the risk of catastrophic injury like we're running the risk of tearing ligaments but also be bad for the contest how somebody have to drop out yeah it could fuck you up pretty bad I don't lift max weight I lift like considerably less than my max weight and I don't go to failure I do this you don't go to failure no I operate under these principles of this guy Pavel taught Celine who came up with this company called strong first and what the idea is is you do lesser like say if I can do 70 pound kettlebell and I can press it over my head 15 times I don't do 15 times I do six five or six and then I put it down and I leave it alone for like 10 minutes and then I come back and I do another five and I do low repetitions and unless I'm doing conditioning in which case I'll use a much lighter weight and I'll do weight so camera saying yeah but cam does different shit it was like 40 reps of five he does a bunch of ridiculous shit he's a fucking maniac you can't pay attention to him because he doesn't make sense he's outside the norm he's he doesn't make any sense he doesn't get injured he fucking runs marathons every day and he'll do hundreds of repetitions I kill do sets of twenty five like for everybody yeah he like when he's preparing for one of those big races he runs a marathon a day Jesus yeah it doesn't make any sense but also you have to recognize that he built himself into that state over decades do you know marathon where it comes from yeah I was a distance that they had to run to alert someone of some guy right and you know the guy I guess his name was marathon or the guy right afterwards deliver the message and died but it was more than an actual marathon I don't think it wasn't 26.2 I think was 100 miles I think I ran 100 see if that's true the origin of the term marathon if you call that up origin of marathon please thank you yeah pull that shit up there's two shirt by the way mm-hmm so cam doesn't count yeah I don't understand how he's not always hurt but anyway so you need less Oh 25 miles uh-huh announcing the fucking announces defeat of the Persians he was just announcing a sports score Wow he wasn't alerting them saying that guy's name try to say his name the soldier fit dip fitted lose dip ADIZ sure what you want man you're the boss the first marathon commemorated the run of soldier Philippa T's from a battlefield near the town of marathon Greece's areas in 490 BC according to legend Philippa T's ran the approximately 25 miles to announce the defeat of the Persians to some anxious athenians but doesn't say that the guy who died no it does not but it died see how that guys running look up see where the guys striking with his heel it's wrong totally wrong not only is it wrong human beings never ran like that before they invented those stupid fucking shoes right up I heard you say that before when you're talking about the goat shoes so I try to like lead with my with you yeah yeah not so what is it you Paul you follow my foot that's what you're supposed to lean forward more and when you lean forward more you strike down and you almost hit with your foot flat but what you never want to do is run like that asshole heel down that's how people destroy their knees running and that was all created by Nike Nike created that a stupid bubble fat heel shoe because you know to give you more cushioning but it's just the mechanics of it are totally wrong if you ever watched little kids run their run ball the foot first that's natural that's how you're supposed to naturally run it's your foot is literally designed as a shock absorber I run with those minimalist shoes my shoes have zero cushioning zero so I'm running mountains and hills and shit like that even I'm when I hunted elk last week see these guys oh yeah right on the ball mm-hmm but the black ones the real dark black ones were good they run barefoot those fucking guys but these guys are they're landing flats they have a lot of cushioning on these shoes you have to realize like it and some of these guys are landing heel that kind the bad guys down heel first and that's because of those goddamn shoes if you didn't have shoes like that there's no fucking way that guy's all he'll see that last guy that guy's all heel you would never run like that it's against the mechanics of the human knee hold it go back to that what does that video that just come up it's the elite what was that video that was just coming up next said Candice running cadence Oh cadence okay that that video like that's the only reason that people are running like that is because the invention of those shoes I mean you you run quite a bit right I've I've seen the reason I looked for that is because I've seen a video from the Olympics I think it was last year where they're showing long distance runners and all of them had a different stride some were running ball foot or first some were running heel first the winner it was different I mean it's also goes to all their bodies are different they have different well you can run heel first with those shoes and you can get away with it for a long time the the issue is that's not the way your body's designed and the only reason why people are running like that because those fucking shoes you know if you talk to physiologists and people study anatomy and the loads and the human need there's massive loads there's massive problems with running he'll first just not unit you're not designed like that I would say though just isn't disclaimer the biggest problem for most people who are probably those do it is you don't run it at all so go ahead and get up fucking ass and run and then figure out the exact right technique later remember when we trying to convince Burt that running on a treadmill is not the same as running and he was like no way and they try real running here's a quarter dude it is so much harder of course the fucking treadmills coming towards you all you have to just pick your legs up but you know it's way light for me anyway that I've noticed running on actual ground where's that burst pavement ground is way easier always on my joints if I can go longer it gets a give or something it's like putting a cork but you're you can run on pavement no problem as long as you run uphill really well it's not just that it's you just not pounding when you're running uphill because you're decelerating as you catch yourself and you're pushing off it's like you're doing lunges the problems with that is unless you're running in a dolly then it's fucking impossible to keep running uphill it's good point good reference to leave references you having this every podcast I walk downhill basically Walter wait and then run uphill oh really why kind of I mean I go way slower downhill it's just dangerous it's bad for your joint yeah pound like going downhill like deceleration like running downhill and catching yourself like that it's just not good but the deceleration when you it's not even deceleration really but when you run uphill there's no pounding yeah because you're just reaching that area and then pushing but it wears you out more but like your muscles but you're right the joints okay we were hiking the Alps this year and July and man there's up hills with like you really have to push but down hills like you're pushing off yeah and it's like it just hurts more yeah it beats up your knees to really beats up your knees yeah I found that elk hunting too but the really the painful stuff was the downhill you're just stopping yourself stopping yourself stopping yourself and yeah there's also a lot of sliding yeah and they almost like got a pusher foot sideways like so down that way it's almost easier yeah that's why they have such stiff use when those stiffs are you don't rush shoes you don't come over the edge get an edge and you dig that edge into the ground I got some good luck boots for that and it was really good makes a big difference I tried hiking with these minimalist shoes this last trip that I was on I didn't like him I wasn't a fan they're fine for running if I'm running on a trail but for hiking like the human body is just we have bitch-ass bodies yeah also so weak with boots you want to be like walking to a creek without having to worry about like it's gonna suck my socks to the next four hours yep yeah yeah gore-tex you want that gore-tex lining of your boots by the way so after that fight after that me and Duncan kissing yeah there was a blog that went up pretty fast that's had a two-board beer to do is go make our UFC and uh I got a text from a guy just got a new phone a new flippy and uh somebody I didn't know it was somebody texted me like oh you two were quite the social media darlings last night weren't you and I didn't responded who it was and then later I looked through my iMessage - it was Dana I don't think he does but you never quite know I know because you're like you are a CEO you know in addition to being this cool fucking regular dude who curses all the time you're also a CEO which is like who I don't really get along with of a gigantic sports organization yeah that guy it's interesting meeting that guy to having like dinners with them and like converse a casual conversation to listen to like a highly successful person and just how they like normally act once he dropped the guard you know it's just interesting he's a super dude for sure very driven yeah he loves making deals and all the all the shit's involved in it but hearing you guys talk about like the fucking meatheads of Boston fighting and stuff like the tops we meatheads finally met I remember story he told what it was like whoa well Boston where Dana came up and where I came up the sparring was awful it was he he sparred a lot in South Boston and I sparred in Somerville and in Revere and a couple of these other players everybody would beat the shit out of each other there was no real spar and believe is only one are in Revere Revere Revere yeah they there was no you're supposed to spar wow this is a lot of debate on this but most people think you should spar at like sixty to seventy percent maximum everybody's part 100% Wow they were they just fought everybody fought right and everybody got brain damage a hundred percent that's my boss is how it is there was a Harvard or your dork and the women aren't the best looking every sets up it's like one of these things the comics do where they say something like real dark just your comic friends and they're like you should use on the stage and it's like this challenge of like oh right you are he goes on stage at the comedy connection in Fanueil Hall anyway I don't remember the exact word one of it 50 people but you were like you know the problem with Boston is women are just really not that good I love that training and now I can go after a crowd and he's like you can go up maybe one I'm being honest yeah you know training yeah yeah the way I met that you can see that in like in like Katt Williams when he's shitting on Michael Jackson when he was still a hero yeah and it was like boo goes fuck you children fuck you he's a molester yeah you know that go right at them I don't care how you feel I'm well justified in this super justified with that yeah I mean that was just some so as I Boston women are disgusting even if they're good-looking their voices of garbage Bonnie oh fuck me and my pussy man you fucking queer those were fun times to men because like when we first started going on the road together like one of the more fun things was well it was really fun hanging out and doing shows but it's also fun saying like you can't get fired Kakarot dude that was such an influential time my stand that specifically where it was like we're at the hotel five-minute walk from Fanueil Hall and let's get high and I was like no I'm about the four months they're crazy kick right now that's where I've been hiked when tea time maybe right and you're like why I'm like because I won't do good he goes so I'm like what do you mean so I guess so I think but then it goes you won't get fired didn't hire you you can't play here it's 4050 seats and also like it's too far for you go to feature and you just way too big for you to headline so I'm hiring you and I don't care if you get too fucked up so it smoke pot it was like yeah you also wanted you to feel free and that there's these moments when you get high and you go onstage where and they don't always happen but there are moments where you take a right turn into brilliant Vil mmm and that right turn doesn't exist sometimes if you're sober if you're so will you'll stick to the script but if you're high yeah you like so what if I did fuck my dog ya know where you might come up with this premise or this tagline or this thing that comes from you being in this altered state of consciousness and you can't do it any comment listing I would not advise you doing it on a big showcase we have to show like well you're Marshall more chill when you're taping something where it's important but for workout sets yeah we're really just trying to get work out of this mm-hmm so so um and back then I could get hot now you and I we get high for a couple hours you know maybe then I was high for nine hours three hits there was no like so anyway we had two sets at night or Friday or Saturday night and uh the first set was awful I forgot what I was saying I had no idea where I was going I wasn't that bad it was bad no no parts of it were really four hearts of it okay but then by the second set not then you went on for an hour then we had a half hour break and then one hour again by then I come down a little bit and a second set was what you were talking about free-flowing you really should get high about an hour and a half before you go onstage not like right before I fucked up and got it high right before that's not somewhat that's not wise what's wise is an out on your way down you already know where it's gone and now you're coasting you know what Edgar would do medic overdue for a while he would go on later the Connery store and he wouldn't get high all day you know your first hit of the day is like your biggest one and um cigarette smokers havasu's only time you get a buzz that first cigarette you know but your first we'd hit it's the biggest one he wouldn't smoke all day he'd have a 12:15 a.m. spot and when they go hey Matt we're letting the Tony he go cool run to the main room smoke a bunch in that three minutes and then go on stage oh yeah he'd be going up and feeling it while he's on like it wouldn't even hit him until he's two minutes on oh Jesus yeah they did have like six months that would be good if you had notes yeah and if you followed what you talked about already that's right tell me when they play Clint destiny or comedy underground they call it in Toronto well that place is crazy east yeah and I'm like I'm like any advice Mike my advice is bring a setlist I normally don't say that but this is one you will lose your place dude there was no air in that room once Green it's only pot like you were breathing pot and exhaling pot it was all pot my buddy man olace he was like I don't smoke and then he's in the back for 20 minutes like dude I'm high as shit yeah triple e Triple E wasn't getting high back then and yes you are he was barbecued that's when I started to believe secondhand smoke is a real thing people don't think it's real when we used to mock tape because Tate didn't want to get high we would to smoke pot and Tate would have to stick his head out the window I feel like what the fuck is wrong with it hotboxing that's when we used to get Vans remember we used to get Vans uh-huh yeah conversion fails yeah we would rent vans any of us oh yeah yeah we would entourage it on red band with filament we would just have shenanigans and every town we went to you bring you of course and then Eddie Kate and red band as the non comedians and me and Duncan or me and Diaz or whatever there's a shitload of us yeah so five six people and then we would feast these fucking amazing restaurants Fogo a lot a lot of it brings me back to one of my memories I believe was Cincinnati was nearby right near the hotel okay she wants Korea yeah right across the street yeah and as we're leaving fucking newly Botox literally came in like dude that's fucking Vandelay and he was he was the most fierce pregame fighter the way he'd look at you I want to kill you for taking this fight yeah nobody was scarier than him in his prime yeah crow cop was scary because he would just be so calm look I don't care what Robocop stared him down more than anybody ever stared Vandelay down he wouldn't break crow cop was a straight-up killer Croatian yeah Croatian anti-terrorist squad they begged for mercy and I've showed them and he was a world-class kickboxer he wasn't afraid of Vandelay strike and he was a heavyweight and Vandal eight really wasn't a heavyweight yeah but anyway we saw him checking in the meet he was in that tree house Korea 15 minutes late like he threw his shit down and came in that's it look at cro cop Wow yeah dude nobody stared down cro cop back then that was when cro cop was at the peak because japanese guy going through his routine it's like fuck and I'm pretty sure this was before cro cop really had sort of mastered MMA he was coming over as a straight kickboxer and they had different rules for him the rules for cro cop were like you can only fight on the ground for like 30 seconds they had like yeah and if the fight went to a distance it would be a draw yeah yeah because he really didn't have a lot of experience with takedown defense or any MMA fighting back then and Vanderley didn't get Botox he had his face reconstructed cuz his nose he had been in so many brawls his nose had completely flattened we couldn't breathe out of it and he had so much scar tissue over his eyes that his eyes were drooping down so he'd get cut instantly any any punch to hit him would open him up like a god you say and he and his nose was completely flash so they took a chunk of his rib and rebuilt his nose and he had his nose built big so he could breathe out of it more and then he had all the scar tissue removed from his eyebrows and then pulled back and according to Dana I don't know but Dana's like he got its Donna Brazile on the cheap and just like wasn't the didn't they don't really make him look like Wanderlei wow so he went from Wanderlei Silva it's like Wanderlei Silva has the most profound facial form change in all of MMA because he went from pretty if go back he's like Silva Wanderlei Silva versus go-to Wanderlei Silva versus Dan Henderson one when they first fought in Pride he he was a normal actually pretty good-looking guy like regular good-looking guy and then by the time he left pride his face was just smashed in by the time he fought Chuck Liddell his face was just smashed and his nose had been literally flattened Wow from punches and kicks and not just from fights but also from training the training that he did it shoot the box and Curitiba was this fucked up fucked up that also okay would bring me to another thing we got to go to Brazil one time we didn't do a show that time but that's that's him versus Dan Henderson Dores look can make that a little bigger so you can see yeah super normal looking just a normal looking badass that was the first fight boy you fought Dan Henderson Henderson his chin looks like it was drawn on yeah he's like somebody fucked up no bone yeah let him see that picture of annually above that with the eye all fucked up that was him from that fight oh really and Henderson connected with a haymaker of a right hand and fucked up his I love this guy's smile on that like look at this badge look at this cool picture on by the take but you mean look at vanderley's face there in comparison to his face later on his career totally different Dan Henderson looks exactly the same mm-hmm he looks like the same guy he's just another version he might be one of the toughest guys has ever lived so tough yeah Dan is just picture up there with the tattoos and the shoulders go to that one now that's him after facial reconstruction make that larger see that's after the facial reconstruction is settled in you know we saw him right then and he just fought real recent like a couple weeks ago no way he's still fighting gun knocked out by rampage rampage flatlined him yeah just a fun - yep rampage still carries that power that was when he ko'd rampage kod him in the UFC we can knock him through the ring through the ring pride was one of the coolest yeah I saw that later I mean I you know way later you come to the UFC and there's like all these highlights this backlog of highlights of MMA oh yeah especially at the UFC purchase prime yeah yeah Rio was really cool yeah that's a place to go and actually that fight that in terms of the audience first phonce the two biggest ones were Silvia Couture in Columbus first time they'd ever been in Columbus and that real fight jose aldo vs. that was chad mendes right which one brazil wasn't it it was a spinning back kick oh that was Terry Adam versus Edson Barboza dude from date from fight one of the undercard the place was so light you could feel it shaking and I remember them chanting something in the crowd cuz Dana did smart there's one of the first like foreign ones and he made a Brazilian fighter on every on every fight yeah he fucked up a little by having some a couple times Brazilian first Brazilian but at every fight and they were chanting something in the audience I yeah you were like you ever the translator like hey what are they saying like oh my god oh my god they don't play games man oh my god that's when they were like legit and I believed it like we got to figure out how we're gonna get Chael Sonnen out of here fights Anderson here and I'm like come on and then you go they're like oh I believe it now yeah well they're fiercely fiercely nationalistic and also that's where MMA started I mean really MMA I mean martial arts started in the Orient they started in Japan and China and but in terms of like legitimate mixed martial arts valley tudo those no rules fights that's all from Brazil man Brazil changed jiu-jitsu I mean you leave the airport and they're these giant like jujitsu guys he's like looking at each other like it's part of their organization or their culture yeah it's huge over there and you know I had on Rafael Lovato who's like one of the top Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters in the world yeah who fights for Bellator now and he's actually an American from Oklahoma that fights you know and really represents Brazilian jiu-jitsu but he was saying that like for the longest time the Brazilians dominated the World Championships he was one of the first Americans to win a medal in the world championships but for the longest time like even Stu this show the Brazilian still like have a disproportionate number of gold medalists and that's in them right yeah yeah huge part of the culture and they're so proud you know so proud that was one of the coolest places ever bit so I remember also when we were two Australia mmm to Sydney and we did do a show that I never could we did two shows it was cool but um it was in your contract first-class companion ticket way before we were ever gonna go to Australia for that yeah and then it was just as the UFC grew it just grandfathered in and so I remember Dana coming up to me half joking and half serious just going do you know how much a fucking ticket cost $25,000 dude that's how much I paid for you to go to Australia bro put me in coach and give me fucking twelve of that I could use the money let's split the difference for 14 hours yeah for 12 grand yeah yeah yeah there's like apartments so practice yeah Segura told me he thought in the year before and he was like dude get ready it's gonna be so good to keep his socks that I jerked off into he okay such a fucking crew grand experience yeah you can do a lot of fucking ufc's live man I went to let's talk about Anderson for a little bit yeah cuz I believe my very first UFC was at the Pearl yes at the Palms I think it was Anderson Bruce Chris Leben yes it was fun fight yeah I guess Anderson it might've been his first fight in the UFC it was okay and people were like he's highly Talia but not crazy like he's the best just like he's a bit I knew who he was and I was telling everybody like whatever the betting line is it's off you told me that on on Glover Teixeira oh yeah hey dude I don't really tell you go fucking take money on this early on the undercard Glover fought Kyle Kingsbury yeah I mean just like people don't know and you know go over I was like what's a long ago it doesn't matter to he'll he'll win he got a rough deal man cuz he couldn't get a visa to fight in the UFC for a ride for six fucking years for six years Glover had a toil in other countries he was one of the best ever he was fucking phenomenal back then man and I think you know when we got him in the UFC is at the tail end of his greatness honestly I mean I think we never really got a chance to see Glover at his very best in the UFC it's kind of like a Jackie Robinson like what word assess what have been if he could have plans for career or HRO or something like that he's one of those guys that I mean I remember when he fought so could you he fought so could you I think it was in the WEC and the early days of the WEC when it was in Northern California yeah yeah he was Chuck Liddell sparring partner and it was one of the rare times he got the fight in the US and I remember watching him fight and I would hear about him I think Hackman told me about him too cuz he was training with Chuck and I was like that guy's a motherfucker hmm he is so good he was so solid and he was like you know training with hackle man and training with Chuck Liddell in the early days when you know they're just savages man and his head wrestling too it was one thing that a lot of Brazilians didn't have there were more jujitsu oriented and he was a wrestler as well there's babalu babalu had a real good wrestling base to Pablo's the first guy I remember making money by leaving the UFC he was one of the great guys to like I'll get paid as a UFC vet I have a name I'll get paid a bunch off this fuckin Chuck fight you know I'll get to meet a bunch of the rest of my career until everybody started going and then it's like wasn't worth that much anymore UFC Strikeforce opened up you know a lot of people realize that there was like there was a legitimate venue and they were on Showtime yes Strikeforce was on Showtime good scene yeah um when Kimbo fought there I mean it all sudden was a big fuckin deal that was a lead XSEDE came about the chick that went on to to uh murano gina carano and they were like making these people and that's actually where you've heard about cyborg yep yeah no yep yeah there was like a lead XE and that's yeah and then you know and Strikeforce those were two legit venues outside the UFC that really kind of because the UFC wasn't as big back then right and then they they were pretty legit there it more minute you could get it you didn't have to pay per view it right you could actually just watch which is what Bellator has going for it - but now Bellator is on that new thing does own Daz end do you know that isn't well they what they're doing is they're splitting it's like a streaming service they're splitting half the half the fights Bellator on paramount which is used to be spiked paramount half the fights on this Daz n network but what's crazy is the Daz n Network just gave Canelo Alvarez 365 million dollars they just gave him this giant deal is a former fighter isn't it no Canelo just 100 just be triple G on consider boxing you know what I fully left it what we went to your place once your old house me you Eddie may become other people we were watching some pride stuff that you DVR'd right and it cut off the last fight because it went long oh that's right then we watch box watch boxing and after watching 2 hours of MMA you see a guy get knocked down and they're just like gonna work it away let him get up you're like what the fuck is this so much hugging and fucking yeah boxing socks it's great if you watch really good boxers and if you know you're gonna go see boxing yeah fight that happened a couple of weeks ago it was a really good fight yeah it was a really good fight I thought triple G mmm Wow I thought was a real clothes fright but if I was gonna give it to someone I think I would have given it to triple G but it was close enough where you can go okay this isn't a robbery but good fight three decisions but leg kicks and and and takedowns and it just makes fighting more interesting so just way too many fucking let's see what the judges say it's no one so nobody really won they just got just did better yeah nobody beat a guy right rare I mean it happens but yes rarely it happens less yeah the thing about Pacquiao Mayweather was like I mean kept fighting right so what have we decided right right right yeah after 12 rounds he could have gone 12 why I like the early pride like the early UFC with like hoist it's like you're gonna find me for 35 minutes right and then we'll see eventually I'll fucking wear you down yeah that's what Nate always says like if this is a war you'd be dead yeah you know yeah he's like I choked you out that means I would've kept choking you yeah and then just put a fucking you know and twisted your neck yeah I mean if if someone came along today and did no time limit fights I wonder like if you had like three big no time limit fights yeah like Nate versus Connor John Jeffers is DC you know and have just three giant fights and have no time go fight scary thing to go into that kind of a fight that's a different feeling like what hoist went into in those early days of the UFC it took a lot of abuse just to get like past guard and that's look like eight minutes late he took so slowly move yeah we're not in a rush it's weird how it changes your fight plan yeah based on this outside influence well people also have to remember hoist fought guys that were so much bigger than massive like chemo fought chemo and chemo like was a giant roided-up dude and was hitting him with bombs and and hoist was on its back and finally caught him in an armbar and then couldn't continue he couldn't fight after that yeah he was supposed to fight later and he couldn't fight he was just he couldn't fight in the in the next fight he was just too bad tournaments right hmm yeah crazy that they could play twice in a night there were three times in a night yeah yeah look how young Big John looks oh my gosh Christ he's not even growing facial hair there's chemo chemo was giant I mean he was so huge yet Jesus tattooed on her style look how big he is damn yeah that was a crazy-ass fight man that's when I was like what is this whole sport I'm getting it my friends like ya know it's dorm as hell house and Gracie in the back I mean that was the Klan man that was the the Gracie clan who was the Gracie that was supposed to be but they were like here's to good it'll fuck everything up Hickson but the thing about it was not just that Hickson was too good but also that Hickson wouldn't listen like no one could control Hickson oh really like yeah cuz whore Ian created the UFC and whore Ian was the oldest brother or Cory in Hilson I don't know I'm not sure which one was to him a run right at yeah there was no feeling each other out seventeen seconds in that fucking fahan I had to do that I mean he had to close the distance to get a hold of the door open he's like wait wait wait he's like oh fuck this is sucky yeah ready go yeah and Kimo out his wrists taped up and not his knuckles it's crazy yeah there's not golden forgot about that happen uncle stomps soccer kicks you could do anything back then you can kick in the balls you can knee in the balls you get home yeah right that's right remember that guy just kept wailing in the balls like 30 times so much the guys like acne Heath Hackney versus jousan he fucking boson Joe Sonia went to jail for rape right went to jail for yeah and now and he murdered his cellmate he went to jail for a gang rape they arrested him for something else and they did a DNA test god I once found out that he was a part of a gang rape damn yeah look how skinny Big John John is so Wow he's just John their belt looking so sexy I got a model this is 93 right so this is a long-ass fuckin time ago man 25 yeah and hoist like headbutt see that hoist with the head but you know it's like a girl but the knees in the balls like please fall down so I can do what I need to do well I mean he really didn't have a wrestling background you see how high his hips are you know he didn't he didn't drop down and go for a double he was basically yeah he was basically clinching and then hoping he get to fight to the ground with a trip and there he goes and then when he tripped him chemo wound up on top of him which is hilarious look at this flattened out had his back is terrible terrible position blue hoist he's instantly turn boys just happy that he's on the ground yeah dude keep wrestling with me I'll fucking get you but look at this kima was riding his back but Kimo is maybe 80 or 90 pounds heavier than him it's AIT's a lot to get off your back yeah hoist was like 175 he's got that key too yeah he was 175 in chemo is canceled about what the guy easily 250 he was a big fucking guy man look and there's no back of the head so he's got to protect himself with distance and no like and also chemo is holding on to hoist is key yeah but now look he fucked up over tired look wide open gone and then he just didn't even tried up took yeah but he bucked him off just but from sheer size yeah but chemo just got exhausted because when you're that big if you don't have like a real rigorous strength and conditioning program you just get fucking but I was gonna you've got no idea oh no armbar but it looks not that good a sloppy he's tired man he's carrying this fucking big guys wait and again they didn't have strength and conditioning back then right nobody know what the fuck they were doing this was always if it not a cut wait he didn't cut anyway they didn't know shit about nutrition I mean in 93 men now remember he got ahold of that hair yeah and he he got a fistful of hair and started punching him in the flaws he's really creates distance for the arm triangle there no look at they still can't get a fistful of hair it's not letting me this bitch I got your hair fucked up managed to go haircut try to be sexy that on purple shit but you know this is we learned so much about martial arts from these fights yes everybody had these ideas like would work and what wouldn't and then once they did that is like oh I have to work on my ground and then that evolved and I have all been involved well I built those though opened up jujitsu schools worldwide everywhere and everybody wanted to be a Gracie you know guys were changing their name to Gracie guys were like marrying Gracie's just to have the Gracie name guys would marry a female Gracie and then changed their name to Gracie I mean it was crazy it was the difference between you making a million dollars you making nothing yeah nobody wanted to go to Fred's jiu-jitsu to be a part of the Gracie yeah you know you just got all that hair on the ground what is that oh it's a hairy Mo's hair if you pulled a fistful of fucking hair I'll hold it out yeah what the fuck they're both so tired Oh exhausted Ben how long is this fight go I think it went seven minutes if I have to remember exactly it's crazy that both so worn out it looks like it's more of seconds what's that J months and right here it's about to end here for 22 oh hey he catches it keeps going for the armbar of the triangle and eventually as I hear he gets it so it was like for 28 he's catching the armbar so this is like first round whatever I wonder if UFC today even knows what he's going for here a hoist does no not you know chemo he's like what are you doing okay that's it I think he more tap because he was exhausted than anything look at him he's exhausted yeah yes me a Barrett he got the armbar for sure but I mean barely but then hoist was so beaten down by this fight that he couldn't go on but Hickson would've destroyed chemo it would have been a completely different thing because Hickson was strong as fuck man and Hickson was there's Jo so Saeng Hickson was a different animal like Hickson was much more physically imposing he was about 190 200 pounds he was smaller than chemo but he was jacked look at their bodies looking fucking his body is just like wrestler body yeah professional wrestler bought it yeah more bodybuilders yeah yeah yeah whereas hoist is just if you saw hoist was shirt off you would think that guys make a fighter a wrap you up like a fucking package so back to Anderson though yeah sold my book ends with him are that first Leoben fight and then shattering his leg which I was in front row for which you didn't even believe it it didn't make sense to see a leg move like that you're like I don't I don't get it it looked like somebody filled up a sock with with pebbles and just like yeah hit against something I was like it doesn't didn't make sense and it was so gross but in the interim seeing that first Chael Sonnen fight when he was I mean he won four and a half rounds jokes on it yep he almost won the title and then to get that I mean it was a such a legendary sports thing not UFC but sports thing had this guys down like crazy in a title fight a guy who's never been tested was finally tested and was losing it was over this guy could Chael Sonnen was beating him he figured him out and then to get that triangle with what 40 seconds left two minutes left whatever was but I remember what's so clear indelible in my head is afterwards were at the insurance everyone's cleared out of the stadium we're at the entrance to the to the under the you know the caves of the of the stadium wherever it was and it's me you I think Dana Randi was there and we're all talking and then every once in a while somebody's mind would go to that fight and you just see him but like yeah yeah I think the weather's pretty nice here and then you see some I go like like you couldn't believe I've never seen Randy Couture do like it's like what is this four minutes into the fight grabs a hold of it or four rounds in the fight grabs a hold it syncs up the triangle and gets a triangle armbar combination and taps him Wow and this is an Anderson came into that fight injured ander Anderson had a fucked up rib entering into that fight and a lot of people thought he should have pulled out what kind of weird edit is this all the only strange fan I mean it was nuts it was nuts for that guy who can't see how he's holding his side and the moat that was the first trash talk fight ever remember two OHL son and people forget how good he was at talking shit he was the best the best he was the best when I come in when Anderson Silva walks into the ring you can hear a mouse pissing on cotton when I walk in it's thunder I mean the the promos he would cut yeah we're just the bet that hadn't been done yet now not a lot well Conor McGregor prob you know it's arguable the chill was even better than Conor it is arguable but if we take time period into account no one was doing right he was the first yeah and he was building up fights as a heel for the first time ever mm-hmm and brought it a little bit later but people forget how they could fight if you go back to really to me his one of his most impressive victories was Nate Marquardt because he fought Nate Marquardt when Nate was one of the best and he ragdoll him and it was a bloody crazy chaotic fight and he you know he basically dominated him with wrestling yeah chill just fought last week he just got out by phaidor to him he stopped by Fedor yeah and you know he had some good moments in that fight he had faders back he tried he tried to roll them over there's a move that you do go under the chin when you have someone's back you go under the chin and then you you somersault over and try to carry with momentum try to carry them over but it's a core strength move your head an arm well you yeah yeah he was kind of like riding high on the back and he went he felt like he had a grip under the chin I don't know how he held his hands but what you do is when you have a guys back you you hold it like this and then you go forward so you take them forward with you that way you have their back when you're on your back you could cinch up a body angle you could cinch up the choke but phaidor shook them off and then beat the he's on the ground yeah watch how he does it so he tries to flip him over see but he lost fuck he lost control and then boom haymakers coming down from one of the greatest ground-and-pound experts of all time a giant difference that was getting out or not getting it all so you know chill fought 185 faders been heavyweight his whole life it's like you know there's a lot of factors in there but yeah it was a good fight for as long as it landed long as it lasted brother one of the cool things that we've gotten is the ability to hang out casually with these fighters like having just breakfast with Randy seeing him you know having enough times with you that I remember one time I was like going into a buffet or whatever or the hotel like free breakfasts and like looking around and just having him going hey sit with me yeah I'm like okay just like oh you're just such sought after it I'm just like I'm talked about nothing but some of my favorites were in Chicago to going the weigh-ins and then like let's go to the show and then just drunk driving with Clay Guida like I'll Drive you it's his City it's his City yeah and he's like come with me I'm like okay and you white knuckling holding off the front seat as he's swerving with a brown paper bag he drives like he fights I'm just like I accept that so either way and he's just going for it on these highways he knows and I believe the rain and it was just like just like so fun yeah another one that I remember early on early on John Jones he wasn't anything then which for know maybe something like that meeting him talking about shit and I could talk about this now because it's not no longer a banned substance in the UFC but like talking about weed yeah and was like yeah let's smoke bro he wasn't anything it wasn't anything and just going like he's like who's gonna wait a micro Rogen's got a piece in his hotel room and texting you flip phone texting you back when it wasn't cool you'd have to have like hip to have a flip phone it was like that's all anybody had that's how long ago and then just going like maybe it's that maybe there's early I phone but like just going hey man are you up you know kind of tired go to sleep Andrews I can fuck John I think he doesn't want us up there and then like no no let's go he's got the weed let's go because some fan gave it to us right you had this fucking tin like tinfoil of weed and and just knocking your door like what and you're like you were you were to retired and it was like um do you have that we'd like to come on I wanna go sleeps like me and John wanna smoke and you're like you looked at us you open the door fully looked at me and this young fighter and you were like come on in and we all smoke pot together in this hotel room in fucking wherever it was I think Montreal actually Montreux yeah yeah and just a fun top and then seeing this guy move on to become the baddest motherfucker on the planet well we also had a conversation with him about I was I wanted him to go to a different camp that's right he was training in fucking YouTube videos in New York yeah with his buddies in a garage you're too good Mike you should be in a real can that's right we had that over weed Intel room he's like you really think so I go I know so I know I go you only have a certain amount of time in this thing I go and your time should be invested with a real coach who's gonna hone your skills I go you you could be an all-time great man Wow yeah I remember telling him that he's like you really think so I go I know so I know so you you really got to move on I forgot about that part yeah how influential is that on the fuckin future of mixed martial arts I hope it helped you know he did he what's a twinkle John yeah John eventually I mean he probably what might have done it anyway you might Oh knows but I think it was a good conversation to have with a young guy you know I was like listen man you you you have real talent like you could really be something but you got to be you got to be coached by guys who are gonna find out your tendency your bouncing technique isn't worth isn't gonna go take you that far well I mean fucking he was so good who knows how far you might have been a world champion even with the camp that he was in yeah he's so good and his wrestling is so powerful and he's so physically talented but it made a big difference for him to go to Jackson's and and be able to train on a regular basis with world-class fighters yeah being there on a daily basis with Carlos Condit who was you know at the top of his game back then that's right I mean Keith Jardine and they just had a massive they had the they called it the Ring of Fire where you go five rounds of sparring with to get ready for a fight with a different high level I mean highest level fighter so like Nate Marquardt like cool that was round one get out of here Jordy and you come in yeah now I just finished a fucking round with Nate Mark white now I gotta go with Keith Jardine cool round three yeah sure didn't get out John Jones you come in yeah and it's like what I mean the training you got there correct Johnson's camp were like oh yeah I mean look there's a reason why so many extremely high level fighters were coming out of there and then Rashad Evans was there as well too and Rashad had a real problem with John coming there because Rashad was like hey this guy's in my weight class yeah but what are you gonna do have one guy teach weight class and right it's an issue yeah and then you know Rashad and John became friends I've never thought they did fight you think what yeah they fought and John beat the shit out of him remember they fought after they had a big falling out because Rashad was upset that you know John wound up John wound up getting a title shot and beat Shogun because you were shot got injured Rashad was supposed to get the title shot John steps in and they were friends at the time and then somewhere along the line then the trash talk started you know I'll fight Rashad fuck it and then it was like man I thought we were friends and then oh yeah that's back when it was like you know you guys can fight his friendship we're doing you don't have to like be at enemies everybody fight it's it's a sport and it's a it's a money thing and then when Jon beat him it was a real drubbing and it was five rounds it was a decision and it was a real clear-cut unanimous decision he did some crazy shit doing like stepping elbow to the face oh yeah I do remember this one no this was John when he was developing John wasn't even John like the John that knocked out DC I remember he was sang in fights I didn't really ever see this were the fighters where he would talk about after wins talking about the holes the fuck-ups he had more than the what he did right whereas most guys would be braggadocious money I loved it I did but it was like he was upset at things that went wrong yeah I gotta cover that up that could get exposed you know John's a fucking smart dude to me is reckless and chaotic as he is and you know I've said this before that I don't know what causes that kind of recklessness but there is a direct correlation between traumatic brain injury brain damage and impulsive behavior and recklessness it's a fact it's well researched it's it's well documented in neuroscience they know that this this is a there's a connection I don't want to exonerate him from his past behavior but we see that in football players we see that in BMX riders that go crazy and fucking land on their head a bunch of times people they get crazy Wow they get wild and impulsive it's just a fact it's just a part of the game you know they those people that engage in any kind of an activity where your brain gets rattled on a regular basis you are way more likely to do ridiculous things that don't make any sense that doesn't make sense yeah it does this is what I said about John or you talk to John about it you know and you know I know John was upset with me after one of those things before we actually did a podcast together he was upset and I said listen man I have to be honest about everything I have to be honest about how I feel about every single aspect of your performance of your behavior I have to be doesn't mean I don't love you it doesn't mean I don't think you're a great guy I hate to give your commentary on yeah I have to be you don't really choose sides I can't I can't not only can I not choose sides I have to call what I see it's it's everything because if I don't know then no one's gonna listen to me there's just cuz I have a comment on it go ahead okay well I remember finding it interesting that after Brock beat Heath Herring yeah went to whatever Steakhouse you want to and Heath coming in afterwards and looking right at you said like it wasn't good you were critical of him right he sought you out like I talked to you and we all fuck he's mad but he's like he just wanted to express to you they had this leg injury and that's why he couldn't really defend that takedown yeah but it's interesting other fighters that I get to see these fighters respect your opinion enough to want to explain their side of it well I appreciate and there's always a side like I was talking about that fighter that has this pretty significant injury that he's dealing with right now like most people don't even know and they wouldn't have known if he didn't tell you there's a lot of these guys that go into fights and they're really compromised you know yeah hand injuries back injuries neck injuries and this is just a part of this crazy sport where you're the whole objective is to injure people so you're injuring each other in training and you know and you got to hide those injuries because then they'll exploit them right yeah but then there's but this is why one of the reasons why I have to be honest all the time is because people they respect the fact that I'm not gonna I'm not saying things because it sounds cool I'm saying things because this is actually what I see and maybe you have a different perspective maybe you could share your perspective with me and I'll tell you why I thought this and maybe I'll change my mind and I'm not scared to change my mind but I gotta say what I think yeah and they just cool the fires like I just you know wasn't being a pussy to see I mean I keep hearing would be a pussy yeah that's just they cared that you know the real truth of it and not that I was bad but like here's the reason yeah it was interesting how they respect your opinion like that well guy like Brock Allah is your man I swear that if Brock Lesnar got into the into mixed martial arts right out of college well when college wrestler right into training really learned striking and learned slowly like took some small fights on Jones did yeah yeah and then but really learned striking instead of like spending all that time doing WWE which I'm sure he made a fuckload of my oh yeah I mean good for him that's all great and everything like that but man I think he could have been one of the all-time greats I really do so long no we have free nobody I remember cutting that much to have you wait yeah those would weigh in with their jeans on because they honor whatever I am was also there was no testing back then oh yeah you got to realize that the testing back then was horseshit and the way to bet the best way to show that the testing was horseshit was the show when Alistair Overeem fought Brock that was the steroid Olympics those two guys together inside the Octagon but that was also Brock less than a year from diverticulitis surgery where they had a remove I think 12 inches that's crazy of his fucking 82 olin or is um well it was it's not even a meat-eater I thought it was at the time then I talked to aunt of all people Anthony Bourdain told me now people get diverticulitis sometimes from seeds really it'll get stuck in your intestines so they brought yeah well it's just things get caught and stuck but they they had to remove 12 inches of his intestines so that he's done after that well he was and then he came back but he was done as yes the Brock lesner that everybody feared well he he says that he was compromised even before that he said he was compromised before the cane fight and before a lot of his other fights even the fight with Shane Carwin from diverticulitis like who's suffering from it from a lot for a long time and he just thought that you know it was just exhausted from training but really he was having this blockage and all this issue look at this Jesus yeah it's fun talking to uh that's 256 is incorrect by the way that's not true when he weighed he was 265 if you lose over him over him was over him was 265 as well Wow and if you look at over him on the scale for that fight there's a this there's that's a great picture of the two of them facing down like Jesus Christ they're both so jacked so big but it's not like they're 610 when over my height yeah when Overeem was was standing there flexing on the scale you're like what in the fuck is he like right there what the fuck dude Wow exactly like really fucking hard he's still smiling oh my god so jacked that he was so fucking friends trainers name or managers name Oh ed source Ed Soares yeah and we were tossing like about the pride days and he was like oh they tested for steroids and pride and you were like what they tested for steroids goes yeah I mean they didn't do anything about it but they're just tested but yeah you're both positive go for it who cares yeah well according to n sin anyway not only do they not test it pride they put it in the contract we do not test for steroids oh I thought he said they tested and then just like we don't give a shit Bridgewater no I think they test they took they took tests but they didn't really test you damn those guys are big spring card girl that she was so young which was that gorilla he was a gold Willis on Jesus he should have no Nazi in the war he's missed his calling you have been met one of the most feared Nazis there were honestly if he was a fucking Nazi I would have rooted for the other team he was a Viking yeah he would have been on one of them boats with a dragon in the front of it by the way I mean underrated John Jones for a weed head I mean everybody gives all the credit to fucking Nate and Nic it's fair they've earned it yeah but when you would give a fuck it those breast strips half a strip was the dose that's right and on the plane who's like heard you got it one of my finest compliments was John Jones I heard somebody else goes hey you know John's always goes or Shaffir he's always got great weed he'll fucking yes I'll take that is the dose he took too and you like do that he's like Joe Rogan I'll be fine he was fine I was so scared for him I was paranoid because I gave Tommy buns a half yeah and we flew to Florida man he told me he goes dude he goes I swear to God when we land he told he goes I didn't think I was gonna make it I've had one of those with you before I've really thought I really thought I couldn't make it I really thought there's no way I'm gonna be able to survive this flight I'm gonna freak out I'm gonna have them land somewhere I almost told the stewardess before we took off I was I was close to back before we were on the runway the only thing that stopped me from doing it is knowing the abuse I would have taken from you verbally that's two years that I'm like I'd rather die I love those days it was so fun I was actually I I felt bad for you a couple times in my life why one time me and Nick Youssef were doing a corporate in Vegas and went to the new Aria and we took edibles and we walked around and I was like oh Rogen's too famous and big he can't do this he can't get this fucked up and Walker but but watching the fights on edibles I'm like oh it's too bad you don't get to experience this yeah you can't do that you can't have to do commentary 100% sober I tried early in the days yeah early in the day I did like one or two events where I was a little fucked up and I was like this is just too cloudy I want to think because I would want to talk about other shit right the fight would be going on talking about dude about a stingray tattooed on his back he just fought in his last fights he was on there I think a guy who'd the fucking big black dude beat on the last 13 so volkov yeah I think he has a stingray oh yeah it is kind of a stingray I can see you going like what a great for to distinguish is some of the most underrated sea creatures there are first of all the peaceful should this strange thing to have tattooed on your back what if he's like an ocean guy it's really enjoy did city I swam with those in and uh forget where flora is awful Flora's really yeah I know where the Komodo dragons are you fucking dive in and you were you went to the Isle of Flores yeah that's that's where that little fucking man lived you know they had that that human being that they found what do they call it homo Florian cissus I think they really yeah I was a little tiny Hobbit like person that existed I want to say as recently as 10 to 15 thousand years ago there was like a three-foot tall kind of human yeah there was there's been many different branches of human being right there's been Neanderthal yeah there's a one from Russia Dionysus or something found forget I was look at that oh yeah no I met that guy you rent a hostel I said oh yeah that guy was the shit he gave good drugs but this little little person that lived alongside human beings well see if my timeline is right do they have speech they don't know but they know they used tools no yeah they always make sure to paint him with tools to show you with ninety five thousand seventy thousand years ago oh that's it seventeen thousand years ago Wow what is the same debunked was that one Hobbit human species debunked I don't think that's correct it says new historian but I'm pretty sure that's probably an old article for instance what year was that article when is that ten years ago ten years ago yeah was it ten years ago 2004 that's what they're talking about I'm sorry so it's 2014 is the article that's fairly recently yeah I don't think that's the consensus I don't think the consensus is that it's been debunked a long part is about the cranial volume but not that it was a separate species cranium volume is calculated to be 430 million Li milliliters which puts it within the range of modern human living in the same region they went further comparing the size of the circumference of the occipital it support a simple frontal section of the skull to patients with developmental disorders in that region the planet they found the measurements were indeed similar if lb-1 did have Down syndrome then it would explain the short femurs as well hence when calculated statistically for normal growth they would yield a height of just over four feet which matches up with some humans living on Flores well hmm this is I think this is probably one of those heavily debated things but you're trying to recreate there's a thing called Island dwarfism that happens too it's really odd because it happens to mammals but the opposite takes place with lizards and reptiles get massive like Komodo dragons on the island of Komodo the scariest photos ever been giant they get huge they're their monitor lizards really essentially that are enormous whereas elephants that live on Islands get tiny they have these Wharf elephants yeah yeah see that that's less room to have to cover so no less resources so they adapt to the track humans too look look how tiny that elephant is that lives on those I mean it's an elephant it's like shorter than you and elephant 3 yeah it's like that's like an elephant it's like my kids height like this is it happens with all sorts of different animals he dwarf Buffalo yeah Island dwarfism they think it's because these animals adapt to the fact that there's a limited amount of living amount of territory all right they're not to cover long sister get to something yeah it's fucking crazy what happens with animals man when when they figure out like what they need to do to survive like one of the things that I was reading about really recently was these fuck I wish I had it off the top of my head but these moths that lived in a separate air an area where things were darker and they changed from a light colored moth to a black moth like really quickly really yeah like really quickly like they did it over a couple generations and they're trying to figure out how the fuck this happened see if you can find that couple generations most peppered moth yeah really fast like it blew them away they don't understand how it happened so quickly I think there's like there's there's so little that's truly understood about what adaptive changes can possibly happen within animals like ferns this is this documentary called relentless enemies and it's all about you're gonna piss in something I entered I need you to accept it though kombucha bottle okay where's the bottle right here I'm sorry I thought that was full it's the widest mouth okay you know what you should do you should get one of those ice bags that people use for definitely don't show that there's ice bags that people use like compression ice bags yeah they have like a nice wide mouth oh that's cool I had some of them here but I don't want to give it to you god damn it didn't work I mean you have so much piss too much okay I'm topping it off I'll use this I'll use this why don't you just run off to the bathroom real quick and just hold on to your deck and scared Jeff well you just suck it that don't piss in that Cup please what do you got what's that tumbler yeah that's for definitely take that piss out of here though afterwards with me like a wasted day I bet you could suck the piss on Joe this is Ari Shaffir is pissed for real I never say to his 47 it was losing witchcraft this is real Joe piss alright give it a shake let's get back okay all right Jaime's turned his head away he's afraid of dicks Jamie don't be afraid the glory undies no I believe this might be actually yeah yeah they are how fucking comfortable yeah the best they're the only one of the only two maybe them in blue apron the only like no longer sponsors that I'm like I'll still rep you guys yeah what's going on with you and sponsors did did something happen but you said something crazy bout sponsor and they gave you a hard time yeah man yeah it's okay I get it I'm not for everybody but then it's like we can't work together anymore yeah I just I can't operate under the idea that you can tell what to say would they say don't say something they said it's offensive when I'm like what did you say it's I think ice it was something along the lines of like if you're a human resources person and you have to hire you can your time can be spent better you know doing something else you could fucking quickly hire somebody who's difficult and it's been all your time masturbating in your office you could bring in like a ziploc bag and keep putting like use socks in there that you masturbate into I don't know I'm just going off top my head trying to be funny it's pretty reasonable it's a three-minute read on a one-minute buy yeah and then they like it's offensive like that's fine all right but I can't be thinking about it I refuse let myself think about so I'll just give up the money yeah yeah I've had some people get pissed at me yeah and it's fair on their part I get it I don't agree but I get it that's your that's your right some of our pista jizz language yeah exactly but Mike that's not the way I'm gonna do it so like we're done but that's such a foolhardy way of liking I believe that too I believe a good sponsor read that one I did was segura for satva beds where I was like him getting pegged in the ass by Christine Christina and and his butt leaves us but his knees are most so soft and ass off the mattress it's like do they got Superman to go back in edit get down which I'm like now you giving me warp more work to not pay me he said take it down yeah that's why to go rillette it what why do they have the right to say take it down because they like come on we're a family company like do family are your family company exactly and I'm like you guys I can give you gold once in a while if you let me be fully free yeah I can give you something to go passed around well I remember Berg up naturebox pissed at him he goes it's fucking healthy hey hey have a fucking Apple yeah you want to eat healthy well that goes against like I won't sit on the actual product yeah they gave them the copy and it's like though the healthiest snacks our he hasn't pretty read it he just like written as it strikes bullshit with image like math I don't know I know we're done well there are some like irrefutable sponsors like for me Squarespace irrefutable awesome product but always let me go do whatever I want whatever the fuck mandis if I start saying I where me and these are super console also when you have that last bit of calm on your dick it'll soak them up perfectly they'd be like whatever they don't care right yeah they're not saying how dare you I'm like hey there get the dark ones they cover up the fucking blood that comes out of your ass really well on the product you're not saying it's uncomfortable so go ahead you had so super corporate guys the ones that zip recruiter or that kind of shit yeah yeah I guess and it's like it's fine it's just like yeah I make money by continuously focusing on free speech I'll lose money in some spots and makes money in other spots and this is all just part of it yeah you can't really think about it like only looking to make money every time make more cuz that Universal growth paradigm you know that's only for corporations and then I'm gonna be doing straight ad reads and my listeners and you're bored as fuck I'm gonna lose listeners so then I'll be able to make less money off ads in the long run because of that more ads less money as opposed like fewer ads more my it's like well not only that it's like how much time do we really have left yeah exactly if we if both of us live another 45 years would be fucking amazing yeah that's 45 seasons of sober October's you know that would be amazing oh no this is the last sober I was over done I shouldn't got him roped into this one are you done because of the contest are you done because of the sobriety assert can we do it in January so October is the best drinking month in New York we could definitely do it in January but New Year's Eve even yeah because technically after midnight you'd still be fucked up and you would remember I wouldn't mind November yeah no booze November no booze November what do you button Thanksgiving you have a little turkey one nice you don't need that honestly though Thanksgiving the memories your everything's giving a little childhood they're not alcohol-based no not really you might want some but that's what she really want is if you said no stuffing you black hold on that's part of it mmm but no alcohol in Thanksgiving that's not a big deal what about March March is okay more sober March sure that's alright sir bullshit month the fuck goes on in March March is a bullshit month March Madness st. Patrick's Day is March yeah it is but yeah but I'm not Irish I mean I'm barely Irish yeah spring big yeah there's always a reason by October's are one of all the NYU kids have calmed down and going to classes so like you can actually the city's back to yours again it's amazing hmm and it's like it's fucking hard I just passed my bars I'm like I want to fucking go I want to go with Jay and they're like let's go to a fucking neighborhood bar mmm it's fucking awful a couple days away buddy we're only ten days left now it's what's really important is that we beat Bert for sure I don't care if you win I don't care if Tom win as long as Bert loses can I can I tell you can we talk about drugs at the UFC for a little bit sure so with Diaz always bringing the breast strips there'd be this time where it wouldn't kick in it wouldn't kick in and you look over you like feeling it you like maybe sort of or one of those Jolly Ranchers that they have I remember having a side it's I remember eating a Jolly Rancher like before the fight started because again it's early with you and just like I'm stalking Locke there's and some other guy nobody knew me back then and it was like dude I think somebody smoking weed well once we're going for more huh you smell the weed from the Jolly Ranchers yeah yeah and nobody could comprehend back then that it could be coming from your Jolly Rancher it's all I can smoke about 2003 mm hmm hmm and then you look over the feeling that sort of and then you look over again and Diaz just like in a trance and you realized you are too and you both look and years ago and you know he bought the devil in you and it was just fucking great and that's I mean I've talked about something this is not happening stories where it's like you don't even know who's winning fights you just know you're enjoying one of the UFC events mmm yeah fuck when we're sitting with kill Steen and and uh and uh we didn't tell him red band knew and just do an acid I remember how into it you were that part of Me's you never quite know how people gonna react to things so you really know them and like it could have gone like do is my place of work you can't you know just a small part of you thinks maybe but then you're testing us whoa you're into the fights where are you guys where you guys sitting it wasn't one of those we got bottom floor we're in the fucking stands for that one and we kept looking at us until you found us oh man I've never seen stuff so clear that remember Forrest Griffin coming in with shipping up to boston playing and everyone cheering and I was like this is the Coliseum we're watching what was like in the Coliseum few people fought in lions yeah this is the everyone's cheering for blood how are we different than the Romans pretty fucking similar in a lot of ways yeah just a modern more acceptable version of it oh that acid that you have seen don't fucking good it was great you didn't want any food Redbank sort of took care of you a little bit he was like some of the fucking and do Delores cookies yeah we've done I mean I went to a bunch of events outside of the UFC where we got really fucked up on Adam went to that one in at the Playboy Mansion yeah strike force yeah we got fucked on those blasted in that one yeah that was fun I missed out on a lot of that like you guys sitting there in the audience had a lot more fun than me six hours of fucking greatness so you take him early and by the very end it's like you're just coming down and that's like let's go eat these steaks so wrong it's buying again let's go there was one in Calgary where it fell on shroom fest and is with Duncan and I was like hey I got his mushrooms and he goes oh I don't I don't want to come on I want to take mushrooms right now okay I'll just throw them out I'll to get the mushrooms I have for you I'll throw them out I'll step on them on the ground and throw them out so you want to eat guys all right relax I'll take the monkeys and man it's so fun there because like you would take them you get bored there's some wrestling fight you know where it's like they're trying to out point each other and you're like let's go wander and you just go wander you go get a hot dog we put him into a Maynard's which is like Jolly Rancher like a gummy whatever we'd stick him in there so you could reach fire I'm a nerd or you reach in there and you feel something crunchy like a stick and you're like okay I'm going for that we just keep eating these mushrooms some random dudes we're like hey you want to come fuck into our skybox and so we went into some skybox for a while and so we got kicked out by security and that was fun like this cuz we were great fucking giant pupils I saw a fucking security guard in Calgary as we were going in and already tripping you're trying to smuggle these these mushrooms in there and this guy goes hey man happy shroom fest I was like okay you're being cool about it like you know about it you letting me go like thank you very much this was like a cop one of those that they hire their Calgary was fun Calgary is great uh-huh great city yeah doing doing that doing the edibles I remember Alex Jones being there once India's given a real cookie it was right this cookie yeah and Alex Jones like what's in the cookie India's eat the fucking cookie what kind of stupid question is that you don't spend there we went to eat with him afterwards he was barbecued but so much more reasonable back then I never understood how they made him from crazy conspiracy theorists to alt rightists I didn't get the connection there well that connection happened when he became United with like Alex Jones became United with Donald Trump right because he was a big part of Donald Trump in in the campaign days and what Donald Trump would call in he would call in the Infowars and he knew that Alex Jones had a big base and Alex Jones would help him get elected you know Donald Trump it's very clever and who he aligns himself with like when you see him standing there listening to Kanye West where Kanye West is ranting and saying all this crazy fucking schizo nonsense and he's like this mmm that's a smart cookie thank you he's very smart and when he calls bullshit and when he doesn't call bullshit it's like imagine if Kanye West was debating him and they were doing a presidential debate and Kanye was talking like that he'd be like what the fuck is this guy saying exactly what you're saying you give enough for me so I'll let you talk yeah he's you know he would have more on a bunch well you know also out all right wasn't a thing back then I realized when when Alex came with us to the fights there was no all right but he was more like lizard people or like or like oh it's a fucking government conspiracy yeah he was all about don't get him started on 9/11 like he was all about certain conspiracies I remember we were in Austin once when there was a shooting at him at a army base we were there right with him yeah when when we were at a bar remember and he goes I guarantee you they're not taking that guy alive I guarantee they won't let him talk and then an hour later like they got him alive they shot him in the leg and they got him alive because yeah of course I got him alive because they want him to be a fucking martyr for this nigga it's like or whatever martyr right yeah and it's like no matter what he's just I'm spinning this to conspiracy and then I just that business is a tricky business I just don't they said like no you gotta be off the air now it's like well that's where it's fucked up just a lizard person guy well it's not though because like people were concerned that you're giving out bad information right and then I learned about it but then with Alex what came out was the Sandy Hook thing the Sandy Hook denial thing was when again conspiracy I don't get why that's but it was a conspiracy involving children being murdered and their parents being actors and that everyone was like some sort of a crisis actor and they were hired by the government to take away people's guns this is this is ok ok ok most radical version of sure I understand and I understand that's that's wrong and crazy mm-hmm where do you get from there to you can't be allowed to say these great you've been saying these made-up things before right you're saying it's still well I don't get why it's a hatemonger you got a really good argument but here's the argument the argument is what is Facebook what is Twitter what is YouTube are they private companies or the Smurfs er most certainly or even more so are they utilities is it like the electricity is it like a phone like what should you be allowed to tell someone they can't use it like I wonder if jack said hey I'm shutting down Twitter if the government's like we're opening it back up again right or is it like NBC because if NBC is a private company and Ari Shaffir says hey the lizard people are eatin kids and that's that's tough to run 60 minutes and they say no no our you're fired look bro Xion made one fucking bad ambien joke and they cancelled her and they kicked her off of any other words they were they weren't that's not true it was a huge hit because of the outrage over the first season when she was like she supports Trump but it was a giant hit but they were looking to get rid of her this whole group was already saying we want you out we're looking for an excuse kind of like when they got rid of you at The Comedy Store but were filming when it was like come on they already wanted to get rid of you well and then they found an excuse to get it done mmm that's a tricky argument they watered her out so bad they wanted her out I think they wanted to minimize her the less that's true but she was telling me how they were changing the way they were writing things and they weren't including her in the process where she was very much included in the process during the first season when they were writing for the second season they were there basically excluding her from the process of premises and the way they were writing this show I mean I read I read all the outrage about early on it's like you're a trump supporter mm-hmm and I read I saw someone like grace Ani some young female comedian going like when when when Silverman was like hey watch my friends show Roseanne she's great great show and she wasn't this is the bitch I gotta be fake with at a party and kiss her on the cheek pretend I'm cool with her and it's like what is all this outrage over this pro Trump thing and I finally I'm like let me go watch it and my friend Jewish female leftist Morgan Murphy who wrote it I talked to her later about it by finally watched it and it's just 12 characters in the show ten of them don't talk about who they voted for at all one of them is pro Trump one of those anti Trump it's also a little trans kid on there and that's it just one Pro Trump one anti Trump and the outrage that I saw was almost like I don't think you guys could have possibly watched this episode hmm I think you're all reading headlines about stories and that's what I talked to Morgan about I'm like it doesn't seem like it could have come from the actual facts you know there's a lot of that going on right yeah and so I feel like it's the same thing with Alex Jones I'm getting hate monger I'm like what Alex Jones just crazy conspiracy guy most of it yeah most hate monger well yeah you talk about taking away trans rights or there was some talk there was some talk Alex Jones was saying and one of the one of the last final straws it was talking about people taking up arms and that people are not gonna stand it and you know it's it's basically rabble-rousing which is like a lot of what people do when they're they're talking about the other side trying to take away your rights yeah time to take away your guns we're not gonna stand for it you know you know and and people are gonna get shot you know that kind of talk you know no specifically what he said but there's a problem that you don't know specifically right there's a problem that they can just decide that you represent a certain faction of thought yeah and that this should be eliminated from you should be deep platformed instead like to platform for a conspiracy guy and that goes people were going up to those those parents is saying like your kids not dead and it's like a real issue yeah but it's like he's not calling for that that's what they're doing on their own well I'm somebody shot two cops in New York because of the black lives matter movement right you don't shut down a black lives matter movement over that they weren't asking for them to shoot cops someone did on their own he was also and he wasn't asking to do that no he wasn't so like so like I don't see how you deep platfor the only great article I've read was by a trans woman who said when I hear crazy shit like that I feel like it's supposed to roll your eyes and then walk away you don't say hey you need to get gone well you know the platforming people that's a good way to put it dad that is what they're saying and it's also it seemed like it was a universal deep platforming because Twitter was in one of the last places that kept him on and then they decided that they were gonna remove him but I didn't see anything specific cause yeah like they have some rules like that when they got who's a woman that was Rose McGowan and then she was claims talking about a rape and people like how dare you she outed a rape and then and then you D platformed her from that or you just took her down from that and that was the story that was a headline everyone's like how dare you jack is that the guy from Twitter Jack doors yeah how dare you and then he actually responded goes I don't know she docked somebody she gave somebody's information about where they live and stuff like that and that's we already had that rule you can't do that nothing to do with why she docks them well it's just over that why don't you google what exactly got Alex Jones kicked off Twitter because he would Twitter was one of the last platforms and then they can say hate speech and hate speech is one of those no broad broad terms looks like I hate you yeah okay I mean I I really am like I don't I think people are forgetting how the ACLU defended the Klan members mm-hmm because the free speech is too big a fucking issue to worry about how I feel about what they're saying well you know what's really interesting is that left-leaning people the leftists are the ones that want to censor indie platform and silenced people on the right it is it's also both I think we see the less is word that bubble I know the right is doing it so we just know we're not friends with the white doing it they have no no power in technology the the tech companies whether it's Facebook Google Twitter are all left yeah and they're the ones who have the I mean this is where it's weird right it's cuz nobody saw this coming it was media like you had Fox News you had NBC you had you had your left and you had your right more left and right off shore but there was power in the Fox News you know faction they had their voice but in the in when it comes to technology there's not really an equivalent or the most of all left it's all left there's not one right leaning large social media platform right they don't exist it should just stay out of it but I get why they do then you got a reddit situation when it's all right but suddenly it devolved into just child porn well right the problem with reddit is an anonymity when you give people an anemone and one guy actually lost his job because of it because somebody decided hey this guy's such a fucking creep piece of shit let's find out what the fuck he is they got his IP and then they figured out who he was and then he was like some guy who was a dad right he's like some regular guy with a job they got him fired and like you know they he had a bunch of weird you know kid fucking type posts and a bunch of shit that just that's just like it's almost like role-playing you're not serious exactly and it's all said some folks - people are running out of the room yesterday or two days ago he got a full room randomly yeah his first three minutes by like oh yeah these many people like he couldn't handle it and then he starts going they start leaving and he starts getting angrier and more into his pocket you know and to where he belongs and then ask people even like he's talking about child fucking and stuff like that and uh and uh hey guys peek behind the curtain I didn't fuck a baby just so you know there were no babies fucked so calm down well people don't want to hear about that subs right and that's fair yeah do you hear some wonderful jokes about people losing snacks in the dryer right so actually honestly walking out is a fine response yeah saying you can't go up anymore it's not a fine response different response yeah yeah and saying you're gonna boycott the Comedy Store because they don't do your kind of comedy and you if you want a boycott and that's also okay but just trying to get other people to and but there's that this is a problem in that there's no balance right if people are just right leaning and people want to deep platform them because they have right-leaning beliefs right-leaning ideas like say if they support president Trump I mean is the president whether you would say it's like you're allowed or not you want whether you like it or not that guy's the president and whether you like his policies or not his policies he's the president United States and if someone supports that deep platforming people who support him and support that is not the right response the right response is a well worded argument against the that is against that that is convincingly articulate to the point where you you make an argument that this is a terrible policy a terrible idea and an objective fence rider like myself that watches that it reads it might go ok this guy's got a good point in the less I want to hear both sides but I need to hear that side in order to hear the opportunity side that Dave Smith who hates all politicians pretty much he was pointing out these like separating their kids from their parents thing and it's like it's gotten real bad with Trump now and he goes okay that's true but look at the picture they're using on the bottom right hand corner there's a date stamp on it and it's 2014 yeah there's definitely a lot of shenanigans so like your anger is not even who you I I that's just shit journalism is what that is and in online journalism look journalist my fucking fighting for their lives right there back there is terrible it's terrible and it's also there's no money in it there's a problem is nobody wants to buy newspapers and we want to buy magazines and it's really hard for online journalism to not resort to click the anger shut yeah I mean that's literally how they make their living now is clickbait shit and so you know they have a photo this is with the stock photo we got a little fucking kid who's crying and he's standing in front of a Border Patrol guy throw it up but use it here's what we got the story's real the photos not it's it's shit journalists I think it really comes down to like when you see like a normal Donald or is like okay I haven't done anything to anybody wrong I just want to look at with compassion or another human I'm like these are pieces of friends of mine the people I know what do you mean would just be specific what you're saying about nor McDonald what he said like Roseanne and and Louie and like they've lost everything in a day and people don't really understand what it's like right and I would like to see these friends human beings friends of mine come out with the way and he goes honestly I don't think Rose and her that lady was black I don't think she makes that comment and and then people go fuck you you can't your Tonight Show appearance is canceled yeah and it's like well I even do anything me McDonald didn't do anything instead of taking that opportunity to go hey let's hear him out you can clarify what you mean right um even say no I didn't mean it that way he platformed they D platform because these women or people I don't really know who they were at the Tonight Show had their opportunity to fall on their sword and they go now we get to stand up for women's rights oh we get to stand up for racial rights well I understand instead of going like let's say you exactly have them on and say yeah I'm Jimmy Fallon go what did you mean by that exactly and then to clarify his position to now show oh I'm on your side but people don't want that they're more interested in punishment yes and so now you're punishing people who were on your side so you can feel right at the Comedy Cellar a waitress was traveling to fucking work where in her comedy sell a t-shirt off to Louie came back and somebody said hey headphones take her headphones out she did cuz what and they go shame on you just some waitress who by the way he's not in charge of him coming back she might eventually guy or girl is said shame on you don't know I think a woman not sure but this waitress might have been like heavily against him coming back but there's no research done it's just like I get my chance to show that I've stuck up for somebody instead of ruining some other woman's day who might be on your side yeah well this is one of the finger and Val's face after he came back what goes fuck you I'm did they really know who's that was one of the managers of the Karthik cellar and it's like so here's a fellow woman who hasn't done anything wrong right and you're you're you're cursing her out so you can feel like I've done something for the cause yeah well this is something that the left does that the right doesn't do the left attacks its own and they they attack its own Tina Fey once said you're anti femoris and she was like you're out of your fucking mind about what five six years ago I don't remember and she goes you're out of your mind I'm your leader I'm on your side you're attacking me for being anti-feminist you're out of your fucking mind they eat their own they can't they have blood less they know how to control it you're not trained in fucking fighting well they're always looking for targets they're always looking for targets and in finding and establishing a target you clearly established that you're better and more virtuous than that person because you find a fence in something that they do they're not progressive enough and they're a part of the problem and so you cast them out or you shut them down or you D platforms yeah so I think with Alex Jones they go they pointed to that one a lot they're like dude he said fucking Sandy Hook didn't happen and it's like Oh I'm not I'm not saying I'm not you try to now strike a strawman me into saying I'm saying that's okay or that's right right I'm not saying that's right I just don't see the connection to this I don't see the connection to Michael Vick killing dogs which I'm not in the side of to you shouldn't play football right you haven't made that connection to me and like oh you're saying it's okay to kill dogs look no see why is that job not allowed to do the connection would be if you have a private company this is where it all boils down to like do you have a right to use their platform so you're not taking Alex Jones off the internet right Alex Jones still has a website in the internet but if you have if Ari Shaffir dot-com all the sudden becomes Twitter okay there's a separate thing though private company are they allowed and private company should you be doing right should you be doing and it's like I'm with the laws I agree with only a portion of the laws you know I think that this is in response to like the kuiper type of shit that has happened at reddit that reddit has gotten so fucking out there in so many different ways and so like that especially the Trump section of Reddit yeah like people let them be there they're not doing anything that anybody they're not planning attacks but people who if you say if you own that company and you were one of the people that was responsible for trying to sell ads for Twitter or for whatever think twitter has ads but if you had like established guidelines which couldn't couldn't say one of those things would probably be no hate speech no racism no this no that but you can't promote false conspiracy theories that hurt other people right you could get away with saying that right so it's not about so it's kind of like the the Rose McGowan thing was like no no it's not about you just can't talk to anybody what is this Jaime this is from NPR interview with Washington Post reporter about why let's read this it says and when I spoke to someone at Twitter they said one thing that weighed very heavily on them was the way that Jones conducted himself outside of a congressional hearing where Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was testifying about the way the company moderates content online Jones specific essentially went after Republican Senator Mark Marco Rubio interrupted one of his press conferences he yelled Dorsey at one point as he was trying to leave the building and then he live-streamed the incident where he was attacking a CNN reporter hurling verbal insults at him the video was broadcast on periscope which is the live streaming site owned by Twitter and so in the minds of the company it essentially was too much he had gone too far and so they kicked him off the site yeah I mean I guess if you're talking about you're right it's like sure I guess it's there right but I disagree with them doing it I would I would like a world where you're like we don't unless it's physical harm to someone possibly monetary like direct monetary harm like I'm stealing from you mm-hmm it infringes on your rights then do what you want say what you want right it doesn't fringe on your rights and keep going well the problem he comes who's to decide what is hate speech exactly we don't decide that yeah and who's to decide is is saying retard in a Tom Segura special hate speech right it's it's that's such a slippery slope mm-hmm that the only way to do it is if you infringe on someone's right you've gone too far if you haven't you have not mm-hmm yelling fire in a crowded theater yeah it's it's free speech and tell you like someone is going to get is getting hurt from this or it's very possible they will you can see why they would not just like it might hurt their feelings I might make it harder for the note to them to be a kid in this world and you say it's like no yeah no I agree but I also agree that if you are NBC or ABC or CBS and someone says things that you feel violate your company's policies right so if someone promotes some outlandish conspiracy theory about children that gets shot in parkland really never died and their parents are all crisis actors paid by the CIA SIOP and you know this person is on CBS okay you could fire them okay sure no question but let me finish here so is Twitter like CBS because they're both private companies and are the people who are on broadcasting on periscope and on YouTube are they essentially someone who is I mean you kind of are you working with or for youtube if you're broadcasting on youtube I mean how do you look at it I don't think so I think it's a private thing and I think I think if you're making a video on how to make a bomb I think the authorities should get in there right so you can't do that what if you're making a video about how there's some people out there that are lying about their children being shot same thing get the authorities in if you think it's leading to harm but it's not the company so you don't do it you should be allowed if your YouTube you don't think you should be allowed to tell someone hey you say a bunch of shit that's not true and it hurts people what's you what's the word hurt me well okay if your children were murdered and there's some guy screaming on YouTube that you're a crisis actor and nothing ever happened your kid your kids it's a lie and there's rubber kids on the ground with fake blood and they can prove it that's a hologram you shouldn't be able to remove them from your your platform do you remember what's his name from and by the way I'm not arguing I know I know porting for people online to understand this is to the Kansas pastor what's his name he died Kansas pastor we talked on the radio once that just church something Baptist Church and he would go to funerals of uh Oh Phelps yeah yeah yeah yeah and he would go there and say the reason your son died is because gays are around yeah I knew Bruins a child who died my fags calm yeah and not and these weren't gay soldiers just soldiers right it's horrible hmm and then other people had to do things like create a blockade around their cars and say give us tickets will eventually move but the funeral will be over yeah man that's sucky behavior you can't stop it from doing it okay seems of public discourse yeah so go to CBS and say that and say like well we can take you down because you've said things that are totally untrue right what about the guy who gets caught smoking weed in Iowa's legal state in uh in Alabama could you fire from that yeah but that's a different thing well it goes against what we think is okay that's a slippery slope I mean if you're saying are you allowed legally yes of course but morally no I think you're a fuckin platform for speech so let all the speech in and for Cham got written up as this fuckin hateful place we're really they're just trolls and they know one of the best ways to troll is using Donald Trump well you know there was a really interesting case with 4chan that I found preposterous where they trolled Shia LeBouf oh yeah it's shy you know they took down that that podcast yes we tell us it was great it was great it was great it was hilarious go how dare you promote 4chan they're a hate group and you're like then you didn't listen we've just said that they're not a hate group yeah and you're like fuck you I don't like that interpretation fuck you nor McDonald's I like the interpretation she didn't know that lady was black okay you went real far with that but sure you can't say Roseanne wasn't racist he's like he's not saying racism is okay he goes Norma's saying I don't think she was knew that lady was black I agree with 4chan is not saying pro-trump fuck all of you pro tramp at 4chan is saying this will fuck with you let's fuck with you well they're saying fuck Shia LeBouf because he's a goof and they decided to use science and they literally they studied the stars in the sky amazing amazing truth I had someone drive around and beep their horn so they could triangulate the area where this was takes me where the airplanes were going overhead took the fuck yet took the fucking flag down and went fuck child in a day they found it somewhere in the world and the podcast was great and there was no hate involved it had nothing to do with political ideology had nothing to do with racism and nothing to do with hate and people were saying oh you're supporting 4chan you know is for chant supports Hitler now listen 4chan is just a bunch of people and it's like yet they've just said in that podcast that fortune does not support the other yeah they go trumpet fuck with people let's align that with some fucking weird frog for no reason it makes no sense right and that's now explained to me where that frog thing came from and I'm like oh you just pulled a random thing out well most of that frog thing was it was fun yeah and there was a few instances of that frog which were racist or KKK versions or Nazi versions and then people decided that whole frog races but the swastika seems all over Indonesia as a good luck sign different different case the vast majority of the use of that frog was not racist the vast majority was feels bad man yeah it was silly trolling it was just being silly yeah yeah and then there was like you can't land it you can't let people co-op the Frog mm-hmm you know an NPR I think it was NPR podcast it might have been I'm not sure what the company was they were like yeah we'll take it down you can still have it it's still on like use regular radio lab okay yeah and they're like sorry about that we'll take it down still on YouTube I just heard it well after was taken downloaded it and then when I went to send people to it I found out on the show on the podcast that it had been taken down and I was like you gotta be I think the iTunes version is down but you can still get other places but for them to apologize is Mead saying okay you're weak you're allowed to take that down right but for someone else to come in and say you can't make podcasts anymore right is like really dangerous good point and that could have happened from that if someone had said no we're not going to take it down so a radio lab is now I hate monger right exactly their support they support for chan for Chancellor Hitler radio labs support Taylor yeah I mean this is this is a circular logic yeah so the only answer is you have to have a strong line unless is causing direct physical damage to someone you it's everything's allowed well what Dave there the Internet's a horrible it's a great place to though you should have never fucking taken that down nope they should have been like did you listen to it and laugh so hard or they told him how they got together in a trolling guys actually use science oh my kind of logic these think these are smart fucking people that figured out where that flag was Shia LeBouf hilarious it was such a good podcast but meanwhile by the way me talking about it on on people like I can't believe you don't get it you know you you're fucking you always have all these white supremacists on are you all right are you this I mean every day people will tweet at me with stupid shit like that and that one podcast me saying how great that podcast was in particular people saying what the fuck is wrong with Joe Rogan you know I used to think he was a good guy now I think he's a white supremacist he's a fucking racist he's a KKK person yeah I guess it's so stupid one of my favorite books maybe my favor I don't like to use that word favorite but like The Fountainhead sign round and people go like oh you're socialists you know she took fucking social security in her old age she never did and I'm like okay okay and I used to sharing it and I ran all the time myself and then I realized I've actually never read a book read The Fountainhead and it changed my life like not even a little bit it's a direction of my career I said I'm sorry it freed me as an artist you know so you got to read it bro but it's it's it's all about how I read a chapter of it like 15 me a year and a half to read yeah it's every chapter I'd sit down I think about her for two weeks when I read that the the and Jordan Peterson talks about her as a as a philosopher he doesn't like her as a novelist she he's like she's great what what was about it shows you a true artist and it shows you a jobber and the job yeah like pro wrestling style sort of somebody's just like doing it for the money as opposed to her a pure like Abby Abby Martin howdy Harris what's her name which one the journalist having Lauren Ivy Martin where she's like oh I don't want to just take money for reporting I want to actually real report now yes so she's a ton of a true artist at least in that moment and none of us can be a fully true artist and none of us are really just full jobbers we all have a little bit of artistic taste even the jobbers have the fucking a little bit of like I'm just I'm interesting you know and the full artist it's just it's almost an impossible 100% ideal but if you can only aim for that if a sponsor says we need you to fucking tone it down to realize like fuck I just gave up another four grand no sorry I can't hear you anymore I hate this that's what fuck you money is all about sort of yeah but this guy didn't have fucking money in the foul this guy's like I'll go back help mics I'll go back to open mics you can't take away my ability to freely do this no matter what so it freed me in terms of like being able to think that way who's really really informative to me but if I just heard these people going fuck her she's a socialist and then you read it like oh I'm not getting what you're saying out of this I'm missing this amazing stuff mmm so the people who'll just say fuck you for channes hate mongers it's like you didn't really even you're not even listening to what they're actually doing well as soon as you eliminate nuance and you have reductionist ideology right you just want to reduce something - oh he's racist oh he's hateful always this he's that that that is the that's where ideas go to die because you you you eliminate what is what it is to be a human what else to be a human is to be constantly conflicted to deal with a bunch of different contrary ideas bouncing around your head left and right all the time you know and if you if you want to eliminate the ability to talk to people that you don't agree with boy you're living in a fucking bizarre bubble because you're not going to agree with yourself five years from now most likely yeah I mean if I had an argument today fifteen years ago I'd be like yeah man you're a fucking dumbass yeah you need to stop thinking this way you need to stop doing this you need to look at yourself more objectively I mean really what else you like why I think that and just that listen I mean the fact it was so divisive but like no one listens to the side I'll give the easiest argument to me as abortion where it's like Oh both sides are pro-life the idea of life and both sides are also pro-choice no one that gets choice but you're not hearing the other side so one side is saying it's a woman's right to choose her body it's her choice it's like okay but yes it's her body but it ain't a tattoo there's you know there's more to it than just her body right and then the other side it's like it's a human life like okay yes it's a life but also this chick has to carry it for nine months she's got to change her whole body in order to carry it it's not just simply it's a life Dasani they're going in and murdering babies it's in Akuma so can you guys actually talk can you guys really talk and own up to like it's no more than just one side ground yeah right the people with the pro-choice are saying no it's a woman's right to choose and the people that are pro-life so you know you're killing a baby yeah and if you give up any ground the babies are gonna die take away a woman's right to have an abortion and she's gonna have to carry a bunch of kids from people that raped her I mean this this is the worst case scenario and extremes on both ends yeah as a Booker as a former Booker it's someone who books a show they're like you need more women's like oh I'm looking hard but you have to understand that I'm not gonna hurt my product over I do want diversity I want diversity of opinion on there I want to perceive experience I want some Australian so I want some looking black people Ali Siddiq is a far different life experience than I do right you know forget about my race just his life experience is way different you know all ECD can Byron bowers both black guys gives a far different world view yeah you know so I do want that diversity of experience but I'm not gonna hurt my problem I can get some shitty guy who just was in prison doesn't that tell a story right so I'll work hard but meet me halfway I will do it but find me quality people yeah so I'll go to suck in Atlanta and find miss Pat but I'll go I have to go far for it so if somebody cancels on my show and now I have five white guys don't be like fuck you look into a little more just have two chicks cancel so meet me halfway well whenever you're looking for diversity as opposed to looking for the best possible product you've got an issue yeah opinion that is but but it should be good and there's no reason why the two are mutually exclusive mm-hmm like the idea that there's only a certain limited amount of good ideas that come mostly from white people's ridiculous yeah right so there's plenty of ideas that will come from Asians and plenty of ideas that come from all sorts of different ethnicities that are also excellent so it's just finding them but when you guarantee that you're gonna have five of this and five of that that's when you're gonna have a real fucking yeah so I had my friends my friend Colette said that what they're doing in the in the in the business world is they're taking what their industry is the numbers of let's say men and women only to forget on black and white and Latino whatever jazz men and women they're taking the number of people in that industry and in order to correct an overuse of males to say or the other way overuse of females in like artistic training you know but let's just say in the business world its 70/30 to make met up okay so what you do is they forced you instead of has faced where California is like you must put a woman on your board yes which means like okay if we just we had three board members one left and we have to hire a woman now wait bill gates just became available he wants to work on our board can Hiram can't hire him that's hurting my company he got a he's great he's great yeah so what they said is in order to correct it they will interview at a ten percent higher rate than the industry numbers so that they'll be exposed slightly to more of the people that are underrepresented and over time that would correct the issue without hurting any company and here well let me hear why you think you're right for the job and eventually you will like wow she was actually really good that's actually hot here or there but if it's still Bill Gates you probably don't get the job over him he's got his fucking he's got his resume well that's where Jordan Peterson comes in with this equality of outcome idea argument and the equality of outcome argument is it's a dangerous argument if you guarantee equality of outcome but I want to hear your intent that women are going to make exactly the same amount as men and so even if the man works harder the women is still gonna make the same amount of money that's ridiculous yeah and vice versa company the NFL said you have to interview I mean we're predominantly black you have to interview interview not hire interview one black candidate before you hire somebody so at least these people get heard and sometimes you go like that guy was actually pretty fuckin good let's really consider him and then they get hired a little more until just shifts the needle why but only qualify people right but the ideally what you would want is no racism right no racism no sexism that's ideal not to have to make some laws for it yeah but we're not in that world that's not where we look but it would be nice yeah that would be what we really were sure would really want is this is never an issue at all you're only getting people that are great at it and that way we if if if racism was not an issue at all there's no racism whatsoever what you would say is oh look it seems like Asian people gravitate towards this it seems like people of this color or this culture rather gravitate towards this activity and I wonder why that is instead of instead of saying why don't you hire more white people you'd say it seems like white people aren't really interested in that job either the cleaners the cleaners in New York is the Barry Asian job yes well you're not like you need to hire white people you need to hire black people's job that's what nobody cares yeah nobody cares but if it was a CEO of large financial institutions you would say this is ridiculous that it's all this not that ideally it would be a fascinating social experiment or a social observation to find out what genders what sexual orientation what race what jet what ethnicities gravitate towards specific jobs if those jobs didn't have a hierarchy of desire right if there wasn't some jobs that are far more desirable yeah I mean one of the arguments I had really early on in Hollywood was with this guy who was a really nice guy but he was Asian and he was saying there's no fucking roles for Asian actors this is bullshit and I was like okay why don't you make rolls it's like it's not that easy I go I get it I understand that it's not that easy but do you think that someone should have to write an Asian leading man because you have a hard time getting a job right like what should they do like how should it there's no rules for ugly people right it's true like what about you know what about people who are dwarves you know snow there's very few jobs for the very few and the one guy's killing it what that one guy's dominating that game of thrones do what you do like what what would you do to correct that is the question it's not whether or not the world is fair the world's not fair there's no five-foot tall white guys that are playing in the NBA that's not fair either yeah there's weird shit that just happens to be reality like what do you do to correct that and you know he was really adamant that Hollywood is racist they're not not hiring Asians to be leading men and Asians that I'm like okay I see how it'd be frustrating for you as an actor but if you've if you're a screenwriter and you're a guy who writes a story about a white guy moves into a haunted house and you know he falls in love with this woman and they buy a house together and the house winds up being haunted in his monsters you're saying should you should someone have to change that to an Asian guy so that you get a job yeah it's also simplistic because it's like it's not not hearing the other the other argument say okay sure that guy could be anymore right okay that guy could be any any race right but if me I'm not Hollywood I'm a guy making this one movie right and if I cast an Asian I'm probably going to make far less money than if I cast a guy who looks like most of the movie ticket purchasers which is a white guy or a famous person which not sure absolutely so then it's like you want me to correct what Hollywood is but I'm not Hollywood I'm just this producer for this movie that become that's something that my friend Frankie Renzulli said to me once he said there's no Hollywood right there that's what I said about the AIDS cure though doctors have the cure but they make more they make more money in in selling off the treatment off the treatment but I'm like but there's no such thing as doctors no doctor's group so if one doctor had it he would be a billionaire right if he just released the cure well this is the main problem with conspiracy theory is that everyone's working together thinking everyone's working together as a part of some grand thing to keep the knowledge that the worlds flat away from the general public like that kind of stupidity but that comes from a lack of understanding of how human beings interact with each other and about how magnificent a discovery so gigantic would be to the one person that exposed it that person is gonna keep their mouth shut for what fucking reason what that's nonsense I will say with that in mind there is a thing that when you interview a white lady or a black dude for a job a lot of times your predispositions towards those races or genders go in and go like I don't respect you as much as your mind is there I kind of like disrespect you although I don't think you have the brain that someone who looks different has so now you're like not letting them get the part or get the job they would have gotten not the part the hell it was so car doesn't work but a job cause like ah really you're smart no way a woman's gonna do the best job get the fucking yeah we never see like an actor who goes on to like write and direct his own thing like what cuz most actors are fucking idiots right and when you see when it's actually intelligent like I would not expect that from you and then have it's also with race and gender so that you do want to correct yes well that's what Billy Bob Thornton did with sling blade he couldn't get jobs made his own so he decided this crazy character I'm gonna swingers exactly John Favreau no they decided to make his own movie wrong key yeah I mean sort of he just made sure he played and they wrote it and he wrote it yeah but you did go to a major yeah studio but you you can't mandate creativity creativity is a different element because like look how many fucking books is Stephen King written about main yeah like it's every other book it's about main you can't tell him he can't write a book about main because people from Kenosha Wisconsin are upset and they think that you're you know your location is but I do like what they do in the UK in there like the first year of Black Mirror which was uk-based mm-hmm they don't they just let black guys play roles it's not they're not playing black person they're just like there's mixed-race couples they're just they're just people they're way further along than we are in terms of that in terms their social consciousness of the zeitgeist in general they don't see racism English English English you know they say they see they see Indians and Pakistanis stuff like that they see that race really hard still we actually probably see that less but in terms of black and white there which is way more like okay there's people right that's interesting yeah cuz they don't have a history of slavery like we do maybe Serbs stopped earlier I'm not sure I mean way back they had the more in Shakespeare but like I don't know it's just not as bad as us right for whatever reason I'm not really sure the causes but then people black guys can just play a role he was there arguing about that with with black mirror that I found was kind of silly someone was saying oh I'm upset about a black mirror because it's like every show has a woman lead in every show I go step away and look at the shows they're fucking fantastic is that good yeah why do you but that's someone who is so upset by this whole idea of diversity and enforced diversity that they're looking for it even when it's not relevant because the actual work itself is so good she's like you shouldn't say the new Ghostbusters sucker's was all women you just say the new Ghostbusters sucked because no one was calling for a remake of it right and it sucked or Star Wars the new Star Wars like when you had Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern were like the major generals and like what no this doesn't even work like maybe it doesn't work because it wasn't written well and because they didn't really pull it off but you're telling me you couldn't have some badass chick like Sigourney Weaver when she was in aliens who dominated the film and nobody gave a fuck that she was the lead I mean look how good the blonde chick is from Game of Thrones perfect you know and Circe's yes they like Derek so no words like no yeah what a it's a when thinks of them as women they're just like strong characters yeah Omar from the wire who was gay and black like no one came right because it was just like you nailed it yeah but then how do you you have to like like not see it and black who's gonna be great in this and also give a representation of you can't make all the gangsters white because it'd be unrealistic right well you know I mean we've seen this in comedy too right we've seen there's a difference between enforced diversity and people who just happen to be diverse but are brilliant true and we've seen this where they're trying to enforce like certain aspects is they say no but mustaches you're gonna make your product worse yeah well we I mean how many times have we seen this and people will say hey you know why are there more women at the Comedy Store why aren't there more this why aren't there more that whoops oh yeah that way that lady who said like Whitney Cummings only got three spots last month explain that like wait what you're doing is accusing but if you're actually asking why do what he coming and get three spots last month is because Whitney Cummings called in for three spots last month yeah she gets every spot she wanted she will tell you that if you ask to her face she's one of the ones who were you yeah you don't get you don't call in and not get a spot there's certain people get the spots they want yeah so she's one of them yeah so the answer is she's busy she has yeah exactly the answer sexism there yeah well that's nonsense though that that kind of thinking he almost always comes from people who suck if you look at their art they're almost always bad mm-hmm that's just a fact they want leza about this recently it's not new it made me realize same thing when Dane Cook got big people like oh because good-looking and that was a bunch of sucky guys who weren't killing every set like Dane was sure and they were going there must be a reason other than it's on me right why I'm not as big as him you know how about the good-looking thing that's off me I have no control over there and it's really like dude that guy kills 19 times out of 20 and you killed 2 out of 20 yeah like can you possibly say it could be based on that so it's the people that are complaining or almost never doing well anyway so this is why they complaining I think I mean what's what's going yeah you're not gonna hear certain people you're gonna hear Bill burr complaining about other people don't sure he'll said it it goes I mean black comics who do well they're all successful hugely you guys if you're doing well on stage consistently as a black comic there's no question you'll be you'll be doing a you'll be making dr. money he didn't say that but like that's what it is that's what it is yeah well comedy in many ways is very very egalitarian in that way it laughs you know yeah I mean you are what you are you know you're really funny or you're not and there's black rooms for black comedies something's like so like I mean that doesn't relate to certain white audiences like I just can't figure it out but his rooms for them there's a lot the Mexican rooms will they do half their punchlines in Spanish that wouldn't play or a comedy store but it would play in certain audiences when Diaz used to do Miami he would do Spanglish yeah he would have his punchlines would be in Spanish and people would follow their fucking chair laughs and if they understood it and if you were a white guy we didn't swear fuck yeah good jump out a window that was another thing oh you're dirty that's why you're successful that's a man just start crushing and this won't be an issue yeah well that was a nonsense issue too like I don't want to follow someone dirty yeah why not yeah why what difference does it have yeah but this idea that like I'm not getting a hook as a reason it's not new I just realized this has been going on as a reason to be like off me why I'm not doing well yeah and it doesn't I think the real sexism especially for women is having to work with a bunch of people that are trying to fuck you all the time especially I think at open mics when you're already ready to quit anyway yeah you're about ready to quit and now this fucking these creeps are around and there's no one to talk to what might have caused the coffee shop on the homeless I mean for real yeah people line up for open mics there's a giant percentage of them that are out of their fucking mind so if you're some girl who already feels vulnerable around men to begin with because you're smaller and you know that and you're of you're a target further there's no like manager to go talk to this guy's fuckin can you walk in my cars no rules you know sign up there's 30 other people sign up you wait around for your name to be called if you're lucky you get three minutes and you're still no matter what five years away from making a dollar so it's like you know what fuck it I'm done if Mary Lynn Rajskub today gets harassed she's not gonna quit I'm still making money right you know she might not come to the store anymore if nobody does anything about it but people would do sort of there's a place to go to for like Hayden to get rid of this guy the Saudis member can't come anymore and that's just comedy I mean with any job unlike the real issue they're worth well also with men man are fucking stupid okay if you're working with a man and you're nice that man he assumes you want to fuck him because this out this is evolution this monkey that's my arm it's like a woman is like kind to a guy and get some coffee the guy thinks she wants to suck his dick because it's stupid because this is how we're programmed we're programmed to think that women who are nice to us if that woman is attractive she must be sending a signal she wants sexual attention it can't just be some completely platonic workplace situation that's not possible because eight hours a day when you're working with someone you develop feelings and thoughts and ideas about that person I realized that when we were doing the nasty show in Montreal and there's all these young interns some of them women and you know young people are cuter than old people talk to every magazine and you get this idea and you're there a week early from everybody else in a ski show starts way earlier so you pretty much the only english-speaking show while the French stuff is going on and these interns come out and you're like oh I think I can fuck one of them and then it hit me like oh wait there's also male interns who are also showing up to the shows and you're like oh they're all just comedy fans hmm and I'm reading in these women must be flirting whereas they're coming when they're exhibiting the exact literally the exact same behavior as the men who are coming right coming to like I want to hang out with the comedian yeah and they might want to hook up they might not but I'm putting something on them only because their gender and then it's like okay step back you can't fuck any of these people right yeah and that's must be what it's like if you're the manager of an office and there's a cute woman who works for you and a guy who's fat and gross and they're both exhibiting the exact same friendly behavior towards you you don't assume the fat guy wants to suck your dick right and then and then also it's like if you can still hook up but they have to do all the work the underling has to do all the pushing you even though I don't think you can in an office environment I think if the underling keeps pushing there and they don't get push hard they have to push you could be what are you doing this weekend everybody you want to move you want to come like I'm sure anybody else want to cut like you have to like really not pushed and put them in that position mmm yeah and there's people gonna take advantage of that on both sides yeah and even the female side it's a friend of mine who works at Vice and he was talking to me about this woman who was making these like really obvious well advances uh-huh she was trying to have sex with him and he contacted one of the other guys that he works with that was also there and he's like do not fuck her like she is upwardly mobile like what she was doing she's trying to fuck her way up to the top she did it to this guy and then she called sexual harassment on him after she flirted with him some fucking some advanced that she shouldn't have and some nonsense when our people are political some people are very calculated and some people are sociopaths and they exist with vaginas they exist with penises it's just this is part of being a person there's some people that are just bad people but there's also some women who like power and that's not wrongly theirs and so it's like oh you're a manager right it's all justifiably makes me want to fuck you a little more and so that's okay too yeah and well there's some women also that like being in power and we hate those women but we don't hate the men who like to be in power that's a weird thing to like a woman who wants a run shit really this crazy bitch want to run everything whereas a guy who wants to run shit seems totally normal yeah I will say it's a bigger wrong it's like what do you most likely want to avoid you know and it seems like a bigger wrong for someone to have to like worry about getting fucking not just being able do their job yeah versus oh this chick wants to sleep with me because she wants to get ahead yeah well that's easy to avoid it's for the guides there's no physical threat anyways I feel like well I got my ass grabs like and you could ended it anytime you want it's not the same stop it I mean in last year it's like really a mess and you know you're just vulnerable psychologically physically all the above you're an aberration yeah you're an aberration yeah yeah yes I don't know how to correct it but we were lucky we don't have to work with people all day man be people in a fucking office environment that are working around people all day and people have some weird shit and then you go to the company Christmas party and some guy who works with your wife says some creepy shit to you cuz no he's been like he's been coveting your wife behind your back and you know he wants her and you know he's he talks shit about you to her and she tells you and that kind of shit is so normal man because you think about how many do ours are in a day yeah 24 hours in a day eight of them you're sleeping okay so how much time is commuting how much time is work most of your day is at work so you're luxuries are not with your spouse yeah you might not hook up with them but you're interacting with them and then yeah do you think with people sometimes talk about me too going too far but let's talk about for a second like me to going the right level do you think and we don't work in office job so we're just guessing right you think sexual harassments are down now and last year I think men who are creeps are probably a little more cautious I remember after them and see a video people all over open mikes were calling each other out on it yeah and then occasionally it was a question of it went too far we're like you stole that joke for me is like two we both talked about the same movie you're trying to write me off my whole career off because I talked about you know whatever dance with wolves and so are you but your thing was about the Native Americans your thing was about the fucking you know the dog they had and so I'm sure wants you far here there but was nice where it like it was no longer acceptable to steal jokes yes and it wasn't just something we're gonna tolerate right it's gotta be like that too with this me to stuff it's no longer acceptable that fucking patent ass exactly it would I just wanted and everyone else even the guys like dude no dude I couldn't imagine being a man were rather that's it I couldn't imagine being a woman working for a man who wanted to fuck me and me getting a raise me getting some sort of upward movement in my careers dependent upon this person making a decision and this person is always trying to fuck me it'll be too gusting and that's what a lot of women have to deal with all day long and that's only one step of it how about the fucking Bill Cosby step how about you can't release your fucking drink alone you can't leave your drink that's a reality with a lot of women that's not a reality with you or me no one's trying to rape us I mean there's a lot of shit women have to think about that we don't have to think about a lot many many many many many many many things yeah it is interesting this now is all coming up like what how many of you had something it's worse than I thought to cause like you just want to believe the best in the world and people and so when you like the second no that can't happen that much it's not like you're the problem you're not doing it you just don't want to believe that's what's so removed you don't believe some kid can get chopped up by some you know some monster right like no right yeah we're remover we don't see it as much it's not the key directed us so they've been fucked up worlds men our world is everybody smokes pot almost everybody drinks yeah you know everybody's a deviant everybody is impossible for them to have a regular job every single one of us that's successful as a comic it's virtually impossible for any of us to have ever existed in an office environment and survived yeah we're too fucked up but we're perfect for comedy you know I mean so let us us talking about office politics in office environments that's why I think it's funny when people say like talk about Louie or something where it's like it was a Comedy Festival so it was it was at their job but it's like oh no no no no you just don't understand what the safety issue if it was a workplace then then you would have to say like by the way actually do people do coke at the workplace right our job people actually consensually fuck doing work yeah at our workplace like that happens to a lot of pot smoking at our workplace yeah like it's not it's not it's our workplace has a designated pot smoking place and now where we are you're in the green room you can't fuck with anybody but you can you can't smoke yeah it's not a it's not a place it's not well it's less you should still have the rights of safety but it ain't a workplace well and you should it's all like here's the thing like say if you're Tom and Christina no you're married together yeah you could fuck in the green room absolutely locked the door and who's gonna stop you so you could fuck at the workplace yeah yeah you could that's not an issue look people fucking the groom all the time yeah that beat it this girls coming up but you can't fuck if you know you're the manager and she's a secretary and you pull her into your office you get fired for that even if it's your wife you know about do that a real work you can't fuck it what fuck at work when we're Constanza got fired because is that not allowed what do you do at work fuck the mate and then they were like we caught you on camera that's Oh what was that a problem I didn't realize it's finalized way out of it yeah yeah well I think people listening more and it's slow and I think it the the the conversation gets sidetracked when you you you hit on punishment too much when someone people hit on punishment like this person needs to go away it said can we get back to the fucking same thing with Michael Vick it's when you're talking about whether he should pull out of a football it's like now you've sidetracked me from just saying don't kill dogs yeah I'm on your side but like oh now you've sidetracked me to go no no he should be live like football that has nothing to do with it let's just get back always to the argument like let's make it safer for chicks in the workplace let's not let a black guy not get hired when he's deserving right you know let's fix that stuff the punishment side tracks is you can still talk about it but not when you're emotional I think one thing that we've come within this conversation is that jobs suck drops do so no one should have them because if you have them people want to fuck you that you work with yeah I think that's the that's the solution when it's like men need to shut up it's like oh well then we can't help you or hurt you if you those people are just there's fringe there's loud fringe people like you know that's just one one of my favorite tweets that I saved from this feminist woman that said all white males are trash and less proven otherwise okay great that what you want our help so okay good luck with that unless proven otherwise is it that's a ridiculous way to look at things you know what if a man said that all women are constantly proving otherwise that's a bad person well it's also like the answer - I don't know white dudes have been in charge forever is not fuck these people over who I wasn't here for forever white people just need to stop talking yeah and it's like okay that's but the answer is lack of racism lack of sex yes complete lack even in judging white people even in judging white males even in judging white males in a position of power like there should be no racism there should be no discrimination and it should be a presidential candidate early early last time like how do you feel a black lives matter you hadn't heard about it yet no yeah what he was super progressive it's like if course block last man a whole lives matter where he tie yeah and like you can't that's it logo for the slogan for the other side and they're like wrote him off and he's like but isn't no bunch of fucking three words summation of the whole argument yeah black lives matter or all lives matter and Bernie Sanders said black lives matter and he said why and people like oh you're super progressive we love you Bernie you're playing by the rules that we've established and you saying the things that we make you say yeah well of course all lives matter but black lives matter as well so the yellow lives matter also it's two fits two and can crazy to it doesn't work as a slogan if you go hey we need to figure out why black people are getting shot at a higher rate and their percentages than white people by cops so we need to like curb that immediately we need to make it somewhere where you can actually trust the police to represent you all and not have a fear of them it's like that's not a slogan you throw out right but if you said that then nobody's gonna like I'm a super deep and complex conversation about systemic racism and communities where like in Baltimore where they literally established zones where black people couldn't buy homes yeah and now you're gonna sum up the three words this is you've got giant cultural issues that should be addressed on literally a nationwide scale yeah like we're interested in building nations and helping people in Afghanistan and and the giving aid to Saudi Arabia and all these different we're fill in the blank with whatever I'm sure it is how the fuck are they not fixing the southside of Chicago yeah I mean how the fuck are they not fixing Baltimore how they not want to Compton Flynt the fucking water still drinkable goddamnit Elon Musk has to step in and say he's gonna fix your water and by the way you and I what we have no idea about the backstory to it and how to fix it we have opinions and our opinions are worth us they're just worthless as no solutions or neither one of us have any skin in the game we're talking out of our ass but but we're not doing really wrong to people we're not hurting anybody but if we look want to look at things objectively that is a real valid argument a real valid point of discussion it's like sure black lives matter but you know what else matters really bad communities that have been bad for decade after decade after decade and they're not being addressed by any politicians they're not being addressed by any community leaders no one is stepping in and saying hey before we do anything involving any other country we've got to fix all the problems we have right here and they can be fixed they can be fixed and it might take decades it might take years I don't know how long it's gonna take but it's not gonna be fixed at all if we do nothing right I mean that's also part of this argument it goes too far as the pendulum was here and we want it back in the middle it's just gonna have to swing a little too far and then come back when we're talking about me too and and sexual harassment and rape and all this stuff I think one of the things that we're dealing with is information distribution of information is occurring at a rate that's unprecedented it's never been like this before yeah and I think there's a real step that's gonna happen with human beings where you're not you're gonna be able to literally read minds and this is gonna happen through some sort of emerging with humans and technology Elon Musk believes it's gonna be this thing that he's releasing something in the next few months called neural link and this neural link is going to somehow or another increase the bandwidth between people and information at a rate that's going to literally change what a human being is and the way he was explaining it was very vague but you know when you're talking about a guy like Elon Musk and the the insane ideas that he has bouncing around inside his fucking robot brain yeah I believe him and I believe this is one step just like no one could have had ever predicted the Internet in 19 you know 60 no one ever would have thought other than I think Malcolm McLuhan had some people had some notice of this yeah some people had some ideas of what what could possibly happen but no one no average person saw this comment and I think no average person is gonna see these next stages of integration between human beings and technology and one of them is going to be some sort of a translation device some sort of a translation device that translates not just languages but thoughts and a universal language that is its defies economic boundaries political boundaries geographic boundaries something that everyone's gonna be able to understand like the real product our of Babel argument is that you know if someone's talking in Bangladesh and someone's talking in Japan if someone's talking in America there's so many different ways of saying things it's too hard to understand them all no one knows all the languages right any nuance oh yeah there's so much translated the stranger four sentences and it's in French I think but it's its mother died yesterday or was it the day before I can't be sure and they have to have arguments about she used mother she's mom should use mama like which one is the actually meaning in French to not just get like a sterile one but like a normalize once I can't like it's it's beyond just translation so yeah so go ahead and I think this is one of the giant problems with whenever you're dealing with nationalism whenever you're dealing with this idea of the other that someone from another place is different than you different yeah kids in Yemen's lives don't matter nearly as much as I don't know yeah I'm not getting hired sure is a perfect example because they're using drones to launch missiles into a country that we're not even supposed to be a war with kids yeah not insurgents mm-hmm yeah a six year old little girl is dead times a thousand right but you know if one died because like but it's not okay it's not happening in Chicago or San Francisco we just know it drones launching into the East Village so because that's not happening we don't think of it as a concern of ours yeah and this I think these hurdles these are informational hurdles as much as their geographical herd and their language hurdles and these are these are hurdles of understanding and I think as our realm of understanding expands and we get a better understanding of the idea that we really are just human beings in different places and that you are no different than me and I'm no different from some kid who lives in China and that we're all just human beings and whatever our differences are they pale in comparison to our similarities and also the random chance that you were born in Maryland and I was born in New Jersey so there's randomness and this idea that you take pride in that is so foolhardy and so ridiculous and the idea that somehow another we're on some sort of a tribe and this is something that human beings will cling to for security and safety and we go with tribe left and tribe right and we go with tribe progressive and tribe conservative and we go with tribe American tribe Canada and tribe Mexico it's all foolishness and I think as technology expands that will be more and more preposterous and you're starting to see this with even the the way people view religion if you look to people from just a few decades ago how many people in this country thought they were how many identified as atheist it's quite a bit less than today I'm quite a bit more identified with today because you start to understand more about religion there's Google people can and Bill Maher and Sam Harris were actually talking about this on a podcast recently because they were talking about the 10th anniversary of Religulous Bill Maher's documentary and they made a really good point that Google came along and when Google came along people were allowed to then research the history of Mormonism where they never really could before and they go wait he was 14 in 1820 and Joseph Smith was just a kid and he made up a bunch of find me a 14 year old it's not bullshit that's way more impressive and then Scientology and and and many of the you know many of the chapters in the Bible when people look at the difference between the New Testament the Old Testament who wrote it and why and and how many passages were removed and edited by human beings so how you decide the work of God like what gets to be released and what's not yeah all that stuff is it's man it's kindling for the fire of enlightenment and in that fire spreading and I think that it's an informational tool and these this yeah I think that's enlightenment is that's a bad term fire enlightenment but when you realize just like me too when it really does get out like wow I didn't realize right and we think about how many women you like they were talking about this a long time ago and you're like come on yeah and you're like man relax honey yeah exactly like that's okay I know you're like fuck I guess it is really bad well the Cosby's the Cosby thing I remember hearing about that when I was at Newsradio yeah I was always a thing like I guess I don't know man think about it like in terms of my real terms that's a purse actress yeah or if like that was my sister who went through that or my mom that's another reason to wear I'll try to put myself in the place I'm pretty good at like I'm Eve see me tell stories I got worked up you know I could put myself in a place I was or you know imagine something pretty pretty good and so it's like yeah if it was your sister your mom your girlfriend your wife daughter going through it you'd be like I'll fucking kill that guy you know it took you're so mad but then the same thing when I hear about like I don't know like Louie and it's my sister's like told me dad like he did what pubes even we're great yeah so it's like right yeah I try to put in them as a position as best I can i still don't have to go through it if it's wrong but like there's levels there's a little but also it's like getting back to it it's like you really hear about those stuff now and you're like whoa but there's also in terms of someone like Louie there's got to be a road to redemption and this is one of the problems with people that are so fucking angry is that they don't think there's any road to redemption they never play again but the Michael Vick thing is different well as Michael Vick tortured and murdered done didn't murdered murdered but to jail shift for yes he did the time that the state said you need to do this for what I did he'd served his time he's lost his freedom for four years yes yes so his job that he had before has nothing to do with it but it does come down to people going I'm not through with you suffering yet okay same thing with Lily don't think it's a difference I'm not good with you suffered you represent kill evil to women torturing toys is different do you represent evil to women just cuz you beat off he's a representative of that / they're not of course you're just creeper but like not even that I don't think but like but like pervert I guess what are you I don't know miss actually deviant you hang out with two girls who are like talking dirty to you for two days you go on drinks with them you start getting like the idea it's like I think I'm gonna hook up but I think I might have a threesome and they're like that it's not enough reason that go for it's like yeah you're right I got any more signs like well let me say you want to go out for drinks and I do and sex still no it's not on the first of the signs like yeah you're right you're right oh I know all about I'm about to my hotel room that's usually pretty Universal sign and they're coming there came to my hotel room no that's not enough you're right you're right you're right all these signs is not enough tell you what I'll just ask outright can I fucking jerk-off in front of you and they said yes no that's still not enough what are you talking about well here's the so no not creeper but he represents things to people it's just like Roseanne represented Trump when she said she has a character voted for Trump in diction in the show so because they're representative evil against women they go just get rid of that representative right and they're not seeing him as a human being that people actually know right that is a human as a person not only that if someone says yes if you ask can I beat off in front of you and they say yes and then never say no no I was just kick just leave the yes out there Jesus we're done here we're done did you say yes okay so like if a girl says can I can i play with my pussy in front of you and you go yeah and then she does he go well that was fucking disgusting and I can't believe this happened and I'm going right to the press like wait a minute did you say yes yeah like okay here's one thing is if this is an aggressive angry person who traps you to room you flash your only way you can get out the only way you can get out of this rooms you let this guy beat off in front of you and you've you fearful of your life people don't really most people don't really care I saw him on stage everyone conflict crazy they were so happy and when he goes I guys I'm just gonna do jokes tonight everyone's like fuck yes yeah just to joke see jokes we just want to see what we loved about you two years ago yeah ten months ago yeah and Michael Vick we just want you to see you throw we're done with that you did your crime or we still hate you there's nothing would look like Richards how you got your job you just got yelled out racist shit but like but like nobody nobody saw nobody liked him on stage but the thing yeah you're right so it's like missing about Louie is you know you there's got to be some path of redemption for everybody yeah for everybody I mean human beings very Wild Bill Cosby no not go up at a prison talent show no no no it's over pick can't even go up in a in prison no disagree no I'm kidding until you show me the connection to what he did versus this job you know I mean if you Pete Rose bet on baseball he hurt the job he was doing so that you like you can't be in baseball anymore because you fucked over baseball but did he fuck over baseball by betting on it yeah he'd they show he liked probably through some games or he like use his relievers and in situations he wouldn't have that he can't use them tomorrow because you fucked over baseball that fucks so you baseball huh shut its doors to you right if you steal jokes yes maybe there is a path to redemption maybe but you fucked over jokes well you fucked over other comics yes so you slipped over the experience you're talking about getting back with you but that guy can go to the supermarket yes he can work at another job because it has nothing you haven't show me a connection to another job see the thing about the joke stealing thing and this is where it gets really really weird is there's no real punishment other than people deciding they don't like you because you're a joke thief that is the real punishment like your time why can't we take you down it's like no no what I'm saying is it's different than someone who steals cars right someone steals cars as a punishment set up yeah you go to jail to legal if someone steals jokes like you basically done the same thing you're stolen a thing and you know the thing is ethereal the thing sort of yeah you saw a little done because you can still do your jokes if I see their car you can't have your car if somebody goes on in front of you like we know Mencia did and does your headline your closing bit I'm purposed on purpose to fuck with you he would do closing bits is Freddie fucking with Bobby once and he was like oh you're gonna love him he would fuck with Bobby Bobby Lee yeah but it wasn't ideal yeah it was to fuck with Bobby what he said you're gonna love his next guy he's so funny and Bobby all he wanted was Freddie support he looked up to him so hard and couldn't ever get it you're gonna love this next guy he does this joke about selling corn the side of the road he's like young cool any cooler yells so good he has a subtle bit about about his bits he would just tell the put up ending punchlines I wasn't bit - yeah just pull his legs out from under him that's a terrible thing I mean he was fucking with him but he wasn't doing to gain himself only to hurt Bobby and only in one moment that I ever saw but it was like fuck you got me bad mmm yeah I mean they were bitter enemies it was like sound about writing routing them out to somebody a long time before was the arguments way yeah it's done but like they hated each other back then mmm Freddie hated Bobby Bobby hated him back only because the thing about people getting caught it's like the punishments real though it's almost better than going to jail yeah it's like we don't we know about you now not only do we know about you now but the public knows about you now and the disdain is palpable yeah it's real and you see it not just with him not just with you can see it but here's a few of them and you can tell the difference - between somebody going that guy took that guy's joke versus that guy takes jokes mm-hmm you know I mean that's out there and that's real right but doesn't quite stick as much as like we all just know that guy steals jokes right you know yeah possible like it's like over and over again like there's such a clarity - in the difference between the jokes they come up with on their own and the jokes that they steal I'm sure you can keep going up you can still sell out theaters so your punishment is we know about you okay you can't sell out theaters though that's what happens to them eventually but a lot of them still do name one then coke continued to sell at theaters well he does those things dog they're all dried off eventually but a lot of people die off too but during wala was happening there was no real he was still doing massive numbers Mencia is still doing living better than most a level comics even after all I mean even right now actually he still makes more money than Mike Vecchio does you know then really good comments in big J does you know probably still makes more money than I do to be honest you know what I'm doing his core ideas I've ever done but like so it's like it's a completely you'll never get the respect of your peers that's a big deal with us why we're talking about this in the back of the comedy store I was talking about a bunch of shit he was going through and splitting up and all this and that Eagles listen at the end of the day all I give a fuck about do I have the love and respect of my peers yeah and those guys don't have it and it fucking drives them crazy so you can take jokes and do whatever but like we're never gonna look up to you and that's what you want yeah you know that nobody hates Larry nobody hates Larry I think he's like lame but nobody hates him Larry the Cable yeah it's a great that's great guy I want one more story before we go this is a brilliant MMA podcast is kind of not what it is yeah I did this thing you helped me like organize a little or arrange in my head where I was really stoked on the experience la people have with medical marijuana and I said it's not fair that other people don't get to have this experience of taking these breast strips out of UFC how great it is and I was like I'm gonna have an event called hunt for the edible oh no and I am going to hide marijuana have a scavenger hunt at first I thought like have some clues and they'll come to me I'll give it to him like a cop will do that and come to you and like the point good point I gotta hide this so I would hide try me drugs but only marijuana one time mushrooms but like at UFC's I would have access to it beforehand when we went to the MGM for the weigh-ins half it was shut down to the other half I could just walk through freely and I would hide I would tape these breath strips to somewhere the first one is underneath the bathroom sink in a fucking in one of the bathrooms and draw clues on Twitter released them every five minutes but then that ahead of time when one was like if you want to get high go up a level and was like okay people were like run up people got into it they run up levels and then they until this guy was like I think it's right here this bathroom sink then he looked under it undid it had a note in there with the proper dosage I want to fuck anybody over hmm and it became such a fun fun time I got to assume the powers-that-be knew about it and said nothing said plausible deniability I don't know I don't care did I promote it no I tell people I don't think so yeah so how did they how do you think they knew about Twitter I might have mentioned it on the podcast or something but it was so fun for me and I would do it over and over again and then I would go back I remember looking times where I would go I would tape it to like a pillar somewhere I like the Pearl and I would go to see if it's found in order sure go like I was looking at he didn't know I was one who hit it you know he would just go what you're looking for is no longer here because I guess a bunch of people kept coming to this pillar they would follow the clues no one said angry uh sure it's somewhere no one said it's found now cut the game later I would go in and delete all the clues I'm not looking to fuck over the cops when in fact that but it was so fun one time nobody found one I was leaving like still here I'm fucking taking it off I'm using it myself but I usually I hiked two of them underneath a fuckin fire extinguisher something like that now one time somebody found it and then came down and sat like right behind me and Chandra and then these these uh sure slash security guards came and found the guy and said hey I need you to come with me and they took him out and I was like fuck he kept his about he wasn't like it was just going in front of me and I sat there for about thirty seconds and I was like I gotta go Chandra I gotta go fucking turn myself in on this Wow yeah and she was like what I'm like I'm I'm not letting this fucking kid dude if I I gotta say like no I hit it I'll figure it out and then I went up there and they're like oh no they were just in our seats because didn't you get busted in like Minneapolis or some shit yeah at the Mall of America that wasn't at UFC at the Mall of America I go you kept doing it outside sure people would be like ready roll actually never did much mushrooms was in was in Winnipeg was not at a UFC was just at comedy shows oh but the UFC experience was so fun for me to give these people the drugs that I took and I want you to experience this heavily blown out on weed experience it me and Diaz get to do and it was fun to spread that joy it really was fun was one of my favorite memories of this UFC wonder if you could do that again now that it's totally legal oh maybe you're right California and Nevada they're both legally legal legal legal Massachusetts legal legal Wow there's a bunch of states now you know and now all of Canada all of Canada that's October 17th Canada fucking went whole hog now what if I could do it salute Canada salute you bad motherfuckers yeah finally graduations that's a beautiful thing they did they made it legal before the first guy got pulled over for smoking weed in this car before you get in the car you idiot mom stupid don't be ridiculous um yeah but that was when my favorite memories of UFC's having that thing we had some good goddamn times it was funny but it took me a long time to figure out that I could combine the UFC and comedy yeah I remember you taking us with us a few times and then I was like - why are we doing nothing on Friday nights you know what I mean like my show can you schedule a show yeah we're gonna do guest spots somewhere yeah let's just make a couple bucks what did we did we start doing it I think we would okay I think honestly when we did like the Pearl or something court McCown would be like hey if you want to come in and do a set you can like like Dahmer era right I'd like sense he's like he'll come to us if I'm ever smoking cigars with me you him Kevin James and just like the common bar those of us from I hated those clubs but those common bars work the best were great and we were but we could sneak around back dog yeah hmm we didn't get mobbed yeah and then eventually it was like hey instead of just doing occasional guest spots why don't we do clubs and the club's would get full I'm a guy Torry doing something maybe in Omaha and Rizzo well how about a midnight Friday show can we do that you didn't want to bump anybody right but then you were scheduled at months and months out so nobody was scheduled yeah and then theaters it was just one night anyway and it was just became like we're not wasting time yeah doing these fun UFC stuff we're actually working if you ever want to do those again man we could do some it became harder as I started headlining to be like I got to give up time yeah to go do that at one time it was a you were like can you come to Dallas you know how this like shows that are important to you it might not be the most money or anything but it's important to you case in point I went to do the Wilbur my first time doing the Wilbur you know and that was one of the ones I remember you doing and be opening for you and then I'm doing two shows of the Wilbur I'm like this is I want to show Boston's an important comedy city yeah so then I was like I needed to get like a really good opener somebody I got Joel it was like you're a headliner I need you to open for me and luckily he'd been open for Louie and his schedule became clear lucky for us that's how I open for us but yeah and you were like you had this show in Dallas and you're like can you do it I'm like I'm doing the fucking San Francisco comedy festivals like how much you can pay them like honestly like 400 bucks it's not about that I agreed you know I'll give you $5,000 and I'll cancel now let me get off the phone right now and I'll go ahead and finish line because it would be more fun yeah there's that too no yeah would you be more fun I mean we've had some fucking fun times man to last and when I talk to people about the road the girl the rule is lonely the road so I'm like you're doing it wrong yeah supposed to do with your best friends do some fun shit with it I try to stay later on Sunday and go hiking if it's I go yeah if it's cold in New York and I'm in Austin fucking stay in the warmth a little bit do something fun that's a good move you know but yeah but you and your friends is the number was a different thing man you know the entourage thing when we did that it was too big leaves you've got a control there's too much work there's too hard to organize and get everybody to get in it's too much pressure on me I don't want to deal with this I just want got to be an administrator to those people even to openers or to acts with me it's too much work one person is fine the only reason you brought a second opener because the one opener was so irresponsible you couldn't trust he'd be there but he was so brilliant that I refused to not hire him whatever I could work with the obvious answer is get someone else but you're like no I'll get a buffer in case well my feeling on Diaz is always like I have a special I've always had a special place in my heart for him because I he reminded me so much of my friend Johnny Johnny be from New York who taunted the pool player yeah and like I knew what Joey was she's this brilliant guy who had a really hard time with reality with with with life with civilization he was just but in those moments of brilliance he was worth everything to me so I was like look what I'm gonna try to do with this guy is I'm gonna try to somehow or another because I had I was in mainstream I had a television show pull him in clubs that I could headline I'm like I'm going to bring this guy into the world and I'm gonna show him how I do it and I'm gonna like indoctrinate him I'm gonna I'm gonna you know I mean he's older than me and I respect him and I'm not like a mentor to him but I am someone who was more advanced in comedy and but was a giant fan of Joey Diaz so I was like I just want to figure out a way whether it can work for this guy because I know if this guy's is out there hustling and being crazy and coke it's just it's gonna go off the rails like whatever I can do to and and I think it helped him that someone who was established who a guy who legitimately me I don't give a fuck what he did I wanted him to be let it be himself want to be yourself yeah you loved it wild with him I want to be fun I don't care about what went on I wanted I wanted fun for everybody like that was it was important for me that I'd be the only one like that's one of the biggest poisons ever with comics be the only funny water on the headliner I'm the only one who kills and you you guys are doing too well or you guys are doing too much time for me it was like go have yeah we're here to party this is a pussy point Denver once when I I mean I just did way too long it was just me and you I think I did 44 minutes and read bands like to do like 45 minutes was like no I did not it just didn't realize things like you did I'm like there's no way I did 25 or 30 but that's such a good club the comedy works and he goes I recorded it on video I can show you the starting point in the ending point and he did I was like oh fuck I've told you this before but but I was like dude I'm so sorry that was way wrong like no didn't matter like no no I'm really I'm really sorry goes no no it didn't matter I'm like no but I shouldn't do that he like no no you killed and then I went up and killed so you haven't made a connection to me where it does actually matter doesn't we both killed why is it an issue if it goes off the rails one time and you go long like who gives a shit yeah that's not a consistent thing yeah it's just that the whole thing to all of us should be we know the process try some shit have fun and the audience has a great time that's what I all thats all i wanted and like and to have also that stand-up wasn't something that I had to do for money like stand-up was almost like supplementing uh-huh whether it was news radio money or fear factor money it's like I had all this money that I could my bills are okay I was okay I didn't have to think about it so I didn't worry about getting kicked out of clubs I didn't worry about not getting booked like so what like we're here to have fun and we rolled through the entire country like that and it worked out it was fun god damn dude we had the time of our lives when you look back if we look back as you know senior citizens at the fucking the the rare great times that we had consistently all across the country the off safe suffer stuff great for me onstage I was getting more stage time than I would get in LA and I was getting this weird exposure to an actual good crowd where I could like experiment pausing I wouldn't be afraid of losing a crowd if I chose yeah doing a half-hour consistently two shows a night talking to Michelle she just went to a wolf she just went to uh I think comics for the first time I was like oh how is it she goes it's not fair they're laughing at setups it's just too good it doesn't make sense I'm like it's a victory lap you should enjoy it and then I remember like I think that might have been the first time I went with Brogan was and I was doing so well that he's like oh you're coming with me again it was almost like like it was unfair showcase you know tell well I already knew you were funny yes that's why you asked me to go in the first place but like but I was like this is the perfect Club for anybody to try out in because it's so sad like a wind assisted 100-yard dash you know with heavy gusts of wind right it's almost like you have a sail yeah yeah yeah oh they were fun yeah we had a great fucking time dude but and it works look I mean look how all the people that went with us whether it's Diaz or Duncan or you or Segura they're murdering now all over the country murdering doing quite well if I was a talent scout did I be a hundred percent no you would not think 100 they failed them so they also had the potential to be yeah then it's on them well discipline is something that a lot of people lack man yeah it's not very very unfortunate and we're seeing it right now Bert Kreischer you're
