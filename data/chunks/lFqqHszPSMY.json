- what hello Michelle go ahead crack your neck put it on put the microphone to it so we could hear it does it propagate oh that was a good one that was a good one do you do that all the time I just when I'm getting ready to throw down yeah pull this microphone like a fist from your face there we go yeah so what's happening no we're just in town my brother-in-law just moved just got stationed here in California so we drove him down and then we did the whole San Diego um no I think it's it's actually an hour south of here I think it's no no close by but mm-hmm cool Air Force Edwards yes okay yeah okay I know where that is yeah yeah so we got fish in there it was the first time I ever saw a stealth bomber it was like a trite afternoon I know when we were filming Fear Factor out there and I saw him one fly overhead it's like a UFO was like wow that is crazy does it look like a UFO yeah it doesn't even look real you ever seen one in real life it looks like like a Batmobile like like Batman's plane uh-huh it's so crazy when you see one fly and you're like wow the engineering involved in something like that it's insane and that was a while back yeah sure it was 2001 because it was right after 9/11 so it's 2000 that's it right there that's what we thought of them one of them it's uh does it be - and this is like oh my god I don't know which one we saw but it was black and wicked-looking that's crazy looks like your Tesla yeah flying around one of those things that's what we thought well imagine back then that's what it looked like back then so what would what is there now right you probably can't see him probably the sky probably are you from a military background my dad you know my dad was so that's what my parents met my dad was stationed in Germany my mom was fleeing Thailand um to hurt her first husband was like physically abusive to her so she was leaving Thailand and she came to Germany to find her a GI and then found she came to find a GI specifically well you know I think she was coming to get away but right now she wanted to she wanted a better life for her at the time and my dad was in the hospital and so my mom was taking care of him look at him food and made him fall in love there you go and my dad always jokes he says he tells us a story all the time he's like yeah your mom's taking care of me and then she told me that you're pregnant and then twelve months later you were born oh that's funny but now they fell in love it was just a really long pregnancy just weird just kind of weird I don't know why but I was well but no yeah and then so then we moved to Colorado and that was boring then we lived in Germany for a little bit when I was younger and then back to Colorado and I grew up in Aurora Colorado oh cool when did you start training Oh probably around ten yeah yeah around ten I have a older brother he's four years older than me he's my half-brother and I really wanted to do gymnastics as a kid and my parents just we just couldn't afford it was really expensive and so my brother found a little karate spot at the church just across the street and it was a community like a community karate thing and so it was something that all three of us could do and so yeah we jumped into it and I fell in love with it I just it just took over my life and changed changed my life did you start competing really quickly yeah I think so and I first it's funny because at first so I would do like the the karate tournaments and so there's point sparring and then there's the Coty's and I thought the Coty's were silly and I remember going in and doing point sparring and getting knocked on my butt and I was like okay I think I want to do some Coty's then I want to bring some trophies home but so yeah I competed karate from 10 all the way up until I was 18 and so I did a lot of like the fly she like extreme martial arts Coty's with the like the flips and stuff like that but I always I always came back to sparring because I wasn't good at it I was like it bugged me it bugged me that I that I wasn't good at it and then I found my niche because its point sparring so you get to two points to the head for kicks to the head so I would just sit back and let him come in and just kick him in the head she had come times in win the fight so how did you go from that to go from that to kickboxing or did you go right into MMA like when did you when did you just start training him a man so so I did I did karate and then I got my black belt in karate what Chi America freestyle and then so I think around 18 or 19 I was kind of just exploring doing a couple different things so I did wushu for a couple of years and I competed in wushu and then I did a little bit kemple and and then kind of dabbled a little bit into kickboxing and so it all kind of just happened pretty strangely I was in college I was working at Hooters and I was doing that all these like little side jobs like doing photo shoots for this and that and I was a ring girl for MMA shell I had never seen him ma and I remember just walking around the cage and thinking man I want to be like on the inside I said that one that looks cool I think I could do it cuz it was mixed martial arts you know and I remember talking to a promoter and he kind of laughed me off and was just like whatever you know you're a ring girl and it was a smaller local show Donald Cerrone was actually fighting on that show and he ordered me yeah and so he came to my work at Hooters and I wasn't there and he was just like left me no serious about fighting get your ass in the gym Wow where was this is in Colorado mm-hmm in the night so I went to go train and went to go training with McDonald and you know we we Jim hopped from place to place I trained with with Duane I try with Trevor I trained with without with all the guys and and so I took a couple smokers would drive you know drive around the region and took a couple smokers and then it was like at that point when I was still in college and I just was not happy in college I I was kind of wandering around aimlessly is really successful in high school and you know it just didn't transfer over to college I still I got good grades I was 3.8 you know I was going to do you but I wasn't happy I just I there was something missing and it was it was the martial arts this is a big part of my life and you needed a real challenge need something physical to probably write I would imagine that someone growing up doing martial arts as long as you did you like the thrill of using your body and moving around it's like that it's so important like once once you do that and you compete and it becomes a part of you did the idea of like sitting in a classroom all day and then eventually sitting in a job all day was probably not not that compelling yeah I think so I think that um I just I was going to school so I was double majoring in theater and sports science mmm so as majoring in theater cuz I got a scholarship for it and I was doing sports science I wanted to be like physical therapist for like a sports team or something like that or even a martial arts team but yeah so I decided to take a like a little bit like a break from that and my mom my grandma was sick in Thailand so then I was like I told my mom I just got with her for the summer and I went to visit my grandma in Thailand and all I was out there I I went to sit at home muy Thai camp and I absolutely fell in love with it they made fun of me because of my my karate kicks yeah it's interesting how different karate kicks are yeah high kicks yeah and they were looking at me like it was crazy but like what no I'm a black belt I know what I'm doing they're just laughing at me we're training on concrete outside these little five-year-old kids are doing ten year old ten minute rounds and my feet are blistering up from kicking over and over and over on the concrete but I loved it I fell in love with it it kicked my butt and I fell in love with it and I came back and I dropped out of college and I decided to pursue fighting Wow so where did you learn grappling so so my first MMA fight was kind of just it was supposed to be an amateur fight and like I said it was training with MacDonald and he was training at a school in Vail and so I would I would go to I would I would work on the weekends and then drive up to Vail and train my grappling and all of it like that like all of the MMA and so so you basically trained MMA together look he didn't take specific rappin classes I would imagine that that was the thing that you needed to concentrate on the most right mm-hmm yeah and I figured okay he's my pro dude it was supposed to be amateur but the girl that I was supposed to fight fell through and the only girl that they had available was already Pro she was like - no pro and of course you know how Donald it he's like whatever fuck it so that's a good double back so I was like all right I mean we've been training so I literally had four weeks in Miami in my like throughout my my karate career we would have grappling nights when we would do grappling but it wasn't anything like substantial so yeah four weeks of grappling training and I figured okay you know I'll just use my stand-up to win the fight and she was swinging from from way back here and trying to take my head off so I ended up taking her down I Undertaker down like six or seven times I've been winning the fight by taking her down and ground and pounding yeah that's crazy yeah did you say while you were doing it like wow this is so weird that I'm doing this it was I I wasn't thinking at all I was just in the moment having the time of my life but were you thinking that this was what you're gonna wind up doing like professionally are you just thinking I can't believe I'm doing this oh yeah that's exactly I was like this is so much fun it was that the Broomfield events I don't know if that's that's still called the Broomfield Events Center in Colorado but yeah I think a bank oh yeah those changed names there's so much fun but never in my life I thought I would be a top UFC contender never and on your way your goal is to be the first mommy yeah to ever win a title yeah that's possible 100% you're in them you're in the hunt right now like what are you ranked I'm ranked 7 mm-hmm 7th but I don't think the rankings are anything they're weird and they're weird yeah this is like sometimes someone will beat somebody and then that person still ahead up in the ranking I'm like explain that I just I don't understand the rankings though I feel like I've won my last two fights and I've gone down in rankings all right you wanna hasn't fought and she's gone down in rankings and some of the girls haven't fought and they've gone up in rankings I just think the rankings are crazy yeah well it's a bunch of people get to submit their positions right like a bunch of journalists and accepted experts on MMA I guess when I look at the rankings sometimes I feel like it shifts depending on who they're trying to push or you know just sometimes I feel like just story line kind of conduct 8 yeah the rankings you know obviously I'm a giant fan of the UFC I love them to death I'm so happy and I just I would do nothing for any other organization I didn't ever want to work for another organization but I don't like the way they do things there's a lot of things they just stay Scott Elias Theodore oh really yeah one loss Derek Ross scary I'm like what they cut Derek fence no no he was just one I'm like explain that how do you explain that one that one doesn't make any sense there's like some matchups don't make any sense interim title shots those are preposterous it's crazy yeah I mean I understand it's a machine it has to work and they're trying but it's just it um especially for like a fighter who's life too pens on ya the fights and you know your livelihood depends on that and for you just to be out yeah it's stressful enough to only fight a couple times a year because you have to divvy up that that person money throughout those times you know but yeah well I think people like you are very important for women's MMA because you seemed so normal you know I mean like there's some women you talk to me like well this girl's fuckin crazy no wonder why she's a fighter you know I mean like there's some girls are real aggressive or just like you talked to Amanda Nunez like I get it yeah yeah she should be a fighter she's like yeah she's cool so cool yeah she's so cool but that's a badass bitch yeah you know I mean she'll fuck people up you could tell just looking at her you know like the way she's built she's wide you could tell she's got power and she looks like a girl you would not want to fuck with Josh called it Josh called he said he'd that she'd knock out cyborg that was crazy that was crazy that that was I didn't I didn't think that she couldn't knock her out I thought I think she can knock out anyone I mean I think she could not I think Amanda Nunez could knock out a lot of guys she hit so hard yeah but I thought that there would be a big weight disadvantage cyborg has a tremendous experience advantage and she's never shown herself to be someone that gets hurt yeah even when she fought Julianne bars did you ever see that fight in lion fight I remember seeing highlights of it cuz she's just like stuck in the ropes mm-hmm and Jurina is a elite kickboxer and cyborg got dropped and kept coming she was pursuing her in the final rounds yeah I mean she was chasing I'm sure she lost the decision but she gained a lot of fans because she did have any pro muy Thai fights and she fought a woman who like she couldn't get a fight for almost three years because girls were ducking yeah cuz they didn't want to fight her boy-toy is brutal I feel like because my husband I talk about this all time because Emma may you have options like if you have if you're having trouble to stand up you could take them down you can work your grappling this or that in boxing you don't really have much options either you you give up you get knocked out or you give up you know in the corner and I feel it's the same way and I'm in more types that for now you're introducing me knees and shins and elbows yeah sure cut and you have no way out like you know you know so that's that's brutal yeah that's a rough sport in an incredibly exciting sport to watch and one that I've never interested me boxing is so gigantic in this country and Muay Thai has almost no presence and I just it baffles me to no end I mean they have the product yeah I mean they have great American fighters I mean like Joe Shelley and Kevin Ross and there's a ton of them and this guy's like John Wayne par from Australia and all these guys are exciting to watch and fun and and then there's so many elite kids that are coming up but there's no mainstream appeal it doesn't I don't understand they don't know I you there yeah that is crazy to think they need a thing like the UFC where something comes along and they dump a ton of money into it but the thing is like there's only people only have so much time to watch things so it's like Oh Deontay Wilder fighting I'll watch that oh you know tyron woodley is fighting I'll watch him yeah you know Oh John Jones is fighting I'll watch that what's this Muay Thai ah this fight song I'm gonna go watch Bellator instead I'm gonna watch that instead it's like there's it's almost like too saturated yeah that's true but it's it's a shame no be cool if they had like a card with all different types of fighting on that's what one does mm-hmm you know all in the same night yes one Fc does that they'll have kickboxing Muay Thai in MMA in one night no no no they let everybody know no this is what they're doing I think one is doing fantastic they're doing they're they're putting on amazing fights I mean and we've seen that these are like legitimately world-class fighters they're beating guys like they you know Timothy nuts you can just beat Eddie Alvarez yeah and they're also they cut out all the weight cutting there's no weight cutting over there so like when sage Northcutt fought Cosmo Aleksandra he fought him in 185 pounds cuz that's really what he walks around you know so there's no weight cutting over there that was a brutal hit then he got caught with crazy I'm glad that he's okay yeah he's okay but yeah his faces had eight fractures do you think it's better for him to cut down that's a good question because very good question because I mean if he's getting knocked out by that I'm wondering if maybe he should be walking around lighter or I don't know he's pretty lean already he's lean but that's that fight played out realistically like not not that it's better for him or worse for him but sage is a young guy he's twenty-one or twenty-two years old he's got a limited amount of world-class Muay Thai experience he fought Cosmo who was a multiple time world champion yeah and it's just a bad fight why why did they why would they set that up if they're trying to build them it's easy like I've said that too and people like oh it's easy to say after the fact you're right but if I was in sages corner hey bro there's a lot of fights we should take and that was a more Thai fight no it was an MMA fight okay but sage is not a wrestler yeah I mean has taken guys down before but I would absolutely say that's the game plan the game plan is tie this guy up and drag him to the ground don't don't be standing with this - I just feel like if you if you have a background in something in in stressful situations you always revert back to what you know sure yeah so even if he did work as wrestling he's gonna revert back to his you know really hoppy movie dance and and that that's that's what it looked like what happened he was kind of pulling out hopping back and got caught yeah well he was trying that sideways karate style stance mhm you know Cosmo is just super elite and he saw if you saw the fight he fainted a couple times with the left he set him up like with a switch a couple times and then as sage circled off he went to his right and cracked him but that guy is just a super elite fighter I mean when it comes to striking I feel like that is where being elite is the most dangerous for an opponent you know I feel like if someone if you fight an elite jiu-jitsu guy and he catches you and he submits you you live another day you know like Neil Magny Demian Maia we found out you know Damien gets him to the ground and just strangles him right yeah but that's he'll be all right mm-hmm if you get Kayode by an elite striker who knows what kind of damage happens to you you know when his face got broken he's had eight fractures in his face his cheek is orbital like they had a piece and back together it was attached do you know I don't know you know the extent of the injuries he posted up some images though did you see the images of the x-rays whoa this is horrible yeah I mean so so that's how I feel against jiu-jitsu people when they submit me I'm like okay like let's do it again you know yeah exactly well what about androgyny Andros I was scared yeah I was scared for Rose was a really bad landing landing on her neck like that was terrifying that's what scared me just because we were in Brazil too and that crowd was crazy mm-hmm and everybody shot up and started screaming and Rose was just like laid out on the campus and I kind of was just like wanting her corner to be in there with her cuz she was just all alone about herself right you know and I was worried that she wasn't gonna get up I was like cake he was like wait to cheer until I see she's okay cuz that can paralyze someone 100% yeah if you look at the impact have you seen the photograph of the landing itself I mean it's it's one of the worst ways you could ever land she's essentially headfirst with the neck sideways and flattened yeah her neck his face yeah it's like someone was cranking on her neck it's horrible yeah that's a bad landing I mean the whole thing was bad she's going for the Kimura Jessica picks her up she doesn't lace a leg and she holds on the Kimura she which you you just can't do you just can't do you got to let it go you know but she she's she's held on to things before and you know and caught arm bars and triangles and it's one of those things you know you make mistake so cuz I know people were talking about it being illegal to slam somebody like that she didn't do it on purpose she just tried to slam her I mean she's just trying to take lifts her up and dump her down I mean the the illegal slamming is like when Minotauro fought Bob Sapp do you member no Minotauro Fat Bob Sapp and Bob Sapp literally got him in a piledriver where he scooped and Bob Sapp was 370 pounds with abs and on everything that Mexico has to offer every steroid that was available Bob Sapp was on they said they used to travel with like a briefcase there were roads it's I mean he was a goddamn science project at one point it was fascinating to watch right because I I think to this day that was probably one of the greatest victories in all of MMA Minotauro who was he was outweighed by a good solid hundred and thirty hundred and forty pounds like legitimately and still got an arm bar off Bob Sapp Jamie got it yeah watch this so look at the size difference first of all just see the beginning of the fight scene so he shoots he shoots but look at the size difference when you see them come out it is so crazy Bob Sapp was so big but look at this boom so that now Minotaur owes neck was fucked up from that forever like that haunted him his entire career watch this boom yeah see he tucks his head a little bit at the last second so he doesn't catch it on the top of the head but all of his weight all a Bob Sapp sweat Lou that well I don't think he tucked it I think it just gave him going he kept going any fucking submitted him weight ro was one of the toughest guys it's ever walked the face of the planet look at this he scoots out he escapes and gets on top of him yeah well look at the size difference three different four I mean Bob was so big and he's probably on EPO fuckin everything and look at that just wind melon with his legs he was any was trained by Maurice Smith you know Maurice was training him so he was a legitimate you know it will Ajith emit light rain - leet and he was so big so these were this is back in the day when there's like 10 minute rounds mm-hmm 10 minute first round so minute are I said I believe I went into the second round though I want to say what oh my god don't remem entirely whether it went into the second round but I want to say yeah yeah I mean look he beat Ernesto Hoost twice in kickboxing matches but also goes to show you how hard cro cop punches because cro cop flattened him with one punch cro cop broke his orbital bone with a straight left so Minotauro eventually gets him on his back and then once he gets him on his back his Bob Sapp like you can only keep 375 pounds going for so yeah he's just completely exhausted yeah so this is the end he ties up his arm and catches him in an armbar and Bob Sapp taps and I was at my friend fuck whose house was at but I was with Eddie Bravo when we saw this more screen we couldn't believe it we couldn't believe it because it was like a victory for it was a victory for a technique you know that's what it was it was a victory for jiu-jitsu was evicted for a technique over brought him is a perfect example of technique over brawn yeah nothing Minotauro doesn't have brawn and not that Bob Sapp doesn't have technique they're the same size Minotaur would've fucked him up it would shit would have been an easy fight for him just whether there's doorman wasn't scared to be in there with them yeah phaidor wouldn't fight him fader said fuck that they offered fate or a fight with Bob sighs like nah I'm good I mean he fought hong-man choi when hani i was like 7 feet tall remember that fight caught him in the most ridiculous arm bars ever a caught him an armbar and the arm is as long as this fucking table crazy it was that was a ridiculous armbar a ridiculous armbar that's crazy but you'll never see that any fights like that happen not now well I still think someone someone might do it yeah rise and could do it there's to do fucked up things with Gabby Garcia amazing Gabby Garcia's science project and a half that's crazy what is that I think she'd been beaten uh nothing I'm aware of yeah how are they gonna find someone a woman is 240 pounds they're not she's chillin 840 pounds jacked and she's a legit black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu yeah and she's you know she's legitimately tough I thought I saw the video of her grappling with Mike Darrin and Mackenzie like almost McKenzie beat her oh did she I think Mackenzie faded jiu-jitsu match did you just see much but in FML to get anybody's beat girl yeah I think Mackenzie either beat her or how to draw one an advantage something like that but it is what it is that's science okay you're doing some stuff you're doing some stuff to people that it's not your body's not supposed to have that in there lady it's nice you know I mean it's it's interesting cuz like like the Bob Sapp thing like you get to see what happens like wow okay this is what's when someone just goes for it yeah and when pride ensign anyway was on the podcast and he and since hilarious he was detailing the contract he was like it said in all capital letters we will not test you for steroids yeah they're like that's what joy would tell me all the time Joey Villasenor he's been in my short over the last couple of fights Joey's an excellent fighter and he would say that he said it almost they almost encouraged encouraged it nonetheless they basically did encourage it because they just wanted to see crazy you know things that like came out of comic books no they wanted you to be jacked yeah he wanted you to be gigantic yeah yeah I mean as long as everybody's doing it I guess I don't think I would never I wouldn't want to do that even if I had the choice to do it you wouldn't want I want to right I get it well that makes sense and that's why I think people like you were important for MMA because you are a you're a woman yeah you seem like a woman you behave like a woman you look at a woman if you've someone saying that girl's top 10 UFC fighter you be like what mm-hmm no way really she's so normal like but if you saw Gabby Garcia you know that girl's smashing people in Japan you look out of this room pushy Hulk's out flatten me yeah I just like I feel like it takes the the joy I feel like it would take the joy out of a victory if you did steroids yeah yeah well you would become something different the reality is a woman becomes something different when she starts taking male hormones you just do he becomes something different your tendons strengthen your bone structure changes your voice deepens you become much more man I mean that's when you see transgender women when when a woman rather is a transgender man she decides she wants to be a man they start taking testosterone they get beards they have all sorts of strange things happen down below and they they start having a deeper voice and they sound like a man and that's that's exactly what happens to a woman when a woman takes steroids if she's not trying to transition it's the same thing he's taking male hormones that make your muscles grow far larger than they're supposed to yeah I remember watching a movie that they did in Thailand it's called beautiful boxer yes but is the opposite yes he wanted to be a woman but I think he did it the right way right if there's a right way to do it because well he started as a man and then became a woman and kept fighting man yes and I think that someone should have told her at the time like let's just stop fighting but stop fighting this is my take on it like but she needed to keep fighting so that she could pay for the short transition right yeah all right catch-22 whoever was one yeah yeah but it was an elite fighter until the transition and then you see the skills start to diminish because there's no more testosterone when she's fighting men but if she was fighting women she would have a giant advantage still all over women and I don't think that's right I don't think that's fair no one does no one does except transgender people transgender people and super progressive activists who have no idea how sports work it's those are the people the people that just want inclusiveness and they just want everyone to be okay and you know maybe this is the world I'm looking for I'm looking I'm looking towards a world where everyone's included yeah good have a transgender league I have a transgender division no I'm cool that I'll be happily happily support them but you're pretending that that's a woman and it's not it's a male who's transitioning to a woman you have an X Y chromosome it's a different thing yeah you know I'm a hundred percent if a woman says I want to fight a transgender woman okay I'm that's fine but like four leagues to recognize that this is the same thing and like to say like how would you feel if all of the UFC's weight classes in the women's do were dominated by transgender women I would feel like there were some I feel like I should not say so right right right yeah like I'm gonna get caught up saying something let me talk for you it's fucking bullshit it's fucking bullshit right yeah you don't have to say anything and that's how girls feel right now when there's sports being dominated in track and field so fair I mean it I guess for me I've always been especially like being a female in a male dominant sport I've always I've I guess if I can like to consider myself a feminist not not so much a feminist but I like when I go into the gym I my teammates look at me as a fighter like they don't look at me as a female fighter or anything like that they look at me as their teammate you didn't mean and I appreciate that I appreciate that they trained to treat me as an athlete and and and all of that good stuff but I feel like what like at the end of the day like girls need to fight girls and guys need to fight guys we like we have different strengths than the guys do and the guys have different strengths and the girls do and and it's nice for us to have a place so that we can showcase our skills yes I agree I think the only problem that I have with that transitioning thing is physical competition that's it physical competition against the gender that you supposedly align with yeah you know you can't do it but here's what you don't see here's what you don't see you don't see a lot of transgender men who want to fight men you know see a lot of women who are taking hormones to become a man who want to fight men yeah good fucking luck with that ladies good luck stop this is crazy like this idea that you just magically become a woman or you just magically become a man it's just not true and athletes recognize it and rational people recognize it but there's so much pushback from progressive people who it's like what percentage of the population are we even talking about here I mean it's not even 1% it's it's a very strange saying that it's it's taking over the conversation with bathrooms and competition and sports and so many different things I'm all for inclusiveness and I'm all for being open-minded in leather many people do you yeah be yourself be whatever yourself is I don't know what your selfies I don't know what you feel but you can't compete against women that's it's that simple it's really that simple it has to it has to be something deeper where they you know it and to me I think it goes back to like that mental like a mental block where you where you need some like a false sense of confidence yes I feel like what's like sandbagging really is it really it is the ultimate sandbag it's like oh I'm a woman like wait a minute what the fuck did you get those hands yeah that's it really like the ultimate form I mean everybody of you for folks who don't know what sandbagging is oh I was gonna bring up smokers too for folks who don't know what smokers is if you listen to this podcast the smoker is small amateur fights that they have in gyms or a little arenas or high school gyms but sandbagging is like say if Michelle had a black belt in jujitsu and then entered into a judo tournament as a white belt and then just fucking fly an arm bar everybody be like what the hell is this where'd you get your white belts yeah like how do you wipe but we've all seen things like that before everyone has seen things like that before there's people that pretend they're younger than they really are they pretend they're lighter than they really are favorite and they because they want to win this is no different it's no different it really is and the people who don't understand it they have never competed in high level athletics it's really that simple if you've competed in high level athletics you know that there's a differentiation there's a difference between men and women there's a reason why we have a man's division and a women's division it's not that anybody's better or worse it's just like there's unfair advantages like the Bob Sapp Minotauro think that was an unfair advantage it's just overcome by someone who have superior skill and an iron will and that's what Minotauro was when he beat Bob Sapp I mean there's no denying that one guy was way bigger and way stronger but it was overcome you shouldn't force people to overcome it should be even if they were even if Minotauro and Bob Sapp were even here's the fight shoot takedown dang odds back our bar bang fights over it'll be like a couple minutes maximum and Minotauro would armed bargain yeah it's because people like to see the the mismatch and maybe like that underdog story where the person that is you know the underdog wins like Minotaur but like again Minotaur his neck it's still fucked up to this day mm-hmm you know his neck bothered him his entire career from that one and piledriver 375 pounds plus his weight all on his neck it just shows you how fucking tough that guy is you know the Minotaur old story was run over by a truck when he was a kid it's where's this giant scar on his back he was in hospital for a year he said the guy's an animal I mean he's as tall hit by a truck you're not gonna do nothing to me you can't force everyone to be that tough you know I think it's important to have fairness in this this is why I'm so pro you sada I love what they're doing I love the fact that they're testing the shit out of people they're just showing up in people's houses 6 o'clock the morning hey wake up time for a test and but is it the same in in every country that's a good question it's a very good question Ryan if someone's training in Russia or Germany or wherever yeah that's a very good question I do not know the answer to that because I know that's kind of one of the concerns for some of the athletes that yeah I might be really strict here mm-hmm in the States but in in other states as strict right because it is US anti-doping agency that's you sada yeah that's a good question yeah oh you so what do you think you don't think it is I don't know I'll talk for you if there's something fucked up you need to say just go like this okay I don't know um I guess I just I I can only be concerned with what's under my control right so then I'm just gonna train and I'm gonna get as good as I can get and hopefully you know you thought I can can take care of the rest but for me to stress about it is it's just time wasted I think for myself well I do know of a case where there was a fighter who told me that there was a guy who was openly dirty as far as what everybody knew and he knew that he was gonna piss hot so he went did some seminars in another country and just stayed over in another country for it just moved around it's like so you see this world-class fighter in these weird little gyms and he was like what is going on over there and the gentleman who told me said listen man he's docking drug tests that's what he's doing over there that's crazy yeah for sure like when you when the kind of TJ Dillashaw gets popped and like wow TJ for a world title he's getting popped like how many people are getting away with this how many people got away with it it's just not worth it he lost a lot doing that what he oh yeah you know it's not worth it it's not worth it ultimately it's definitely not worth it because his legacies tainted but if he got away with it is it worth it I mean how many people got away with it here's the question how many people retired and we never got to see their drug test from 2006-2008 like what were you taking oh you're on like back when they used to have those silly wait drug tests or their chests you at the weigh-ins which is basically a intelligence test oh yeah you still taking steroids or did you stop a couple of weeks ago and the testing today is so much more sophisticated that's why people are getting popped for EPO and a bunch of things that were hard too hard to find yeah the thresholds like this is the john jones thing with the pika grams what the the time the insignificant amount in terms of like the performance-enhancing aspect of it that is in his system like how can they detect that well they can detect that because the machines are way more sophisticated the drug testings wait like he if he had tested if John Jones had tested 2 years ago he would have tested clean yeah but now it's just they're just way better to tell even something less even if you're taking creatine and that creatine is tainted yeah which is a lot of it what these guys Tim means that was his deal he was taking a supplement it was tainted quite a few guys yeah have legitimately just taken over-the-counter supplements that they thought were clean and they got something anything just some tiny fret that doesn't have any effect on their performance mm-hmm but it shows up and he'll show up for months and weeks and John's case like years it's been showing up for like a year and a half and when you're cutting weight that's when it seems to come back that's what it seems to show because your body water is gone you're losing fat you're losing you're losing body weight some of its stored in fat they think it's very confusing for them there try to figure it all out and then any all these fucking people online or ranting and raving about pika grams and this like the science experts and they think it's I think it's all bullshit that John's allowed to fight you should be banned for life and like okay you know you're not listening like he tested negative and then he tested positive a week later and then he tested negative a week after that like what's happening here something weirds happening there so figuring out for themselves exactly yeah but I'm glad they're figuring it out because now people get to see like hey look John Jones was out for all that time for other problems and then for the drug problems yeah like this is a lot of money that guy lost John probably lost tens of millions of dollars yeah you know he's still young yeah he's still young and he's still you know and hasn't hit his prime in I don't think no I think also all that knowing that it can all be taken away from you probably met like tempered him yeah like put him in a better place we realize like I still have this gift of incredible talent if he's just a natural-born fighter fishing he just knows how to fight some guys they have all the technique all the talent but they don't know how to put it together John knows how to put it together yeah he's just he's just that's his that's his Jam he just goes out there and he can he just does things on the fly that nobody would ever think of that works yeah he tries it's crazy to watch him train cuz he's just super lasered in and focused and there's nothing and you know there could be the building could be getting bombed and it wouldn't matter he'd just be on the back working on him technique yeah believe it it's really cool to watch yeah well he's he's the outlier right I mean there's there's special fighters they're outliers in in the sport and from our era it was like Anderson Silva Mighty Mouse John Jones yeah those are the real outliers where he just watched me just go Jesus Christ I can't him when he was in his prime you would watch him and he would watch him set guys up and it's he just it's almost like he had cheat codes like you could just see what they were doing you just like check and you did that I did and you do that okay well I'm gonna do this and I know you're gonna do that and pop there it goes yeah and he would just figure guys out it was wonderful to watch though because he opened up opened up like a door for all of the rest of us fight I feel like with any good fighter when you watch them fight it opens up a door in your own mind like oh like that's possible I can do that and so you're like with Anderson Silva did did that a lot with his movement with this head movement with his variety of punches and kicks and the angles at which they came in from mm-hmm you know and I don't know I feel like Anderson Silva did I feel like Rhonda did that with her judo feel like Machida did that with his karate and then you know III can go down the list of everybody but I feel like it kind of like goes and cycles mmm you know and I mean it's great for me because I can watch them and I can implement new things I feel like that's why I've been able to be in the game for so long and and still continue to grow and evolve because I get to watch other people and the things that they do and like add that to my to my tool list you know yeah it changes the expectation of what's possible right I think it was mighty mouse that was one of the best examples of that because when I would watch Mighty Mouse fight I'd be like show me someone who's better someone show me someone who's ever been better than this guy like I've never seen anybody move better than this guy like he doesn't get hit or if he gets hit it's rare like every three or four fights someone catches him like John Moraga caught him with a good straight punch like that that's like that was the last I remember I'd like to see him run it back with the hood oh very close fight and he kind of blew my mind how like nonchalant he was about it all like yeah and he's like yeah but whatever but that's him DJ is just a special guy yeah and he's another one's like couldn't be a nicer guy yeah like if you didn't know that he was a one of the best fighters that's ever walked the face of the planet you go over this friendly guy he seems he's so nice and normal it talks like he's articulate he doesn't talk like a mean person this just it's a great it's a great example of like some it's contrary to the stereotypes that people think of when they think of cage fighters yeah you know someone is fighting it which is a weird word right like it's do what do you do do you do UFC yeah you do UFC yeah that's if you're fighting for Bellator people like what's that is that like you have seen what is that what's Bellator can you changing no it's great I love the competition I think that's great that there's more options out there for the fighters oh for sure yeah I think it's very important I think it's very important what's interesting too about this sport is that it's one of the only sports where you can go back from 1993 to 2019 and you could see massive evolution yeah there's no other sport like that if you go back and watch boxing from 93 you're watching great boxing world-class boxing like you could take someone from 93 and put him into 2018 like they would fit perfect right thanks Roy Jones jr. she was genuine he's in his prime today everybody be fucked they be fucked he was just something special boxing mentality is like so old-school and you got to stick to the traditions even it's kind of like taboo to to see like fighters switching stance which some like the good ones are Josh like my husband he boxed you know and he has a lot he had a lot of old boxing coaches that were like you don't switch stance like you stick your stance and you perfect that stance you know those people are out of their fucking month you've watched Terence Crawford that's one of the things he does so brilliantly yeah he he as as good as a southpaw as he is Orthodox and it's one of the reasons why he's so difficult to solve yeah because if you think you got a read on his timing and then also listen to the right jab instead of a left jab now like oh shit maybe maybe it's just that I watch MMA and they're more focused on MMA than I am in boxing but when I just from you know having my husband help me out and all this stuff he that's what he's saying is going to be the like the biggest evolution or what has started to evolve in boxing is that they are realizing okay you can use both sides now and that's gonna trick them even more well Marvin Hagler was amazing at that it was one of Marvin Hagler's best skills that he could fight southpaw as well as white Orthodox mm-hmm Hagler was one of the greatest fighters of all time you know and he was a champion in the 80s oh you don't know Marvin Hagler no honey you don't know the marvelous one I never even really watched boxing until I met my husband really yeah that's crazy well he introduced you to something awesome yeah yeah it's a good time right now to watch boxing mm-hmm you know there's so many good boxers yeah I think that's the one of the things that he wants me to really work on in order to to get my game to the next level is my boxing you know because my kicks are good my wrestling's you know getting better and my jujitsu is good and if as long if I can put together my punches and we'll be okay ready to get that belt karate is an interesting martial art to that you are really good at because you have this you have an excellent ability to use that front leg that most people don't they don't have like you have an awesome front leg side kick great front leg roundhouse kick and when you do that I see that in your fight sometimes people like oh just to this because like a jab yeah but a jab that could fuck you up like a jab that can knock you out yeah I think I mean I guess like oh that to my point flying days like everybody was bigger than me it didn't matter because it was bye-bye belts right so I was always a smaller one and trying to trying to get the point off first I would just use my my front leg and kick it out there as fast as I could but I do I feel like my my kicks have blended to being I've adopted them as jabs you know yeah yeah I love it I think it helps because then it kind of neutralizes the height difference do you train a lot with Winkeljohn I do Winkeljohn is he was an excellent fighter a really good kickboxer and really good at both styles to it like leg kick style but also good at like he had karate techniques as well he and he's also he was very good at those transitions between those straight kicks and punches well you know that's the thing where a lot of people get confused is like a no-man's land between kicking and punching when people were kicking specialists and you see it like even with elite fighters like Raymond Daniels is coming up in his kick boxing career it took a while before he could make that smooth transition between kicking and punching because Raymond would be on the outside and he was a world-class top of the food chain karate point fighter yeah and then got into kickboxing and as long as he was at a distance he was fucking people up but in transition the no-man's land between the kicking in the punching he looked awkward took a while before he sort of so some guys like Joseph Volta Leaney and Nicky hold skin' they sort of exposed that that gap the no man's land gap that's a problem a lot of kickers have yeah they have that problem the gap from the kicking to the punching mm-hmm yeah I first sure I think that's one of the things that I had to that was one of the things that I had to really work on and I think because I enjoy grappling and jujitsu that I went straight from kicking to clenched up grappling and I kind of skip the boxing the boxing part of it how much boxing you do now um quite a bit actually is that your main focus yeah especially off you know off camp we don't have any you know game plans to work on we're working boxing and wrestling now when you say you work in boxing are you just sparring boxing and hitting pads boxing or are you trying to implement that into MMA training um I would say both we're not sparring we're not spying right now boxing but I was working on your hands working on the hands working on the footwork and then so we'll just do strictly boxing but then we'll do like you're saying that transitions so kicks the boxing and boxing the kicks and then boxing - takedowns yeah having things to do when you don't have to think right knowing exactly what to do oh I'm in this position there goes the knee I'm in this position now I'm throwing a punch when you see someone going like I got to do this I think yeah you know the the those transitions it's it's very it's a that when you're in the higher higher pressure situations that's when those transitions are the most awkward when you don't have like a conditioned response yeah and I think that's the biggest thing that I've really been able to work on his is the blending of all of them I feel like so much of us so many of us we train specific boxing specific mm or kickboxing jujitsu wrestling whatever but we never really blend it together and I think that's the most important part is well that's why what George was so great George st. Pierre was so amazing at transitions like you never knew what he was going to do yeah he was so unpredictable he was gonna punch you or he's gonna take you down so everyone's worried about everything you didn't know what was coming mm-hmm yes that's why I always encourage fighters like even if you're a really good striker man you got a attempt takedowns you got to keep people honest otherwise people are just gonna settle in and never worry about your takedowns and then they have an extra degree of comfort with their striking and you can get caught with stuff you wouldn't get caught with otherwise yeah and there's just I just feel like in MMA you have so many opportunities why would you limit yourself from those opportunities yeah I remember one of my fights um I was fighting this girl who was like a ten-time boxer in MMA mm-hmm and so I'm like oh this girl's coming into my world I'm gonna show her what's up but then and I was beating her the whole first round kicking her out keeping out with kicks keeping out with punches I remember going back to my corner and saying man this is too easy like um you know I'm piecing this girl up and just just me saying that to myself I think something in my head switched but I went back out and ended up I think what happened was I told myself okay you're piecing her up with what you know go out there and beat her at her own game oh Jesus I told Mike I think it was just like a mental like this is too easy I'm gonna make it challenging up more challenging on myself I didn't tell my corner that it was just like you know sometimes when you're in a fight you have like a million thoughts that go through your mind within a split second and that was one of one of them I'll show this bitch what's up yeah and at her own game which is stupid because it's MMA so I stood in front of her and then she cracked me and then and I saw stars and I stood in front of her and I didn't take her down and I was trying to you know exchange with her and she cried to me again and you know I was waiting for her to stop so it could be my turn and she never stopped and I got TKO'd you know but I mean lesson learned but I was just so stubborn in it you know in my thoughts that I was like I'm gonna beat her at her own game what are you talking about you're fighting MMA we're so mad at myself after the fact because I just I beat myself I just beat myself when I went back out there well that's that old how did you win or you learn and you obviously this is something instills in your mind to this day you learned yeah but that's a part of what makes a champion like that desire to show I can beat you anywhere yeah that that crazy belief in yourself I can fuck this bitch up standing those thought processes are so crazy is that the reason why you get so good in the first place is because you love challenges yeah you want to do this difficult thing so you literally made it more difficult but that is exactly why I continue to fight now you know I think I was nervous coming into the UFC cuz that's coming up from 105 you know I was talking to my husband I'm just saying like what are we doing like do you think I can make the jump up and still hang with these girls and would you pee fighting and 105 do see how to 105 I don't know I guess it just it would depend I think it would have to be worth it actually just to make the cut yeah I feel like my last couple of cuts at 105 were pretty brutal you're sure jaded that man like my you know how your eyes sink in all right I remember wiping wiping my eye and just looking down and like a whole row of eyelashes or like on my on my arm and that's like when people get syphilis Oh teeth start falling out I was sickly for surely the you know there to check you check your vitals after weigh-ins and the doctor when it released me because it couldn't find my heartbeat like my my heartbeat for like an hour I couldn't find your heart because you were so dehydrated yeah whoa so I just think that also that last cut was it was just like I I did it too quickly I think when you walk around that um like 130 to 134 and when you make the cut done with 115 how slowly do you do it I usually have about 8 weeks like camp and as I do like pound pound and a half two pounds a week yeah so for you to get to 105 yeah don't do that that sounds crazy well back when the last time I fought at 105 is probably what when I was fighting at 105 probably walking around it like 25 mmm still mm-hmm that's 20 pounds of weight for a hundred pound person that is 20 percent of your body weight yeah that's a significant amount to train yourself I mean if you think about a welterweight losing 20 pounds it's a good cut but an atom weight person that's so much weight I know I feel I feel so much healthier now I feel like when I'm in camp I can focus on training yeah and having good energy you know going at going a hundred percent rather than going seventy percent and then going to do more cardio so I absolutely feel like more healthier I feel like I've been able to put muscle on I feel like I'm stronger and just happier happier training yeah well you're seeing that from so many fighters and that's one of the reasons why I to go back to this one Fc thing I love what they're doing that they've eliminated weight cutting yeah they do hydration tests on people they make sure you're not cutting any weight and I think the UFC is missing the boat Metesky which is fantastic a hundred percent I'd support that they should test hydration to this weight cutting weight cutting is nothing but it's just sanctioned cheating that's all it is I you're not 115 pounds right but everybody is gonna cut down to 115 and then you're probably gonna go back up to like what do you when you fight when you get into the cage what do you think you weigh this last time I got back up to 128 yeah see that's what you're really way like why is everybody saying she's fighting at 1:15 she's not fighting at 1:15 like when you say tyron woodley fights at 1:17 no he doesn't he weighs 170 you know komaru smart he's not 170 he weighs 170 I for a very small time what maybe it's just kind of like the old school mentality or just the the idea of that being the last challenge that you go through before you step into the Octagon that I enjoy and not that I enjoy it but again you were going back to challenges and it's like one of those things like all right like you know take yourself to this point and if you can get through that without breaking then me and you can go to battle right I don't know there's just something to that for me I see what you're saying so it's another challenge like you have a whole there's a series of challenges there's a training there's the mental preparation and there's a weight cut all these things together and and I feel like that's like the last step it's like you know it's a battle within yourself is that the Death Star on your forearm what is that it's an actual silhouette oh oh oh that's so cool so it's a circular silhouette with the mountains and trees oh that's awesome yeah that's really cool that's very unique thank you it does kind of look like the Death Star though fucking Star Wars yeah so the the way cut though the only problem with it is it's bad for you yeah I mean I understand that I don't cut much I probably cut 4 pounds of water weight well that's when I hit when I like when I show up fight week I'm probably like 3 like 4 or 5 pounds off right but if you just ate normal we wouldn't you be healthier give if instead of getting down within 4 pounds of the weight like because you're gonna go up to 128 the day fight right so that's that's an additional 13 pounds where's that coming from come from somewhere yeah right so you're doing I understand that the thought process is talking to one of the doctors about it my last because he was like so strange that you go through all of this just to be the same weight the next day now doctors are so smart it's fucking stupid is what it is it really is for all for the sport yeah not you personally but it's what you have to do if you want to compete in the sport I guess just because I've been doing it for so long it's in my head it's like you know they're only a couple things you have to do as a fighter cutting weight is one of them if you can't do that then you know it is hard I feel it it's a process that you have to go through and you have to be mentally prepared to go through it and if you do it right it should only be water that you're cutting even though that's silly to do I don't know how it's it's silly to do it's not good it's never good to just cut that water it's just not it's not good for you but if you do it if you if you do it intelligently well you're not cutting too much weight it's not that bad but so many people are doing these brutal 30-pound way cuts I just I feel like at that point it's it's not a benefit for you like for some people they are the bigger person coming into the to the Octagon the next day but you're gonna reach a point certain point where cutting weight is not a benefit for you maybe I was you know that's if you can do it you pull it off especially if you're young and you figure out how to do it correctly and replenish your electrolytes you know it is an advantage bigger but the reality is you're whatever weight class that is that's not what you weigh you don't really weigh that much you weigh it's like it's crazy like you should be it should be about skill versus skill it shouldn't be about who's got the best scientists so I mean so what do you think you think and ROG would still be a 150 no no chance no chance no no no no she's bigger - she struggles yeah she struggles for 150 but then you've got Valentina I was like I think that weight class it's it's really interesting right when you're talking about weight classes if you're talking about the difference between 105 pounds and 115 pounds it might only be 10 pounds but it's a giant percentage of your body weight yeah and then you look at MMA in the men's division and you have you know 155 and you have 170 of that 15 pound gap that's a big gap it's a giant gap yeah I think this should be every ten pounds every ten pounds for men and for women I think there's a real good argument that should be every five pounds but if Dana heard this he would find whatever hello gonna shut the fuck up Harris he doesn't even like the idea of a 165 oh my god damn that's a no-brainer yeah there is there's plenty of fighters out there that are willing to fight and just give them a place to do so in and guys who would be champions because that's their real natural weight clip in betweens I think that what one FC is doing in terms of weight cutting is the way to do it but the other side is they're not doing the same thing that you sod is doing in terms of steroids so they're able to take 100% percent you talk to guys who compete over there and it's like yeah I mean there's some some testing so would you rather fight somebody that's heavier than you or somebody that's very it's very good question because if they were not just taking steroids but also taking EPO there's a lot of different shit that people can take you know they can give you more like EPO is a scary one because the person has more gas in their tank to beat you they have more they can hit you they can take shots better they can recover better and then they come after you and then they they'll have more gas in the tank than maybe they could put you away like somebody that's heavier than me and depleted from cutting water weight than somebody that was taking steroids or even for a woman I think for sure I think there's for women for women there's a real argument that once someone has ever taken steroids that you've altered your chemistry enough and your physiology enough that you're forever going to have some sort of an advantage so then there's nothing you can do about that it's quick well maybe deduct a point before you even get in the ashes oh that's not even good enough sony kos people right that's to know how often you spar um I would say heavy sparring once a week once a week like so we do like MMA grappling on Mondays Tuesdays as a heavy spar it's the 16-ounce let's throw down sparring Wednesday's is wrestling Thursday's is MMA gloves sparring so it's kind of more just accuracy like light on the striking here we on the grappling and then Friday's technical work technique stuff like that now you're at a gym you're at Jackson Winkeljohn which is one of the best gyms on the planet Earth but also a gym it's filled with savages I mean yeah you there must be a lot of chest bumping and a lot of people that are trying to test people and there's got to be girls who are there who look at a girl like you let's say this girl is where I want to be yeah and I mean I've talked of males who train there say man let me tell you something there's some Russian cats just show up out of nowhere and try to take your head off yeah and they go outside and smoke cigarettes and drink some vodka that's weird fighters are crazy you get the funniest coolest stories from meeting fighters all around the world yeah Jackson's is uh it's a shark tank like you're not going there to find Nemo you know you have to have a good set of skills before you get there in order to kind of hold your own right we do actually have an amateur team right now that is run by Joe Villasenor and he's done an amazing job with and much a team and so we've kind of been able to separate the classes in that sense where Joey is kind of overseeing all of the amateur fighters and he's building these amateur fighters and when he feels like they're ready to come and train with the proles he'll give them the go you know or I'll do a trial run where they would they train with us or one week and see if they're ready and you know for a high level of competition and then if they are then they stay and if they're not then they come back to the amateur team and and it's it's actually worked out quite well oh that's great so do they start people from fresh like no skills at all some so you get classes there for total beginners yeah it's crazy if you ever like going to gym and see like when you see like amateurs or people that have like zero training spar versus like professional fighters spot it's crazy it's almost looks more dangerous I would not want to be in that within like the cage with some of those people that like because you just don't know where the punches or kicks are coming from and they're all coming full blast exactly control no yes what's that about you Jitsu this is the same thing you don't want the last thing you want to do is grapple with a really strong guys about to get his blue belt yeah gets in the way I think that's why they match up high level with low level don't you think sure so someone can control you and calm you down and yeah I loved you Jitsu I can't wait to you know to get my black belt in jujitsu and I think it's kind of brought me back to my more traditional background where you know there's a little bit more structure when it comes to that are you training with the game yeah now how much of that do you do you use a lot of grips like do you grab collars and sleeves and things like that I try I try to force myself outside of my comfort zone because I am so used to grabbing wrists grabbing shoulders and you know right at the Crick of the elbows and stuff like that and I find myself going for those grips because that's just what I've done for the last decade one because I am stepping into their world I want to learn I want to learn the grips and I want to learn all of that stuff mm-hmm yeah it's I mean it's great if you want to compete in jiu-jitsu with aggi but I think for MMA I think the best benefit of jiu-jitsu the key for MMA is defensive for submissions because you get caught in things you can't power out of them because it's not slippery uh-huh and I'm I'm slippery like I've I love noogie because I can slip out of things and I'll just wait until I have a little bit of space and then I'm out yeah I'm yeah and I'm just out but I can't do that in game yeah so what I'll do a lot of times is I'll go train key and I'll do the technique class and then when it's time to go like do live rolling I take my key off no Michael no key that's smart so that way everything you're doing is applicable in MMA because one of the things we used to see in the early days of MMA see these ghee world champions like elite level world champions and they'd fight in MMA and they lost all of their technique because everything was collars and sleeves and pants and everything was grabbing things yeah whereas instead of now they try to go to cable grabs her over hooks and under hooks and they're all confused they like their technique is off yeah and they would be like a blue belt or a purple belt world champions yeah I think it's great like my professor now he so I'll I'll be rolling with his with his wife or some of his students and like it's weird because they're getting me ready for my fights but I'm also getting them ready for worlds and stuff like that so depending on who's getting who ready is what he'll call out if we're going and I'm you know there's I'm sitting in their guard he'll tell them that they have to get active they're like he'll straight up say if she was fighting you should just be punching in the face you gotta move you got to do something no so I think it's good just to give them a different perspective as well have you ever watched combat jujitsu I've seen a couple but what really get to slap them in the face and stuff like that yeah I've seen some of it that's interesting because it shows you where there are these gaps well okay this is an MMA but if it was yeah you'd be getting pounded on right here like you can't just hang out like there's moments in jiu-jitsu that are unrealistic in self-defense situations or in a fight situation yeah and that's where I get frustrated but it's good I need that frustration because I'll be in a position and in my head I'm like I could just punch you right now in the face so your schedule that you're laying out is this a schedule of Jackson Winkeljohn this is just their schedule so yeah that's what I do in the mornings at the gym so who sets up like when you're in camp when you have to do you know you you've got a fight it's 12 weeks from now who sets up your schedule I think what we do is we get a fight scheduled and then we we get all the coaches in together and so my jujitsu coach I go to Gracie Baja for jujitsu so jujitsu wrestling you know coach Jackson coach Wingo John joy Villasenor and my husband and my husband's with me all the time so he kind of oversees everything and we just sit down and we talk about all the things we need to get together I do one private with coach Jackson a week I do two privates with coach wink a week I do a private with coach Villasenor and then I do all those in the morning and then I and then I work out at my house as well and then I do jujitsu what are you doing your house um it depends on the day sometimes we do simulations we'll do like ground simulation sometimes it's just hard core cardio sometimes it's just technical Jeff something set up in your garage or something yeah that's nice we got a home gym we got a we got a clear light sauna we got a crew health what's a clear light sorry it's like it's an infrared sauna mm-hmm and then we have a cold plunge oh nice and so we can get something man at home everything everything if we needed to we could do our whole campus oh that's grab but I really enjoy being at the gym around my teammates and around my coaches and just pulling energy from them sure what about strength and conditioning how often are you doing that I just shine I do more strike the conditioning when I'm out of camp so like right now I'm doing strength and conditioning like three four times a week but when I'm in camp but it depends on my body and it depends on what I'm needing at the time but I usually once or twice a week and then I run just for maintenance just for like met it like meditative running you know nothing hard so like longer distance was slower yeah but not even too long like three minutes three miles yeah nothing crazy that hill that Jackson loves to throw people up what is that all about that looks crazy it is crazy it's um coach Jackson always says if the mountain can't beat you nobody can beat you you know it's like the mother nature mother mother you know there's something about that steep ass hill too you watch everybody the whole team running up at you it's crazy well there's that one but then coach wink has another one and that one's just insane you can't sprint up it you like crawl up it and it really yeah it's ridiculous how steep is it it's so steep you can't run you have to like what you have to basically the first three Sprint's there's ten Sprint's to the top and then you and then you slowly jog back down because it's really steep but the first three you really can't sprint up but you kind of have to bear crawl up them the mountain as fast as you can as fast as you can but the one the hill of tears is crazy because they call it the hill of tears yeah it's like it goes up it goes up and then it goes up like when you think you're almost there it like cranks up even harder and then you have to get to the top and it'll test you for sure it can break you well that camp is known for its endurance like fighters that come out of that camp or are known for having great cardio yeah and how often do those Jackson make your Winkeljohn make everybody do those those hills depends we used to do them as team as teams quite a bit as a team quite a bit on the weekends but you know coach Jackson coach we just sit right here yep oh that's me that's my dog my Dobby it doesn't look like anything really oh it looks like it to me yeah I'm used to running hills I know what it's like though it's terrible looks like that yeah with its it's amazing how gravity is one of the best things to work with like get a good pitch good steep angle and try to run up that it's one of the best things for strength and conditioning for just conditioning your lungs and your ability to recover yeah yeah I I love it I think that um again it's another one of those things that can can really break you and I think it's just like a a theme like a consistent theme in fighting is is will you break yeah can you if you break then you're not meant for it you know or maybe you are and you just need to heal up and go back at it and try it again but we need in terms of your mental endurance I mean that's what we're talking about right we're talking about fortitude and your spirit your indomitable spirit when if you go back to when you first started fighting versus now like your tolerance must be through the roof like what you can tolerate what you can endure and your belief in yourself yeah all that stuff I feel evolves just like your skills do yeah and but it's crazy too because you know we all have our own separate journeys and I feel like when you first start fighting just like when you're a kid and you jump off of things and you you're fearless because you don't know what it feels like to get hurt and then you break your leg and then you're like well never doing that again you know yeah I feel like it's the same in fighting like you see a lot of amateur fighters or new fighters they go out there and they just do whatever because they're fearless they've never been knocked out they're never been hit they never broken anything and so they're just gonna go out there and and and be fearless and and then they get knocked out or submitted and then the next time they go out they're not as as free mm-hmm and I think the the truth the true test is to see if you know you can deal with those those challenges and allow it to to make you grow versus you know petrify you in and make you go backwards you know do you do any psychological training do you have a mental coach or a hypnotist or anything else I do I have a sports psychologist dr. Shannon and he's he's he's been working with me for my last two fights and I won all three fights and I think that's a big reason why for sure yeah I I think that is a a giant overlooked factor and some people get along great without it but could they be even better with it that's the really yeah I think so as well absolutely there's so much that goes into fighting that I think people don't see you know I think it's just like with anything in life how long it takes to make a movie versus the actual movie and and and what goes into that 15 minutes of a fight that nobody even knows you know not just eight weeks but your entire you know training before that you know for me it's you know I've been doing martial arts since I was ten and fighting professionally for over ten years and so it's an accumulation of all of those things but each fight presents its own problem and if you're not mentally prepared for it if you're not prepared physically if you're not prepared like spiritually emotionally like hormonal II if that's even a word everything has to line up that one night those 15 minutes or twenty five minutes in order for you to win and you can definitely beat yourself before you even step into the Octagon so what kind of stuff do you work on with your psychologist without giving too much away I talked him about this whole time because like my secret sauce right but how he explains is this everybody knows what you're supposed to do what you have to put in the work just like physically you have to put in the work like I can sit up here I can tell you what I do but it's not going to make a difference unless you actually put in the work to to just strengthen your mind mentally but we do a lot of so your opponent it's not like you can practice barring them because you've never fought them before and so how he explains it to me is it's just a repetition you know of the mind and so when so you just have to really I think explore your imagination and for us we we practice the fight in our head and some days are harder than others sometimes I win the fight in the first 10 seconds of the of the round sometimes it's all five rounds and and it's a war and and I win that way but you have to you have to see yourself going through every different scenario and there are millions in MMA and you just practice them over and over and over so it's essentially just going through that or do you do you prepare your mindset is for for for me I have a set of power words that's what he calls them power words one tell us what they are and so yeah again confidence flow vicious see mom champ mom champ yeah cuz you want to be the first mom champ yes sir healthy there are a couple of others as well mm-hmm but the one word is is not just a word it's like a whole thought process so when I say one word it it feeds into an entire feeling if that makes any sense hmm and so instead of having to have a conversation in my mind which takes way too long I just say confidence and it takes me where I need to be and eventually I won't you shouldn't even have to do that you should just be in the moment and just allow your your mind to connect with your body mm-hmm do you do any meditating at all yeah I mean I would say it's kind of a meditative I I would say it's more of a practice than it is a meditation because I'm not trying to clear my mind I'm really trying to focus on something specific right but outside of that you don't meditate I wouldn't say so maybe just maybe in my runs sometimes one one I just that's when I clear my mind how about you yeah I've been doing it a little bit but most of what I do I do when I get in the tank float tank I like float tank do you do you use one I have before mm-hmm it feels like you're floating in space yeah it's amazing does Jaxon's have won no they should you have one we should except you wouldn't want to go in there after God we have a hot sauna at the gym and there's tons of people there's tons of people so it gets good ya know I'm sure the hot Sun of those different than a float tank it's floating so personal it's just one little yeah uh-huh I they showed me yours and it felt hotter than the ones that I've ever done right temperature is it yeah okay 94 degrees that's what it should be yeah it should be the same as the surface is your body temperature right yeah it was crazy I remember doing it one time and I kind of drifted off and I remember almost waking up and feeling like I was like floating in space yeah sure almost like kind of panicked because I I didn't have a sense of where my what my where my body was yeah that's what triggers is weird psychedelic states but if you can find one and use it on a regular basis it works great with visualization and a lot of athletes UFC and other sports as well they use it for visualization like they'll think about passes like throwing a pass yeah and then watching someone catch it they'll they'll visualize things and go through the the technique in their head and I've done that what you just do as well done that with certain techniques that I was really trying to learn you could do it as if you're rolling you know like you just like picturing your body going through the different positions yeah yeah that's basically what we do with the mental training and it probably just take it up a notch in the in the float tank yeah I'm sure but a lot of times like when I meet up with my with dr. Shannon we meet up at at noisy places like Starbucks or you know or at a coffee shop or something like that I mean it's because he want he that that life is always going to have distractions oh that's interesting and you know you need to be able to focus with the structure especially me like there's so many things going on in my life with being a mother and a wife that sometimes I can use the distractions as an excuse to justify why I'm not getting things done or this or that and so that's something that I've really been working hard at is to not to not use those as excuses but more so to to to allow the distractions to happen and and and choose to stay focused anyways hmm there are there's quite a few women's MMA fighters now but it's still small in comparison to men when you meet young girls that look up to you do you recognize that you have you have a very very critical and it's a very small role there's an in small in terms of small amount of people providing that role yeah as role models to young kids that are thinking about fighting when a young girl meets you like oh my god it's the karate hottie like is it is it weird to you like what is that feeling like to you when you meet a young girl and you say oh my god this is me when I was 16 yeah it's amazing it really is to know that just through my story that I've touched people's lives you know I get approached a lot by by parents you know that are happy that I'm pursuing what what I'm pursuing even being a mom you know so I think that's really cool just because I feel like when I was pregnant how was your daughter now she's eight yeah so when I was that she was much younger for some reason oh yeah she's a shrimp that's why I saw the pictures when she was younger - I this might be too much information but after I had my daughter she's been - ever seeing one of my fights and I had my first fight back when I was ten months old and I was still breastfeeding I like breastfed her when she was ten months old not when you were sorry wow you had a fight while you were breastfeed yeah that was your first fight my first night back okay how many fights did you have before your daughter oh I had a good amount I'd say I don't even you've been fighting for ten years professionally it's 12 years mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah a good amount and I was 25 when I had her when I was pregnant but yeah I just remember being pregnant and being everybody talks about like postpartum depression but I was really depressed during my pregnancy I mean don't get me wrong I loved being pregnant and there was a lot of memories that I had with her being in my belly and me feeling her and all of this and that that those moments I treasure forever but I was depressed like I couldn't do what I wanted to do it's not like I could go out and you know I felt was feeling bad I couldn't just do the gloves on and go out and spar and hit somebody in the face you know did she do to relieve stress and I just I I watched everybody get better and I watched everybody progress and and fight and it you know it ain't me alive and I just I there was just so much uncertainty and so much unknown was my body gonna be the same you know was I gonna even want it was I gonna have time to do it there was just so much that I didn't know and so I was I was really down then and I um I get a lot of moms that approach me and they tell me that because I went back and continued to pursue my dream that they did - mm-hmm and I think that that's cool that is cool now when you say you had your first fight back 10 months that's that's a really for people that don't recognize that's a very short amount of time to rebound from giving birth and then get yourself back in shape and then get yourself at a fighting shape where you're like I'm ready to take a fight and then train for the fight I mean that is a incredible process to go through in ten months it was crazy it really was my body was when you when you have a baby your your bones kind of like shift apart from each other and you gain weight and I after I had my daughter I found out I well during my pregnancy I got gestational diabetes and um and I gained like 50 pounds I gained a lot like I looked like the blueberry on uh Willy Wonka the chocolate but um yeah I want to take you to bounce back were you in the gym again I probably stayed with my daughter for the first three months that I had her and I just wanted to be a mom I just wanted to be with her and I wanted to nurture her and you know enjoy my time with her and I think it was after three months where I was like I I want to kick somebody in the butt yeah come on I relieve some stress and coach wink and coach Jackson and all my teammates were so supportive and so I would come into the gym and I'd have you know my diaper bag in one hand and my gym bag in the other and my car seat and I'd come into the gym and I'd set it all down and I'd get wrapped up and she'd be in the car seat and she chill out and Wow she would start to cry coach wink or coach Jackson would pick her up and then you know they'd let me spar and you know she needed to get she needed to eat I would go to the room and feed her and then come back and and and we made it work Wow yeah so I started training for that and I really couldn't run to lose the weight because my joints and my bones were like all spread apart you know so when you say spread apart like what actually does happen well they I mean I don't know like all the science behind it but they just say that in order to like have the baby like everything kind of separates from each other your your bones like loosen and you're like more agile and loose and stuff like that and so you felt it I felt a big difference in the way your body performs yeah for sure I felt it and so instead of running I would swim from my cardio and that helped me hmm because it wasn't hard on my joints or anything like that it kind of helped me get back into shape and you kind of just you kind of just go with the flow and figure it out as you go it was really hard I was worried that I was worried that because I got back into sparring and this and that that I would go dry like my milk would go dry but I didn't it's just my body just figured okay this is what what you do and I still produce milk and everything and it was really sensitive at first to get hit and and then I just got used to the pain and then now I don't even have one of those like yikes yeah I would imagine you're yeah I mean if your memories you know they pop up yeah it's it's the body is just so amazing they'll like it'll it'll adapt to what it needs to adapt to and and when I trained it I got used to the pain and then it didn't hurt anymore and then you know my I would only produce as much as she needed yeah now when you fought Tenma it's pretty incredible for your daughter to have only seen you fighting that's got to be crazy too right you can't remember when you weren't fighting yeah my mom kicks ass yeah she is she's a really cool upbringing I I think like she's just she's she's surrounded by really cool people like she gets to meet the coolest people in the world and they're normal to her because that you know she sees John and Holly and you know that's that's auntie Holly to her anyway so like you know her expectations for for what she can be in life I think are way higher you know and I think because she's surrounded by people like that that she and and that's why I like to keep around because you know I my dad used to always tell me that we learned through our actions our parents actions you know you walk the walk you don't talk to talking so I think the best teacher can be my actions and for her to see it through her own eyes I can tell they're this this and this all day but but it's a different story when she comes to a fight with me and I'm the champion the 105 champion and I'm defending my belt and you know I bust my eye open to the point where you can't see it anymore and I lose my belt and for her to see that and for her to see that Mommy is okay and that failure is a part of life and that I still love what I do and I'm gonna still go after you know my set of dreams because failure is a part of your journey you know that's amazing lesson for a kid learn and to see that at a high level growing up with our mother on this giant stage in front of all these people in the crowd and television that's amazing for her yeah and because people ask me all the time like is aren't you afraid that she's gonna see you get her than this and that but why would you want to shield them from that stuff I know I know it's it's hard it's a hard pill to swallow you don't want your children to see you hurt and this and that but I'd rather her see it and be prepared for it you know because life isn't fair at life isn't sunshine and rainbows all the time it's challenging for her and challenging things for kids but that's how they grow mm-hmm you know that that's do you have when you think about your career do you have a timeline where you don't want to fight anymore how do you not like to fight for the belt this year this year yeah you're 30 33 33 mm-hmm so you're in your prime like right now that's like an athlete's promise like 32 like 35 36 yep you're in that zone I'm in the zone I'm confident I feel ready I feel like I've gone through my ups and downs I've I've gone through all the steps that I that are necessary for me to be confident to be a contender do you have a timeline when you want to stop I would give myself I don't know it just really depends on how my career goes but I would say three to four more years so you're just you're just in the zone right now you're just concentrating on getting things done fighting for a title you're not thinking about like planning the future I would like more children Wow I know my husband doesn't care for and my daughter doesn't even care for me to have my church she'd rather just be the three of us you know but I would like my children and I I have taken steps to to figure out what I'm gonna do when I'm when I retire as a fighter but I feel like this story needs to I I need to finish out the story from my own sake and for you know millions of other parents out there that you know have a dream and and don't give up on their dream and just because they have children it's a longer road but it's worth it yeah I hear ya now when you look at the division it's an incredible division now so talent stacked we don't know what's gonna happen with rose she means she's even said she might retire yeah and she's a very eccentric person I mean she's she's not motivated by money she's a very very unusual and I love how honest she is about her emotions yeah she's very strong I mean in terms of like her ability to broadcast that and tell everybody and project it so she was I thought felt like she was winning that fight and yeah she got caught with one of the craziest slam chaos we've ever seen I mean you got to go back to like Carlos Newton Matt Hughes to have a slam ko like that yeah I'm trying to remember I just won it's one of the best slam Kayo's of all time being Tito Ortiz Evan Tanner that was another one I mean slam ko is a rare and I love that it came from the smallest division in the UFC I think that is just amazing I'm I'm just so proud of the star weight division if I can say so but I do I think it's stacked I feel like in for my any fight that I have from here on out is championship caliber fight union yeah right for the belt like I want to go for the belt so that it's legit like we're fighting for the belt you know and after that it's a championship fight every time yeah when you're looking at that division do you have those two Jessica and ROG and we don't like and we do not know where roses head is at when she wants to do but if she wanted to have a rematch they probably would set that up yeah then you have you wanna you have Tatiana Suarez who's a beast you you have who else in the division stands out to you well Nina sure Deanna has to get through Nina first sure she kind of just riding under the radar she's badass and and maybe it's because and that's the problem that I've had too is that I'm not as vocal you know when she just she just goes in there and does her thing and and I think that a lot of people are overlooking her as well sure and and that's why I'm just I'm speaking out now this is what I want and Josh always jokes he says you get a hundred percent of what you don't ask for so I'm asking for it it's what I want you know but yeah there's there's Whateley so I know that they're they're trying to pump her and she's really good coming out of China and then you know obviously tisha Claudia and even the girls outside of the top ten our dangerous it's it's it's a stacked division and and it can go it's probably the most talented division I know for sure technically and heart driven I would say for sure now what have they said in terms of like what your future holds if they have anything lined up for you when do they say like if they're gonna come to you and say hey Michelle we'd like you to fight in July or August or September like when would they come to you I just feel like with the way that the rankings are working if I just take a fight outside of who is the current champ I'm gonna be in the same spot I've won my last few fights and I've gone down in rankings you know so um I I really would like to hold off to fight the champion because I feel like any other fight is going to either take me down or keep me in the same spot so I don't know what they're planning on doing with Tatiana and Nina but if they're trying to give them a shot before me I feel like I want the winner of that and let me and them hash it out to fight for the belt hmm so that would be what you would do is a second choice first choices you want to fight for the belt choices whoever's gonna fight for the belt let me fight her let me fight them first because Tatiana's only had seven fights nothing against her like she's you know she's played her case I have three times the money fights as she does you know I fought for about four I've been a champion before I've gone five rounds before I fought main event before I worked my way back up give me a shot let me be mob champ before somebody else does right that's what I'm saying because the only other person in that well cat Zingano you know I mean I don't know how our eyeballs doing right now I know that was a crazy situation to have all those fights in the AFC and never have someone get towed in the I like that before and obviously you know that's how Winkeljohn lost his vision yeah it's scary ya think that this is what we do and that there's very there are so many dangerous yeah I mean you you're in a wild business lady yeah but I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for the world I'd you know this is what I love doing so well that's awesome mm-hmm then you're in the right spot well obviously you know you ranked number seven in the world even it is got to be frustrating though that you have gone down in rankings even though absolutely and I just I don't know why they would argue for me not to get the belt to go for it you know everything is there the storyline is there yeah um it would be you know technique versus strength speed versus power this is you and Jessica yep yeah and um and like I said they were there there were millions of people rallying behind me because they want to see me you know get that belt and and I do too you know I'd love for my daughter to see that dream of mine come true and and for her to come in the Octagon with me and behold in that belt I think it would be an amazing moment yeah it's crazy watching kids see their parents win titles and how amazing is to them it's it's a it's a very strange thing to see like that oh my god you know my mom is a champ of the world or my dad's champ we've never seen it obviously from a woman but that my dad's a champ of the world yes it's a very powerful thing yeah so you in a holding pattern right now Sachin yep that's that's that's what we're doing what you asked for it um was it April March or April March April yeah we're just working we're getting better it's almost a year no this April this April what am I talking about yeah I thought about Karolina Koval cabbage that's right yeah I know it was a great fight um I wanted the finish but you can't force those things you know so I just gonna continue to do what I'm doing and continue to get better and what did you think of her loss to entourage that was crazy I feel like styles make fights hmm and it was the perfect fight for and Josh to showcase her knockout power because KK is a pressure fighter and she instinctively will go forward and throw when she is in danger and sometimes it works and sometimes it does it you know yeah and she throws hard obviously she put you wanna you know she buckled you on a couple times she's dangerous she's she warned against rose yeah you know so but yeah I think styles make fights and that's that's what happened with her in that situation what do you think and Raj is unusually strong yeah like freakish you know like you see when she grabs ahold of people and then dumps him on their ass like she's she's freakishly powerful to be able to like hit that single and elevate Rose that way and drop her on her head when you think about how strong you have to be to do that it's beautiful yeah beautiful to watch um she's a beast great technique as well no no doubt about it but man horse power that's her butter and I figure I honestly I I gave it to rose to win the fight it only takes a split second though to lose your focus and to get picked up and slammed down like that and then the fights over for the division that's actually probably good because it's exciting because it mixes things up a bit you have Johanna who is the dominant champion for so long Rose comes along to Pete's her and then Jessica dumps Rose in her head beats her in a fight that she was losing I mean there's like it's a hotbed of talent it's a 115-pound women's division is amazing right now yeah it really is yeah yeah and so that's what I'm letting that's exactly what I want and in the meantime we just we just get better beautiful weight we train and we get better I feel like what's gonna beat and Rajas um I mean Rose had rose was doing exactly what she was doing I think that role is actually kind of got a bit just just a little bit complacent and and like she's even said it herself it was a moment of of laziness a lapse yeah well it's easy to say I mean so hard after the fact to try to figure out what went wrong and why it went wrong what was going on in her head but clearly it was not lacing up the legs when she's attacking the Kimora she was elevated and dumped and and and I'm sure for a lot of her camp she's she was able to do that with with her teammates and probably pop off good submissions you know but in the moment of a fight for a championship belt in your hometown against a person that's bread and butter is a piledrive you know it it's just like stacks up against you well good luck trying to find someone as strong as well as her outside of me Valentino who she does train with I mean but Jessica and ROG is probably one of the strongest women in 150 pound division she's so damn strong so good luck trying to find someone to replicate that and try and you don't train that you don't judge don't train the piledriver like that's dangerous yeah that's one of the things that she does train Valentina though who's one of the strongest women at 125 Valentina's a tank that's a very strong woman but her style is different to show that she's a counter fighter and she picks and chooses when she wants to go and she holds you down drug her yeah like her takedowns are not on joshs takedowns right you know so I don't know it is one of the things that's so citing about the sport is that there are so many different ways to approach it there's so many different ways here's your way karate style there's you Lana's way Muay Thai you know there's some this jessica's way bulldog get a hold you take her down and you know in a lot of ways you want to also showed how to beat Jessica I just I feel the difference with your Manan rose is that Rose because this is just my opinion because Rose has it has shown to have more variety in her in her toolbox she's really good grappling and that's not that I don't think she's as she's not hesitant to go to the ground I feel like if if the situation allowed it she would go to the ground and even get a submission on and Wragge whereas with joanna she knows what she has to do to win and she'll be stubborn in that sense and do that for five minutes for five rounds consistently you know I mean mm-hmm and I feel like with Rose she's she will she'll take risks and and a lot of times it does work for her you know and sometimes it just doesn't yeah and that was just one of those times yeah just it's interesting to see her talk about fighting in period that she doesn't know if she has that in her anymore just to be mean to a person to hurt a person I thought that was really interesting yeah I love how honest she is but I also feel like a big part of her getting the belt was to know that she could you know to know that she could take down you wanna the invincible you know and then she did that and then it was like alright well now I know that I can and it's kind of like well I've already I've already accomplished what I wanted to accomplish I don't know maybe that's just me thinking out loud of what maybe she might be going through what might be going on in her mind you know let's say if you fought and Raj and you beat her and you become a champion would that take a significant amount of motivation away from you or would you have more motivation to defend it so we talked about this too because that's been such a huge goal of mine is to be the and I want to say two fights ago we started implementing visualizations of me
