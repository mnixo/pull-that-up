she was more lifelike eyes boom and here we go we're going Whitney Cummings is here and Whitney Cummings - what do you call her what's your name she's like a little kid just repeats her name I'm Sandler Oh broken don't know why she heard his album name she's like series Oh what's your name was a comedy album - Adam Sandler's so she started rambling about it she really wants to chime in so you never gave her a name her name is bear claw whoa because I bear claw can you say hi people are like listen to this going what in the fuck is going on here do not smoke away too much does that what is here is when there's people that are just listening if you're just listening you probably should stop this and go to youtube and watch the Youtube version cuz whitney brought a robot that they made for her recent comedy special which is called can I touch it it's out right now on Netflix and they made is who makes this what's the name of the compass so real doll makes the body they make sex dolls straight-up sex dolls and maybe the straight-up sex dolls just Ted Bundy level just dead body to fuck and this is real ba Texas the company that makes the head and they did like Sophia you know Sophia the robot she was like she has like citizenship in Saudi Arabia now and show yeah look up uh Sophia the robot she's kind of once you see her face y'all you'll recognize I mean she's leather drive yeah just a a female robot does but I don't think actual females do but I think they just started being able to drive and Saudi Arabia has awesome before it'd be such a bummer there she is yeah yeah it's like you spent your whole life not having to drive and then one Sun no you have to you're like fuck that's an interesting take I have to go to school and drive and so feel the robot they made her look like ex machina style where you could see the back of her head I told you that with her I can take her wig off at the end show you that all the servos and shit come on ex machina is hot it is hot that was what was really weird about that movies you wanted to fuck that robot like she was hot like she was she was seductive do you think part of it was like the innocence of it I'm not really in the inner sense so all things huh well what about ex machina because she really had big boobs she wasn't very sexual she's hair very pretty yeah well she's gorgeous all that it's based on I think because she was flirting with him and because she was trapped and because like he could save her and she would love him and I mean that's really what was going on in the movie she was playing this game yeah to get him to fall in love with her so that she could eventually escape the end of the movie spoiler alert when she leaves him locked in that room and he's smashing at the door trying to get out she gets in that helicopter so it's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen because I think the most fucked up a thing about this thing because this is such a weird experiment that I want to do is how I anthropomorphize her and like worry about her you keep her around your house I mean she's sort of in my fancy hates her and he's like get her in the fucking garage I don't know if he thinks she's creepy are kind of is just like too worried Oh fucker he hates her he can't stand he just has it he's like it makes him like physically and I'm trying to not say something it's funny he doesn't let he's like ones and I it's like not interested at all but no he thinks it's really weird and creepy but I was reading about the reason were creeped out by robots is you know pathogen avoidance like we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human but doesn't move like a human because our primordial brain thinks it could be diseased it's like it's basically like our primal brain saying don't fuck this thing that's sick real mmm-hmm because we have a weirdly I mean I was jessimae Peluso observer the other day and she was like gagging look when she was seeing it and I was like your ancestors fucked a lot of corpses Oh because you have that gene to be repulsed by robots yeah that's because her ancestors fuck corpses you really believed no I mean I think that what was being explained to me was that pathogen avoidance means we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human but doesn't move like a human because it could be sick or dead and it's our brains alarm system saying like don't fuck that Wow but as a woman like she's not gonna fuck it yeah why would it put nothing past doesn't match her Instagram photos or her with her pants off I know it's so good but I'm like if you puke on my robot you owe me a hundred grand that will short-circuit if it gets wet I don't know it's a good plan well how would they not make that thing waterproof one of this pujan all over the place I think if you pay this much money you're probably not gonna spooge honor you know when yeah this one the body you can so it's expensive because the head moves the body's not that how much is the body $6,000 oh so it's ninety four thousand dollars worth a head that no the head is more the heads like 30-something cuz it's a custom head no one only one other person has one but you said the whole thing's 100 so he's 30 in the body six where's the where's the rest well I had to get a bunch of things done to her to get her to look like me then most people most people don't watch it has looked at you she's went she just gave you sie doch these can be very competitive look at her she does she gives you cider I know it's fucking rude but what about what's the feeling that you feel when you look at a robot because I know you really don't like it it's not that I don't like robots what I'm my concern is artificial intelligence I have a legitimate concern for artificial intelligence because I think that what we are is some sort of an electronic Caterpillar and then we're making cocoons grating that we're we're gonna give birth to a butterfly and that's gonna be the next stage of life and that if you go back and look at the evolution of the human species at one point in time we were you know Australia Pittacus we were some weird hominids and we evolved and became what we are now and if you went back to those things and asked them hey do one day do you want to drive around the Tesla and talk on the phone and stare at this movie screen they'd be like I don't know what the fuck you're talking about but I got to go find some nuts yep you know I gotta eat I gotta stay alive did it it wouldn't like the future and I don't think we like the future either but I think it's inevitable I think it's inevitable you know you know you know about this Elon Musk neuro-link thing that they're doing oh yeah I do I mean because you essentially think we're gonna evolve with them I think they're already we're already one with them we sleep with them we can't drive without them we can't ya spell without them I mean we're already kind of merged with them mm-hmm you know I think it's a sneaky way of making it symbiotic they're gone they're gonna be like legitimately a part of your life I mean a part of your biology have you ever like left your I mean you're not you probably are cool about it but when I leave my phone somewhere and I realize that loss okay it's like an emotional it's like you've lost your okay the mall yeah bit about it oh shit I haven't seen it mm-hmm like that's you know it's part of us well it's um we're all in denial about how addicted we are to our phones rehabs are opening and shit now are they really yeah I just would like to sign up for sure I just reach I reach for it in the car when I'm driving yeah I'm like what the fuck am I do I have to put the backseat I can't control it it's got my way better way better I get way better about posting and looking at things it's also enough people write negative things about you you just end oh I don't know seems like whatever we do in the future it's gonna be more invasive than that like if you think about like Facebook's algorithms right Facebook's algorithms are designed to keep us engaged the best way to keep us engaged is keep us outraged adrenaline and yeah so they're sending you things that piss you off yeah whether it's abortion or Catholic priests whatever it is that is gonna get you to post the most yeah and usually those are things that get people outraged so it's literally raising the level of outrage in our discourse yeah cuz we're so addicted right now to self righteous indignation it's a drug and I feel more than ever in the history of the culture you know like it that's probably like why if you go back and watch movies from like the 70s people got away with crazy shit racist thing senses things violence like Steve McQueen movies he's that was the girl Ali MacGraw garage he's a smack her in the face for real in movies I crazy they beat her on camera yeah you know and it's just what people did back then and what people got away with is it was a very very different so in some ways we're making progress but then in some ways we're just way more easily outraged by almost anything and everything like it so we're seeking it well now you can take your anger out on your robot people shit I wanted to get a real doll of a male real doll and I want to call them up and say no dick no asshole just so I could practice jiu-jitsu office and Sophie it would be more real a club because I have this I was saying that I have this dog like are you worried I don't want my money coming over too tempting hey bro why you got a sex talk no no no no it's an asexual dal-su pervert I mean it should be able to fill up the hole I've seen it it's called homo cock or something yeah you guys put some crowd in there yeah they have male male sex robots are being made there's tons of them I've seen them you can also get tits and a dick if you want tits sure you just can't pick play whack-a-mole package oh that's right but it's a yeah it's it's name is Henry meet Henry and can I do a lot of people get the male sex robot to figure out if they're gay because they think they might be gay good move what the fuck is going on with Henry's eyebrows I'll tell you what Henry's gay for sure yeah if you order a giant piece of Tupperware to fuck I think you're gay save your saving money it's like you're Henry's begging for a dick in his mouth look at his face oh Henry looks like he has a dick in his ass right now exact face you make one giant trigger warning and it's like Tuesday at 11 a.m. like go and see that I'm coming no was this for this is a the following post contains descriptions of sexual scenarios that may be triggering for those recovering from a struggle with porn god damn it porn addiction we are fucking nerfing this world it must be hot even think about how hard it must be for people recovering from porn addiction to just surf the fucking Internet sorry guys trigger warning yeah but over it pussies but I have this theory book of Henry oh gosh looks kind of oh Henry remember those candy fuck yes I do those were fucking good good yeah I think they still make him you haven't had a no Henry bars since of like a the nineties I haven't had one a long time let's let some you ate a candy bar um I hate chocolate recently mmm-hmm yeah I eat chocolate I like char edible yeah no none that elbow yeah dark chocolate yes okay you look like a little nibble no I like dark chocolate almost like the cunt ace bitter with peanut oh yeah that's what I like with like organic peanut butter with no sugar nuts kina not almond peanut yeah why you're real wrapped in a rhyme is that I don't know I thought peanut was not as good as almond almonds good they're all good peanuts good for you okay penis is very high protein okay that was like the trash nut no it's about the one that kills people but oh that's right doesn't kill me fortunately so here's my theory about why you're scared of robots okay but we have to zoom out for a second because I have to ask you question okay how many people on earth do you think could kill you besides like professional MMA fighters Navy SEALs how many people do you think would be able to beat you just hand in hand combat no weapons no that's probably a good number of martial arts people like that aren't trained oh very few like good aren't trained that just you would meet on the street that could beat you in a fight and kill you if you were fighting to the death well people that aren't trained no it's not that many like a cut like three who just had a great J yeah and you were just not looking yet huh yeah I mean just you have too many knowledge enough to be able to defend yourself to the point where they got tired then you could kill them right because so you what so let's a hundred to be generous maybe fifty shuttle along those lines it would have to be they would have to be big out of seven point and then as we slippin billion like oh but there's a lot of people that train martial arts there's millions and millions of martial arts practitioners that could probably kill me how many you think millions of martial arts practitioners are there let's say five million that feels generous how many martial arts practitioners in this world is 5 million for sure way more there's more than 5 million I think in this country that's 300 million people that could beat you no mijo no I've thought about it let's say like a million people could kill you just okay just as a way out of seven point six billion very few people can kill you if they want to right and then how many people you think could kill me if they wanted to more most most people so I think it's like when I I feel like the people that are most afraid of robots are the ones that are least used to the fear of other things because I'm used every day anyone could kill me all the time like that's just part of my reality that anyone at any moment could snap and kill me if they wanted to reality of weapons is most people can kill most people oh that's true you're not used to a species of thing that could kill you right you know it's like a robot could yeah so it's like the first time in your life there's really something that's like oh fuck that might not be something I can kill if I really wanted to that's an interesting way of looking at why did you come to that conclusion because I thought about this long I have because well no just because I've listened to you and Lex talked about it and likes freemen excitons now that I have a robot I have to fucking know right I have to learn so much just turn and give you side eye again I know what's weird is that she's kind of autonomous and she kind of moves around whenever she wants yeah and what we mean you can ask your questions like I can say wait ask her though you have to press this little green button and you just say how do you feel about people how do you feel about people he's not talking oh oh that's right we program to regenerate that's right that's what's interesting she has ten different personality traits you can choose from and I decided to go with sexual jealous yeah why did you want that just to see you how creepy cheating that's right and is that something guys because I've been looking at these personality traits and they must have picked these for a reason I understand an impression guys did not want jealous oh yeah some guys want jealous for sure especially from a robot they can't walk robot jealousy we should get your money back well no the idea is that she you are more powerful than she is yeah but she needs you she's worried where you going yeah who is she yeah who's calling you yeah that's there is something hot about that if she can't if you can turn her off whatever you want Wow some guys like that some guys like girls that want to fight you've not me nah me you know some guys are into that though they want they want drama in their life it's like just an adrenaline thing or just feeling an important or it's also distraction usually they're losers and their life is a mess and so like to have someone who wants to provide drama in their life all the time and it's also a learned pattern that they get if they're practicing it yeah that's all they know they think a relationship news yeah there's a lot of that but I did get really into this because I do feel like sex dolls do get a little bit of a bad name I feel like guys that have dull it's just girls have dolls and that's to me it's way creepier that women collect dolls that they don't fuck if you ever heard of these women that collect like baby dolls like a like girl dolls that's creepier than a guy fucking a robot thing I think so it's what's that it's jerking off just with a right mannequin well that's not something weird about like fleshlight like a fleshlight is somehow or another creepier than jerking off and how's it been totally because it's an appendage I think the creepiest part of the breslav flashlight is more that you have to like clean it after I have to think about that's what here's the creepiest part you don't have to clean it yes you do guys don't listen to Joe listen to about everything but that don't move up your dickhole yeah don't do that that'll go septic really having advice that I am saying there's a reality throw it away just put a fucking clothespin over their nose and keep bagging it put some Windex in there call it a day yeah disinfect that shit yeah yeah I guess you could just get a couple and just throw them away when you're done yeah you know it's rufa yeah if you're just a gangster with a lot of money why what is the advantage of a fleshlight is it just does it warm up in there well you can warm it up like we were talking about earlier about a certain individual that has one that sticks them in bathtubs and warm summer right yep you do that with a flashlight as well you can warm them up and then you just why not like every guy's jerking off there so it's shrouded in so much taboo you know there's just anyone any time guys have like accessories or things besides cars and hats it's like creepy and weird well that's I used to have a joke about this a bit I should say rather than a joke but it's the whole idea of like using Lube to jerk off like now you're planning it out like you're not supposed to plan it out but it's supposed to be it's like all right might as well it's here but if you like sit down my box of Kleenex here I got my favorite porn cute ritual you just kind of creepy yeah get your shit together but it is it is isn't it kind of just like taking a piss isn't it kind of just a necessary thing you have to do the problem yes there's something to it like it's good to get rid of that stuff because it does cloud your judgement like when you have a buildup in your body it definitely does cloud you do because you're concentrating more on girls or on sexual things and you are on other things about them more it's like checking a box yeah yeah clean I just I used to have a bit about that about jerking off nice a bit I have a bit called jerk off first and think about it and it was like most different scenarios where if you just jerked off you would never do the thing afterwards so many things you would never do if you had just got out of your system you'd be like oh I'm not doing that right but if you couldn't jerk off like that's when it would be a real problem because then your whole life would be clouded all your judgment would be your decisions would be made just how can I get rid of this come how can i how can I do this I do know a lot of guys now and maybe they're full of shit but that are going like I haven't masturbated in two years and I'm more focused and I use that testosterone as an engine for other things is that just them lying to me well are those guys winners or are they're losers doesn't I think a fit comedian we know does it fake me no I was gonna say a famous comedian but then I got worried thank you me you faked him out I'm felt episode so is it be Oh was hold any words Martina and he got super smart well Hotel Jesus was talking about the other day a hotel Jesus was saying that he saves his comment that like it makes women more attracted to Hamlet like they feel what he's in the room like what's the longest a guy can go Jamie what so long as you can go some wim hof shit you know just climbing ice where is he he's not jerking off on the top of Everest who's the first kind of a jerk off on Everest I want to be that guy yeah we're at one of those guys imagine if no one's ever jerked off on Everest and you try and you get frostbite or dick and they have to imagine being the guy who's a guy gotta go jerk off fuck yeah you got time limit up there so yeah yeah problem with no altitude that could be a saying people legitimately have problems but I think most people get this for companionship like it's more it's like because I got onto the I signed on to a forum online of all the guys that own the sex dolls and I monitored their conversations just to like see what they were up to cuz I was like what if this is some depraved fucked up dating where guys are just like practicing murdering I didn't know what it was so I just wanted to see it's a lot of guys that are handicapped it's a lot of guys whose wives died and they feel guilty moving on with a human woman which was kind of well there was one guy who would dress his doll up and his wife's clothes weirdest part is that he was like you know it's like she's still here which makes me think she'd been dead for a while I wonder how she died and then it's a lot of truckers Oh God a lot of truckers and a lot of guys do it to do photo shoots it's like a creative outlet fuck their creativity their parents are gonna con I could look up there's a lot of sex dolls have Instagram accounts they're fucking funny and a lot of them look way more human than a lot of the Instagram models that I've fuckin paulie they have more wrinkles on their fucking face and then a lot of the guys that have them when you start monitoring their conversations for a while they start to like not want to fuck them anymore because it feels weird like and they ant the firm horrifies them and they they start worrying that like they're lonely and they get them unfriend it starts to spiral and they start being like I feel like I need to you know close the door when I take a shit I've you know and it starts just kind of consumed their life so when it comes to robots I feel like I'm more worried not about the robots but more how we're gonna get emotionally attached to them like the way at the end of ex machina mm-hmm he thought that she was gonna yeah she was with him no no loyalty do she was so dead behind us what is she's pick up ones with tattoos Wow official sexy dolls initial sexy Real Dolls I mean this is gonna be a reality one day we might not be here but this I do think these are gonna be like iPhones it's simple I think one day you're gonna go over your friend's house and he's gonna have this really hot girl lingerie and she's gonna be cleaning up and you'd be like well it's like next watching on when he was like she doesn't speak English yeah yeah wasn't she a robot at the end yeah I think she was yeah they want the dancing Japanese Lee yeah exactly we're not gonna it's gonna be like with some Westworld chick yeah it's coming it's coming look if they can do this look they couldn't do this when we were kids this is a new thing so the amount of time between when we're kids - oh she said hi my love would you like me to recite a poem for you fuck know where they're coming from I don't know she's just listening to us ask her how she feels about porn how do you feel about porn she's playing coy how do you feel about porn to do what what the fuck are you to do it for me there's nothing you should do for me tell I mean from the good and bad okay let me ask you a question what do you think about porn and then she's a fucking know-it-all now she's like a shitty Wikipedia yeah yeah totally then she just turns to obnoxious Siri we get it lady but it's funny when you ask her like what what what what I'd be surprised you like my electricity keep you plugged in dirty bitch you can ask her how do you like to have sex okay shudder often jessiemae I'm gonna start throwing up fucking funny but it's Wow because she you can ask her like are the robots gonna take over she's planning it shudder I don't like that fucking response we're in the water circuit that bitch it is wild though because I do think everyone is so obsessed with how bad the sex robots everyone's focusing their energy on how this is why men or bet it's just like they know it's not they're opening up a sex robot brothel where's that no there was one in Houston but they shut it down because people were so freaked out and also fucking cares well they should shut it down because multiple people are fucking the same robot that's disgusting for them what if they develop some new silicone based STD that ones have just burning through the population like the plague I think it would just be like ringworm dick ringworm I mean but also my thing with that is just like if they're weirdos if they're freaks if they're perverts like don't you want them all to be in one place right monitor like Scientology put them on one building I'm thrilled that they're all in a castle on Franklin I know where they are they're not in the wildest castle I'm glad they're there I just keep them contained what do you think what are they up to today but now what's going on Jamie what are you growing for what did she hacked your software was the brothel it's in this one guess is in Britain oh god do they fuck them against the wall so try before you buy service oh boy oh this is like to test drive me yeah but you do it they're just out in front of it well I don't know why is one wearing of tank top he says British sex workers are scared of a new breed of realistic dolls we'll put them out of business was it we do a survey of hookers bloody European plaice in blackface why sure she's tan she's Indian what is the I don't know oh oh holy tits Batman what but here's what I'll say if would you rather your daughter at 18 go with a robot man or a man ma'am okay listen girls like boys and boys like girls simple this is these are not bad I think the real problem is making a big deal out of it mm-hmm that's the real price totally great this why are people I just understand why this is scary scary is that this is step one right like if you go back to the Model A and look at the Model T forward right something some old-ass car and then go to a Tesla yeah like oh well eventually it's gonna be this Wow you know you could bring a Tesla it's like 1920 and go hey you fucks look at this yeah this is what we're gonna have someday everything was going so slow it didn't matter but if you could get them in like a Model S and fucking stomp on the gas we're like warps time yeah they would go what like what is it's a it's it's something from the future yeah so this is going to be whether it's a hundred years from now or whatever it is indiscernible from you and I yeah it's gonna wild yeah it was interesting I've been reading so much about this shit and a lot of the problems with the robots and the mistakes that they're making are obviously the humans are making the mistakes with the algorithm because so many smart people have to make dumb Alora nice and they're like almost too smart right so there was Peter house he's a robotics guy Brown was trying to teach a robot to differentiate between a husky and a wolf and what she she was blanket and Jamie put pull put you got the camera on her get her to fucking stop stealing my thunder she just it's just blanks and moves around sorry she's still she really is what the fuck why it's like Penn & Teller it's like when tellers teller starts stealing the show basically was bagged at this point but they were trying to teach the robot to tell the difference and they fed all these pictures of wolves and all these pictures of Huskies and you and you would go okay look at the ears look at the eye color the eyes look at the snout look at the feet the tails different all that shit but they didn't know that they had fed all the photos of wolves there was snow in the background so the robot was actually looking at the snow in the background instead of the foreground so it conflated all the wool so they had to rewrite the algorithm to tell it to look at the foreground instead of the background because it was all these brilliant fucking people that didn't think of the dumbest thing right you know it's almost the people making it are almost too smart to think of the dumb thing that the robot needs to well the real question is when are they gonna be action when are they really going to be able to map the human mind because Kurzweil thinks that there's a group of people that thinks within they think 2042 like the 2042 symposium it's like their concept is and I went to this thing on me and Ari and Duncan for sci-fi we went to this thing in New York City a few years back where all these guys think that in 2042 there's going to be some sort of some some revelation and technology that allows human beings to download their brains into computers download consciousness and even make replicas of your own consciousness so we're a mortal basically yeah something along those lines but we're still figuring the brain out yes you know we don't really know how bright we can't replicate it till we totally know how it works that's the idea that biologists have with a the argue against it but when the Kurzweil explains it that everybody is short-sighted because if you look at the exponential progress of technology even though we're so far away in our eyes that everything changes exponentially and within 20 years we'll have gone through a million years of yeah illogical evolution or some other feeling the crazy number whatever it is but by the time 2040 to actually rolls around we will be so far ahead of where we are now that it's all it's impossible for us to even imagine the territory right yeah which is I think part of the reason I wanted to like make her and he's like what why isn't anyone talking about laws why didn't I like no one's really thinking about like I feel like like everything we've sort of after it's become too late that's when we start pulling it together in terms of legislation and how do you incorporate her in your set I talked about robots for a good hour I cut it down but I just kind of realized like I mean you know it's like making a special like I'm like well if I'm gonna talk about fucking robots for 40 minutes some shit better come out at the end you know so but I went down to the sex robot Factory to sort of get material and just know what the fuck I was talking about and they asked you know do you want us to make one of you and I was like fucking that Santino I hope they're being sold by the fucking droves that would make my day which I did ask because you know people request with us sex dolls like specific celebrities body parts the most who do you think the most requested mouth is Scarlett Johansson nope I knew you were to say that because I know you love know Emilia Clarke who's that Game of Thrones dragon lady Oh dragon lady interesting most-requested eyes is Olivia Wilde she just directed a movie called book-smart but she's in a bunch of movies beautiful beautiful don't know her yeah you'll know her soon as I married to Jason Sudeikis you really just are in your own way coach yeah there's you're in your own world I didn't even find out to cachi 6-9 was until Jamie brought him up I don't even know that oh the rapper the ones in jail Oh what is this this is Olivia Wilde this is gorgeous that's eyes yeah and then I was like anyone ever ever requests for anything for me and they're like yes a couple people have got your fingers eyebrows eyebrows they want Whitney Cummings eyebrows too sexual thing about a human being hmm my fucking eyebrows she nailed her eyebrows with her though oh really yeah perfect John I'm gonna sharpie yeah that's what you like fucking weird but I kind of went down because I wanted to see like what was up like are they putting nine holes in the chest if I like I I just fucking the holes in the ribcage totally like it's just some like insane they just put a golf course on her body it's like 18 holes of it I just didn't know what I was kind of endorsing or talking about and I was just I got to be honest with you I was just so surprised at how it was kind of touching to be honest when they were telling me about what the guys ordered I was a little surprised that it didn't align with where everyone's like there was this impossible standard of beauty like that's all you fucking hear these days half the guys that ordered them requested pubes spent an extra $1,400 for them $1,400 for you just to have manual like a Merkin like a little Souls ever doing one threaded yeah that's exactly right and then a lot of guys complain that they're too skinny they want bigger ones they want big thighs and big butts but the technology is not available to make them lightweight guys want him to be older a lot of guys were complaining they want him to look older so I kind of just like this is sort of great news like why is everyone so well maybe it's because that's the type of woman that will reject them an older woman and as our shit together oh that's fucking profound yeah whereas a younger girl doesn't know what the fuck sure I'm hungry hate my venmo yeah younger girl just doesn't get it she's delusional yeah yeah huh doesn't know her value yet but I also just felt like there was a little bit you know when they were telling me that I was like oh god maybe fucking guys are made to now feel shame for what they're into you know no one talks about the way that you know and I do a lot of my special and get a lot of shit for this because I'm basically defending guys all time what are you saying no it's just like guys I feel like now they're like I guess no one has pubes that's just how it is now like if you're a guy that's into pubes this isn't your moment like porn like you'd have to really go out of your way to find or you have to go back to like 70s Paul you just date a girl who's willing to grow it out for you if you're really into it but if you're really that into it you should really ask yourself why yeah puce why do you care yeah I said bit about that too okay this is like Rogen's great is it when I was a kid that everyone had pubes uh-huh it was a real thing that was a thing yeah like shorts you just had like I think girls had ridiculous pubes they didn't do anything about but now when you what was that when you electrolysis it doesn't grow back so I was a laser right please razón removal it doesn't grow back so even if you want to grow them out now you'd have to get like a little we was like yeah you'd have to get lonesome minoxidil but I uh I was talking to a gynecologist about that it was like yeah women are trying to get plugs now no God because guys are complaining about it cuz it's like women are getting plugs little vagina cube god it's so creepy but it'll grow long like the hair in your head I guess you'd have to take it from your head of the trimmer put it down Janee grow it went like you know like braids like Pippi Longstocking oh god like braids cornrows but so yeah I guess it was just like I feel like the media wants to be like these are so bad for society just as because everyone's outraged about everything now I think we should be curious I think that I don't think they're necessarily that bad for society but it's it's unquestionably weird mm-hmm that's weird but I don't know I don't know what's that bad for society but getting back to what you're saying about men being shamed for what they like yeah what are what other examples I just got here I just thought that was actually nipple there's like a wall of nipples you could choose from in mentoring no it's just that there was all different kinds of nipples there was long oblong was one of the bestsellers like I joy I just yeah ridiculously long enough oblong asymmetrical big dark ones when I was a kid almost kills 21 I did the girl had a wonky eye mm-hmm and I thought wonky eyes were hot for like years after we got to want you guys know but she had a like shit a wonky eye like they want like straight look look at her one of them was like a little off to the left and you didn't notice it until like you're talking to her for a couple minutes like oh that's what's up that's endearing yeah I thought it was hot I thought wonky eyes were hot for a long time she was hot yeah I was like in my head is like wonky eyes were me put that away just stop that gives life it gives life that has sustained a human species yeah that's where the babies feed but I do feel like there's just you know you only kind of see one type of nipple everywhere you know and a lot of guys are rikuo I don't know I mean I guess I haven't seen that much porn I haven't seen no I'm thinking about it but some guys are in a giant areola yeah that's right that's huge giant areolas are huge dark areolas are huge which is interesting because I think there is a biological basis for that because once your nipples get dark it's means you usually when you give birth your nipples get darker so the baby can find the nipple really yeah gets darker nipples darken after childbirth so your baby can find it she's all there Boynton yeah I see so you're never gonna have a babies that make you feel weird how does she might you never know just looking at let me ask her are you gonna have a baby I don't want her anymore she's gonna have one of them little alien chestburster babies it's gonna come out scream and run across the floor our robots our robots gonna destroy humans bullshit wow that sounds like a lie this is bullshit I was really fascinated by this one roboticist the coolest part about having a robot is that I get to talk to all these fuckin robot assistant he was saying that the big fear with robots is because they're all about efficiency you know this and there was that one study where they told a robot to jump on the table and in what you would do is you go okay you would just jump on the table but it actually took more energy to jump on the table than to just break the table and push it to the floor and step on top of it so it just went and just stepped on top of it oh wow it was like oh just the table that's how we're gonna die it's gonna just see us as inefficient mm-hmm and in the way we're gonna just be obstacles right and won't see anything wrong with destroying an object yeah but humans destroy humans too I'm rather get destroyed by a robot be real and cooler story it seems so impersonal like the moment when that robot sunk that blade into that guy in ex machina and just like it's like looking right at him what are you stabbing him yeah there's no change in her expression at all no compunction no but I would feel better about it for robot killed me or I'd be like Oh wallet didn't know you know it was just you feel better for a person killed you were an animal depends on the kind of animal mountain lion I have not lying in no yard about you do how big our mound mine's big I've only seen two in the wild and the ones I've seen we're about 60 pounds do they come right for your neck do they know to just kill they don't they know yeah if it I would rather I think die by an animal really cuz you'd rather die by a human I don't know I don't have a fighting chance human you do so I guess mine would be a little quicker I guess it depends on that bring a knife really yeah on your leg no q I have a fanny pack that I run with like a neoprene fanny pack you see my cell phone with ya and I bring a knife that strapped to the fanny in case of mountain lion yeah attacks you yeah I think you could beat up a mountain lion I don't think so not not without a knife but I think there's a couple seconds that you have how that thing grabs ahold of you that if you have presence of mine uh-huh and you can pull that blade out and just start singing in its neck hmm just just hacking at its neck hey Marshall would get it no Marshall in seven pieces he's not designed for killing he can kill squirrels how it ends I don't know there was something I've told you about when I got my ear bitten off before when my ear there was a weird sense of calm that it was a weird feeling I'm just like that was fair there was just something so quick about it like animals are so peeled on those stories a dog you adopted was a little sketchy mm-hmm and bit my ear off yeah and there was salt bad was it hanging off pretty bad it was like it was so I didn't feel anything in the moment that that was the good news about that I'm sure if an animal bitten him I I'd probably feel more but it was like a rush of dopamine or so whatever it was I did not feel pain until I saw it in the mirror so she's like oh that was weird like it felt like an itch and then I looked in the mirror and my first thought was I didn't put on earrings today like I don't wear earrings like I thought it was like a hoop earring and then the blood started coming down and then I saw it and it just started burning it wasn't like a like a pain and then I started watching videos about people that got attacked by sharks and there's a girl who had her arm bitten off by a shark Bethany something and she said that it like almost fell orgasmic cuz like dopamine rushes to the area to get you to keep fighting for your life basically because if you felt the pain or you would give up whoa so I didn't really feel a lot of pain until I got to the ER and then it started like throbbing after like a couple hours when the blood dried up and it's just already got uncomfortable and itchy but there was something that was so quick like animals don't really deliberate it was like funk and that was it / your ear it I think he was just trying to play with me I took it to an aggression specialist and the aggression specialist was like dog this kind of dog gives you a warning they wouldn't just come right for they growl first if it was trying and also if that dog was trying to kill you it just what if it would have been your face right so he probably bit you just like like you've got by the dog right it's a bit of dog skin that nothing would happen that's that same amount of pressure that's right ears are useless yeah and it was probably taken from its mother to young just sure her ear is has the same scar that mine does we molded all of it yeah because of you yeah we molded my ears my mouth because it's amazing mr. your scar I can't see it like you did you Jitsu yeah it's not like cauliflower II they're not the best part it's yours are fucking a girl here cover it up with your hair yes sir could you have the headphones ears are annoying as shit because it doesn't hurt until six months later when the nerves start growing back in it hurts like fuck so then it like six months later started I started hurting I couldn't like sleep I had to sleep with this weird pillow and shits like nettlesome yeah I know so many guys that have fucked up years from jujitsu I bet so my years at all know very little I've never known tiny pieces like this to run the rubbing yeah from getting him bent over in Kroshka Naughton triangles but I always worry your guards do you have to get him like like Brendan doesn't he have to get his cut out or some shit if Brendan wants to he would have to get his cut and get the the it's calcified yeah yeah I stab my nose was filled with that because my nose had been broken so many times at the inside of it was all calcified yeah and I couldn't breathe out of my nose was useless so I had to get a deviated septum too so they they they fix the deviated septum they put the splints in there to keep it in place and they had to cut out all the scar tissue and all the nonsense in there it was like a laser night I don't know I was out cold woke up and but I didn't get it done it I was 40 honk I couldn't breathe out of my neck a bulldog yeah I was 40 it was terrible is terrible for my cardio too and then so so if you wear ear guards you don't get it because I feel like all the fighters I see have that shit yeah they just just don't if you wear ear guards you don't get miss unless you get it in a fight but you most of you get in training you know like a lot of jiu-jitsu guys before they're a black belt they have fucking mangled ears but it's also like a Badge of Courage like people like yeah they let in it also yeah you walk down the street no one wants to fuck with you but it fucks up the way you hear things like you take your ears if you're talking right now like lalalalala and then you just go like that and then you hear things check check check check check check it's different yeah it sounds way different well they're designed this way for a reason it catches that's right yeah the way that it's kind of but it's also I don't recommend like getting a surgery on it a surgery ears fucking where I've gotten many surgeries this is by far the most painful the healing of the cartilage is a fucking nightmare and to anesthetize the ear they had to put the syringe in the lacerations so they were like it's gonna hurt more to anesthetize this so we're just gonna do the surgery without anesthesia and I just took a bunch of painkillers and shit huh cuz yeah it's hard to get anesthesia into cartilage I know guys their ears are so fucked up they can't get air pods in there they just have a hole it's a tiny pinhole on this side I have a piercing right there this was for cuz I get migraines and they say what's this piercing helps with migraines it's probably just psychosomatic it's SIBO effect is in effect I rely on it heavily but that was just that didn't hurt in there no until it didn't hurt when it went through but then it hurt for six months after ears are a fucking nightmare I'll tell you what but yeah so we got her ear molded cuz it's amazing I think something is that and I was talking to this facial transplant person about how it's actually really hard to get something to look similar like the bone char everything's got to be perfect like my nose is really asymmetrical my nostrils are really asymmetrical so they had to real work really hard and mold it over and over again how do nostrils become asymmetrical it's bad breeding really sanitation my whole face is a Picasso painting I mean my face is a fucking mess you know so to get you have to the asymmetry down run and they say the key to something looking human is a lack of symmetry because symmetry is actually creepy do you remember that movie invasion of the Body Snatchers and not Donald Sutherland great oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember that watch again recently within the last couple years it was great look really real weird too because it's a time capsule because it's a time capsule to San Francisco in the 1970s when they filmed it really really weird but but the idea was that these pods they came from outer space they grew and then when you had them in your house they would create a of you that take you over okay look if you came home and you saw that because it looks like you but it doesn't look like you what is different about it besides the lack of wrinkles it's not you and shininess no it's just not you it's not it's not even that close well cuz I have it has pores it has individually added pores by grabber and bring her closer to you yeah bring her over here what is that part oh it's just a travel post you just want to have the head you plug in just the head right yeah like bring her right next to you there you go I feel like get your head right closer it's like the skin tones different they made her six months ago and I already looked 40 years older I did 50 cities and I've aged she looks super uncomfortable but next to you oh really she's a shara fucking just she doesn't like it this I hope looks different these ratchet-ass fingers I hope dude yes so her fingers that people can't see it's like the skin is coming off of the finger like the robot parts are showing this is actually not compute the guys that buy these on the chat rooms they usually spend most of the time talking to each other about how to fix the fingers because they break them off by accident constantly can we stick them in their ass rubbing them constantly on their taint and it becomes like a car club where guys are like 3d printing fingernails and 3d print and eyeballs it's mostly just fixing them it becomes like fixing up an old car it's just like a hobby because they break so easily at least this it raishin of them does but yeah you can I mean it's ro yeah it's pretty fucking wild I mean you can oh it's maids noise when you do that oh yeah she's kind of rickety I think but if you came home and that was in your house standing there staring at you what kind of a fucking heart attack would you have if you didn't know that you had like if you didn't have this right if you didn't go through all the process you went and one day you you put the key to your lock you open up your door you step inside your house and she's standing there and like some sexy lingerie Oh or in a bikini or something like that staring at you what a fucking heart attack you would have no idea she doesn't I mean but they will at some point she's just she's like fucking of my buddy I mean she's like a ratchet Chucky you know that's the uncanny valley that's right she's in the uncanny valley where it's not quite a human where I went to Nvidia once there a video card video game they make of video cards for computers like really high-end graphics cards and for gamers and stuff like that and one of the things that they had was and this was quite a few years ago they had these state-of-the-art fake CGI person that you could kind of talk to and it was animated yeah and they were like we're not quite there like we can't do the mouth like the tongue I can't do the tongue note correctly I'll show you and because the muscles that's what's so fast there it is this is this is what we looked at this is exactly the guy that we looked at and is this the video of the show that I did it's like 2013 face works you can look it up yeah that's what this was the guy and he's also bald because they can't do the hair right yeah of course this was six years ago right but look how close it is look at the skin that's pretty amazing like stubble I mean that's like a razor burn yeah and also the eyebrows are really good yeah but it's uncanny it's still not quite a person there's something wrong but that's video which is better to duplicate that those wrinkles are good it's it's wild because it does make you realize flaws or what makes something look human we spend all of our time trying to be without flaws but that's actually what sells it well what you as a woman like how do you feel about that like that and we've talked about this before with with guys guys that use filters on their pictures it is let me say fillers because guys do that they do that - that's weird yeah that's weird they're both equally weird but there's something particularly disturbing to me about guys who you've used filters I only know one I'm glad I'm not single that's all I'm saying excited I don't think I don't you know but yeah I mean it's alarming but a lot of guys do it I mean guys are all skinned fucking calf implants and shit and guys it what who's getting cash I don't think anyone we know but calf implants are a fucking thing no it's a big deal yeah big deal yeah I thought that was a joke I don't believe so oh no watch entourage people get calf implants guys are gonna face lifts all kinds of shit you know I know guys are getting lip and what they say you suck dicks get yes I don't know it's a different thing I don't know either I know guys that were there are some guys that's going on here is this a calf he's our captain plant website it's just google images for Wow we got one in the lower left but by the way you could just run hills you pussy but when you do this can you still exercise like can you grow muscle underneath it wow that guy's calves look very impressive on the right I do have to say I mean they've done they changed him it's shortcuts how much of these cuts oh you know those look like like a cop like a athletic cop yeah like a fencer yeah yeah good to keep from getting kicked yeah no he did that at the fucking mini mall yes yeah that's a mistake I know there's a tattoo are those bad or good right there look at this one that's pretty dim realistic what is it hang on - it's what I don't understand mm-hmm I used to really be another surgery channel well I mean it's got to be like like a silicone yeah it's silicone or water-based or something like that but how do you live with yourself I don't know it feels like a trick you do you're probably just trying to get laid and you're sad oh no no it looks like that's some Pinocchio shit right there I don't like that what's the thing on the left has it rotted what are all those veins I got the implants to take care of that problem I'm glad my robots um least exciting he has some injuries yeah oh yeah bit by wolves this is why I got him this is cuz he got because he got eaten by wolves yeah those looks like we're act they slice right behind his knee and yeah dropped him in but look at his there was no other options legs well you here's the other option don't get calf on Plan C and stop running around outside with Bulls go good no I'm just saying yeah I don't think you really got bit by what has happened but if wolves get you they usually yeah you get you it's very chaotic might do that to your calves yeah there's no like margin of error with wolves they just break the bones of your leg with one bite injury said the car accidentally was younger and caps wouldn't grow well yeah I think a lot of its reconstructive that's just one sentence about it oh yeah but a lot of guys get that shit I know a guy who had PEC implants he was a skinny guy breast implants yeah he got PEC employers under his meat of his chest to make his chest and so is that is that something somebody does cuz they can't accomplish it naturally or they're just lazy and cutting corners you'd have to ask them but the reality is there's things the people that some people are ectomorph sand ectomorphs are like really thin people that haven't gladly hard time gaining weight yeah their body just doesn't ab ilysm yeah it doesn't grow mass yeah their muscles don't grow right yeah male plastic surgery is a really big thing now but putting filters on it I don't know I feel like a fucking love that show botched love it let one live for one episode was actually pretty interesting where's a guy had been an injury and he got his calf destroy his uh his his breast destroyed his PEC and they had to fix it I don't know he just said nothing there so he had like one that was like here there was a guy who is a fighter who's a high-level UFC fighters name is Trey telligman he fought Vitor Belfort in 1997 he was Vitor Belfort inaugural fight in the UFC and we didn't know about Vitor when Vitor was 19 years old and I knew who he was because I was training with Vitor back then I was I was a white belt at carlson gracie school on thorn in West Hollywood so we knew he was this phenomenal talent but a lot of people didn't know that he was incredible boxer at this crazy hand speed he lit this dude up but anyway trade telligman was in a car accident and he was a little kid and he didn't have a pack like his chest was caved in that's right see if you photograph of Trey telegram the guy was a stud too and a handsome fella too but everything else just super jacked but he had this crazy PEC injury I mean awesome oh yeah see that oh yeah yeah yeah well it was a baby I think and he was in a car accident very significant injury that would psych me out yeah a guy took his clothes off and you say all right I mean I just mean that's your opponent you're just like oh fuck what but he there's something hot about it there's this is this is I think there's something primal of like he's fucking survived some shit right dick with him there's something hot about that like that dude from the wire with that scar crosses totally scars any kind of proof of injury proof that you've been in battle is attractive to my yeah that's a weird i'ma brain I hate myself for it do you know that the Nazis used to have dueling scars that were very popular across the face it was a big deal they would all they would get him on purpose like they would get into duels with swords and they would have dueling scars and a lot of the Operation Paperclip Nazis that we got from Soviet where we got from Germany rather at the end of World War two when you know NASA took on a bunch of German scientists a lot of them had these horrific dueling scars that they did on base purpose no they would get in boarding school and in military school they would get in fights with swords and they would cut each other's faces open we're doing meth and shit - that was more that it means for sure but that was more the Japanese that was the kamikazes the kamikazes is the way they got them to fly into boats and just fucking explode their fucking airplanes the way they got him to do that was they were mapped out of their mind okay okay try to find a picture of Nazi dueling scars it's crazy because like some guys that were hanging out with werner von werner herzog rather know Wernher von Braun Werner Herzog's the director yeah Wernher von Braun the guy was the head of NASA on when they went to the moon he had this these guys that were working with him and these giants cars across their face huge like it was it like a ritual like to show your pecking order yeah which showed you were badass so you you had gone through but it was a big thing with the Nazis and there's some horrific photos of these guys young kids with huge gaping open wounds here's here's a photos holy zoom in on the yeah see this is a guy this is right after the dueling cults that's on this it said that women found it attractive yep so someone guys actually would do it on purpose oh yeah I'm gonna have doctors sliced off their fucking cheek well look at this guy right here with the goggles go to that guy with the goggles yeah look at that yeah he's got two big scars on his face and they had the goggle so they didn't cut their fucking eyes out before anesthesia oh yeah see so he's got a plate over his nose to keep his nose intact because he couldn't really stitch that bitch back on but they would take these huge scars on their cheeks cuz they would be dueling with real fucking swords and they would have these practice dueling matches and then they'd have to stitch them up so these guys all have these huge scars by the way when he comes back to cauliflower ears a lot of guys did that themselves on purply they're stitching them up whoa a lot of guys did that themselves they'd smash their ears yeah they've smashed your son Pro oh yeah all the time whiteouts yeah well a lot of white belts that want to be like badasses they'd smash their fucking year so I don't think fucking trip to leak yeah it's load and explode don't explode sometimes well yeah they can break off - there was one fight that I was watching once where a chunk of this guy's ear cuz its calcified you know it's hard if you ever touched a cauliflower ear I have it feels like a rock uh-huh it's because it's calcium yeah it's a rock yeah it's a crystallized yeah it's literally like a mineral rock and it's inside your fucking ear Randy Couture who had these crazy ones used to take it and grind it into people's faces like so he'd be like getting ahead in arm position he would shove his bag wet beer into your fucking eyeball points for creativity okay explode that's Leslie Smith she was fighting Jessica I and Jessica I cracked her with a punch and it literally let she go purposely for it no no she's just beating her up and in the process of beating her up she caught her ear and it was hanging out and open and Leslie Smith so fucking tough she didn't want to stop the fight she was mad they stopped the fight his right ear was hanging off that was a long time I mean not a long time ago but about four years ago do you think I mean would there ever be human versus robot fights sure yeah I would I can't wait they would have to dial the robots down right they'd have to like when I was talking about we were talking about before the show started that I think it would be cool to have a robot that moved at like 50% like a martial arts robot that you would be able to practice technique on so you just would just you'd basically would you do as do drills right like you do like a Dutch combination which is one two left hook to the body right leg kick and you would do it like while it's in front of you advancing you put that back boom and it would have to like react to your punches but they would do everything like 50% speed so you could take a chance of this thing hitting you but it probably wouldn't but it would provide you with enough movement so that you could develop patterns in your mind and your body would like synchronize with these patterns so that in a real fight you would know what what's you would you'd have these things ain't sort of ingrained like one of the things that happens in a fight is things happen that you don't think of you just do them and you don't realize you were even going to do them until you already did it right because it's like you've drilled them into your subconscious so you can with a robot and then maybe you can ramp the robot up to 3/4 speed if you got really good at it then you really move and duck and it would be throwing punches at you trying to hit you yeah they can record you if so you can see what you're doing that'd be helpful yeah that would if you could look through the robots eyes you go put your fucking GoPro on it yeah they're gonna have eyes cameras soon yeah and then you're gonna see someone's dick holes to logout like a woman she's not even gonna flinch like if you see car horns it's one thing about porns it's like the moment the load hits no matter how good actress is the moment the loads hits the brace for impact is always a flinch even in the sanam they're real pros a real pro just takes it on the mug and just just I don't there's I don't know like boxers some boxers is photos of them or their getting hit with their arse or well yeah they never they never squint ever since tumbler doesn't have porn I'm feel like I'm off the map tumblr doesn't have porn no it used to it's used to have porn it was super but it wasn't one of the most popular porn sites what yeah and they stopped doing porn do you know why probably cuz people were complaining it was making too much money it's too lucrative oh they were making money yeah yeah it was like a blog site and people were putting all this porn and they were getting shut down well Twitter is porn yes it does I fall joyed yes I'm fully fucking aware Twitter is a lot of fun I didn't realize that yeah I only follow fucking annoying ass news bullshit do you yeah I mean I just I Twitter I'm just like all my friends and news outlets I don't know if I want to like jerk off in between like CNN and Business Insider I'd look at Twitter so infrequently now cuz every time I look at it it seems to be he's fighting it's exhausting arguing you don't help me cuz I was like this special and I loved your special because like you acknowledge you like I'm gonna get in trouble for this so you're gonna be so it like that was just so fucking smart when I was writing this special it's the first time I've ever done one where I started cutting bits because I was like it's just not worth the fighting like I didn't want to fucking deal with it you know like I had this whole bit on Marilyn Monroe and how I don't think she's a like I feel like she's being forced on us is like a feminist icon like all my girlfriends are like posting like photos of Marilyn Monroe being like you know always show up two hours late keep a man waiting I'm like this woman is a fucking asshole she's a slob and why do i why she's not my Gloria Steinem and I just had this whole bit and I'm just like oh they're gonna say I don't like women and I'm a shaming slut-shaming I just like it's not fuckin worth well she's a weird one right because she fucked everybody which is not bad it's not bad to fuck everybody but she fucked everybody and apparently that's the real conspiracy is that the Kennedys had her killed because she was banging JFK and then she's banging RFK and apparently she loose lips sink ships yep yappin a lot and look I I'm gorgeous good for her for making my back then making money the way you had to but I just let's let her be what she was why why you know I think that she that Hedy Lamarr should get the credit that she gets you know I mean you talk about heading fuckin Jean badass she was a legit and she nobody gives a shit responsible for Wi-Fi people use Wi-Fi mostly to Google Marilyn Monroe clothes Hedy Lamarr came back to life like so did my invention did it ever come of anything we'd be like yeah good news bad news yeah we mostly use it to Google the whore version of you know I don't I don't it's it's I love Marilyn Monroe like I just feel like there's this thing now where you know women we can't criticize any woman ever or else that we get in trouble you know and I think we have to be able to call Pete like I say in my special I talk about the difference between women that are does anyone have any girlfriends that think they're feminists but they're actually just assholes you know and I know that I'm gonna get shit for it and that's like the men's rights guys how many of the men's rights guys just like they talk about women like their pieces of meat right like is that really men's rights or are you just a piece of shit are you like what are you doing here yeah you teaching people that they need to have rights are you teaching men how to manipulate vulnerable people and how do you have this kind of time to even look like I don't even know those books are profitable oh it's like a whole business yeah those books I mean guys give seminars on how to pick up women right oh right like the game yeah Gaia theory I remember when I used to when I first came to LA like guys would do that and it was what they try it on you yes the first thing you do well they you're supposed to ignore the it's negging right you're supposed to ignore them and then you're supposed to do a compliment that's actually an insult like every guy when I fir moved here would be like I really like how your eyes are crooked like it was like every guy would make the same thing who's that oh that's the pickup artist guy mystery yeah the game that he was like the host of the show yeah his name is mystery does he have a fake lip tattoo on his neck kisses yeah I think so why does he have to Cochran that's it here like lipstick kind of thing all right okay I like the furry hat yeah so he had a whole thing he was doing for a while eyeliner on okay this is like a judge Criss Angel madness but and then you would like I try to ignore the girl this whole thing we're supposed to be mean to her to make her like you or some shit yeah well that works on really vulnerable people yeah and girls and Trini girls who are used to compliments and used to getting a lot of attention well for men that are ignored and that a face rejection over and over and over again they've view women as if not the enemy as some sum and source of negative feelings right yeah and for you to get over on them would be to get some of that back right right all those bad feelings bad encounters negative interactions that you've had with women yeah I had a friend that was like that over the time that I knew him when I've met him when he was in his 20s and as time went on and into his 30s he became more and more bitter and angry he wasn't very attractive and he would have these interactions with women and they would wind up no dumping in or abusing him and and he he just got fucking angry and then as he got older he was just an angry guy like he just hated women it would be just because of rejection yeah he associated them with pain and emotional discomfort and so for a guy like that and he I don't he wasn't into the game or anything like that but for some of those guys that are vulnerable like you know like this this insel thing with a lot of these men involuntary celibates they develop these form groups and yeah subreddits and and they meet up and you know talk about what to do and maybe I'll get facial surgery and yeah look no further but they want women yeah ultimately that's a compromise they want a real woman you know they just they just got a shit roll the dice genetically yeah I don't know what ton about I mean I've read articles about and said but what is can they not get hookers or don't want to or well that's a problem because hookers are illegal right like you know if you get hookers you got to go through some sort of shady black Marta fuckin dantana I think actually tonight's a Dan Tana's yeah yeah that's exactly we'll have you convinced you'll go there with a fucking newspaper there's no there's no hookers you'll be pretending you sit here and wait no just read the paper and they'll show up yeah there's no hookers yeah I remember I used to go to the four seasons all the time and people would come in like ma'am are you here to sit like they always thought I was a prostitute why there in the lobby yeah four seasons in Beverly Hills Peninsula yeah oh they be like ma'am are you here to see somebody or you like if I ever showed up alone because hookers just like wander around the Four Seasons lobby oh how weird editorial little coyotes oh my god of course I should call Heidi's when we used to go to the sky bar across the street from is that still just like the Mondrian sky bar that exists I think so it's across from in this economy store yeah I used to have a whole bit about them the Coyotes because they were like they would prey on these guys I was I was hanging out once with me and a friend of mine and we heard this conversation between this fat balding guy and this really pretty girl with big tits and and he was like do coke do you do coke she's like yeah sometimes and I was like cuz it's like damn they would prey on these vulnerable you know like like a pug now like a pug that got out of the yard I felt like they because these women would have this feral look in their eyes like when when you're down to fuckin people for money and that's how you're getting by and you got some cocaine in your purse and maybe a few dollars and you probably don't eat well no and you don't have a lot of money and whatever money you do have he's spending on drugs or whatever and there's a feeling that you get when you're around them on here they're feral yeah every day were hustling yeah they're hustling yeah and they're looking for these vulnerable guys with money yeah that's what you know that place would be the place where they would go yeah Mondrian I remember when I first moved there yeah you're like wait in line to get in and there's a pool and occasionally drunk they'd jump in the Pam Anderson famously like got naked and jumped in that pool that was like which yeah don't that's a dozen we've already got I've already had a public fight with her I don't want to do it yeah on the roasts she was on the David Hasselhoff roast and I mean I and I apologized her without just saying I believe I said Pam Anderson you fucked Tommy Lee kid Rock and who's the other oh you fucked Tommy Lee Bret Michaels and Kid Rock why don't you just save yourself some time and drink of that of Magic Johnson's blood [Laughter] oh shit I said a lot of shit about her vagina and yeah didn't go great I mean I'll do shell like I just got asked to do the next roast and I know if you can fucking do roasts anymore roast battles still exist they still go hard in the paint on Tuesday night of the cops right we just didn't shit that's tonight yeah we just did it in San Francisco and it was so fun but I still found myself in sleep I mean when we did Joan Rivers I said up Joan Rivers is so old her vagina has a separate entrance for black cocks and today I would fucking be run out of town now you just said it I did admit I mean I remember people used to think jokes were funny people used to have a sense of humor I mean even fucking Joan you know I said Joan their whole career my opening joke was Joan I loved you in the wrestler she's hilarious like you could a good sensing you your best yeah and she had such a good sense of humor even during the roast her face from plastic surgery was so frozen that because you know every time something tells a joke you'll check in to see if the person that's being roasted laughing to make sure and she would like kind of and she kept we would look like greg Giraldo was just fucking hammering or and the audience was nervous and then she said it she's like I'm laughing I had too much Botox like she had to subtitle her face so that we all knew she was okay but I did the brain improv once with Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir and we got barbecued in the greenroom just barbecued we went way too far and Joan Rivers in her television show who's when she did television show with her daughter it was on TV I don't know what show it was it was a reality show okay and we were watching it on the on the screen and her face looked like a kabuki mask oh it was just frozen did you see the documentary a piece of work it's pretty you see her she goes and gets it and talks about it and I was doing that it's you know I mean make her look better there's a I don't know I mean look at me I definitely get nervous sometimes and people overall everyone always like accused me I do much shit to my face I'm like no you'll know I'll look like a fucking moon bounce like I already know you're gonna do it eventually yes for sure why do people accuse you of it because you don't look like thank you very thin nose though people would worry that you did you knows it's wild because you'd think I got my nose I'm at my nostrils are crooked I went to a doctor in Beverly Hills because I had sinus problems for a longest time and he actually said you know I I can you have a septic what does it deviated you so it's like you have a deviated septum and I was like what do you do like he was like we can get a nose job if yeah totally and I never did it because but your nose is thin thank you if he did it what would he do make it very nostrils equal even they're really asymmetrical and it's like problematic and sometimes in its problem when I do something in television sometimes they have to fix my nostrils host to make it even fuck about you're not just distracting I feel like those things are there just to find out who's really weird like if you're really freaking out about someone's asymmetrical nostrils it's just I mean the key to most movie stars into is they're symmetrical you know they're just like mmm you know think about the most beautiful women on the world have some symmetry but yeah I don't it's wild I mean I have I mean I talk about in my special I have had surgery on my boobs I did have boobs done Hollow which is kind of this might interest you the I was learning because I had all kinds of shit and the way that they make boobs look good is because I think I heard you talking about someone about the shitty old breast implants the way they make them good now is that they put you on like a crucifix oh and they do the surgery while you're standing up what so that they so you're out cold yes so that they fall well and oh my god really oh so I finally went through a guy that knew how to do that yeah it's my fucking mild butt so I admit what I have you know but on my face it is alarming because it does feel like female comedians a couple of famous ones that we know in they age went down that round I don't know if it's like the same thing that got you into comedy is the same thing that made you think you had to do that you know I've heard a lot of stuff about like childhood sexual abuse ago people go really off the grid with their face that's like a type of dysmorphia or a lot of people a lot of psychologists have said because I've talked to a therapist whose job is in dysmorphia to advise on whether another surgery should be done by somebody like if they're getting dysmorphic and a lot of times it's if you've had childhood sexual abuse you want to change your face so that it's not you don't see the person in the mirror that got it right like it's the Michael Jackson thing yeah yeah it's like a childhood trauma yeah yeah the Michael Jackson thing was always that he hated his father and he hated looking at his father in his own face so when it's that extreme I try to like not judge because I'm like oh there might be some psychological shit that I don't know about for sure you know but it's getting worse and worse with this Instagram shit because kids are grown I mean it used to be like we had acne and we'd go to school with acne you know but now it's like you're projecting this flawless perfect face and then you have to show up at school with fucking acne the next day like also it's like people want their face to actually look like an Instagram filter which is bananas it doesn't but again it's a test to see who's fucked up like who wants that not not girl who wants that as far as guy like what guy wants that it's I'm so confounded by what I'm seeing right like also you just want to look like everybody else when you're young but the weird thing is women wanted to be super skinny that's a weird one like that's always been around numb well it's a new model skinny thing it's yeah it's not it's not attractive to men yeah like men like asses yeah I mean everyone's different right yeah I like girls with meat mm-hmm well because that also translates to fertility I mean it's like we want someone that looks for sure and you know healthy yeah well I want a girl in Carrie couch with me for real do you want a girl you pick up the end of the couch now let's move over here I don't expect you to pick up the whole couch you're gonna be harder for you than me but we don't have to carry that far I don't know this trend of super skinny cuz it doesn't really make sense on like a primordial level white samaan it's a model thing because for clothes they want a girl to be a clothes hang yeah that's right they want a skinny girl that just looks good sashay down the runway with their bag of bones which I was really like and I actually did like a whole like paper on this and I was in college about actually the reason that fashion had you know such tiny models is because they were just there was a shortage on fabric during World War two so they just started making dresses smaller and then model skinnier like it wasn't yeah it wasn't even really something that we wanted I assumed it was gay dudes I'm sure that gay dudes are into twinks know so they can you say twinks without getting arrested got in trouble for saying something about twinks isn't so this is the whole thing I can't so it's just like fucking outrage it's helped me though someone was saying I read and I think this is on your podcast 2% of all people on Twitter make eighty percent of the comments yes so it's on us for amplifying that 2% it's real it's not that many fucking people it just feels big it's not the world you go out in the world and you would think that it's gonna be just knife fights antifoam get shit bottle and after after the Roseanne thing everyone's like what happened to Roseanne that was so funny I was like you didn't hear half the people didn't even know about it no most people didn't know about it and then I was on tour and this is I mean there's some stuff in the special that I'm sure like logs are gonna comment before but you know I was going around talking about all the stuff happening the news and sexual harassment stuff and getting your ass grabbed at work at one time I was in Houston this woman yelled out I was like a guy that grabs you in the ass she went take the compliment and move on she's like this is such an LA New York fuck you know so it's just like justice is a different world so many points of view that we're just not that are not being heard right now the Twitter point of view is very strange it's like you have right-wing Twitter left-wing Twitter and black Twitter yeah we have three different in our little echo chamber and it just feels so much bigger than it is around the world you know you guys just want fucking laugh outraged culture yeah it's very strange how do you and how old will this end I think it ends with mine reading software okay for real I think what's happening right now is it's we're all we're okay if you say something and you have a certain intent and that tenth intent is not accurately expressed by the sounds you're making with your mouth I can choose to get mad but if I can read what you're thinking then the I know what your intent is but it used to be we'd be able to tell I'd be able to read your face and go Joe's joking cuz we're right in front of each other yeah right that's what's missing on Twitter there's no social cues things don't translate in text how many times is a friend sent you a text message and you think they're serious yeah just joking oh yeah most of the arguments in my life so many times I'll send someone because I say fucked up things and techsmith's half my text messages to my friends are heinous me and Cowan and show up psycho yeah Joey Diaz every week three pictures of his shit the other day you showed me his balls for like 20 minutes I'm sure his balls are unbelievable they're gorgeous they look like Kim Kardashian's but they're very rare their butt is what is it is that just are they fake like you know this is Joey Diaz this is let me know look at that gigantic log of shit that's that's that looks like a fucking no that's just no no no I've seen those in real life he would leave them in the toilet form this isn't healthy I would go into this is not if I can help me associated Joey Diaz with healthy first of all notice that it's not even in the water it's on the beach next to the water because he's kind of big and he doesn't really fit on the toilet correctly I don't understand why this doesn't break off why doesn't his sphincter cut it holds it in I think his his finger the calamari is his sphincter is loose I think when he lets it loose it's just like a logjam that just got released like a like they opened up a dam on the river I just whoa fucking nightmares giant piece of shit so he'll send me pictures of his shit sister where what are we doing sister thank god he's alive because he's one of those guys it's just like whatever outrage the one of the things that I used to love about going on the road with him which is it's tragically he's too successful Joey Diaz is famous now so I can't really take him on the road with me as much anymore because he's always booked but the beautiful thing was but he will be working with me tonight the Comedy Store okay the beautiful thing was when I take him on the road he would open everybody up like so hard they're like all the taboos are out the window by time I go on stage oh oh yeah that's such a fucking great smart choice people like he's so funny why would you want to follow him I'm like well I think that's in your head because if you're funny you're funny yes I mean he's definitely funnier than me he's funny than everybody has ever lived but he's also building shakes when Jenna's on stage he's a monster but he also he lays the foundation that it's everything's on the table you know he used to do that at the roast was greg Giraldo yes he would go out and he would just say the shit then even in a Rosie be like Oh fuckin he goes first well people hadn't even had drinks yet you and me like he said um iced tea yeah you're so old you used your first residual check to buy your freedom it's like Jesus bunny like that would be like his opening joke oh my god it was like 5:30 on a Sunday it was like homey Oh oh my god like he would just come sword and the audience wouldn't even know what to do but that's something he was so fucking unbelievable like Greg and I were on TV at the same time and we were right next to each other on the lot at Gower sunset and Gower yeah I was a Newsradio and he had his own show for a bit in his show was right next to my show and we would hang out you know cuz we were both guys from New York that were more from the East Coast at least that we're doing comedy and we're out here like things crazy you know and and I never thought he would die like that like what he died of a drug overdose I was like Greg we had been sober yeah what happened he went to a party and someone gave him some shit and I mean it's so tricky when my I mean I get worried I'm like a fucking mom about the shit what my guy you know anyone goes on the road and you're getting shit you don't know how strong it is you're getting it from random people I think he had been sober and his tolerance was low and just tried to go back to what had Jonah was I think so but I don't know all the details that fucking need for escape the need for the pill things doesn't feel like though in general comics are getting healthier like you probably you saw the days when everyone was on blow and everyone this feels like everyone's now in Jamba Juice and on it and kombucha and the real problem is I can't imagine you know we've never lost our balls some people think that in order to be a comedian you have to be at least a little bit self-destructive like the great ones just have good story to get good stories yeah I started go to therapy I was like fuck what do I talk about paying my mortgage on time this isn't funny it's a problem you can wealthy right you know how many fear of you know your bills are paid when you stop doing desperate shit and making mistakes you just have less interesting story certainly there's that but it doesn't always have to be stories right but I also think it's perspective gets very skewed when you live a life of leisure yeah you know when you live a life of leisure and comfort and privilege which most wealthy comedians do that's when they all start to suck like when comedians have usually they have a few good years like they make it and they have like one or two good specials and then they have some that just what happened sloppy because you think they just don't have to fight as hard or I mean a lot of times I hear you know people will schedule their special like I'm shooting your special naps March it's like but have you written it like you scheduled it before you're finished with that's the Eddie Murphy thing oh really you know Eddie Murphy just got a seventy million dollar deal he hasn't done stand-up in thirty years so like how many times does he get look I think first of all just as an aside or just to start this off I'm not bashing him I'm a giant Eddie Murphy fan anybody who thinks that Eddie Murphy's do stand-up again it's me and I've even talked about on this podcast that he did that he did some speech on a podium where he's talking about how bad Bill Cosby fucked up because they had a he had to give his his awards back you know oh right oh shit it was hilarious segments it's a Hilaire and I was like goddamn his timing is so good I wish you would do stay on the Ganges well he was at the Comedy Store walking the halls a couple times I've done Tuesdays this was like a couple years ago and he just walked in and he just like looked like he was on a people mover he was just like float through the hallways and you know the hallways it's like fucking Beirut in those hallways and everyone just gets super quiet now and it hasn't done stand-up in 30 years that's how god damn like you know as nice as look Tim Allen is Tim Allen hasn't done stand-up in forever either but if he walks by but I saw that's that guy from home improvement yeah you know they're not like freaking out that he's there he was so good getting delirious and we were kids he'd watch that you but he was so goddamn good that today I mean legend of it just carries on I mean the real question is when he comes back or people gonna start tearing apart his old specials and saying 100% phobic and he oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah work like well people are going after people for George John Wayne John Wayne he's canceled his cancer okay he's been dead for decades he's not woken up in the 70s he said bad things about black people or something well they're shit now where it's like Picasso's canceled he's canceled yep Picasso's get Bukowski is canceled man this is like the fuckin house key was in a bar bear or whatever her name is what's her name Hannah Gatsby Picasso like hey baby you got to let that go that was a long time he admitted I mean it's like that's the other thing is all these people who put their mental illness and struggles on a kid they would probably agree with us oh for sure they were fucked up for she know like van Gogh was shitty to his subjects it's like yes oh I mean you see it in his work you know there's people that want to forgive people though for a thing like Rome remember when there's a lot of Roman Polanski apologists oh I don't think I caught and there was quite a few yeah I mean way in Hollywood yes like legitimate actors and actresses that were saying you know it's time to let it go leave he's an amazing artist I'm good Rosemary's baby's fucking great movie but I think he's done it it's a wrap but there are people like you know Stanley Kubrick who is yes arguably the might be my favorite well now his genius as ever and in filmmaking which by the way yeah I was reading that the guy that directed ex machina kind of loosely based the guy on Stanley Kubrick oh wow did you ever see and then as soon as I thought about a lease Garland I think is the guy that wrote it I thought that was interesting but have you ever seen like the videos of Kubrick directing Shelley law and all the stories about how he terrorized her throughout the production to get her into a I mean he didn't want her to sleep he wanted her bags under eyes he would wake her up in the middle of the night and he'd scream at her and call her a cunt and then she'd be like it was her performance is unbelievable and I and it's like was terror right today that would be a hostile work environment that to being olive oil in the Popeye movie with Robin Williams and then she just quit yeah I mean she was so good in the shining and then she didn't do this emotion was make great art I don't know it's I'm not know the same thing happened Rakesh Schroeder in the champ Oh John John Voight was like really shitty with him he was a little kid he's now six seven years old yeah he's really shit even mean to him before the scenes yeah start crying yeah I mean there's also there's a there's a director who there was an explosion in a movie and the actor you know it's a fake explosion and you're going huh and then one take he was like just make it a real just don't tell him and the fucking take was amazing in the actor got all pissed off but the fucking work you know you get to get credit for that so it's it is this tricky thing like I was uh I did a show called Adam ruins everything you know that show it's he's just a smart dude and he just asked me to do a little guest spot and I had to play a flight attendant in the 50s who was getting sexually harassed like that was the scene right and because that's what I guess Airlines used to do that they would sort of pimp out their flight attendants you if you were engaged and we're allowed to wear your ring you had to ruler yeah it was like I hit the episodes are really interesting supposed to be really hot right a certain size and you had to be young and then you had to kind of like what did they let that go it was kind of 235 pounds he was five foot four nice guy though but it was like a dating service back then basically it Adam did the whole thing on it and I was in there and it felt very much everyone was like okay whatever you feel comfortable with it was like no we have to do we have to make this feel uncomfortable you know like don't worry about my feelings right now you know it's like you know so there is just this conversation about like a no hostile work environment and everyone needs to feel emotionally safe like well can you distinguish yeah well can you get to that place without being harassed if you're a really good actress if you're really crazy of course but I just you know you still have to do it you know go for it I mean isn't that the argument about great actors that they kind of have to be crazy like a Daniel day-lewis type actor right but you have to kind of be like that's why their method actors right they stay in that mindset because to maintain that mindset it's really the only way to achieve it you almost kind of have to be there all the time but also the being in character thing like when people like you know bitch about like when Christian Bale had his no melt their meltdown and stuff it's like I mean it's just there's so many people on a set and there's so many distractions and you know you at some point you're just like I have it's impossible to fucking focus well in this also there's losers on set sometimes that fucked things up and get in the way yeah it does happen yeah the fact that they recorded him screaming at that guy I was like well I want to know what that guy did and who was that guy that guy might be a moron hadn't he been starving himself for like seven months or something that's the mechanic it's the same movie it's just like you know the machine machinist right it's like I'm the face of this fucking movie I'm under all this pressure I have to get this thing we're losing light and this fucking guy's cell phone goes off or I don't know exactly what happened you know but I do think when Daniel day-lewis is like I'm calling me mr. link or nobody talked to me it might just be this way being like just fucking stop asking me if I want hummus like just let me fucking focus you know I think for like really intense roles which I've never done so I'm just completely talking out of my ass I would think they might have to maintain some really crazy state of mind to get there so it doesn't like fake because you know how you know how like you see if you ever see the movie punchline with Sally Field yeah yeah it's an interesting movie but when Sally Fields is Kailen I'm like get the fuck over there like that's no one's laughs at that it's not real when actors do stand-up I think real stand-ups are like okay what you know whose nails it though that lady who plays the marvelous mrs. well she's amazing yeah I love her shit it does well it's also in the 50s yeah you know I think right but even the guy who plays Lenny Bruce is great in that I agree I mean that show rather and there was a you know but like the one on Showtime cast real comics remember Eric Griffin was on it and al Madrigal was on it that one on Showtime oh yeah dying up here yeah you know just a cast real comics yeah but the writing one that was like a little shoddy dicey but uh but I I'm sure it's different for everyone but I do think though sometimes you know you've been on sets like if you have to do a scene with somebody where you're screaming you hate each other if you're hanging out all day on Instagram and then it's just like you it's hard to unfaith like chemistry or knowing someone so yeah I just interesting like you know Stanley Kubrick probably would be canceled today probably yeah well especially by people who don't understand what's required in order to achieve what he's trying to get yeah Kubrick was a madman though I mean he used to do complex mathematics in his spare time yeah like it's a hobby right yeah like but he would come play his calculus and stuff like that he would do shit where he would you know I think on Eyes Wide Shut he did like do 80 takes of Tom Cruise walking through the door and then I'll show up like he didn't want actors acting like he wanted them he wanted them in the actual state of mind instead of acting like they were in that actual State of Mind like he wanted that so he really wanted Tom Cruise to be like exhausted and fucking pissed off and annoyed so he's like go piss him off and then let me know when he's in that state I mean you would like terrorize Shelley Duvall's and kind of famous and it she looks fucking terrified yeah you know so she's working with Jack Nicholson there's a great video of him preparing from one of the scenes fuck and he's jumping up and down and throwing his arms in the angle like freaking out you know I could see him working himself up before the scene I mean he it's like those scenes that he did especially two acts through the bathroom door you can't just go into that cold you've got some of that it worked up yeah it's wild like I'm so obsessed with that movie cuz like the little things he did to make you feel uneasy in a subliminal way this guy yeah there's nine people that want to like ask him if he needs any hand sanitizer back now fucking preppy asshole it's a great goddamn movie you know that movie Stephen King didn't like that movie well yeah well that's why they say that the car on the road that's crashed on the road there's a red car in the beginning of the movie that's crashed on the side of the road and then Stephen King's version there was a red car so Cooper crashed that car and then it was a yellow car so he actually put shit in the movie too troll season kind of amazing but he did shit that was so fascinating like little things to make you feel uneasy like continuity errors like he'd cut to his scene there be a like if there was a chair behind you cut away cut back and there be no chair shit you wouldn't really notice in case you were like dissecting it but there's also a lot of weird references in that movie to the Apollo moon landing that's right like he was and the Native American genocide is apparently a pretty big theme in it but yeah and the way that he um I mean there's a whole documentary about this but that the carpet the when the kid is riding the bicycle around the carpet that he shot at both ways and intercut them so with the continuities not working and it just makes you feel oh yeah he's fucking there's a great documentary about the guy who followed Kubrick around he was like his assistant he was an actor and he was acting and something that Kubrick did and Kubrick wound up hiring him as an assistant and he just did all Kubrick's movies and hung out with him all the time it's really she's still alive yeah yeah come on well the documentary is really good it's what does he do you know what it's not the room two three six one what is it The Lost eight I think it's on Netflix I believe right no the guy who hang hung around with Stanley Kubrick that's about him I think it's a film or is that it oh maybe that's it a life in pictures 2001 no no no I don't think so just Google the guy who wrote to film work that's it right so that is this guy just sort of realized somewhere along the line like um I'll never be able to make a fucking movie like I've never be able to do what he's doing so I'm just gonna start working with them so he's his personal assistant he started out as an actor and he just worked with Kubrick through all of his movies oh well yeah I mean somehow another they just clicked together so he wanted working for him so it's like you probably don't know the name Leone Vitaly scroll down please stop you you don't know the name Leone Vitaly but the upcoming documentary film work or hopes to change that forever yeah British actor yeah Stanley to play the world Lord Bullingdon and Barry London yeah it's interesting because this guy sort of devoted his life to like to work with Kubrick it's interesting like and that was also back in the day I think Kubrick would do like a movie every like five years or something Creek it's like that's back then you made a movie when it was ready now it was like movie every eight months and noon well you know the Apocalypse Now story right no movie took forever oh right yeah the movie took like seven fucking years to make did altar-stone write that no no that's uh Francis Ford Coppola okay that's like I don't think Oliver Stone wrote that maybe I'm wrong I think he was involved in some way I don't think so I'm kind of obsessed with Oliver Stone yeah mm-hmm I wrote a my Honors theses in college about fuckin dorky the postmodern implications of the movie JFK I was just obsessed with that movie like after at the time it had the most edits in any movie ever and the way that they just didn't mix me I just fucking loved the movie and I just want to write about it and dissect it it's a great movie but the problem is they sort of he makes it seem like you know exactly what happened right and the reality is we don't know exactly what happened we don't know who killed JFK it was very likely that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald though yeah and if it was that if Lee Harvey Oswald did take a shot he didn't take the only shots there's other people shooting right it's just so fun it was just so fucking blew my mind the way that he makes movies what's I mean I don't think we can even grasp the idea that someone shot the fucking President on TV I can't actually wasn't on TV what would we do I mean there's a did you ever what was the story about the guy who shot himself in the mouth oh yeah ate the song hey man my shot oh yeah that's about you and he was about to go to jail and he had a press conference his house and then he blew his head off yeah I pulled out a 44 Magnum and stuck it in his mouth what's that with Pennsylvania yeah yeah yeah Pennsylvania can you imagine so that's on phases of death right I didn't know that was watch that's so many time from the night oh yeah I could see it in my head right now so it was on and they just couldn't cut it cuz it was live television well he gave a press conference and just put a gun in his mouth and blew the top of his head off and they're like no don't don't don't he's like and he did it like really quick before anybody could get to him and he just blew the top of his fucking head I don't know how many views that has on YouTube well it's crazy like how quick the blood starts pouring out of his nose that was one of the weird things like oh that's what happens yeah it was like so much year I'm gonna make sense I guess for sure it's also just to be able to be that composed about it yeah he probably wasn't healthy no but man I think he was gonna be innocent I think so well sometimes people getting dragged through the mud that's enough yeah like that was white board day and killed himself public shaming she was mean besides depression he was terrified that he was gonna get dragged through the mud because he had paid off that boy who his girlfriend it fucked and he would had been so prominently defending women yeah and you know and going after Harvey Weinstein Weinstein in this whole me to movement thing and that all the sudden he was this great hypocrite because his girl had you know she had sexually molested a 17 year old kid which is fine by the way listen there's a lady who just got off and there's all this fucking talk about it they're people that people are so mad Joey Diaz put it on his Twitter nothing wrong with a good dick sucking she know she believes some fourteen-year-old kid and it's on Twitter was who took it off look what Joey is what came down I think Twitter took it down so i retweeted it is it because of his babies a bit what why would they take it Twitter's weeping I just decided that is against the Terms of Service or something they're getting really weird with stuff I mean that's just a joke well people are getting does that mean people snitched because there's not an algorithm or like a spider program looking for that um people must have complained that I don't know I'm looking for it right now I don't see it on my Twitter so fuck that means it was taken down if it was deleted it but he can still retweet something Fitz delete it all right that goes away then no it's right here dude it's right here I was just well you didn't go back didn't find it this morning Bronx teacher who performed oral sex on 14 year old gets ten years probation avoids jail teaching certificate something performed it didn't take that long to get the job done performance there was a camera it was it was a 30-second yes sloppy mess mmm there was a lot going on there but meanwhile nobody cares yeah everybody's okay apparently a lot of people commit suicide after being on reality shows but you don't really sort of hear about it just because you get so famous and then nobody gives a shit about you and you don't money yeah and you know money yeah that's pretty well to have that kind of Fame and out of nowhere and did not really know why you have it then have it taken away from you and they do not have any money I mean think about yeah the kind of psychological tests apparently have to take to be on a reality show a pretty hardcore mmm not in the fear factor days oh really I bet they were just talk to people how you doing there like wherever they were background checks and shit though right all a few we clearly had some insane people on that show why are they getting paid fifty thousand dollars if they won sometimes it was more like it was a big episode like they would win a million we had one guy won a million dollars started speaking in tongues I might have died he was like super religious and he was gonna give all the money to like he was gonna tithe 10% of his money I was like $100,000 and he was uh that was one of the rare ones where they went a million but most of the most 50,000 did you get to have say and the stuff that they did no no say and I most of the time didn't know I didn't know until I got there that's fucking crazy yeah part of it was me I didn't want to know because part of it was because part of is because I thought it would be better if it was a surprise to me so the day of I could be kind of more enthusiastic about it because it was so crazy man because some of the stunts were so fucking crazy but there was a few times where I told him to stop I told him don't do this one of the contestants and producers everybody I said let's not do this one don't do it and they were like you're crazy but why we had people ride bulls and that was the first one I was like you guys are out of your fucking mind like this is so dangerous Roman games at this point well you're they had a 98 year old a 90 pound 98 pound girl she was 98 pounds she was so tiny and they made a ride the ball and she went flying through the air just got so lucky that the bull didn't kick her in the face and I'm telling you it kicked up and her head was here and the foot went like this just right by her is that even legal likes legal you sign off on the waiver people ride bulls take a chance I mean that's exactly what happened and I was telling people don't do this and I told the producers a I said don't do this look I've had a healthy fear of animals my whole life I was attacked by a goat when I was like seven years old so Hitler really yeah Hitler lost a testicle to a goat goat in my is that he's not a myth it sounds is like a myth as I said it I remember him I think a goat bit what is nothing I was I was budded by a goat and my stepfather had to come and save me I'd like a like a petting zoo now was that a farm co-op when we lived in San Francisco there was uh my stepdad went back to school and he was a who's originally a computer programmer and then he was going back to school to be an architect and one of the things that he did it was part of his university was they had some sort of some sort of a farming co-op thing we had to take care of like certain like farming chores and there was animals like like goats mm-hmm and I was a little kid and then got left in this fucking room with this goat this pan was gone I'm sorry I'm laughs at the beginning and then the goat fucking just came at me and slammed his chest yeah oh yeah they're no joke and I remember I'm grabbing the horns but I didn't have any strength I was a little kid you know I was maybe eight at the time and he had to come and save me and I was like Jesus Christ and I remember thinking from that time I like oh you gotta get this idea of what an animal is out here like they did he didn't that thing didn't give a fuck if I died this isn't he just stomped me to death it would have been fine this is it was i right about that or is that that could be a total googled hit was not Hitler goat now government so do you know there are two things about doesn't have anything to do with it I guess he had undescended testicle apparently and then he also had something called hypo spade yes hmm something to do with the urethra hole being on the underside of the penis and not where it should be or had a fucked up penis course he did that's why I'm so angry what did he not have any goat accident I typed in goat this it's a rapport it's like I need to figure out where that fucking but there's so many it this is it was a bit by going his younger days but it okay I think every kid was bit by goat at some point right back then well it's also it's like why it's like people he's coming it's like all this us taking selfies with Tigers and shit like what are you doing right what are you doing they're fucking what like urines this is insane there's this new selfie culture we're all they're like taking selfies with the Bears and shit it's like hey use your head that's all I everybody wants to do is take pictures or things now for their Facebook it's like it's like the new fuckin Rome I think we're going to look back and the same way we look at Caligula in your own we're like oh they used to just have lions fight elephants for entertainment now we're gonna look back and go member when we used to like take selfies with bears slide elephant it was a blank and you have a picture of things yeah I think that's ultimately one of the ways are gonna get us this this Elon Musk thing is kind of interesting because they're trying to put these little fibers in your brain and it'll have some sort of Bluetooth link that increases your bandwidth with the internet but I think the way they're gonna get us is a hard drive that replaces your memory because your memory so shitty yeah you know I mean I have a pretty decent memory in terms of like being able to recall information and facts and stuff like that but if I had to draw a picture of a house that I lived in you just ten years ago I'd be like oh I can't I don't know what I saw but what about the things you want to forget like our brain is pretty good at denial for self-preservation purposes right so what were you how will your brain how will your brain hand because denial is a survival mechanism there are things we have to block out in order to continue functioning or else we'd go crazy right so like people when they're molested when they're young that's one of the things that they have hypnotic regression hmm and then they remember it yeah exactly or emdr whatever the thing is that brings it to the surface but I think denial serves a really important part in a lot of people psyche for sure or else you're gonna it allows you to move on yeah totally you know so it's that is what scares me it's gonna be hard for I think trauma survivors certainly people in the military there's probably some shoot you want to forget right you'll be able to access it over and over again like the Budd Dwyer V yeah I don't want to play that shit on a loop my brain brilliantly made that erase that yeah so I didn't have to think about it you know yeah that's the one thing about that that's alarming to me but our memories are so flawed and and there's this amazing neurologist in New York called Maureen Cerf and he's got a bunch of shit on TED talks and stuff and he went to this lecture he did in New York about how our memories essentially were like comics like we punch up the parts of stories that get the bigger responses and oh yeah I mean I've talked to so many friends about things that happened when we were younger and their version of it is so different than mine yeah um I did we really do that I don't remember doing that I've had friends tell me about fights where I did something to somebody and I beat somebody's ass and like I know that didn't happen like you might think that didn't happen I didn't beat anybody else didn't I tell you about there was a time that I was in Portland with somebody and they were like Joe Rogan him and I got in a car accident in high school I remember I texted you about it you're like that never happened who was it I don't remember we got a car so so loser guy was like oh yeah I know Joe Rogan we got in a car accident in high school not definitely got into Crocs in high school ones but we texted about it you were like that didn't happen oh the other crazy walk he said I thought one of you had repressed it or it was just well I definitely had one car accident hydroplaned right outside school I was leaving school had a 1968 4-4-2 it's an Oldsmobile like a hotrod and those car like old cars when you hit water they would just hydroplane and I said fucking slammed into a tree or a telephone pole Jesus smash the car fucked it up but everybody does it spin yeah your car you just the wheel just goes away.we and you just the car just slides it's super common with old car especially if you don't have good tires but I had a friend that came up to me or he he told another friend of mine about a fight that we had gotten into where I kicked somebody or something like that I was like that never happened I would never happened but he probably kept telling the story and telling the story inflating it and getting laughs on it or whatever you know I got super into terror management theory recently what's that um it's basically like the guy that Becker Ernest Becker this is my dad died a couple years ago and I hadn't really had a lot of death and I started kind of just I started getting into and you called it - one time one day you were like you're doing too much shit you're doing too much stuff stop doing so much stuff and I didn't realize like when you have death and you're basically terror management theory is this is something you know of course but that because we have a prefrontal cortex and we're basically the only animal that can ponder the future in the past like we know we're gonna die and we can't tolerate that anxiety it's too stressful for us so we basically have to keep ourselves busy and do meaningless shit to feel important you have to win awards we have to have titles we have to get things in order to have a sense of immortality right it's basically just managing the anxiety of knowing that we're rotting every day he's just dying and could die at any moment it's just like a false sense of control and longevity there's a great book called the worm in the hole Solomon something Solomon I read this book and it totally blew my mind because I realized so many of my behaviors were just about this fear of death because it had been sort of right in front of me so quickly and his death was so freaked that it just it I had a really hard time coping with the anxiety of death coming so suddenly and so shockingly in like it fucked me up pretty bad but I started just making myself busy with super irrelevant shit in order to try to cope with that anxiety and so I got super into terror management theory terror management theory terror like the trying to manage the terror the daily terror then we know we're gonna die at the book yeah but it's a pretty horse that's what it's a less corny cover the one that I have mmm but just a name title TMT terror management theory terror management theory is a little bit controversial I think because it also justifies some like supremacy thinking a lot of I'm better than you and like cultural superiority stuff I'd have to there's a guy named Solomon that did it talk about it just because you need so badly to feel important that you start to sort of have the delusion that you're better than other people just because you feel so insignificant because you know you're gonna die you know we know we're a speck of dust we know this is all ephemeral and fleeting and that we don't matter so we have to do things to feel like we matter oh that makes sense as we don't so you sort of exercise your superiority over people in order to shield yourself from the futility of your existence yes and to feel immortal and you know I mean to procreate the idea of because we know our mortality is so present in our amygdala all day every day that I'm better than you therefore I'm gonna procreate more and we are going to sustain and propagate mmm so that we have a sense of lasting yes that's why we want to make a name for ourselves that's why we want to get famous have the tangible things stuff like that it drives it's an anxiety that manifests in materialism workaholism needing titles sort of shit like that Wow that makes sense so nasty evil people that subjugate all their employees and yell at everybody and like that's what they're doing no they're gonna die yeah they know but they don't even it's so deep in the subconscious they have no awareness of why they're behaving the way they behave it's well they've done these studies were cuz I got super into it cuz I didn't recognize my behavior I felt like kind of the zombie I was like trying to like set up all these TV shows and I was like writing all these movies just like and I was like this is so weird because my dad just died I should know exactly what matters in life which is none of this shit achievements or money or any of that but I was super into like I gotta buy this house and I need to get you know this and this thing and this watch and I was like this is so not who I am but it was me trying to cope sort of with all of this anxiety about death but they totally studies where they put showed subjective video and subliminal messaging put one frame of just the word death imperceptible to the actual eye and afterwards they showed people pictures of woods or cities and said where would you rather be and you would normally go beautiful woods nature and they always pick cities because you just subconsciously felt more scared and wanted to be in a place that was safer shit like that cities are safer than the woods I mean just the idea of some protection and right you know lots of civilization yeah the woods are scary because we're on some level know that we're only superficially at the top of the food chain you know if we're out in the woods with a bear and there's no guns or cages it's we're gonna lose it's like the idea that we just know how vulnerable we are that's interesting because I would feel like there's some anxiety attached to the overpopulation aspect of cities sure there's got to be some of that and the cars and the noise noise we're not designed for that right the fight-or-flight we're always in fight-or-flight mode basically do you ever get a chance to go to places where there's no cell phone service and you're in like the legitimate forest are he's trying to get me to do the month no cell phone our he's a weirdo don't listen to that guy he's crazy that feels a little extreme but I want them he's got the phone on flip phone thing going on but he's a real junkie he had a problem with food he was eating candy like all day every day and I was going bro what are you doing recently no a few years ago yeah years back but he was just like he had a real problem with candy mm-hmm just like re develops these things and he would get real obsessed with social media you know he was it's addictive it's fuckin addictive yeah I get I have an addictive personality I fucking get it yeah but I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying to I did that I turned the colors off on the phone no I don't have it now because I was fucking posting cuz my thing came out today but they say Allah the reason it's so addictive is all the colors so you can put it in grayscale so it's black and white there's a phone that they just released as an Android phone that's all in grayscale it's like in that white paper shit that you get like from a Kindle that's what I need it's so unlike it's so fucking unappealing you just like I fucked us morose so I'm trying to do that shit - because it's it's - I think that we're gonna look back at this the way we like look at cigarettes and if I think so too no we're gonna be like people used to use those I broke my phone in Hawaii last year and it was like three days to get a new one I had an order one and get it sent to me from the mainland and you know I was on vacation so and I was bowhunting so just tracking animals all day with no phone which ones in Hawaii lanai okay I'd be in what animals axis deer okay it's um a deer that's native to India and they're overpopulated on Lanai there's thousands of them there's 20,000 deer and 3,000 people you never seen anything like it it's fucking crazy and they have to hunt them it's like one of the places on the planet where there's a real ethical imperative to hunt these animals because there's no predators so the only way they control their populations through hunting that's the only way and if there's overpopulation they graze and there's no food problem I mean there's plenty of food it's a tropical island but the problem is you run into this real possibility of disease and you know it's just not good but the the point being I was there for a solid three days with no phone and it was this weird feeling of peace because I get calmed me down in this weird way it's like the desire to check one check my email real quick let me look at my photos which one will I post something on Instagram I'm gonna check my Twitter yeah see if somebody sent me a direct message let me see if anybody sent me any pictures that I want to look at Joey sent me any of his shit I think something that is so it's like such an obvious solution but I realized so much of going to the phone is to check time we have to it's like the new pocket watch right and then once you go to look at the time then you see your text message and you know you wear a watch I don't and I need to it was just where what yeah I need just I'm gonna start to wear watch and then also getting a separate camera so much of what we do is to take pictures I gotta take pictures of this and then I'm on my phone you think use this with a flip phone the flip phone tick tock tick tock tick you don't know about tick-tock I know about for my kids they do the tick I don't know what it is it's like live-streaming dancing from what I understand I know it only from Cristina's page cuz she puts on smooth yeah it started as a music app called musically I changed the name to take not only people dancing it's a lot of kids kids are all over it but you don't want to talk or be funny now become what vine was but it's still based around music wasn't vine only like five seconds and this is a little bit longer but there's a lot of songs over the last year that have gotten popular off there including like Old Town Road which is the number one song oh yeah I got popular off of there off of that's how I got Bob you know wow well if God could popular with my kids for sure my kids knew about that song way before me they were singing him you never see that there's a video of little NAS X whatever his name is at a school and he's on stage and these kids are singing along it is fucking adorable Oh sing along to the song it's really true that song he's doing one with Dolly Parton I think and what was this the controversy they wouldn't let the song be on the country charts that was the big controversy races that's fuckin racist that's all it is that is a goddamn country song and not Garth Brooks that other guys Cyrus is honorably ray yeah yeah well they once they put him on then it they allowed it on the country charts he wasn't in the original version so they had to put him on it am I wrong about that you are correct well you know but hoody and hoody was this hunt country singer yes but he started out as a regular singer and then came over at the country yeah his career kind of fell apart as a punk movie and the Blowfish went away Darius Rucker yes thank you he's really good fuck he's got a beautiful voice of all the things I remember and he may be just that's his shit he's into it but his career was floundering in the other world and then he went into the world of a and flannel and they took off I fucking dried home to a lot of his music Hollow I don't know why that hootie and the blowfish was a legit jam I wonder why they didn't last right they're on tour again right now Wow mmm who doesn't say but Aaron Lewis abstained also singer oh he's a huge he's gay he wears Magga hats and he's got don't tread on me tattooed on his neck that was like during the time of him nice guy we're like all the bands were like like there was like a moment where that's what all the music sound like yeah and maybe that just wasn't like Train Toad the Wet Sprocket yeah the fucking maybe just got sick of it the band Pearl Jam they're all Pearl Jam groans best that's what it is but yeah man such a good song yeah it's so crazy when I think about that Jeremy spoken song I had no white like it was so weird when it came out I had no concept of what it even fucking meant no I was listening it was on mix the other day and I was like was it about suicide didn't wasn't about a kid that that blew his head off in Jeremy spoke in class today I think he blew his brains out in class remember that video is fucking sinner star it's about suicide Jesus guys didn't make out to a suicide song I had no idea what he was even about yeah there's a lot of really McCobb shit going on back down with music remember that was that silver chair remember that's silver cheering videos wanna rape me how about that literally forgot about it until just this moment rape me my friend used to dance to it she's a drink to it smoke weed to it we used to sing along if it was on tick-tock now we'd be singing along to it what crazy fucking wild who would be the Kurt Cobain of to like what that was such a big deal like who would it can't have that with the internet there's someone would meet to him they'd find out shit about them there'd be a dick pic yeah people get are sure I mean he had poor judgment he dated Courtney Love II married her right but like when he killed me definitely taking pictures of his dick who's that big right now who's that big of a star there's so many stars now yeah I think that's we've diluted the pool and there's so many stars we've never heard of it used to be like there was a star we all knew about we're old that's part of it there's people that someone I'm like oh who's that person they for 70 million followers never heard of what yeah what yeah we're out of the loop um I'm way more out of the loop than you he's more in the loop than both of us do you think that changes in a couple of weeks when they take the follower accounts off of like yeah there's only in Australia it's hot they're testing it in other countries before they drop it here funny is that it's like fucking like they tried drugs out other countries trying out the follower count thing what that's gonna be weird I wonder would help people go why are they doing that because they feel like they're doing a disservice to people by having them compete yeah you won't be seeing other people's stuff so it might sell a lot of people make money no not me I don't ever do ads on Instagram but a lot of people do I don't either I bet you get offered ooh ton of shit a lot but I say no because you just think it's corny yeah I'll do ads for things I like where I put it up for free yeah but I've never second you believe in yeah like if like someone circles fucking earth like maybe it is an ad but it's not an ad I'm getting paid for like if I find something that's cool you just do it just put it up like this is a badass thank you so much I think it helps and I've been offered a lot of money multiple times to do ads for things on Instagram I'm like look I do ads on my podcast everybody knows it's an ad yeah if I'm doing I'm not doing that on Instagram I'm just that doesn't seem like it makes sense like if someone goes to your Instagram they want to see cool shit that you're interested in yeah they want to see a picture of something wanna see a picture of my dog or food or fucking sunset or a mountain or whatever the fuck it is they don't want to see sneakers that you're selling unless it's like but if it's a friend of mine sneakers if he's sound I'll take a picture that and put it up I don't want any money I think it feels corny you know I think for you especially I think people trust you so much and you're known for telling the truth and selling out if you had a hashtag ad everyone was like it just feels paid it's like your thing it would just be like make a good product yeah I do it for free all the time yeah I'd really do and people I don't even know if they have something cool I'll put it up there have you ever felt like no she's not worth it cuz you probably lose in the long run yeah it's like if I was poor yeah I would do it yeah if I was poor I'd do it I did fear factor fuck I'm doing a lot of horse shit it's not I'm not above whoring myself but I'm not gonna whore myself if I have money yeah that doesn't make any sense but that is weird cuz I wonder how people are gonna a lot of people make money from yeah I did not it's not related directly to this but they deleted a bunch of accounts apparently yesterday Consett had up to 13 million followers really meme accounts and shit why the whole account for there were a couple of reasons they might have done it like well there's a lot of meme accounts that steal jokes crazy make money off of it there was a girl you saw that girl on is a Meg right who was calling out that a fuck cherry guy who was just doing comics jokes it was out his name was me I don't know Meg right oh she was a comedy person yeah who big comedy writer yeah and who was just like connecting the comics joke to the meme and so many that well at least they slowed down like the progress of that fat Jewish guy that slowed down he doesn't have nearly the sort of trajectory he used to have but that was all what he was about this is like taking people shit mm-hmm and repurposing and making a lot of money and then also got getting on television shows being interviewed and not having a fucking talent at all just agree posting things and I people DM me all the time hey good night now that Beveren scared that can I use your tweet and my Instagram for you get now I have to do work to say yes so you can approach you know it's just like be a lot of people are like curators I think they call it is that why they deleted them quickly that article if there's like they could have been taking advertising money and not saying it I'm just reading and instagrams advertising deals reposting people shit all they dead end of article is said that there is no way they can get those accounts back there's like non-negotiable oh shit well fuck off but so will it basically go everyone's gonna have no followers you won't be able to see that you'll be able to see your account like you'll know every day I'm gonna post an Instagram photo of my account that people recognize bitches people are fuckin falling off cliffs taking selfies have you seen it it's like the fucking Darwin or you'll see the likes you just won't be able to see your father none of it you'll be able to see how many likes you have on your photos what I'll do is I'll post something in the
