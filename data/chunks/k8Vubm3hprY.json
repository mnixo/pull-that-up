hello freak bitches you know that's true right you could guess based on their the precedents yeah yeah man yeah it's very fluid jeez Tom she's doing I mean freaking Salvage I drink a lot of water no no you don't that's the first time you've cracked it open what yeah you guys fighting why I hydrate a lot more than he does Oh is this an issue it's not closed you hydrate more than of course and absolutely not I've been hydrating this whole time mmm interesting no but he has that drink - that's ounces this is hydration much smaller well I'm smaller being I weigh like a fraction of what he weighs I'm very tiny and petite I'm oh jeez look at my moniker and Dad mouth but look at water to me I say the water champion is that what you tell people I'm clearly the water champion we've decided this I got to do I got to do a full new show a lot of times you know they go you're doing like eight minutes right I did the entire Brock I did the weather and everything always DJ dad mouth everyone what city was this in Des Moines really yeah so happy were there they were just oh my god what are you doing in Des Moines I was I was there I did two nights just at the funny bone is it fun yeah I had a really good time really good time did you come up with this DJ dad mal thing just like it was it a specific like like a plan or did you do it like for fun for fun totally for fun just one day yeah and then we just did what happened was tell Jo the whole story I was eight months pregnant and he's like I'm gonna buy like a ton of DJing equipment I'm like wait what are you doing like he's like imma buy like ten thousand dollars with a shit in her house and I was like alright this is your I clearly knew this is his last hurrah as a free person so I try not to give him too much static and then sure enough all this DJing stuff shows up not ten grand you know it's you've got decks and fucking lights and lasers and right yeah he's got a lot he's got he's a real DJ he does like he goes to clubs yeah he can do it would you say he does yes he does yes she's making a face because I was like I'll get good enough at this to do after parties after my shows I'm serious I was half serious yeah because I was like you know what because I you know I love hip-hop I've always grown up and I've always wanted to do it so I got that I got like you know intraday I'm not not tenth that not even 5,000 like not even close to that I just bought turntables and got fur jackets gold chains no but come on that shit was just silly to get if you were a DJ today and you were trying to spin turn tails don't you think people be asking to take selfies in the middle of it and it would fuck up your flow yeah if I was DJing yeah if you were like doing an after party people try to take selfies with you yeah probably right yeah for sure they would yeah routine I have to be honest who really gave me the idea idea where I was like oh like this is actually possible was Hannibal because I was in Cleveland earlier this year and I saw him tweet that he was in Cleveland doing a pop-up show right he just tweeted out and doing like a whatever like a rock club pop-up show and that no advance notice so I texted him I was like I'm over at hilarities that great club in Cleveland when is your show he said like nine I go mine's at eight you're gonna do a guest spot and he goes yeah so then afterwards he had an after-party at the and I and that's me basically geeking out on the decks excited ties yeah so and then Tony trim which is a DJ that travels with him was like oh dude you can just get this and that you can just buy this stuff and and and that's what really got me to do it well scroll one up let's look at that white guy dance move look at that move you're doing there he's doing it you doing this oh guy dad yeah yeah that's true just listening to yes that's what really geeked me out and the name DJ dad mouth came because he was becoming a father at the time and I was like you're like way lame bro leave me a dad yeah and then it kind of morphed into DJ dad that's true oh that's true but taking it on to morning news was like funny that was like so fun it was like all the time you know so when you went on as a one time goof did you have a plan or did you do not really what you do I was just like the fun thing was to go was when cuz I the thing I hate the most we do they're like what cannot ease as expect this weekend they always say though I hate that and I'm like oh fucking show jokes yeah what do you talk about yeah what's what's what's bothering you right now Tom yeah that's the setup tell what's going on your life and they think yous good like and then they go just do whatever you want like just have fun with it so when they do that I was just like it's not really I don't really give a fuck about comedy and then they're like what I'm like it's about the after-party you know we degenerate like it here just a goof because it was fun to have her and be like alright well you are at the funny bone right like I mean for a minute you have the funny bone sitting right there off-camera like what do you the best part is when he sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him stupid questions yeah like did you oh you had someone do the bird as fat thing I had that was the best one yes you know if you ever at sometimes when you go hey you know asked me about farts or something right there was like like so they they know not to they checked themselves on asking something provocative or that's not 100% PG so I didn't know how I would go but I go oh ask me what birds so fat and the lady goes okay and and then so we just are in the middle of this interview and she goes white bird so fat and I was that's a good question like I just rolled with it you know and then it grew and then a hot dog eating champion a guy that was in the name scotch oh and she placed Sydney place yeah he's like one of the he was like a super competitive eater like a Kobayashi dude yeah yes this guy oh my god whose side you probably the audio on this it's incredible life-changing stuff eight months he drops per hundred pounds my cheek light day for the year water which I have two giant inspirations first my wife that's alright second anniversary alright I want to say hi to her and there's a comedian I love he's a big giant fat guy just like me Burt Chrysler Tom and burnt have been doing this thing for a fucking year now hashtag Burt is fat and then Burt will write Thomas fat and then they'll argue they make videos with their shirts off arguing who's fatter yeah it was fun it's actually you know it's died down a lot but like the fact that that guy but he did it on his own extra view up yeah I see oh yeah that's a mean that we didn't like we talked about on your mom's house but we never thought we'd do all kinds of silly stuff but this one really resonated with the audience why did that one really resonate you know what there was there was great theories about this and I'm and I think it was this I think mat fulcrum pointed out to me the full charge said you gave him the formula you gave audiences a joke formula here's a person mmm-hmm it's a fat joke go go ahead and I think that was what was fun for people with shame just to jump in on something that it's all like the formula is there to pick a side that's the competitive nature of it yeah yeah and they know that you guys really are good friends some did some did not I know I would say most most people did most people did some people get mad oh yeah some people were like really fucking really harsh and really like fuck I've always fucking hated burries a piece of shit like you like shit like that but it wasn't the majority some people were like that though yeah same thing to me some people were like you know see it's one of my theories about this Trump thing hmm I think people just pick a fuck
