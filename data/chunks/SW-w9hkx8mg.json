hello freak bitches what's your take on this Trump versus the intelligence community jazz that seems to be going on right now because I couldn't wait to get you in here to get an insider's perspective on this because I've never seen anything like it I mean I've never seen anything like what he was talking shit about flu shots today he's like flu shots the biggest scam ever like are you sure yes done reser are you a doctor Wow well yeah I know that whole and he's kind of appointed not appointed but he's brought somebody in as an advisor on that who is you know against vaccinations yeah that term is and not the Intel thing there's so many ways you can take this it was a you know basically was a self-inflicted wound it was unnecessary there was no reason for him in the early stage of this when that narrative started to build about others this rift building between Trump and the Intel community it was because of his tweets right it was because of him questioning the the intelligence about Russian meddling in our election system you know and now to talk about that just for a second of course the fucking Russians were meddling the Russians have been meddling in US politics and and campaigning over here in a way since they've been around as have the Chinese as have the Chinese you could go back to and people said this is a fascinating period of time in history back to like 1941 go back to when the Russians were still in an alliance and a pact with the Nazis and so from the Russian perspective their goal there their point was to keep the u.s. out of the war and so what did they do there's an isolationist wing in the States and Roosevelt was under a lot of pressure Roosevelt was was becoming very close to Churchill he understood the threat he was one of the few people that did at the time he understood how important it was going to be for America to get into this battle the UK was about ready to fall and so the British were actually running their intelligence operations out of New York they had place over in Rockefeller Rockefeller Center and because they were worried they were Island was going to be run over by the Nazis so you have this going on the dynamic with the Russians was that they were still in this act you know with the Nazis Stalin didn't see this comin he didn't see that you know on the Nazis were running a very large propaganda campaign a diversion effort to ensure that the Russians wouldn't know that they were about to invade so the Russians spent a great deal of time and money and resource here in the u.s. influencing US public opinion about staying out of the war there's no reason to be in the world why would you want to get into another war in Europe and they bought journalists and placed newspaper articles they paid off journalists they were setting up associations that were supposedly independent but were run by the Soviets they were influencing unions dumping money into unions and bribing basically to get them to steer their membership to isolationist you know agenda so to say that I don't know if the Russians were meddling of course they've been doing it that's the and then although I've through the Cold War you know that's this is what they do so you know but it the narrative because it always has to be simplified I think as far as the media is concerned the narrative was that they influence the election we'll know they were meddling but they weren't hacking into election systems they weren't hacking into voting booths and then changing these things so so we say meddling what they were doing is essentially they were getting information that was private that was being distributed between the Democratic right - that's right they were definitely involved in in the DNC hacking front right they were definitely involved in - how were they involved would they involve what they did they directly did the hacking to the Democrats or were they privy to the information because someone sold it to them or got it to them as with most of these things that usually there's cut outs right so there's there's there's plausible deniability and so but the Russians have been very austere no-one the Russians have been very adept over the years at creating mayhem creating chaos around democratic institutions their whole goal is to chip away at public trust in a democracy not just here in the US but everywhere I mean you know and obviously that played out in proxy wars out in Africa so again I guess what I'm trying to say is it should have shocked no one but the Russians would be engaged in this sort of thing but Trump again a self-inflicted wound he hadn't gotten the full briefings yet he hadn't seen the the intelligence about this and prior to that then he's sending out a handful of tweets saying I questioned it didn't make any sense you have all the opportunity in the world to question the intelligence and the time to do that you know you're sitting there you're getting the briefings from the heads of the agencies which happened and then if you notice after that briefing his his tone changed completely and he came out and you know okay well the Russians were involved right and it didn't make it now I had to walk that back so then he goes out to the agency and again he has a meeting which I think was a great thing I was really happy to see that he did that and and so soon in the administration goes out to to our headquarters out there in Virginia and you know he got sidetracked but that's his personality he starts talking about you know the inauguration numbers he starts talking about the media you know the unfair media well you know what you could just go out there thank of people say you're looking forward to working with them to protect national security interests shake some hands and leave but it's not in his nature right so he's can I get sidetracked he's got to talk about other things and then that becomes the story yeah that's it that's I guess where I'm said a balanced perspective how did it happen because this is what was confusing to me how did the FBI and now original eventually the FBI came around to the CIA's conclusions but for a long time the FBI was disagreeing with the CIA about whether or not the Russians had anything to do with hacking and DNC yeah the big I think the big disagreement was really over motivation right I mean what it was it big part it was an evidence based thing that they didn't see any evidence that the Russians were involved which actually became clear now there was a rest there was an arrest an unprecedented us a couple of days ago right yeah well I think but you're also talking about two different coops so the bureau is the FBI as a law enforcement so when they look at something they're looking at it from a law enforcement perspective they're looking at gathering sufficient evidence to prove a case basically that's how they look at the agency is an Intel operation and so they're get Gavin pieces of information you know it's not an evidentiary chain thing right so let's just get you know the preponderance of Intel let's see where Italy some of its going to be conflicting some of its not well well-sourced but let's all see what it tells us you know and so part of it is how they approach reaching a conclusion but you know they were both going to get to the same place because the eventually they sit down and they compare notes but part of it was the difference of opinion over the motivation and motivations the toughest thing one of the toughest things to prove in in this business and intelligence you know you can say okay they did this but you know unless you've got a source sitting in the tent who was there and part of the conversation when somebody says well you know this is why or if you know this is how we're going to do this and this is a reason without that sort of sourcing or you know intercepts it's it's tough to prove motivation so it took a while to kind of get around to that notion and it's still to be honest you know it's still a little bit up in the air we're probably never going to get unless again we get our hands on a really quality good source that may still be a little bit up in the air but the bottom line is Russian together Russians were engaged in doing what they always do over to action propaganda campaigns whatever it may be there's did the 30,000 foot view was always the same they wanted they want to so a sense of mistrust they want to create some chaos they want to you know kind of chip away at the belief that you know a democracy is a great thing and they did I look how much time was spent talking about the integrity of the election system and whether we actually had a legitimate president or not that's a win so you got a couple of Colonels in the FSB which was the old KGB who undoubtedly been promoted as a result of that operation and who got someone got arrested from the FSB who was that guy yeah I know yeah I don't have those details in front of me I just don't you can got a pissed-off Putin yeah exactly I perform in the fucking hole for why he just said the wrong thing you know but unprecedented right then they never matically arrest their guys but now what they did they have for certain things for corruption issues if they get sideways you know from internal arguments you know then you'll you'll yeah it usually doesn't make the news because nobody really gives a shit outside of Russia and they do now because of this because of men because if people want to talk about it and what bothered me about this starting irreparable what bothered me about this was the narrative because the narrative was Russia the elections that's what every kept saying and then with all these Democrats these left-wing people were saying to try to pump up this idea that Trump was not a legitimate president Russia hacked the election Russia hacked election well know someone maybe Russia whoever it was put that information out that the DNC had sent through private emails but the information was what they sent I mean it wasn't they didn't hack anything right they didn't get into any election machines they didn't they didn't get into the voting machines they didn't do anything other than release information that was supposed to be private that indicated a bunch of really shady shit yeah exactly I mean all those by all those Bernie Sanders how pissed off what you behalf of your Bernie Sanders supporter and yeah Bernie himself fucked over he got yeah well he seemed to have made peace I guess he sees a politician that even though he says he's not I mean at the Cosmopolitan yeah yes no it's a weirdly principled one yeah exactly I mean I you know what I Bernie would have been a better candidate I think Bernie would work a Joe Biden would have been a better candidate oh well you know you always like the person sitting on the bench and then they get in the race and they're not you know that's true too right they want to dug up some shit about those guys but Bernie was an interesting guy and there was not a whole lot of people that are in his position for as long as he is that have the kind of principles he has like when he was able to say you know why don't you release the transcripts of all these different speeches you gave to all these banks that you got paid a quarter million dollars he goes I'll happily release mine because I don't have any because I wouldn't take a penny from those people not a whole lot of people who could say stuff like that in a big debate yeah and you know they rallied they got together and they they decided to rig the primaries and they rigged it they really did yeah that was what the Russians exposed but I debbie Wasserman Schultz she was a real piece of work and uncredible yeah so that so I think there's and you're right now I guess what you know why obviously what what people on that on the far left side are saying is well but without that if they hadn't released that information then it would have been a different ballgame and you know they didn't right because we wouldn't know how fucking corrupt she was right I wouldn't know the debbie Wasserman Schultz had done what she done the debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't have gotten fired from the DNC and it immediately got hired by Hillary's campaign yeah I mean they picked her up in a couple of minutes yeah well she obviously they want to keep her happy yeah you know how long you been walking out of that organization with with a chip on their shoulder logging so especially after what she did for you I mean they rigged the primaries they really did and people should be upset about that way more than anything else this idea that Russia did something when you expose something that you should that we should have known we should have known about it because it's a crime you know that kind of corruption is essentially collusion it's a crime it's a conspiracy it's a real conspiracy - they're they're they're interrupting a democratic process that's what they're doing right right well and then that was yeah far more so than an outside force doing what you expect them to do anyway yeah and frankly the Russians did they always do yeah so I think it would've been a great how interesting with those big conversations though in in the Kremlin or at FSB headquarters where they're talking about this yeah and they're thinking about they're planning it someone had to write a note right someone had to sit and say yeah I got an idea for an operation and and they had cuz they you know their bureaucracy like everything else and so they would have had to sit and figure this out and then it would have made its way to Putin because you know this obviously they concern over the blowback and the publicity of it all so Putin clearly knew what was going on but again that's just the way it works Stalin knew back in the day knew exactly what they were doing trying to influence public opinion here back during the early World War one or two so yeah there's no surprise the Chinese do the same thing every you know every nations got the resources I mean he'll we of course we do it till people would say well but we do it well yeah of course we do it you know I'm not saying we don't you know they don't do it at half of the weird competition that's going on and you better hope we do it and in a sense I would say the same people say when I talk about uh you know cyber hacking or whatever you people always go yeah well you don't have any right to talk the u.s. does it as well thinking well yeah that's actually a good thing given how aggressive and how nasty the world is out there and how we're constantly being hit and attacked out in cyberspace I mean yeah we better hope we're good at it and you know if people knew how often how consistently and constantly our commercial and public sector infrastructure is probed and tested and attacked on a daily basis
