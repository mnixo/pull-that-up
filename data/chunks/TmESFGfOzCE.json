the gyro can experience well I love dogs too I love animals and this that's something that people have a weird problem with but they don't have a weird problem with loving animals and feeding their animals animals like I have friends who fucking are vegans and they have cats and I'm like do you understand that cats only eat meat it's not like a dog a dog can eat carrots a dog can eat grains got dogs eat rice like if I have a friend who cooks for his dog and he gets his dog ground beef and mixes it with potatoes and rice and it's delicious you do that for your dog oh yeah it doesn't a probably himself but yeah but you can't do that with a cat if you're gonna do with a cat it has to be just animal protein that's it that's really the only thing that cat is allowed to eat yeah you can't feed cats grains cats are not supposed to eat rice that's supposed to eat carrots cats eat fish and the chicken and the beef and the liver and they they eat animal protein they're carnivores there's straight Carnaval so for you to be a vegan and have a fucking cat living in your house like you're involved in the killing of animals whether you like it or not I mean I guess there's probably some vegan cat food but I can't imagine you let's do it right now they'd probably kill the cat it's probably not good vegan cat food bad let's let's look up that cats what a diligent Livius yeah that's that's one of my two phobias cats okay vegan cat food you know I just would imagine that shit is not good that basically mini lions Oleg says actually and the vegan cat foods contained adequate amounts is it okay to raise a cat vegan hmm I think it's hilarious by the way I think that is Virgo Alerus now artists and activists with more than one feline the family in Ithaca New York more in her partner sure aya Goulding that means they're lesbians what a surprise lesbian vegans with cats that's crazy you never hear about that relatively small but deeply dedicated group of vegan pet owners who believe their cats and villain diets should reflect their own beliefs about the treatment of animals and the environmentally sustainable sustainable lifestyles is it okay to give your diet of mm-hmm spare me on the phone outrage be outraged the billions of land animals and trillions of sea animals tortured and killed each year in the u.s. torch it alone for food to feed people and pets oh man you know you leave a cat outside that cats gonna kill a bird that that's sweet kitty cat that you have as a murderer yeah my cat makes these crazy noises when he looks outside he sees like something like a squirrel his little jaw starts going they start their jaws start moving up and down like they can't help it like they're just thinking about biting Tilly have you ever had fight dreams like what you wake up kicking you know you know those dreams well cats have those when they see a fucking animal they want to kill it's like that they have reflex looks out the window yeah have you ever watched them like stork stalk you stalk your leg and then watch a lion there is very little difference you're like a line crawling through the grass or a cat crawling through your carpet yeah like they look identical oh yeah absolutely identical they're murderers bro they have fucking murderers apparently what they're saying is for a lot of these a lot of these people that are they're making these these diets for these dogs there's like a big debate whether or not it's healthy for the dogs it's about the figure yeah eating diets for dogs and cats whether or not it's a matter of the animal getting all the proper nutrients or just being able to stay alive so I don't really understand people's relationships with dogs in that sense like I get the whole like man having a dog but people get weird so like we had we know a a friend of a friend who told us they have a patient who's got Munchausen's you know Munchausen's yeah you know which is basically so they basically make up things so that you can get their dog operated on like it's just like as in problems so that they have an excuse to get yeah an operation on the dollar but just like like it's like their kid apparently what they're saying is that dogs and cats have a much different nutritional requirement than human beings and that the they need much higher protein in tech then a human does so especially dogs can eat a bunch of other shit like yams and potatoes and all these different other things it's okay as long as they get sufficient amount of protein but it's almost impossible to get the amount of protein that a dog needs with just plants and cats just a fucking joke cats are you know here's what you know put put lay out some fucking meat and lay out a bowl of beans see where fluffy goes Oken down these pieces of meat you know happy yams fluffy fucking ridiculous cat food shut the fuck up that thing's a murderer man you're gonna keep keep it keep it from being a murderer it's its nature I mean you know it's what it does that's what a cat does it's kind of comedy like everybody who's been pushing all the like the tofu and all the the soy stuff over the last couple years it's time to get breast cancer men you know it's just you're discovering it's bad for you I used to ate that stuff instead of milk and I'd always feel sick but I was like it's got to be healthy for you everyone keeps telling me that if I got man boobs that's why I have boobs yeah even vegan cats.com is telling people to feed their cats meat that's when shit gets real when vegan cats calm tells people to feed their cats meat after much soul-searching we've decided that we need we only feed him asshole cows
