yes we're live please gentlemen we're live and we're here to talk about Brendan Schaub shoes fucking shoes that you wore to the Mayweather McGregor fight what in the fuck you bought those or they someone gave them to you is some opinion where ya tell me oh jeez famiiy like Jared Leto that's what Bryan set you up the video of him was like oh god he's gonna judge me so he's gonna judge me so uh it's part of you though I like a man a man I wear a fanny pack I gotta shut the fuck up no matter any any time where there's any sort of fashion discussion I just gotta shut the fuck up me back to make sense though the only the only my you are you like a handmade yeah I'm from Britain yes 18 holes are delicious sir let's not buckle what the fuck is that about my throne shits on a Khaleesi buckle that I just can't get a number what's the betta back is that a bee yeah it's a gold be son I get more cuts of gold yeah is this like one of those that black or blue dress thing or just it's on these shoes than any shoe I've ever had and you're 6 foot 4 gorilla now you're scared of no jail oh I saw jail if she loved your shoes she was I love your shoes well she does she's a chick the cosine well she's probably also trying to make a rod jealous because they've probably been together long enough where she's starting to feel bored yeah here I was just trying to basically get the crackle going Jamie does that look like gold to you or am I going blind that's a gold bead go back up to that he's going to see the buckles like silver yeah I guess different could go larger and that's a little posing on oh is it I mean I just don't get the hate on this baby I'm looking at me they are gorgeous they're so gross and then on top of them being gross they have sneaker lasers which makes me more stupid it's just not for you I guess it's like a light gold I'm thinking of like you know like oh right oh wow those are going on TV suck contrast that one looks different that one's I have to walk the red carpet after Bruce Willis in those shoes and some guy goes killer boots man like a dumb and dumber yeah Bruce Willis that old ass can't pull these off and one started laughing but I think he heard I was like oh mister diehard please please don't please don't judge me but I will will kick you on these things twisted the movie said yeah there's something about like leaving that foot that buckle mark on someone's forehead embarrassing just for quiet guy in skinny jeans in those boots whoops your ass that's embarrassing do you remember when Pete Williams had kicked Mark Coleman oh my god remember that yes it was just like the world felt like a bat it was was also like one of those like why the fuck like who saw that coming like we thought that Pete who was a young guy is dealing with Coleman who was just all super gorilla super gorilla and then you know Pete wore his ass out and landed that perfectly plays head kick if he had that buckle on dead you would see that mark forever that Gucci a Gucci yeah I mean pika I'm tired people I'm just a bad motherfucker back boom got that asically face though yeah enjoy them Asics I was a big bad win damn that dude is contesting that if you had that mark like that like your boots on boom and just like thank you chief it's all that was a cheap baby yeah if you notice Pete kicked my shoes on last fights that you do you think some more like with the point yeah hell yeah the robbers are doing a wheel kick like a spinning heel dig in some boots yeah I guess I think with the heel kicked out quite honestly does don't think it matters it lands it lands both so there's so much power in that cake and if you land your landing with your heel and your heel can it's not like a knuckle it breaks you never break your heel never I did hit somebody once so hard that my foot was sore and I was limping for a couple days with a heel kick with a heel kick he's horrible hit the hell he went to sleep for a long time they took him to the hot it was scary I was 19 that's bad okay I didn't tell you the story's a fucked-up story I was it made me reconsider fighting rodent killed who does this a thing I said to my instructor because my instructor wasn't there he was in California I was in I was in Boston and he goes I heard you had a really good knockout you know this accent yeah and I go yeah I was it was scary I go caught him with a wheelchair can I go and he just didn't get up and I thought he was dead he goes sometimes they die he walks away dead Syria dad serious yeah he was training troops an old school yeah he didn't care at all and I was like but wait a minute they died I'm them I'm very melee is MIA I got for sure composable I wasn't the best for sure somebody gonna fuck me out I'll see ya I never got head kicked but I saw people that it was close to get head kick did you ever get killed in tournaments just TKO'd teach boxing match a kickboxing match where they stop you got rocked and he came and stopped it yeah I got rock the left hook um I got my legs just shut off boy oh wait is that it's the weirdest feeling of all time what people think is that I get hurt no a liver shot hurts like if you get kicked to the liver or punched in the liver in your whole body will die your legs kind of give out that hurts but there's a weird thing about getting hit on the chin it's like everything just goes yes it's a real feeling yeah just stops working it might be my body would get hot the worst man what is it like to get completely flatlined it's nothing because you don't you don't feel anything right so you don't feel anything you don't when you come out of it what's your what's your most recent memory not much everything's a little a little like fuzzy and then someone tells you what happened and then you remember certain parts of the fight like god I remember doing that and that and then what happened you know I'm saying like you have to piece it like puzzle it together this one and then you get in the back because there's there's two type of people that when you get concussed or flatline in my experiences you react to one get really emotional like heartbroken sat like super super sad the other gets really really upset like mad super mad and I I've always seen those two opposites and you think it is this from concussed or is this from the emotions of losing and realizing you lost after it's all over I think it's a combination of both mmm you know I'm saying yeah but this is one of the reason why I want to bring this up is because everybody always wants to talk about the power of belief you know and how important the power of belief is and it's super important you know and it's a big factor in Konnor success is this like insane belief he has in himself but even with the power of belief at ten you still have to deal with the limitations to the body correct and you still have to deal with like what is the reality of getting hit on the chin correct but that that self belief that Connor has got him into the biggest fight in combat sports history what if he even had a little bit of doubt we're not here your hundred we're talking about him I know so it's a fine line say yeah self belief only goes so far man even myself I myself belief was so high pride it matched my skills but I was so confident could beat anyone in the world I beat a lot of guys that probably had no business beating or just getting through he beat cro cop yeah he's a legend yeah you beat him by knockout yeah but like get getting through Golden Gloves man I thought I was the next Mike Tyson I'm probably not but I beat most of those guys just off sure well but I believed in my heart of hearts I was gonna be the best of all play you know you were a competitor and there's some people that have a hard time with the big moment Connor obviously shines in the big moment but at the end of the day even with that insane belief you get to see his physical limitations but what you got to see though is well you got to see a lot in that fight but you don't know what's going to happen until they do it that's why I didn't fight so he has this amazing belief in himself and he had a really interesting style man that whole thing where he was doing like putting his hands out there and and pap-pap tapping him yeah and then throwing off off-speed punches and then drop another how about is it his the angles were so good so good in and so exaggerated and big you'd get Floyd's back and very smart he wouldn't turn into them they give him more manual he just cover up to the ref was gonna stop it right my the real MVP of that fight granted you know Conner and Floyd that wrath oh yeah I read him fight you the real mvgame granted he came you know his opening dialogue what the hell was that he's just staring at McGregor like now we don't want to know that that gay rasslin and just like I don't think he said that I think I thought he was way over the top I wanted the fight to start so I thought he was over the top cuz I wanted to fight come on let's go this fucking national anthem do that no you do that lock room but I just thought it was off to the wrong foot but I think he granted I don't think Connor was gonna win that fight as it went on however he the Connor did have an advantage if they went in tight he'd even let it get there yeah grappling under hooks what yeah and and that was where Connor was can get his rest he didn't have that opportunity where as soon as they got there that ref separator yeah he was gonna let him fight yeah he was in one fight use the perfect rest however I think Connor thought you'd be able to get his rest in those moments and just never was capable of doing it to the reference I think he got more tired than he ever thought it was going to I thank you also the efficiency of Floyd here's what I did I watched it live from the third round on I got off stage Washington DC the first two I ran up stage I did last yesterday okay watch the yesterday at home but I flew our mayor flew upstairs it was that they had it on pay-per-view in the upstairs greenroom so we ran upstairs type move yeah but I caught on the third round yelling Ian Edwards I'm like I'm like how's it going it goes the fights great this is a great fight so I got in there like writing it I didn't want to give these people waiting in line a long time show started late people bought tickets months in advance and I'm like I'm not cut my show short yeah I'm gonna do the full show and then I'll thank everybody good night in there much better person I ran upstairs and I got in the third round so I didn't see all the the speech until I heard about it afterwards so that I heard then I tried to watch from the time they were both walking out but the National and um stop I love I'm not mad at demi lovato she can sing when that's an American flag it's on my phone okay I love America love it I'm a big proponent in the best aspects of America but to enough see on the Rockets red glare and the bump standing ovations Bravo girl he's a beautiful singer no doubt approach it from a teleprompter though well it's probably good move you don't want to fuck it up like who fucked it up Miley Cyrus did she fuck it up there's been some people up fuck - somebody forgot the words somebody fucked up the words you said Oh Christina Aguilera that's what was was that her that was Christina when she's she's going through a tough time she's got a little heavy back down heavy like unsexy thick like a little over the line - like what's going on too many super sizes it's not just that like when someone gets that big that quick you start thinking about depression you know that wasn't Roseanne Barr well you know what she did though that was back in the day when Roseanne I was on top of the world she grabbed her pussy and spit which is hilarious yeah yeah she's a savage of savages and people got super mad at her and this was pre social media but click on the youtube link to that find out what or if it says there when Roseanne did it yeah see totally before the internet with on the ground right before watch she's an animal she's an ass she's an animal I love her great you know that Whitney is like executive producing her new show that makes sense totally true that's right yeah and Whitney's like she's a great joke writer - phenomenal writer and probably I mean I gotta fit I don't remember really talking her too much about Roseanne maybe we did I maintain she one of the top most important comedians of all time she's here I said you changed the face of women's comedy she did she changed the face of women's comedy she got her start in Denver Sun yes she did how many works how many works she's a beast yep with kids at almost kids right here Dennett dad yeah here hold yeah yeah fucking animal I like her yeah well they're doing a show together but I got what I was gonna say is I got to think that Whitney must think about it the same way most of most of comics do she's super respected Roseanne I mean super respect yeah that's a big job for Whitney fuck yeah that's huge Afghan is that has a potential especially right now and what the hell's on TV I agree yeah Kevin James has a sitcom named another's head come ready go I got enough I got nothing Goldberg I tell you what I did start watching I start watching Ozark oh my god it's good azar Ozark on Netflix Justin Bateman that's involved with the cartel yep seen it I just saw the do not hold up I'm on season for a game of Thrones people try to send me spoilers ain't happening son I don't even look at him yeah you got to be a name I'm just the biggest Khaleesi fan I will mmm just wait well I get waited the queen of dragons son just wait those dragons nothing Jon Snow this I'm not gonna say anything but this season finale just Jesus Christ and then I see people online where the giant game of Thrones lost its way I'm like how about you fuck off how about you suck on haters everyone's gonna hate on anything man don't a what the White Walkers though I'm on season 3 them graphics were tough on see they look like our Atari out there there's like white things down season 7 I saw looking phenom 1 they look like some super Beast oh yeah they've got that wired know how to do it it's about a nice wall and game is that real there's like a shut the fuck up it's like the Flat Earth right there the same thing here it's a wall that's a nice cross wall yet the wall you know if you've got to keep a wall how good is it wind is coming it's fucking phenomenal I was I'm so happy I was I'm telling you I could not sleep I'm so happy that King Joffrey died that little bit spoiler alert they're on season seven three learn alert people will get mad how dare you job I'm at season one if it's more than three years old I'm allowed to talk about yeah for sure people get mad if you talk about something that happened ten years ago though they get mad like if they haven't seen it it's like you're not supposed to discuss things they probably foot the scene yeah hey bro do you water jokes - yeah yeah I love it Dom ups that's the game of thrones all I watch right now sebastio of all time I think already but I'll say that about other shows to me - I get excited me too I'll throw that out no matter what if I get enthusiastic don't you hold me - I'm not some fucking ranking committee yeah this isn't like the UFC ranking guys you know what we're like the UFC rings just throw up whatever get Thrones number one next week I don't know we'll see I think Max Kellerman is walking around today how many people are fucking with him I saw him thus more Conor McGregor will not land a single punch meanwhile he gland admire bunches on Floyd Mayweather than any boxer ever then many Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto yeah and then people go oh this is frickin Max's debate well that's cos Floyd let him that was his style hey man let's give Conor some credit some credit his pace was so high I think Connor space was so high and he thought he's gonna be landing more shots he just wore himself out there's a little bit of that I also think there's a little bit of an efficiency issue that you know John Danaher go to John Danaher his Instagram page please John Donner who's uh you know one of the best grabs in the world jiu-jitsu mastermind he's also a brilliant guy he's that you on musket jujitsu yeah super smart innovative guy but on top of that he wrote an assessment of how he thinks the fight is gonna play out and it was to explode on absolutely cardio is that Danaher said that he was gonna stop him sometime after the fifth round what's it say yeah tonight is the biggest night bbbbb oh man it's way too long John yeah I don't know he does that he's just to smile it's hey but create a blog though huh you know yeah I mean basically he said here I consider a fine victory for mr. McGregor fees for 512 rounds yes he scroll up a little bit and he'll explained how he said that it usually works yeah here it goes they are quite competitive for the first three to four rounds to do surprisingly well that around the fifth round the elite boxer begins to figure out the unorthodox where awkward movement and begins to employ ring craft tactics to tire the MMA athlete by make him work harder than he is making missed punches etc around the 8th round a very noticeable shift occurs where the elite boxer takes over I expect a similar pattern tonight though probably taking less time given the incredible skill lever mr. Mayweather that's it but it was the exact thing around the 8th round Mayweather was clearly taken over the ninth round Mayweather was getting was fucking Khan Ralph was teeing off on Conor and I actually text it to my friend in between rounds I'm like he's done they're gonna stop I got him to not last from a throne to go to the to the back to do something for Showtime I was like look throne was like help it's over they wouldn't let you know they did you miss some of it well I didn't want to see it real I knew it was over yes so that but then they put me caged side you didn't want to see it uh not really I knew what was happening I just I don't know I don't know how could you not want it boy I knew what was gonna happen I don't you watch Rocky movies bro fuck I wish man but I'm glad they stopped it early I wasn't mad at the stoppage I wasn't even I wasn't mad cuz for a number of reasons but he has a lot more fight left in and there's no we got it ya got it Conor did well he went some rounds he's gonna get fucked up in the next round you made it if he made it into the 11th Floyd Mayweather was gonna fuck him up correct like real bad it would use gas and but your Conor and even Floyd afterwards he goes Floyd they go what was the most surprising thing about this fight and he goes Conor's boxing skills honestly I thought I'd be able to take over early but I wasn't able to because of his boxing skills he was I wasn't surprised by his power there wasn't much power there which is you know whatever he ate that up or straight up flush up or hear from Conor but Connor did not seem like he was putting a lot of power and punches it looks like he was trying to be like real active yeah and like but then also he was like kind of winging them too while he was hitting them with some weird stuff like this and he even did hammerfest yeah did you know for every illegal shot that he if he got DQ'd for million dollars out of his purse ten mil so what everyone's like how do you know he's just not gonna throw a knee or an elbow like a savage like well there's 10 million reasons why you get male hairdresser yeah that's that that was the media I dealt with a meteoroid oh man just not gonna throw a knee and flip out there's no ID there's a gay voice like if you do that voice everyone knows it's a gay board there's not there's no well there's really not like a butch lesbian Wow that seem to be a female truck driver that loves dick Leroy that doesn't mean she's a lesbian yeah Large Marge that was terrifying a Large Marge balls dude pee-wee's big is that was pee big adventure right first one yeah god damn if she was Miss Carrie great movie Hammond oh yeah he's all freaked out and when they finally pulled the drivers [Laughter] got that reference dude pee-wee's big adventure was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid I went with my high school girlfriend we went and we were fuckin crying I loved it we just could we couldn't believe how hard we were laughing it was so good man it was so silly in the next one after that was a fuse big top big top feed him sandwiches and shit while he's trying to get with that girl that is a silly fucking movie if you've never seen that movie and you smoke weed you are in luck Large Marge just fire one up makes a cameo though she's not there for long he's long enough that came out like 84 right 90s right that's when the show came out because I was born in 83 pull it out pull it up because I was in high school I say early 90s man my mom had the VHS that's all we would watch I graduated high school in 85 and this is my high school girlfriend and I went to see it hmm maybe she was in high school 1985 c36 son I was a hundred percent remember being in high school and she was in high school we were both in school and we went to see it Wow powerful Joe his bike was sick was before the TV show or I don't know man I think the TV show was out before that a kids show I guess I mean the church had the HBO special oh yeah that was later that was later I think he had that show up like straight up ABC though remember I'd watch it in the morning that's why our stand I was I thought it was after that Kiwis Playhouse yeah and then he got caught like jacking off for the theater right that was actually after all that he got caught jacking off after he stopped doing the TV show really I thought it was like in the middle of the 90s I was like 90 brawler how's this clear gonna take a bell just cuz he jacked off in a movie theater yeah that was back in the day where people we already had VHS like if you jacked off and it was in a movie theater it was the only way to jack off everybody's like yeah we understand yeah that's all I'm saying give the guy a break but you've you jack off in a movie theater when we have VHS well you're a pervert Oh ninety-one damn arrested for masturbating in an adult theater in 91 that's so crazy it was the movie Sarasota Florida is the problem they had a fucking thing in Sarasota and how do they know that he really did jackoff he's probably really worse right not the heat and tiger shark Nancy nurse was another one anyone to see oh okay well that's what people doing those thought he was only 38 at the time 38 he's the most shot out 38 you ever seen look at that picture he looks like I likey a block like this out of here on them too looks like a blogger in a band he could totally be like a bass player was he smart with is he just loaded or write because he was a big deal when I was a kid Dan merchandise and everything well he took a big hit from this I think if it happened today it would be no big deal but also part of the problem was that he was like a childhood idol thing because you know his show was a kids show even though it was kind of adult themed in a lot of a way a lot of ways the word of the day yeah see the HBO cable television show popularized by pee-wee in 1982 yeah he would look up girls skirts with the aid of mirrors attached to his shoes if he was an original character he's a creep why I love peewee kids how to do that basically that's fucked by bears start a fire with a match do you think people could figure out how to put a fucking mirror on your shoe that was in old movies man but then he just you just shot a show for Netflix did like movie like Peters back right wow that's a long hiatus yeah I took him that long to recover you know what that little too late to you know like it's way too late that's like entourage came with that movie like ten years after the finale come on man why'd they do that it take a long time to make the movie I don't know personalities didn't we do really well though I don't think so thought Raj movie not Tomatoes gives it like a zero well the critics destroyed that it's just too late man yet turtle he's 50 on that bitch it's like yeah bad sex in the city can come back today and chicks would flock to it weren't people piss in a sec in the City movie there man well you know because they can do it they go feel like menopause and shit like the young chicks anymore chasing dick well you know it was weird it was like that one character of uh what's-her-name Samantha yeah the slutty character straight-up whore yeah it gave like a lot of women like they go yeah she could do it I loved her what can I do that's why I can relate to that show like it was the smart one there's one of those the whore and you had one of your friends was one of them I feel like and but they loved their whore friend yes I was like it gave her it like it was the opposite of slut shaming be yourself I like Samantha everybody's not Samantha but Samantha's not everybody like be you're the fuck you are who are you if you're if you're a super freak and you're around a bunch of squares is holding it back just wants to go bust just drink a couple of Cosmopolitan's throw some guy your fucking can go let's go yeah man what's wrong with that what's wrong Samantha yeah it's not your daughter you good yeah also as long as you don't run into the wrong dude that would be the big fear being a woman run into some fucking scary guy some bad murder the rapist yeah terrible person like you way more likely to run into that person as a woman before should know predators yeah producers drank on Samantha's Robin cheating your drinks jaw dropping shitting the drinks that's so rampant if I was a girl I would be terrified of that I've met so many people have told me stories about a guy drugging them or drugging one of their friends or drugging someone they know I thought it was like an old school thing but still goes on kind of a friend she told me yeah she was the climbing shoes and I woke up luckily nothing happened but I woke up no memory of what happened before like what yeah a man in LA that still happens like yeah Hana beside the fuck would you take a drink from a dude though like it should be you know I'm saying well it should be like friendly people like hey we'd like a beer yeah sure give you a beer it should be that's how it should be should be I mean in ideal circumstances she should be able to but there's just too many creeps the world we live in like what you tell your daughters when they're old enough like hey do not take a drink unless you know I'm saying of course that's what the world we live in yes it's not it's not worth the risk I mean hopefully you're gonna run into only nice people who'll give you a drink and they just want to have some drinks with friends and have some laughs have you ever heard of girls roofied a dude never but I'm sure it's happened I did here we will you always heard that story about like the fake urban myth about the Russian girl who gets you drink if it takes you back to your kidney and then you wake up yeah such a device you wake up with the bad guys on your side stitches tells you to get to a hospital immediately like what is that an urban legend could be I mean what never happened that's brings up Jamie's point early today before the podcast that we need more reliable Snopes not that Snopes isn't reliable because apparently it's pretty pretty reliable but nobody the problem nobody wants to listen to Snopes anymore because it turned out that the dude who rants Snopes is a freak and like one of the chicks that is like his number one employee was a woman who was an escort until like 2015 and now she's married to him and he's just a freak he's just partying all the time and having a good old time but why is that so bad like why does that affect and also they have a left-wing left-wing bias that a lot of people a lot of people think they have a left-wing bias ILI's you know I guess sort of maybe but I mean if they're just relaying facts you can rely on them I think for the most part but that's not enough who can you realign like even on that New York Times you post on Instagram did you see they changed their yeah they changed it Wow I went out of my way I was like this is crazy I read the New York Times basically every day it should be me tuition reliable I have a new my phone where I go in the morning yeah I get notifications from meat anything happens in the news so I read tons of articles from the New York Times do you see the guy I looked up what's exposed to it not anymore I don't want to do like get personal no I just wanted to see what was going on just a giant fuck up you can't do that he's also not a sports writer he writes more about race he's a young guy you know hide out and race to fight yeah he goes New York Times writer for race Wyatt yeah that seems like it would be within your best interest to keep things fucked up you know I'm not saying maybe that's why you know like maybe I mean look you all you know would say what happened is that after you know just say Floyd Nguema Boyd Mayweather outclasses and stops Conor McGregor it stops and exhausted Conor McGregor in the 10th round that's what happened he was exhausted and he got tagged over and over again and Floyd was teeing off on him I miss brilliant performance that really paint the fight though I don't know it for sure use your words better in the headline you can't say complete his face was completely bloodied anyway those things are not true I don't think you actually watched it reading that headline he probably looked at the maybe foes or someone else's the fight photos even the bloody well yeah I guess a photo of Conor outside the ring leaves the outside the Rings I saved the photo man like here's know no one's face was bloody there was no bloody period I mean it just it just wasn't bloody like you can see his face like I got a photo of the actual stoppage itself Road and at the moment the stoppage happened he was I mean a little bit too bad there was left eye there look no blood he had a mouse from the right hands landing yeah nope no blood and either guy was yeah I mean see the mouse there you see his right cheek it's under his let's just read his eyes did you hear 100 million illegal streaming downloads what 100 million illegal streams holy shit how much revenue they lose how about this how crazy is this Floyd warm-up in the back someone from his team goes yo Floyd the the systems in California Florida it down he goes goddamn those huge markets yeah I'm gonna delay till they figure it out that's how conscious this motherfuckers before this huge fight that's good he goes I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait in the to earth millions and millions I'm saying how brilliant is he that was my takeaway with working on Showtime and get so close to Floyd and doing all this stuff he's so goddamn brilliant man like I had preconceived notions like I'm he's a good box or a bit good of a businessman huh how involved is he no no no he doesn't let anything go on touch without overseeing every face both everything yes both he's brilliant he's brilliant as a producer or as a promoter and he's brilliant as a fighter brilliant okay then they asked him about a so I was in the fighters meetings and they have all the serious Showtime guys there and were miked up north all access crew and Floyd's crew and they go hey be careful cuz last time we do this with Floyd he didn't really know the guys and he kicked him out front of the room was super embarrassing so I'm like oh that sucks some of my suits sitting there and everyone's so serious I'm like this is so sick so stuffing engine so the guy goes Jim Gray Jim Gray goes hey Floyd they're like writing their notes now I'm just sitting there like staring out they go uh you know you always walk out with like an entourage usually for your fights or some big celebrity or something like that who's it gonna be this time and I know previously you had beef with Justin Bieber so I was like well better now whenever I just went out of turn not the Biebs not the Biebs and the boy laughs Floyd he's talking dead tears at Jim Gray's glasses on he takes his glasses off and goes damn dawg I'm trying to be positive up in here we're trying to be positive and I go I start laughing I know all the same isn't walking out with you man what's wrong with that he started laughing after that everyone really on pins and needles is all about church now huh is that the thing like he unfollowed Floyd and Floyd got mad at him yeah and that guy can't unfollow your boy can unfollow your boy ever and that never unfollow you never bro if we do then there's some serious not happening boy me with her clap back it'd just be to try to be positive he's just a pop star Floyd says well it's got a point just just a pop star who is probably the biggest pop star on the planet biggest ever he said he canceled his tour like you stopped his tour because of this Jesus thing that pretty sky I know that God in the Bible stay like that I bit the dinner with that guy really interesting dude if your balls deep man Jesus sees your guy keep talking tell me more no I don't wanna be I don't I don't know bad dude you love me and I'm gonna be the Golden Snitch for pop stars they were saying that Justin Bieber already made 93 million dollars this year before he cancelled a tour on toy how is that kids ball and so even him and then I think yes some dude with Kyrie Irving too and Kyrie is like yeah I want out of Cleveland like this one forget some power hmm he's like Jesus once you play for Boston you know that right right so what is he doing to them trying to get them to well look look maybe he's doing something maybe I'm looking at the wrong way right so if he has a positive influence on them maybe saying listen man you're you're so involved in show business and so on but you have to think about living and life yeah take care of Mommy not only that like here's the thing that once you make ninety-three million dollars it's basically over life changes button but I'm saying it's over just relax it's over true you put that fucking money in the bank you don't have to work anymore so like kind of work yeah all the work you do from here on out is gravy this is what you do now you do what you want to do do you want to go and do a bunch of concerts in front all these people or are you doing too much because if you're working like if you if you had to go and do theaters like now you've been doing a lot of stand-up if you got to do theaters Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday every week flying everywhere so you just see I'd be like amanda Bynes you just see my hair's all fucked up I'd be going crazy I bet Katt Williams I engineered how I do like this Latin might this is the first tour that I ever named the strange times tour the first time I ever sold a bunch of tickets in advance like this smart marketing but I engineered that like and I'm doing these like fly to two places I'm off for a while that's the power to do it you have to do it that way and Bieber has the power to 100% he just canceled everything yeah just canceled everybody west did the same thing what Kanye West it after they checked him into the loony bin Ricky was going crazy he's just but they said he would do that concert come home he had all this work yet to do with medidas in clothing and he Paige said he's working non-stop yeah and I'm a small glimpse of you know show business and stand-up and all the stuff it I mean I can see I'll be on tour that long and Ringo fucking batshit crazy I can see a little bit like it when I saw it oh I bet man that's crazy well you know what a big factor for me is a big factor for me is when I'm at home I'm gonna sleep for eight hours and I have a schedule yes in terms of like my runs your routine my lifts you know whatever workout I'm doing whatever kind of thing I'm doing I know we're where I can train I know the schools I could train out I know the gyms like a trainer and I know what to do that keeps me sane like having those like I can work out on the road and it's good it's definitely better than the same but it's not the same of like being able to have this normal like it keeps my energy up and it keeps my anxiety down like all those things get balanced out when I when I'm at my normal workout routine when I go on the road I'm doing three days in a row it's hard because I don't wanna work out too hard cuz I'm gonna be tired for the shows yeah I got two big big ass theater shows but I can't imagine those guys who do five nights so they're flying in so I did two this week two shows this weekend so I flew in three days I took three flights said you know that's crazy crazy but that's nothing it's so those guys that do it five days a week so well they're well even still on private jets it's still exhausting man still same thing same thing I mean you don't have to it goes more on your schedule I guess if you're flying everywhere for the private jet but it still fucking exhaust still a beast man yeah so I get a little bit there you have money so it's not that that's I think they're already set they're already gravy but without back to the Bieber Floyd thing again I had preconceived notions of Floyd Mayweather before I met him been around him so does this religious guy he thinks Oh Floyd's just about hoes and cars and stuff like that that's all that I guess but he's more there's more layers to that so for you to judge them based off social me and say Beiber quit falling quit hanging out with him because he's just about that no you don't know shit you're judging that guy cuz he's not going to church every Sunday you know I'm saying like you're you're judging based off Instagram which isn't fair to do yeah I think he's saying like I don't know what you're saying but I would imagine if someone tells you to stop following somebody that they're saying they're at that person's a bad influence right which isn't fair to say his Floyd doesn't drink has crazy work ethic oversees basically Showtime sports you know I'm saying like he's healthy he does what it's it's girls Brown strip clubs young strip club bro some of the women he hangs out with I never seen anything like that that's what 50 no get you I mean jaw-dropping shit 100 and they just look at me like a bag of shit and these Gucci shoes those shoes oh I get it not 50 no girl hundreds of millions of dollars I see that all access or they show that fucking stupid watch they bought them that Hugh Bowl people do I met with the guy from who tell me all about it that watch is so gross nuts it's so stupid looking it's all crystal yeah eight million knows five hundred thousand dollars I think they made him another one from one point to they made them three it's crazy the watch is all crystal like the outside of it is all crystal that's nice it's so stupid looking it looks like a cheap watch yeah I agree not my style I do love who blow those shadows yeah they make great watches yeah but that thing the laferrari is now what it's cool yeah there you go it looks heroes did you see the money belt yes they handed me that thing this is real it's kind of small I got it smelt like they just killed that alligator on the spot it smelt like hummus and alligator it's not like shit but that was just like gold all over it I like oh my god in diamonds and shit and rubies do you know who made that who Floyd Mayweather's team is they see a gift to him because they thought for sure he's gonna win like yeah there's this crazy money fight belt for 1.2 million we designed ourselves here you go Floyd Wow 1.2 million dollars for that ugly belt I was all I was all up on that thing well tell me about this then are those red is the red all boss one of those those gems are they what is the red stuff like in the flags all around those are just like colors those aren't real that's not real but the diamonds and all that and gold all that through most of belt about them damn the thing was sweetly dope looking yeah like six hundred sapphires 160 emeralds 3,000 diamond 3360 diamonds waste three pounds of 24 karat gold the thing was tiny three pounds of gold that's that's whole milling a little bit was I like the big ass belt it looks normal-sized are they all like that maybe I'm just fucking Shaquille O'Neal but if you look at a picture with me it looks those chicks when they're holding it up click on eyes look small how weird are the fucking ring car girls do boxing they stand around behind everything and smiled like there's fuckin no Stepford Wives just have four hours that's all they do is pose with that big smile it's so odd it's like they don't express any personality they don't do anything other than shit in there and up there and shit yeah but they're not like like looking at each other and talking about leerin smile they're like those English soldiers these are and I'll tell you what chrome it does it it's what they're like Korona does it right yeah I'm not mad at any of them there was no slump Buster's oh all of them were tense oh shit stone-cold tense and smiling yeah and just not moving like robot yeah one hand on the hip I feel like they hit mine they just drop that belt on their head dude how about alligator big Hoss how about I'm doing before the Wayne's I'm doing a pre-flight show and Floyd Mayweather seniors standing to my right going you don't know shit you don't know what the hell you're talking about shop you don't know shit and I'm like trying to get through it not pay attention to him let's stop saying Oh bro what are you doing come on man what are you doing I'm selling the fight I'm picking but money in your son's pocket man would you need someone up here to talk about what are you doing just cuz I you know what you're talking about like Jesus Christ man relax yeah he's a smooth talker that senior yeah imagine you're Floyd and you like literally see your future if you keep getting hit in the head like right in front of ya button that's gotta be one of the reasons why he's so brilliant defensively not just because he learned from his dad and learned from Roger Mayweather and all the people in gym that he trained with but also he sees the effects of controlling punishment and his brother or his uncle rather as well yeah Roger Mayweather isn't you know he's not doing well you don't know him but doing great man no we're doing great he's perfect though forty years old speaks perfect sharp knows everything about it and everything and they thought that javante Davis if I didn't see you're doing it so yesterday he's a kid who they thought was gonna be the next pay-per-view King and you can tell I asked for and he's just like mmm he's missing a few things he goes because you just can't be thirty no with thirty knockouts and expect to be a megastar you have to have everything he's like so he has to work on so much more I don't know he's 130 pounds it's tough wait - he missed weight but he took the fine short notice he missed weight had a horrible fight how I was short notice I want to say took on two because that I think Shawn Porter supposed to fight and then he backed out so then they book this dude he's fun to watch though he is the most intense tattoo I've ever seen what is it it's not his forum he's from like the straight hood of Baltimore and as he's talk and I looked down at the strap peoples tattoos and it was a apartment building brick building on fire in front of partment villain is a masked burglar black burglar would like the old-school robber mask on with a bag of money and the gun wise yeah I was like shout out to that terrible tattoo Jesus he had a bad fight though and that was kind of his you know it splat for him to do something but I don't see him being the next like big thing yeah he can't tell Floyd to is like mm before he's like this is the next up-and-coming guy he's an exploit Mayweather and now I'm like he's he's the next 40 music mmm not really hmm hit a rough fight - yeah it was a rough fight he clipped that dude behind the ear or behind the head but that's just like where punches land when people duck if sometimes should happen yeah and you know the guy was complaining about it he went down I'll tell you what was cool is after the fight I'm in the back and I see Amir Khan Terence Crawford and Andre Berto and so I go to talk to them and they were all like super complimentary of Conor McGregor like dude he can box man I'm like right like what you think you're just going to look like an asshole like Bart's like would you expect to happen like we just didn't expecting to get any rounds we thought he's just gonna be outclassed like nah man look yes - belief in himself and he had a weird style that that strange style of off-speed punches extending his arms fully and then pop them in there and Paul in the vacuum Paulie goes I gotta be honest I was kind of glad to see that because when I went against them like the first four or five rounds I couldn't land shit because that style like it takes forever just get used to yeah I don't know what to do you think so I just thought maybe I was having an off day but once I see that I see Floyd do this kind of the same thing you know granted Floyd fought a different style I don't give a shit yeah that sounds legit now he's legit you know I mean that's just too big a leap that's all it is but for Conor to go and his first professional fight fight arguably the greatest fighter of all time it's like he's a hundred percent in the mix now he's winner D and oh at 50 you know it's a hundred percent in the mix that he's the greatest fighter of all time you think about defensively no one's even close no one's been hit as little as him and Hunter hit him yeah he's beat everybody and obviously fought Conor different way than he found everybody else that's a fact but Conor hate him more than any fighter that ever you the other thing here's kudos to Conor and Floyd but especially Conor when's the last time you saw an exciting Floyd Mayweather fight true kind of went at him yeah that's when we got out of the fight I made him turn him into a Mexican so they say that like yeah you didn't heard that no comment I missed a lot of it Conor brought the fight out of them okay the first time since I don't know who you know you can say well that's finished was Victor Ortiz that was shit cheap shot you really didn't bring it to him but this brought it out of them and this is legit it was cool man and when I watched the second time knowing the result then you really appreciate what Floyd's doing because although Connor did catch him he definitely caught him with a hard uppercut in the first round that's not that was interesting because that was like oh shit like you got to realize mind your P's and Q's this guy's legit but Connor never even though he clipped him with that shot never really heard him it's not a one shot to the body which I was surprised I gotta be honest in my prediction I thought Connor was gonna do well like you did in the first rounds I called that I thought he's gonna ruin four to five rounds and then I thought you'd wanna pack up would wobble him and that would be enough to win Connor kind of spectacle but just it got you know Floyd's chin and you know just the boxing powers a little different man it definitely is different I don't think Connor is loading up either you know I don't think Connor is really like digging in on these shots because I think he was probably concerned about his endurance you got to realize also this fight was relatively short notice so short notice that I had already booked the DC improv in advance and it was sold out by the time they announced the fight correct so are not the DC improv that the Warner Theatre in DC so if you think about that that's fucking months in advance three months they did this fight was announced three months ago that's enough that's nothing for this not to do the fight most the time a fight like this is six seven months out oh my god maybe more when did they announce Canelo tripled in a long term ow I think between the time they announced it and when the fight starts I got a feel like it's five months at least at least why which is norm I would assume but but at least they but they also boxing was smart because they set it up right so the at Canelo ish Chavez Jr that's a joke but that was literally just a setup to get him to trip to triple G and they both knew it he's relooking at basically a year in the making and before that what two years in the making and here's more importantly during that entire time they're both boxing so Connors not mean he's not really sure if he's gonna actually have this boxing match with Floyd Mayweather right so he knocks out Eddie Alvarez and then somehow another the rumblings get started but that's just not enough time well did you do you who wants to prepare for Floyd I agree especially in that arena the best of all time in that Floyd goes listen I tried making this fight before this and the UC turned it down and he goes alright we'll see what happens and then he goes then I came back and was like yo this how much money we could make he was and then they were like alright let's do it he was but I tried making this fight a while ago but even before this yeah I remember the discussions but to be to be that close like when they actually announced it okay this is actually happening crazy it's crazy to have it so quickly switch to this magnitude of a fight yeah it's nuts so if something like that if you gave Conor like six months maybe he could get in better shape or he could survive he's always going to fit he's he's never going to be against a guy like Mayweather was so efficient and his movement is so crisp and this how I was describing it to a friend of mine I was like does your friend have a boxing or martial arts background no any faster he was trying to figure out like why he would get so tired touchin and I said I go okay when you tie your shoe you tie your shoe you don't even think about your scope right now but if you have to think about tying your shoes it takes more energy and you have to think and then you got your tents I go Floyd's time to shoes he's reacting yeah he's just so he's so good he's been doing it so long that he's just got it engrained in his movements Conor has to think way more than Floyd does and Floyd is constantly pressuring him so cars backing up all time which wears you out and also the the volume of punches you know he set a really high pace he thought I think more he thought he was gonna be able to stop him maybe a little more stopping from coming forward he wasn't prepared when you know when Floyd put his head in his chest and did work the ref did allow him to get his rest in the clinch but listen at then a day I'm all about the glitch in the matrix man I think Connors a glitch it was so much fun that even pulled this off it's awesome he didn't dishonor the sport I thought he did really well the only that I told conics and I'm proud Eman I what he did we win or lose and this is not his belief in himself is incredible but even that is not enough if you fight a better boxer and your body gets tired so that's what we saw in that fight in the beginning of the fight if he could have maintained somehow or another if he was in good enough shape that he could maintain the pace that he had yeah in the first three rounds for the entire 12 gotta fight it's a well away different fight is dangerous he's quick he's moving away he has a huge endurance problem and this is like something that comes back to for boxing obviously you don't see yes from and UFC as well he may because if you look at the trailing Nate Diaz fight with that five rounds nice fight yeah but if you look at his attributes that's a endurance is you know in everyone knows I'm kind of dick rather but if you go on you know his strengths right I'd say it's at the bottom yes as far as his strengths I agree it's not bad where it's like you know it's not good it's not good look here's the best endurance in the sport Mighty Mouse for sure well he doesn't count he's out true you're 25 pounds you're out Cain Velasquez counts Cain Velasquez did countless cats at the height of his career you know who else has phenomenal cardio Neil Magny no magnesia the Gazelle has some phenomenal phenomenal car amazing pace so does you look at guys you know John Jones's get card very good cardio yeah how disappointing was that how disappointed that broke my heart John Jones dude you broke my heart dude sent to me I was at a universal my wife and my kids Dobbs Tech talukas what was I doing I forget I think I was working for Showtime and I had my phone and then I I look at I have 70 missed texts and 23 minutes puzzling what the fuck happened someone that likes Owen died oh no who died I look it's like John jungling so what - well the tide Jaime said to me I thought it was a joke me too I thought the people were messing with me I looked at my phone I was like and then you sent to me like you're the first one takes I went is this real you went yes well my heart Jon Snow once you start talking once you start talking back and forth with the Golden Snitch that go and snitch there's zero jokes there and listen when the gold snitch comes out with something they've ran that pisser through a ton of tests it's not like it's not fake news with shit apparently a court don't think I can say that bring it because I had an expert I talked with an expert about this drug and he fucking drop some knowledge on okay this is what I've heard this may not may not be true because this is the reason why I don't think I'd say this because I'm not I'm not a hundred percent of where maybe we can find some information online available what I had heard is that this drug is not detectable in blood that it's a drug that's detectable in urine and they have been in a new test right the test this is a new test I what from 102 is the you sadhas' they have a new test live C they'll announce a hey we're doing this now everyone welcome to the party and this drug was also it's it's very common around powerlifters because you can using competition and by the time you get tested after it has our half-life so the shelf-life is super short but you're taking it makes you super agro and strong so then they go it's so hard to obtain legally most everyone gets a black market and when you get a black market you don't know where it's coming from and a lot of time and this happens with a lot of power lifters in other athletes when they test hot for this it's because they got a bad batch or something else mixed into it this is done from a super knowledgeable dude who knows about it oh it makes you angry oh huh confident in it laughs maybe an hour maybe two hours max that's how your system no because ego so that makes sense why someone would fail directly after cuz they no no no no no he's failed after the weigh-in that's when he failed this is after the weigh-in I don't think so yeah sure yeah yeah well either way yeah well maybe it's like lingering but that's what he's saying better that we say he's saying well but also I heard they'd use a new test to maybe someone gave him a tainted sandwich maybe some tainted dick pills either way he broke my heart I'm off the train I'm off the goddamn train and I'm thinking though we have no idea what happened it was just dick pills I'm like I'm out I'm out how dare you well is he offering up any possible scenario for what happened no I tweeted out like this is when I find out who my real friends are boy fuck that's noise that sounds like you're feeling sorry just ain't helping out this one so much to be grateful for Wow well you see money but yeah yeah we've got a nice family that's true good friends hopefully fuck is happening but here's the thing man we have a second's fire Joe multiple-time sada since the clone snitch has been around he's a motherfucker I like the guy but if you're fucked well hey he's doing exactly what he's supposed to do in the sport Oh baseball first now you're gonna know the fighters are ruining it because they know what the fucking parameters are now it's done I agree I agree I don't look look here's the thing about this fight do you think Dana's ever like God what kind of testing was done for this Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor fight those new lights I like what you're doing the place man you know what man I like the curtains when I put the new studio I'm gonna do the curtain yeah you should man yeah but Nowitzki is a guy that you don't want on your bad side oh no but do you ever think des is like damn bro relax we hired you but Jesus alpha D that's they knew what they were getting into and you know what they just decided list there's only one way to clean up the sport bringing the guys the very best to catching people for doing drugs but a Miriam did they do am here's the thing John Jones since you saw us come in he's failed three out of four tests the only one he didn't say I was OS P coke is coke brother coke coke once oh that's fine let's go do a few lines and just fucking Wanderlei Silva pride style just drink like a giant monster energy drink that's one of the sponsors yeah because not coke because it's a goddamn turnitin have you ever done coke no have it have you know know one of the few I know obviously but I didn't do Harold but one when I did get my knee operated on they had me on a drip I guess it was more fluffy and I get to hit the button that's just to watch this and I'm just brands fire I celebrate that yeah I guess they let you fire it into a point where you can't die I can't imagine you'd be able to keep hitting that button and then doctors that know they can't I remember I wonder like what the limit is and how many times you depends who you are right cuz you probably have a high pain tolerance kit for with your background but also I was bored so if I'm bored you can give this me this button let's get a few guys hell yeah watching some terrible local television show like a traditional thing is super addicted I'm sure yeah someone gave me a bunch of these these gummies these weed gummies and I can't rest and I'm always think about something so I took the wheat gummy and Mars attack was on that shit was that big I've seen it so many times it's I feel like it's always on late at night for me that's like my go-to it's a great movie it is like a truly great movie right and it's so like silly I guess so well Cox and the cast is just phenomenal they want to redo that I feel like didn't Jack Jack Nicholson played two different people in that movie yeah he played like the high roll what I like Vegas guy yes Jim Brown's in that movie that's right Jim Brown's fucking everybody up and then Martin Schwartz in it to go get the fucking picture of Jesus Christ look how cool the alien looks thank God that they were awesome man look at his clothes that was when the alien was the girl remember he thought he's gay she's hot yeah

girl stand up again so that was the girl from The Big Lebowski Tara Reid wasn't that her isn't it her oh that wasn't that was like the yoga bitch who was all into it like a Tara Reid and remember

send me like Gucci Cape you went for god sakes he was in us a movie that documents his issues with a record company that Jamie you're always recommended and what's that called again it's uh it's something about his band more than 30 seconds from Mars yeah they had some deal are the record it's called artifact artifact that's the name of the documentary so he had some deal with a record company and couldn't get out of it and it was apparently they made a brutal documentary about it and they cut all that won all these awards it on that I got to tell you I gotta be honest with you when I see like awards in between those leaves when they write things in between those leaves I ignore it because it looks pretentious oh it must be good why do you have what you have to say framed in between fern leaves is this ancient Rome what the fuck are you doing what is this hieroglyphs it doesn't work at all with me where does the opposite it's like when I see a company that says world's best coffee and we've gotta try it now you should you should start framing all your posters you send now for your game leaves quotes about you I'll make a quote you can put it inside leaves it's fucking hilarious Joe Rogan with two leaves one of my funniest friends between two palm leaves Joe says he's alright tickets here the fuck is with the palm leaves man me too special stupid pull that back up again that shit looks stupid god I see that I'm like this shit must be good first why they do it why they have five of them get the fuck out of here then you can palm leaves that's why does Jared Leto's involved that's why no you get ten palm leaves you took up on it make those quotes bigger so I can actually read my reading glasses look at much smaller that quotes are then the fucking the subtitle it's a bunch of independent awards the guys in Independent Film Awards audience award winner do see New York City Festival official selection oh it's all bullshit yeah Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award South by Southwest 24 beats per second official selection oh you put that you put that inside of palm leaves that's a money selection some bullshit one yes Melbourne Melbourne International Film Festival official selection you just want to have your shit in in palm leaves see that's exactly what I'm saying that's why they have the quote so small they're fucking with you shop and he just eaten it up I'm eating it up don't want to go home and watch it don't let them get you with those goddamn leaves job they got me brothers every time every fucking time I'm not I'm not impressed by leaves no how about one good quote from somebody that I think a respecter like a legit actor like I enjoyed this move the fucking record business with Shady Kevin Hart that'd be great yeah selection what does that mean even win did you win it did you not win you want you want some cool Awards you need even win that award that's an official selection you get selected bitch that doesn't mean shit can't put that inside of palm leaves hugger picked yeah what a date with a girl did you fuck her no no she selected me Kunis elected me there's something I just brought got brought up cuz I just saw it there's something interesting about Jared Leto suits you guys think about this uh he's got a suit in him that he'd like directs under Bartholomew caught Cubans yeah Cubbins I think okay uh follow me I bet you see a pop up from time to time oh it directed it it's his name oh that's smart because he doesn't want people to think about him you just want them to think about the movie yeah but pick an easier name can we just call you oncet barney Hubbins maybe was on like fuckin I'm sure he's on road shit dude he did the MTV Awards last night before like he's all he's sponsored by Gucci so he's like way too much he has gucci scarf cape the glass is all the shit on just because they sell it doesn't mean you have to win it anyways so they're asking their ask him about that his appearance and like his performance he's like I'm trust me you've never seen anything like this I don't want to give it away and how much Jared Leto fan I was like this give me some shit this motherfucker just did the pretty mean the predator he just did the night vision predator thing look at this come on what do you do he just did a predator vision we did this in the nineties look that's it that's the whole video yeah he was like it's like some avatar shit you've never seen this before see because first of all you're not really obsessed with this like he's obsessed with himself so that's part of the problem and then second of all you probably not on the same drugs he's on but if you work go fullscreen with that I don't feel like you're giving the full effect you talking about the Predators our son no it's a little bit more than that a little bit more than that it's kind of freaky it was kind of detailed I don't like it he's got a hat on you can see it through the hat it's not that creative that I feeling you're interesting that you say this and he's a creative dude maybe it's good maybe if you're high on ecstasy this would be the best video ever he might be really alive I don't know how much that has to play into - are they a good band yes he's phenomenal I've never literally never heard their music you would know they've been around since the late ninth a boy can got a lot of kids behind them well those people dancing that's his entourage son other dancers yeah dude how'd if everywhere you went you had dancers be kind of cool this beer you don't think that looks good no Harry Oh spirit dude how about how about this Joe MTV fucked up so Ben I love him to you however they fucked up how about just jared leto toured with chester the guy who commits suicide from Linkin Park and with the guy from Soundgarden who else committed suicide he's known him two of his best friends so they have him do an open monologue for him right yeah I just tell him like how great they were and he was right let's let's cut to the last time Chester performed on stage here and they're like on top of high when he's singing and MTV cuts the Feeny Mintos have you had your mint fresh breath today and they cut they just cut it off why they come back like let's hey it's a Nicki Minaj's ass yeah they're like did this whole dedication to them and then half way not even half way me 20 seconds of performance cut it to commercial huh it's rough why would they do that I don't know I wouldn't they play the full song I don't know people were so upset that I was so disrespectful I don't know I don't think so I think they're just like yeah I cut the brake hit that Mentos commercial man hey you know look I'm very biased about this cuz I don't interrupt podcast with commercials but there's a big difference between like watching shit on Netflix and watch the shit on regular TV or watching shit on HBO and watch and shit on regular TV I don't watch commercials do you get brought out of the of like the the whole hypnotic effect of seeing a show it breaks your focus 100% if Game of Thrones that commercial I there's sometimes a game of Thrones I don't breathe like when that red wedding I was like oh dude just talk after just wait those shitty pans with certain set dragon and try not to get so close to anyone cuz everyone guys fuck up you can't get close you can't talk I can't say anything other of all dragon I know not Slayer should we never slay the Dragons that's true you know I'm saying though yeah dude yeah there's like interruptions in the in the in the Game of Thrones it's like I'm in the zone man in the zone yeah I try to watch on Walking Dead once on regular TV in real time and I'm sorry I can't do this I just flipped through all the chat Lester's commercial I flipped through I just record I can fast-forward yeah I don't get how they make money off these ads anymore well that's when my point is that this is a very ineffective way to promote things and I think it probably a more effective way like think of all the ads they have in a show right they have all these shows wouldn't it be like way more effective if they had one very good or two very good ads at the beginning of the show and they say like Game of Thrones is brought to you by and they do it if you've got to do that I agree have it in the beginning and know that this show sponsored this entire episode so that the episode doesn't have to have that's just like they do that business greedy they do it but yeah they won't do those 30-second spots to get all that money for the network but the thing is like those breaks they ruin the art so they make the creation worse so it makes it less valuable yep it makes it less valuable to sell ads on and also no one is watching them they know it's not going to get a fraction of the people watching them and a lot of people gonna be upset by them I agree and it does so it did they just don't work that the the advertisement agency you know they come around I'll sleep odd cats if someone's gonna listen to your show for three hours a day you know it's just a different dynamic but you're also not up there reading you know whatever sponsor me on these would have come in me undies and you know just reading in the middle it like you're like hold on Brennan let me do this real well a lot of people do do that I just don't think it's the right way to do it anymore I just think the only reason why we're doing it that way is because everybody always did it that way before that's how you saw it on television that's how you heard it on the radio they always interrupted for these ads I don't think that's the most effective way to do ads I just think that we got used to doing it I think it upsets people definitely does I think it turns people off where they like fuck that product you know people used to say well what if someone has to get up take a leak well do you don't have to do that anymore you can pause things yeah you can watch the HP on pause it I mean we have different control over media now and ultimately we're gonna get to a point where you could watch things almost everything's gonna be on-demand the way Netflix does it it's the future it's my future imagine what don't know Comedy Central special and there's commercials through your special that's where mine was my last special I had to break it up and they edited it for commercials and I even like recorded it for commercials like I knew that it was gonna be 44 minutes yeah I had to do it during this constraint and these were when we're gonna drop things in so it had to make sense when you shut shut it off and then went to commercial it's very complicated to edit that way it's tough enough as it is yeah and it does it's not good to watch it that way it's just not means better than not watching it at all but the best way to watch something is all the way through but here's the question is save your company right like outside of podcasts which is pretty easy just do the ads in the beginning how do you how do you sell things now like we say if you are you know pick a product if you're Mentos with the streamers the fucking I sponsor that show and I pay enough where they don't need to other ad revenue and I get the beginning in the end but is it worth it for them because it's a tangible amount of money right if you're gonna have one sponsor for the entire show think of how many sponsors the Video Music Awards must have like yeah isn't how many they don't do this performance is brought to you by Pepsi and then they hit it you know which is which is almost better than doing a full Pepsi commercial I guess I don't still don't want to hear it like what how do you advertise something without interrupting something else it's got to be away cuz it seems so sneaky but they've always done it this way but you're watching something you don't want to hear the ad you gotta sit through the air alright alright get back to what I like and then you get back to it but I wonder if they're they must be seeing a return cuz otherwise they'd stop right obviously I bet it's down but the Advertising Age he's so big then she's so big because who really watches things live now besides sports Game of Thrones I'm a man season four for God's sakes came out years ago there's other shows like my other shows Hard Knocks HBO no commercials yeah I just and if there's commercials I literally just I won't even see one who's really sitting there when it's live I watch commercials on HBO for upcoming programs those aren't really commercials they're not selling you a product they're showing you other cool shit there's a bell it's like previews at the movies yeah yeah take that here's some cool shit you might want to watch you're not selling you anything exactly but even at AMC when they those delicious ice cold sodas pop-out I'm like you know I might have to have one yeah but that's before the movie so you probably say that and they also have that after they showed you a bunch of really cool shit with the previews you've already got my approval already friends or if you get their real real early it's a slide show oh those are a loser when are you gonna start showing me some things that lights are on bright white screen and then it's just like ad it's like a local Italian restaurant though it's impulsive Oh with the best bread and the fucking thing believes yeah their awards are in between leads yeah it's just you anybody yeah oh my god we're idiots we're so really you know there's a lot of these movie theaters that are taking off that are in places where you get assigned seating and they sell booze and they bring real food that's what I do there's a lot of those now men's then I turn to different ones it's great yeah I pick you go there's so many of them now you don't have to like it's good food - yeah really good yeah yeah some dude was eating a steak next to me and shit the opposite one no arclights good to arclights good there's some really good ones well they figured it out man it's like the same thing that airports have figured out hey we don't have to have only shitty food how about you ever like got a nice little restaurant right here in the airport and they started doing that with like Wolfgang Puck's in LAX and then they have lemonade cell rated there's a lot of good stuff at the airport now you get coffee you get real food cisco has like straight up five course meals food dia has a chop house steak house oh yeah oh yeah New York has a in JFK JFK has some serious restaurants Jason's killer Italian food really Hiller like really good some serious shit yeah there's everywhere has figured that now that like look well you're you've got people coming in and out a lot of these people are business people those people have money with good meals yeah they don't want to just eat McDonald's even the plain foods getting better - yeah Penn Riyadh they have an Austria in LAX now I know like a famed like a fancy schmancy little place where you get with a tasting menu I love that getting hungry let me tell ya you're still stuck in the keto diet uh I went pescetarian oh how dare you know just to mix it up I did keyed up forever I go back to it I'm the only fish would eat scallops and mussels to scalping mussels Liam lobster not a huge lobster fin how do I make some lobster that I grilled it up real proper like grilled it up why not just throw the dirt and let it get heated up by the Sun grill stur you know would you like your lobster boil boils like a man no yeah that's JV I see grill that thing I don't kill anything I just buy it from the store Oh tails fucking yeah lobster tails Jesus Christ what do you do what the hell they're fucking I'm alive oh fuck you get them live from 2017 fucking what are you talking about grocery stores of Tanks you'd go to a grocery store Jimmy what's the last time you saw a lobster tank they do you got a rouse or some shit maybe that inhumane tank to get out do they have it a lot of places no listen I've seen one since I was a kid dad wanting elsens right up the street from here you go there there's a tank of water scoop up a fucking Lobster till he give me that one right there it's about two pounds sir okay we'll take that one that's a good one am i that chick not easy I haven't seen that in four AB you only go to Whole Foods that's why I'm fancy you don't fuck around you do you Amazon bought Whole Foods here behind writing Rice's and their stock assume they bottle went Bubble Bobble they paid whatever 12 billion here's 22 billion yet you wanna make some money yes okay bro those fucking people in the parking lot that harass you when you're walking out with a clock you got ice cream it's 150 degrees outside and they're like can I have two minutes for gay rights for gay rights you can't just get me you're ambushing me when I'm coming out with my fucking cold food this guy did that to me stuck his finger in my face is that Gleason's again Gelson's oh this is a gym and you that's right at Gelson's they did that shit again that sing only happened to me once what the guy said can I have two minutes for gay rights one minute they only happen to me once but I've been stopped for a bunch of other things a bunch of other things sometimes they have a whole fucking table set up oh yeah oh yeah third Street or a bikini there's table set for Syrian children blacks Asians like things I don't have the time to research where where there's he's going I don't trust people that's for sure I can give the kid money for sure there was some girl look real aggressive way back in the days I'm more than 10 years ago at the airport some black chick with a bucket and open bucket and she had some binder with a bunch of photos in it and stuff and she's saying you know we're collecting money for this that sounds legit right and she goes and she was like real aggressive about it I go yeah I go you you have a binder and you have a bucket that you want me to put money in and she was a well fuck you then and I was like fuck me that okay oh that makes a lot of sense you're super charitable that's what you're all I go you're stealing people's money with some stupid scam like you ever you have a bunch of photos of like downtrodden people that's in some sort of a binder that's buying plastic pouring you and you can close this binder and you tuck it because you're gonna get busted and you get this weird bucket that's wide open you could scoop anything out of it and then I asked you about it you say fuck you was there any money in there oh yeah there's like a couple bucks in there already you know was one of those weird things it's like who's to stop you from telling us that like I was off of the 90 the other day that came to stop and I saw this huge bear said help us pay for our father's funeral it was like four black guys oh my god I gave my game a little 10 spot not at when I get crazy but the problem is you don't know that's a really is I mean if this girl really was trying to raise money for a charitable cause it's really good she just seemed like a scammer like I got out I was like look at that binder it's just some pictures they're folded up with a binder and some printed piece of paper there's just a going around yeah yeah it's like bad stuff the bucket is open top but you can just reach in that bucket you could drop things in them you like where's the accountability how do I go but that's a good scam like if you're a person that wants to scam people that's like a great scam is this smart move for bullshit oh you're gonna make money dude if you go to Vegas or not Vegas lax rather and you're walking like down that where people are arriving first of all they just want you to get the fuck away of true this one little throw five dollars in there maybe one out of ten a one out of ten they'll give you money why are 10 gives you money you're 1,300 people and the people are gone they knots it's not like you're doing this in a restaurant they can see you do it to one person coming yeah everybody's constantly filtering out loud Security's gonna let you do that well I think that's why she had the binder and that's why I'd like the whole bucket thing was very bizarre this was a while ago yeah a long time yes move along yeah this is more than ten years ago no but I'll never forget like how aggressive she got with me to like the point where my adrenaline fired up where I was like whoa this girl might like swing at me that's nice the worst yeah she was like she when she said fuck you she was like in my face you can tell like it was enough to know that she has definitely hit people before yeah she's not playing it was it was it was just a person that was a little just a little too aggressive will tell you kids saw him like whoa am I gonna get in a fight here like you get to that that feeling like my half day getting a few dry air pours nerves dude I when I was in the back after the fight right so again I'm with heard about this I'm with ya talking about this I just cleared up now so many people don't blow me up so again I'm with James Crawford Amir Khan Berto and I'm in the back and they're saying how good Connor did I'm like a great you know I thought he knew even better you know I'm surprised you know you did well and Showtime when we go do this post fight show thing so I'm going and I see Nate Diaz things by himself like no one's really buying he's by himself he's on his phone and I see him and I think Oh same fraternity UFC guys there's no UFC representatives there really there was like Dana I didn't see him at the fight I just figured hey we're brothers yeah what's up man but I was going towards him because he looked busy I was gonna go towards him and whether he wanted my help or not I figured I'd know a few things about marketing the next fight for him is Conor I'm assuming he's there to sell that fight that should be in the next fight Conor inverse Nate Diaz 3 the trilogy that's the fight so I wasn't go to him because I saw some any reason to it's kind of hating on Conor and I would have spun it the other way he should have celebrated Conor and what he did winning rounds against the best of all time and saying look I I beat him up worse than Floyd now we're gonna do this trilogy I'm gonna end him faster than Flo he did like that should be the sell I was you know talking about this so I see him out the corner I'm like oh and they're like come on Bren we gotta go Mike let me just say what's up to this guy and I'm like yo nay bro how about that fight man your next biggest fight in UFC history brother and he starts laughing he's like oh hell no how fucking stupid do you look now and I'm like I'm like Kafka I'm like what he's a how stupid do you look talking all this shit I'm like whoa what are you doing right now what the hell are you doing right now and he keeps talking when I go Nate he doesn't like that stupid he won rounds against the best box of all time and then Nate's like he didn't win rounds he gave him one round like alright man either way so he gave him he won rounds though what do you what are you doing he just keeps talking shit and he starts like talking about my career and I'm like what is going on right now I go Nate as mad at you I went Nate I have no issues with you you're pointing your gun at the wrong guy what are you doing right now you should be selling this fight against Conor not me I'm not the guy I said I'm in skinny jeans and gucci boots for god sakes what are you doing right now you know I'm saying right and then like Showtime was like come on let's go boys I'm like Jesus Christ man keep going I was just embarrassed by the situation cuz he kept talking she kept doing this and I this is what this is the part I left out this is what triggered him he was talking that I Lord kept him because people like shop let's go they didn't want a you know a fight so I shop let's go and I he keeps buying an item like Nate use your words I can't understand a word you're saying use your words Oh anyway that's you know at list for whatever if I set him off but I've no issues with Nate there's less when it got ugly yeah then he kept talking shit and I was like what are you gonna do what are we doing here and he kept doing this I'm like well what the fuck is happening I was so embarrassed cuz the Showtime guys like oh my god who is that guy Mike that that's the guy who supposed to fight Connor next they fought before like and why is he what was wrong with him what's wrong with him I'm like it's just I'm so embarrassed now like oh god now I have no issues of them do you think that Connor wants that fight I do you think that's a good money fight I do I think it's the only fight I think you know I think it's the the true winner cuz those those fights at 70 are toss-up one and one is whatever neither one should be finite seventy at 55 a trilogy fight makes sense for the belt it'd be the biggest pay-per-view of all time I think it's the only five that make since you can't do could be toning Kevin Lee there's just not big enough stars to get caught you could be because could be hasn't made the way true and he's not ready to fight he's just you know he's never done that so how can you sell could be right now like so let's say just in a perfect world you want to could be verse Connor and you go on this world tour trying to build khabib up your rush to go all over kinda wants to fight him in Russia crazy how do we know he's gonna make weight and doesn't pull out so he's out of the craze right now he needs to come back fight someone else so he needs to get his body sorted out and he's afraid of some shit Rockhold was saying that his liver shut down I read in an interview apologize I didn't hear him say yeah he said that his liver shut down when he was cutting wait for the michael johnson fight and then the next fight after that he didn't make wait his body shut down for the ferguson fight and they cancel a fight I'll tell you what though I might to be playing the conversation for me when he gets a shit together I'm not even entertain the idea of him fighting I look sick Kevin I like Kevin Lee he's package he's a bad dude but the thing is he speaks well he looks the part ox on a shit he's great dressed as well like he has all the makings of your next superstar yeah and he realizes now especially in the Conor McGregor era you got to talk a lot of shit yeah Floyd said best like you just can't win fights you've got to sell yourself listen Kevin Lee is only I think 25 he's young 25 or 24 yeah help find out he's 24 25 um super young right now remember how brash Conor was when he first got to the UFC very similar he's like 26 I believe okay so he's 24 September 4th he's almost 25 he'll be 25 in a couple of days he's super talented looks better every time you see him so he's essentially like somewhere around Connors age when Connor is a year younger than Connor where's Connor first burst on the scene and Connor was nobody back then nobody knew who he was we did I'd seen him on the internet and from fights in England and I knew was really talented I actually went back and forth with them but we yes yeah so there's a few people who knew about him but it was nothing like what you see now nothing right Kevin Lee down the road is a 135 pounder who talks a lot of shit a bad motherfucker great he looks great speaks well built like a brick shithouse speaks well speaks well african-american dress as well Chuck change the box check any can fucking fight so that's the biggest thing that fight with Conor McGregor down the road you need you need more time by here you right down the road this might work for Conor like but he could do it he Hanabusa optim to me Kevin Lee genetic thing however Kevin leavers Tony Ferguson's that Tony so goddamn good it's a great fight and here's another one Tony first and down the road 20 Ferguson can talk some shit to Tony Ferguson is very smooth Tony Ferguson is very confident she's also weird oh he's weird here's that weird vibe you get that weird vibe I'm so intense but my glasses Wing Chun and shit yeah and he does all these weird moves where he's like it flowin on the ground rolling around he does a lot of weird shit but his endurance is off the charts he cuts a shitload of weight and does it like a prophetic in descent can capitalize the lap and he wins by knockout it also was exciting shit look at the guys he's beat two very tough tests for Kevin it's a very tough test both are very good to me as far as like potential like superstardom those are the guys Kevin Lee is but that's the guy right now I think yeah maybe but if Tony Ferguson becomes the interim champion starts talking all kinds of crazy shit his star will rise man don't humor on just demonstrating rising and then becoming like a straight-up superstar like the transcendent like Conor McGregor Ronda Rousey like there's a certain there's a certain makes Canelo because he's not really charismatic and he only speaks Spanish so with the Mexicans it collects just Mexicans Eclipse and also like a true Mexico has sort of a built in boxing base if you're the king of boxing you're in your Mexican you already you are automatically here you go you know you're good barely barely pops he's not designing their training at all entertaining fighter major engines he's all right fuck you saying no he's from same hometowns my girl she's like no he's not to interview mitts whatever but ganar Gennady golovkin who's equally impressive if not more impressive than Canelo he's undefeated he mercs everybody everybody he's goddamn murderous body puncher and you know he can sell like like 150 paper 150 200 max she doesn't have the struck 150,000 paper views for one of the very best boxers on a planet earth if not the best undefeated how about $175 for Andre Ward crazy 125 for the rematch crazy man that's even crazy it's not I don't even get 170 I think we looked at I think we won 35 round 66 a real bum 167 and like 125 but again to become like a straight-up household superstar it takes more than just being this badass fighter looks have to have everything Andre Ward is like he's articulate he's admirable he seems like he's got a great control of Z go he's smart he's a great veteran comes from a rough background the great stories great single trainer since he was 12 yeah he's never lost Olympic gold medalist yeah I wonder what we lost there's something about that Kovalev yeah right there's something about him that people just don't yeah I don't know what is I thought he lost a couple of fight but I thought it was close but the second fight or hell yeah that's what's important because that was a big a big leg turn around how about Deontay Wilder yeah he's our american-born heavyweight champion he could come in right now with two pizzas and we bike what's up bro they know what stopped him out no one knows who he is it's crazy it is crazy and he's supposed to fight Ortiz I think that's what the room is dangerous I don't like that fight for him - Ortiz is a bad motherfucker and then on anthea josh was supposed to fight that russian fella and then i think the winner who fight I forget his name it's a tough fight for Joshua we should win it but freaking Wilder has a tough fight on his hands yeah super tough fight that Ortiz is he's very good in the south part is south Paul yeah khinkali comp King Kong yeah he's a beast and I don't like that fight form but neither one of those like Joshua's a big star looked the part speaks well knockout artist at that great fight with which Klitschko so he kind of has that but those other guys there's just nothing Joshua will be that way it would be giant for the UK especially if he defends the few times you giant John huge bigger and bigger with every fight he'll he's got superstar status possibilities super articulate very reserved in the US so don't let John Jones out he's really your only next superstar and he's a notch down from Connor like there's Connor broccolis no Rhonda they're here commas even above there and then there's your second tier soup start they got John Jones though John Jones it goes with this becomes the number one fuckup of all time for sure hands down if he wasn't already this is the biggest one it's consistent at beating a shell at people not to gun very consistent inconsistent at fucking up now we can only hope and pray that somehow or another there's some mistake how many times are we you need to go over there yeah you're not saying like dude you're breaking our heart man he's so goddamn good you watch that fight with Daniel Cormier like Jesus Christ he's so good you know you know but do we take the peds in account now like how do we know what do we know John Jonah are we giving because the one we saw what's the OSP one and it looked like shit and then it's DC the best of all time now he's beat everybody including heavyweights we lost to John Jones but wait John Jones was taking peds it's just a hot mess it is a hot mess meanwhile owes the mayor's like opposed Amir's marking these donors like fucking brain well that guy's got bricks for hands too when you tell you something man when I shook his hand after the fight I was like oh okay you know how some dudes you just shake their hand you're like oh I get it he's got giant hands dude bricks they feel like bricks I think you do that dude puts hands on people he fucks people ah yeah I think you do let's say John's out right long story for years suspension outright broke my heart see I go to Japan juice to the gills and fuck all the whores you wanna do whatever you want all right I'm out I'm over I'm mad at them so then you have OHS de Manos de mer FERS Justin to fight DC hundred percent it's great fight right very fun fight Gustafson is so veteran he's so good it's gusting Tom Gustafson coming off of that Glover fight I almost want to see hosed Amir fight more people because there's too much resume go crazy he just grabbed a hold of Jim Allen clipped him with that left hook inside the clinch but that's all there is though Joe like hey bring bring up 205 like you look at like oh my god it's the only left right specially now that rumbles out and Rumble was his stable mate anyway the word was that he was the guy that was sparring with Rumble all the time oh really yeah yeah and he was one of the few guys that was willing spar with Ronald little monster bad motherfucker no time is that the worst nickname no time no time no time time owes Damir what's the best nickname of all time the best yeah el Cucuy is pretty goddamn good that's pretty badass that's pretty good what's Kevin Lee the Detroit superstar yeah that's fuckin sick and you're from Detroit that's a good name pretty sick Oh what was a crunch all crunked shank he's a porno star too and he wasn't he Detroit superstar what's Kevin Lee's yeah they share the same nickname because that that's fucking rude Motown phenom Kevin moto that's fuckin oh that's murderers not bad that's the best hard to market though yeah yeah Daron Cruickshank is Detroit to puresox that's Kevin Lee is Motown fina I'll tell Phenom sighs - that's pretty nice murder of this day and age hard to market axe murder is the best the natural that's pretty good but man the testing back then was not enough to sustain she ate these claims I agree that's where just tough to sell the companies these days Oh The Prodigy is pretty goddamn good well BJ was the best brilliant pretty goddamn good yeah the Phenom when Vitor was marking people who's the best right now though el Cucuy think el Cucuy yeah I think so so goddamn supernatural boogie man got no heavyweights really have nicknames let's try to think of the heavyweights not really just Cain Velasquez steep a but Elko didn't he call himself what's that Russian name sexy Yama that was ridiculous that that but that nickname people like he didn't use it Koreans other people did Uncle Creepy the Mexican is pretty goddamn these are old yeah expert number five how dare you Kimbo Slice get the fuck out of here that's his nickname it's not like his the natural what's number one you have a girl fights with that sexy the karate hottie is not a bad that's not bad just note there's nothing great yeah and cyborg is not bad but her husband's name cyborg - so let's silence out there you can't double cyborg gotta do cyborg rap or the guy that you went with cyborg and Silverado a brew in Brazil cyborgs and Silva's are like Joe's and Bill's here you know I'm saying yeah there's a bunch of cyborgs right there's other cyborgs I'm trying to think other ones there's one other guy that I know that you call himself cyborg was Jitsu guy I think does anyone ever call you Joey never know I really know but also I'm friends with Diaz and everybody calls him Joey it's always been Joey you know but his name is Jose really yeah Joey's Diaz his name is Jose Diaz oh yeah but we've always called him Joey yeah that makes sense yeah we're tall well Jose Joe he could yeah you can for sure but I think growing up everybody called him Joey do you have a nickname was a kid no no nickname no just straight up Joe yeah I never really had a nickname nothing dude when I used to play pool pool halls or the place where everybody gets a nickname there's there's so many crazy nicknames people a lot of times the nickname was like where you come from like White Plains Charlie or Mount Vernon Tommy there was a lot of that my nickname was Joe the comedian you're the funny guy in the pool wow they knew I was a professional comedian they would come and play pool oh no no I was like 20 when I first started playing pool right after I tore my ACL so I think I was 23 so like hey it's Bob the UPS driver yes real original thing ray the fireman not doing yeah White Plains Charlie was a big one this is like crazy little semi homeless guy used to come and play pool all the time he was a addicted gambler I did so many guys I realized about gambling addicts when I played pool I just did not know how many of them there were because I'd never been around them I never been see like until I started playing pool I didn't go places like like a night club type environment or like a place where a bunch of like seedy people would hang out you know pool walls are seedy like a lot of gambling and shit-talking and you're betting on things I didn't grow up around that my high school years was all Taekwondo yeah and then after the martial arts competition then all sudden I'm around these complete degeneres I get never been around them and I'm 23 which is good life lesson though it was interesting yeah I was a lot there was a lot of people that are addicted to drugs there's a lot of methadone people that would come during the day and they would just be like half out of it and they would play pool and they were terrible no just hustling they would just play pool with each other they would call him the methadone Ian's and they would come in and play pool and they're just bang balls rolling they couldn't concentrate balls were real they could not concentrate no shit but it's funny because like what it was like was they were like a bunch of people that were under a spell it would come in they'd be just right and they would play pool but they were dull they were like gray people just path there was no vibrant color there was no but the crazy thing is though there was a guy who was the best player I ever saw one of the best players I ever saw and he was a heroin addict and he would do heroin and he would do he would go into the bathroom he would shoot up and he would come out and he would sit down on up one of those barstools one was pool stools you know thing for you drink he was sit there on this like this for a fucking half an hour and everybody knew it was going on here that he had to do this he just sit there like this just shit so fucked up and I never been around anybody was on heroin either I've only seen every intervention they had explained to me my friend Johnny who did a bunch of drugs would explain to me he's like just going back to do his shit I go wonder what shit does he do he's gonna fucking shoot up gonna go shoot up he's gonna come out and he's gonna sit down for a while and then ft should tell for a while he's gonna play that ass dude he would get up and he had no feet he'd look good the guy who was playing this guy George the Greek George Stickle yeah George the Greek was one of the local big-time guys and he was a wealthy guy he was always gambling he gamble high you know he would say like crazy shit like he got the heart of a mustard seed you cocksucker and a raspy guy always smoking cigarettes right you can smoke cigarettes endure back then everybody some God an entire place filled with smoke and he was gambling against this guy and he had like some crazy spot because this guy was like literally a world-class pool player and this fucking guy didn't miss a ball and he's like he shoots the fucking nerves off he goes into that bathroom and he shoots that shit and he shoots his fucking nerves off he comes out he can't miss a ball they'll realize man he would just he was so dead behind the eyes like you'd look at his eyes they were black like a gerbils the Sharks is gone der both eyes are black it's black it's oh dude that's what he was like I'm telling you it was the weirdest thing around him like he would look right through you he didn't see you he was his blitzkrieged on Harold's not living you couldn't miss couldn't miss but I didn't want to do heroin he's probably dead now though oh he's dead I know he's dead okay 100% I ran into him at a pool tournament when I first moved to LA in 1994 and this guy tried to get me to drive him to Compton so he could cop he asked me to put him right he asked me to put him in the pool tournament there's a pool tournament at goddamit what's the hard times hard times billiards in Bellflower it's one of the thing is pool halls in the world hard times is like a world-famous pool hall and it's in Bellflower California and a lot of big-time gamblers and top-level players used to play there all the time and even came out of there like Keith McCready I was like the guy from the color of money he was the Nemesis of Tom Cruise legitimately one of the best pool players in the world at the time came in another came out of there so this is a huge pool hall like one of the biggest like pro level put balls in the world and I get there and I see this guy they call him Buffalo Bill or water dog those are his two nicknames Claude or Doug depending upon which part of the country and what time of the year water dogs cool so I ran into him and I'm like are you playing what are you doing out here and he was like yeah I just need to get someone to put me in the tournament so I'll put you in the tournament like it was like I don't know 20 bucks or something like that he didn't even have 20 bucks he just needed you to from $20 plus to get him in the tournament whatever I remember how much it cost might have been 50 bucks whatever it was I was like I'll put you in here legit chance to win yeah like he was a world-class player okay got to go to Compton so I can cop I was like what and he was like you got to drive me to Compton I'm like driving you to Compton so you could buy heroin because if they arrest you they take your car like if I was you would harden the transaction I owe you they'd confiscate your car Oh Jose you had a 1995 or Toyota Supra bitch bitch you crazy / turbo the car with a big crazy stupid comebacks is the purple silver I was approached I always wanted a spaceship bro damn that stick drive that thing that Compton these would do to that the first nice car ever had ever you know I was like at the time probably 27 ballin for the first time my life like why it should have post me said shit I was like what I have a rent a condo right now I motherfuckers I'm not giving all this up I was like so excited all sad oh yeah super sad super sad since that and he went out there and he lost two matches in a row it barely paid I put him in the tournament anyway he asked me to put him in anyway like but I need relics man without heroin he could not play well he was so itchy I think I think those guys that get off of that stuff cold turkey like if you have a you're jonesing for it bro you put him in a tournament with withdrawals fuck I don't know if it was even withdrawals he probably got earlier that day he was just jonesing oh he's always raw one cuz he seemed pretty you know I think when they get withdrawal in what doesn't work withdrawal withdrawal they start sweating and shredding machine Miami it's like they like they have the flu I tried going off coffee for a day and I got withdrawals I got eggs oh yeah I was like sweating clammy skin me too hundred percent I'm not mad at though I love Cathy I like life with caffeine I like coffee I like the ritual I get up in the morning I drink some coffee I'll do a little reading I do a little writing sometimes I take our giant shit then I work out yeah I can do routine I used to work out right away but I found out that it's better if I let my brain warm up a little bit just get them Bloggie yeah we got my file you got my coffee take my kids for a walk yeah sometimes I like to look at the news too just to make sure the world's not fucking falling apart before I start my day yeah I'm like yeah just like to be in the know you know yeah I go to Google I have this like Google News thing set up on my phone so I'll hit that without looking at social media so I don't get and looking at my own stuff I just go and read stuff about like what's happening the world everything okay we're going to war with Korea we're good sound all right like to check on weird shit happening some fire I need to know about to like fire season right now buddy dude it's rare 80 degrees outside right now it is fucking toast I'm sweating in here I feel bad for my car dude it's insane so bad for my card so hot this is how hot it is outside when I came to the door to unlock to get in the air-conditioning from our studio was blowing out I could feel it on my hand by the fuck's outside it's crazy well Genting bro the world Satan's coming Houston is we're living in Arizona now it's so fucking hot is this like is it gonna keep getting worse like at what point does it become uninhabitable dude yesterday my my girl's dad was at the house and he just goes Brendon it's only you get worse just the heat just the world everything is that you really like that disagree it's better than ever I disagree like I know things look rough right now but if you if you look for bad things you're gonna find bad things here's what I things more you sages whenever you see like a high temperature like today and we don't beat the record high whatever that was right I always think about what the fuck was going on in 1927 when it was a hundred and bush like fuck y'all and dudes just shit more we get to wear three-piece suits in hats like an assholes they had those fucking wigs oh yes powdered wigs yes that would go into the courtroom with a powdered wig on with no air conditioning no a/c that's stupid wig the full getup what is a powdered wig like what does that mean - they put powder on the wig what is a powder - why I think so I think probably I think I'm white yeah why they have powdered wigs like Google that that's the craziest like a crazy tradition who was like galaxies eyebrows were they still wear them bro in England no no do they wear them they wear I'm super obvious we're like you can see their hair underneath they put a little effort to the powder made made that made them white or whatever color okay in 18th century mens wigs were powdered to give them their distinctive white or off-white color women in the 18th century did not wear wigs but wore how do you say that word kofi or Co Fuehrer supplemented by artificial hair or hair from other weave after 1798 women seldom powdered their hair why did people wear powdered wig click on that mental floss you know why the fuck would they do it what is it pirozhkis powdered wigs call peru keys for all the rich look at that fucking wig they would wear the goofiest wigs they would like like 1970s rockers how weird centuries powdered wigs call peru keys were all the rage the chic is that say how you say that chick is chic right hairpiece cuz I always hear the chic I don't really read it that often she care piece would never ever become popular however if it hadn't been for a venereal disease a pair of self-conscious kings and poor hair hygiene Wow the Peru story begins like many others with syphilis standard 1580 the STD had become the worst epidemic to strike Europe since the Black Death oh my god these people were all fucking each other to death yeah according to William William hey say that name clothes clouds an infinite multitude of syphilis patients clogged London's hospitals and more filtered in each day without antibiotics victims faced the full brunt of the disease open sores nasty rashes blindness dementia and patchy hair loss baldness swept the land well if you start rocking these things at the time hair loss was a one-way ticket to public embarrassment long hair was a trendy status symbol and a bald dome could stain any reputation because they knew you had syphilis oh my god when Samuel Pepys brother acquired syphilis the diarist was that word diarist write stories for a living that said he does reside in the dairy business ok diarist wrote if my brother lives he will not be able to show his head which will be a very great shame to me Wow so there wasn't that big of a deal because we're a bald you made fun of what they do back then well yeah that's true in the Bible you know God sent some bears to kill some kids because they made fun of this dude for being bald those part of the fuck shit and so Louie the my fourteenth hired 48 wigmaker's to save his image five years later so this was louis xiv was only 17 when his mobster ah terrible genetics yeah not good Louis Louie's cousin charles ii did the same thing when his hair started going to gray both men likely had syphilis courtiers courtiers hmm I don't know what that word is and other aristocrats immediately copied the two kings ah interesting they sported wigs in the style trickled down to the upper-middle class Europe's newest fad was born the cost of wigs increased in Peru --cz became a scheme for flaunting wealth and everyday wig cost about 25 shillings a week pay Wow for common Londoner so a couple grand for this fucking wig the bill for large elaborate / ooks ballooned to as high as 800 shillings whoa the word bigwig was coined to describe sick nobs who could afford big puffy / oops still use that Wow the fake wig that's crazy well that was from the 1700s when Lewis and Charles died wigs stayed arounds like some story this is crazy proofs remain popular because they were so practical they're so practical that's why I say about wigs they're so practically said just it's just a thing to do at the time head lice oh wow headlights were everywhere and nitpicking was painful and time-consuming wigs however curbed the problem lice stopped infesting people's hair which had to be shaved for the peru to fit so everybody shaved her head and wore a wig life's had no home they camped out on the wigs instead delousing a wig was much easier than Dalhousie a head of hair you send the dirty hair piece to a wig maker who would boil the wig and remove the nest that's where nitpicking came from the term nitpicking came from picking lice out of weight you're dropping some nom damn this is just like when Callen does that second time droppin knowledge first of all you got to rename that you didn't make you know you got to rename that immediately you cannot say dropping knowledge well you just can't know we should going to calm up we should come up right now hey Brian hey Brian we've been talking wonderful that you're sharing these little tidbits of information but to announce that they're gonna be there in a segment and say we're gonna drop knowledge now you know why'd your mats pops up out of the ground like a fucking jack-in-the-box or you just recurs taste one hunter said he's like what's up I know I have to drop knowledge do I have to do it so listeners when if they don't like that to fast-forward otherwise you're just spring it on you so it's kind of like you know it's almost like an ad read mmm so if you dig it cool here it comes I know that's what this - cuz I was beginning to have a kid drop knowledge on it was mine he told them to start it off as a segment no no I told myself I'm a really funny right your summer fun yeah sometimes is it a problem of years to do it in every episode yeah so we'd be like give a middle of talking about wigs in but you know in France in 1940 and then would go off and this thing and kind of derail the show so I said that's interesting though it is that if he told you that you'd be like why I'd be great maybe sprinkles in some stuff would be like that's not true man no true stuff yeah oh where is it what's the not true stuff you know it just depends on the episode interesting yeah just depends so I figured might as well just label it so France know what's happening right now I'm not a fan of segments in anything when everybody was okay now we're gonna go to the let's pretend you're a Mexican game fan I'm not a fan of like the thing that people like do in the middle of a show well I mean well for ours you know we'll have our banter back and forth like we have not for three hours because we don't do it every day but we'll do it you know if you had the same person every single day it stopped killing with three hours of material just you and I could do a podcast every day for three hours different animal Jill that's add every time I use some professional podcasters so good at talking shit it's what we do but they say in Cal is not how dare you I'm not saying that we're into the same things you and I are into the same things couns into you know but I mean the same things a lot of the same things accountant going down a weird road you know what listen listen bro listen count the fascinating man he is but what would the current event that gives us fret you know why start current events what Alan doesn't keep up with current events like he wouldn't know whatever today's current event was like with pop culture like he has no idea with what's going on in the world cuz he's so into history that's where Jamie comes in exact specially if it's like black Twitter yeah so so I'm kind of like yeah so exactly ideas like Jamie introduced you in a certain stun like with sports like counted see on Sunday yeah you know whatever the fuck he does so I'm like man you didn't know you know Bieber flashes dick he's like I have no idea but he's into books and stuff would yeah admirable but that's why the show works is he's into his thing I'm into my thing right cross-pollinate right cross-pollinate that's Paul is he how much is Brian into like MMA these days I don't know like that and that's that's one of the reason why I started my own show cuz I bet K did you watch that fight we're covering right now I didn't see it or you just see the highlights and I'm like dude I'm getting balls deep into this we kind of have to if you're a fighter in the kid and you grow like this giant MMA population of like listeners yeah but you know for a reason maybe he's busy or somebody does see the fights it's tough when in that time I show started I'd be breaking out a fight getting pretty intricate into it and he'd go so you know just some beginners question where I couldn't really get into it I let these motherfuckers know this Saturday is January 2nd this Saturday January January just because I'm thinking of who's fighting I'm sorry I'm triple tasking podcasting thinking and going to head taxing no this Saturday the second is UFC Fight Night it's Stefan's true versus who is it suppose I have a motherfucking fight companion that's the point ladies and gentleman we didn't hit companion but um we're not gonna do a companion for Edmonton because I that's why do they still have germane to random me on there she's lightly fight good job she got injured she event it again yes just pulled out unspecified reasons but it's speculated there's an injury speculate has to still scale well hashtag maybe I'm a cyborg to me attending yeah okay its replacement late replacement for injured remained Aranda me talita the Olivera has apparently agreed to step in on short notice who is she have you seen her fight no let me see the rest of card yeah let's go back to the card here we go what's the full card here Volkov yeah yeah he was very good to man he beat his last night he beat Roy Nelson I kind of a light card it's being honest see how what light would be an understatement yeah I agree light but wait a minute keV Tyson off his fighting mood and then you also got a Cal above yeah um click on that ties him off fight he is he's been out of the UFC for a while he's in the UFC fight pass prelims there you go right there BAM yeah Felipe Silva Maher back Tyson off is a very good fighter these were very good that's that's gonna be an interesting fight I don't know too much about Felipe Silva but this is Rotterdam right that's where this is taking place that made a vet abhi fun it's Callan town I think so we got to get Eddie Bravo drunk and bring up conspiracies yes yes that never happens Oh Barbarina is fighting that's easy fighting right next to that one that's Bauer design was that Brian Barbarino Leon Edwards Jamaica Bam Bam yeah you know it's a light card but I will watch it and I'll see what the proper mean it's a tough motherfucker I like watching him fight yeah I should be interesting yeah it'll be fun bro either way a lot of you striking a fight pass did you see your boy Snoop Dogg talking shit to karma Gregor no so embarrassing what did he do oh my god can you bring that up Jamie how his face how do UFC doesn't go get the fuck up twist video no you put blasts out in the Instagram room fuck you Conor that's what happens a little bitch I like just on tirade really okay what happened there schizophrenic bipolar there one more river left well come on man I just don't get what people celebrate in signing the demise like risky took there's a fun fight there's a fun fight was a fun fight the brought the fight to Floyd and they made it a fight is the biggest fight of all Boyd brought the fight to Connor I mean Floyd step forward with his hands up and move towards him and constantly created pressure Connor also came forward to man like they both brought it it was a very good fight it was very entertaining very entertain he hit Floyd more than any fighter hit him and I think the right result took place a specialist the greatest specialist of all time beat a guy who is just not at his league when it comes to that specialty you know I mean I think that's what we should have seen and I think it was good for everybody I think it was great for Floyd because it's the most entertaining Floyd fight ever right it was a great opportunity for him to showcase his ability and to show everybody what he can do and get the 50th win get the 50th win and for Conor he got to show people that he can hang for til he gets tired he can hang pretty well with the best fighter of all time this is what else I think is cool is Connors take those boxing skills and now bring it to the UFC and he's been on there's there's no fight to UFC can throw to him that's gonna be bigger there's just nothing you're not gonna rattle him the moment can't get big enough for him so now unless they give him john jones brock lesnar like a tag team some weird random shit which would be awesome however there's nothing they can do right so now he's learned from this he's and he's a guy who learns from his losses and brings that to the UFC I think he maybe has one maybe two left but still do you think so yeah I don't see him too I mean when you have a hundred million in the bank he even said he goes unless I fucked things up I should be set for life and my kids and their kids should be set for life yeah yeah so and he's very you know self-conscious of you know the repercussions of sticking around too long he had a buddy he he was a tenor fighter guy died so you know I don't seem this the other thing with John being out now all the chips are in Connors corner he's the only superstar legit superstar in town he's like listen you want me to fight again I know that's the old contract that's what I'm worth what do you guys want to do it's the only way it's gonna happen to him there is no second who else is number two name and number two Joe obviously it might be steep and that's time I mean he's the heavyweight champ I mean at least there's something they're not even the same side of the part as far as the drawl yeah who else is there who Bisping who George st. Pierre once you fight the biz bang yeah George I mean people are gonna be a little disappointed with the Georges numbers I don't think it seems tall as you think I think the people that were George st. Pierre fans that's a long time ago over four years ago and the sport is a different sport now a lot of younger people now that are just getting into it like this old guys fighting cool he started business only make sense what I'm the other guy I read this douchey preview of the fight it was so douchey see the thing getting bigger and some it's these fucking sports guys who write these really creatively negative articles and it was about the Bisping and I think promo for the fun no no no I read it I don't read promos when you see those promos that's all he's read top of the join 100% I don't have a plan I just say exactly what I think about the fights it's like when I do those the best way to do it and I never you tell me that so when Showtime wanted me to cut a promo for right before the fight I was like let me just sit down and do it man I want just don't tell me what to do and you should go let me think about what is it steak was what it really means I go what's it mean to me how do I feel about let me just go man and now shine through you know like when you talk about certain moments that you've seen out of a fighter that you show that shows like how special they really are and gets me excited yeah like we talked about like Anderson when he front kicked Vitor Belfort in the face like it was an electric moment you know then he's capable of doing these movements that just looked so much faster and so much more accurate than you expected you know Anderson in his prime some of his performances man which is so stunning know what I'm talking about that guy like the onliest Graham what you guys do who wrote this no I'll tell you I'll tell you what I feel nobody ever wrote anything for me no yeah I be that way from the beginning and that's why it comes off so good yeah when you hear a guy like reading off a teleprompter in the beginning of a fight like in the promo of the fight like when they're talking about what what's happening what's at stake it just doesn't feel right even if it's like kind of crazy talk like Teddy Atlas like when Teddy Atlas Lee see it's real real yeah it's real you gotta have real it's some crazy shit but a thrill reading I've teleprompters is just proved um what was the thing you read though with the biz being and just be just on the fight it was just some douchey sports guy article about it and I was like saying that George st. Pierre is getting off his rocking chair Oh God to come out and Brown kick some nobody in the head I might know no she's coming out to fight George st. Pierre who is that car this is George st. Pierre brother is coming out of retirement to fight Michael Bisping who's the UFC middleweight fucking champion of the world shit my way GBE took tit from Luke Rockhold like people you'd say what you want but he still took the belt they go out but the only defending against a inhibitor what who cares shit he beat him he did yeah he's a little jet straight lineage on an 85-pound champ of the world no I don't I just when I see that fight I just and I you get again go on my tours and just get seen the actual reaction face face with fans when I talked about it it's very lukewarm yeah what do you think hmm we gotta wait for Robert Whittaker to heal up you know he's the interim champ and that's gonna be a while his knees pretty fucked apparently so he's got to heal up his knee and you know once that's done then you know you get to see what happens after Bisping fights GSP here's the thing though that with with biz and I love biz me I wish she was a bigger droplet Bisbing british y'all not huge ratings biz being robert whittaker not huge ratings like there's nothing can really do there who's Luke Rockhold fighting again he's fighting uh David branch that's right that's an interesting fight that's a some that's September of what the 16th or something like that yeah yeah dude branch from World Series fighting his first fight in the UFC was terrible but it's also his first you know in a long time he's the World Series champion light heavyweight and middleweight yeah so you know Gerald Harris knocked him out with a slam his first UFC fight way brother UFC career yeah and left went you know did worked in World Series you know for Luke Rocco I think it's just it's more of him just getting back into things right but he can't take this kid light no no Luke so talented me yeah he's a fucking silly talented yeah David branch is one a lot of when I took ROH lost Anthony Johnson by decision for that's pretty crazy lost lost has a light heavyweight - Anthony Johnson go up to Hardy's ripped his leg off did he yeah you caught him oh yeah right yeah there you go no UFC oh that's right he got healed her queer dad yeah any of the black he's a black belt on the ground to second round huh 144 mm-hmm I felt like I was the first round yes you're 16 Palhares more than once no just one time yeah okay Gerald Harris that's where it is Gerald Harris knocked him out and UFC 116 Leslie Lester versus Carwin Wow while we go fuck yeah that's right kale slam yeah yeah I remember that I think that got knock of the night cuz I thought I was giving kid it cuz that was really that got knock out a night of slam I'm pretty sure that the kids we got an award for that interesting so scored go up all the way to the top he has his hands full with the graphs oh yes he does so he beat Vinny Magalhaes who's a phenomenal submission artist velocity beat Christophe Cocteau and there's a decent fighter doctor was writing that nine at the time attendant yeah but that just shows you where the middleweight a split decision though he don't call me yeah but you shin okami has never been the same he beat Jesse Taylor yeah who's the you know the champ but you should know commie after he got stopped by Timbo Timbo and then he got stopped by Jacare trevally stop bad then he left yeah he just wasn't the same and that's all all of that is after Anderson mark correct but I'm you look at David branch compared to Luke Rockhold lineup it's insane Luke Rockhold I mean big breasts in the world no yeah this is a terrible match up for David branch and unless you can rise to the occasion yeah like that talking about shit to each other to have a yeah talking to londo shit look at look at Rockhold Weidman Machida Bisbing boat Philip ooh he hasn't fought since December of 2000 you arey of 2016 June sorry been a while man and then before that he's on the McGregor card when you fought Weidman McGregor aldo that was the best performance of his career beat that shit and when these new shoes for that tune with that I thought was cheetah what he looked his best yeah he also fought the bass being up here I choked him out with one arm yeah I had kicked him to choke down caught him with that question mark yeah yeah playing and then Tim Boetsch he fucked him up with Tim Tim Boetsch you fucked him up with an inverted triangle Kimura that cut that cost the Philippine fight happy body yeah they have to talk tossed into walking out to take that fight you really might yeah why not he just said he was over it you don't want to fight anymore in my man's was like dude if you don't walk out there this will taint your career for the rest of your life Wow and he was literally not going to fight he's like I'm not going there cause name he's like I'm not going Wow Alexa McMahon was like you better get your ass out that I'm telling you you you're gonna regret this for the rest of your life or you don't go out there why did he not want to go out there I think he's just over it the nerves everything is like I don't do this anymore like here let me help you i Jewish lever kick get out of his yeah that's the business were in shit you don't well there's a decision that people make when they've taken too much punishment and then they just can't get excited about performing anymore they can't get excited about competing anymore there's a decision that people make where once they make that decision you got to just get out because you will never be the guy that you were when you didn't give a fuck and you were hungry and young and you're gonna run into that guy you're gonna run into that guy that guy that was you you're gonna run into him you stare yeah you couldn't even tell what cost of Phillip would look normal in that fight looks like he's trying to win think once you get in there it's kind of fight or flight you know yeah I mean it goes back to his instinct oh boy Luke Rockhold it's a very good left kick to the body it's great oh okay it's legal kick to the body on when you're on the ground that kind of hit his head but yeah did it yeah go back to you raised up at the very end of it powerful vimeo not that it mattered house that house it's legally online oh how dare you see yeah you're right right behind your shoulder blade that's legal yeah it's kind of weird that you could do that you know it can you stomp the body when you guys down not really right no you can axe kick though loop oh that's right you can can you like push stomp care such bullshit in it can you like if you can't go down stomp but can you stomp forward you can do on your feet it's kind of like a front kids weird it's kind of dumb right that's weird anyways I think I like David branch I think the Luke learnt some interest but again Luke's not a huge pay-per-view crolick for the UFC and should be an out like yeah Luke has every reason he should be I don't get it but with John being out don't just go through the champ so you got Mighty Mouse ain't happenin no time no time they're paying them no times coming up so we had two fights lately that for right in the UFC yeah he's at four I think he's had he fought Misha no sir poonam hit fight stopped him he stopped how many fights is you have in the UFC it's not not pulling up doesn't the PDS house I'm not saying oh yeah I just go to his Wikipedia I guess I feel like he's had two fights in the upset he's at three three mine have had three safe three you might be right it's not a lot though I agree it's not a lot do as I say there okay om split the sentence P that's right that's right that's a fight he took on short notice he found bail I remember that I was in Houston that's right but he's just been working death God he's just but you look at a division there's just nothing for him so he has fight Dustin or DC well Merkin Misha is not as impressive all the Misha is a very good striker and a very good submission artist he's really good submissions but that was like okay he caught that dude coming in clipped him with one punch knock them out that's impressive but doing it to Jimmy man on why you got to go oh okay this guys fucking for real like if you could do that to manawa he could do that to a lot of people pink yeah I want to see him do it to someone else too obviously you want to see him fight i next-level stuff you know I think's gonna happen and I do like him I said I hope it comes champ be hilarious for many reasons but I think you know his technique of rushing like that use a certain level work guys like DC and Gus Ringo you want to do what right and they get fucked up well that's but here's the thing about that levels levels to this game in light-weight goes DC John Jones Gus Finn DC and then right in the second level and then after that Frank and free furl yeah like what does DC do now like if they give him back the title again it's but this is the thing in the public's eyes it's such a tough sell like here's the best like every world it was like no we've seen them loose twice now we see him get put to sleep by John in the second fight you want do you and I think DC's the grass like every all the time I take out John you want you want talk about worst case now they go tainted subway take pills again six months except suspension we're gonna strip the belt from Mia DC hears about your fight John again six months go get yourself here to steal that goddamn belt back give me my fucking belt that like that's okay but here's the thing we don't know what was really going on now right we don't know with John yeah that's uh now I think we are allowed to have complete open speculation with zero concern for being respectful yes I think after the dick Pole thing I go look man they did was party and he was taking some dick pills let's let it go coke I don't give a fuck about coke that's not helping you yeah then you hear about this you go wait a minute something's going on okay what is this yeah I want to know what the kids because JIT like JD s got flagged right and they pulled him off France you know I'd only get JDS coke um all right that steroids for sure because he's out of clean history right with John one thing after that well JD s also got flagged for a diuretic yeah I'm just saying let's say they didn't say it was trace amounts yeah trace amounts so with JD s I can bet for the doubt all right happened once whatever but John if they come on bro and then and then with the dick pills a lot be like that's kind of covering up the third you know recovery therapy for when your intestines testosterone stuff like that like that's a little Shady whatever put that to the side now it's like come on man well this is a weird one because this one is if he was taken what you described as some short acting quick leaving your system steroid some drug that makes you aggressive you got it okay how long was he doing this for like did was he doing this during training was like this amp him up this help is work rate did this make him more aggressive and more confident in training did it add to his confidence when he was fighting like what is this we don't know we were we know that story that shale son told you know that story the Chael Sonnen told the my podcast about John being under the entire like under the Octagon when when the solid can conduct and pissed under that gun right this is what they wanted to do they they knew that he this was before you had to expose your whereabouts he didn't have to disclose your whereabouts back then so when they showed up at the gym John apparently saw them pull up and went underneath the Octagon he thought they would leave they didn't leave they stayed the entire time and they waited for the gym to close the gym clothes to shut the lights out and then John came out of the offices crew this is what she'll sign says she's really not a liar either besides if he's done he's not taking steroids when he's fighting yeah I don't know if he got it from I don't know what source chale's using he's pretty reliable right he's definitely in the know right I agree I don't know I don't know if it's true or not but it makes you think like okay well if what is that for is that for pot you know okay party was your words like oh I know with the smoke with writers this much smoke i'ma go what's going on right what is going on yeah how about Chael Sonnen he reading we're at the press conference he this is four days before the fight we're both work he's working for I think ESPN for the Mayweather stuff I'm like Showtime comes by he goes yo Max Kellerman didn't take you on a hundred

the news he's like no one's broke here for God's sakes let your point sir good point good selling wonderful long he can keep up that lifestyle though with that kind of spending like his spending is insane it's not Johnny Depp insane like there's Johnny Depp over that that's some shit oh you like 14 ounces there's Johnny Depp and there's Floyd Johnny how about two how about two houses join me when they become boxing's first a billion dollar fighter can you name the other billion athletes Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan million yeah which was surprising me get 500 million come on at least

shit yeah well well he can't deserve it maybe she's a little upset so you got Arnold Palmer Jack no sin Tiger Woods Michael Jordan Arnold Palmer made a billion yeah knocking a little ball off that dirt off that delicious drink oh that's right no I'm just kidding Tiger Woods she estimated at 100 million tchau tchau tchau it's a lot it's a lot of cash baby baby set that's a lot of cash baby baby set did you see that video and Tiger got arrested for drunk driving yes hilarious he's just fucked up on bail he was on sir do you see I think they found six things in his system why did he think he'll drive on pain pills what's Tiger Woods who told them Tiger Woods but doesn't he know like bro you just got back surgery and you're taking like heavy-duty opiates or whatever the fuck they're giving you he's taken it was he taken he was taking a boniface full eyes are so fucked dude time to shave your head take it from another bald guy let it go it's like that song from the movie frozen let it go it did that shit yeah I mean he's not a good-looking guy anyway terrible bro he wouldn't worry about that nonsense you are going on there just going with classes but those two cock eyes to man like another billion dollars bro hundred million but clear glasses that car was wearing yeah get some of those like Dave Chappelle's went something that I definitely want to get there it was like a brown frame and they weren't so dark with their sunglasses they're like tinted wear look cool like get those if you have a cock I know what the move is he goes with like yellow aviators hunter s Thompson style yes and and just starts dressing like Johnny Depp and just starts flaunting the fact he's a freak I agree let your freak flag fly freaking freak oh he's tied to the system and all that not worried more oh that's true Nike still monsters money a lot of people do know a lot of companies even after this yeah do you remember how remember how big Tiger Woods igon tie yeah gigantic golf like cool yeah oh my god I saw my house out in that bitch sweetie this oh my god so he hit vicodin yeah dilaudid Jesus Christ he was taking some shit they gave people that were dying of like bullet wounds and the Old West days dilaudid and AMEX you know I'd say a sleep drug zanuck zanuck is not a sleep drug so it's a relax right like anything anti insomnia drug ambien why they say sleep drugs zanuck no sleep drug is am being dummies use xanax is an anti-anxiety either way it's proof he likes to party yeah man that's a lot of shit go back to that please but he'll really played golf in yet he does but he's not doing good he was found unconscious in his Mercedes Benz which was parked awkwardly on the side of the road and had damaged the driver's side did you hear how he fucked up his back to me have you heard this story no he was upset because his father was the military was obsessed with military he actually trained with Navy SEALs like put on the full thing went through this Navy SEAL training like obviously not real shit but doing a little marches and shit fuck this stuff up that's how he fucked himself up no it's one of the ways he fucked his knee and back up something like intense like maybe SEAL training like shooting with them and stuff that's so stupid the secret history of Tiger Woods is that what it's in there the death of his father set a battle raging inside the world's greatest golfer how he waged that war through an obsession with the Navy SEALs it's tell the tale of how Tiger lost his way I haven't read this either there's a thing I agree that you have to have mental toughness to work out hard and to get through brutal workouts you have to you have to don't gotta go Navy SEAL on a bitch that's what I'm saying I'm saying you got to build your body up to that and you are a different person you're a fucking professional athlete you're not a warrior going over to seas to take bullets no right for your life and kill bad guys what you're doing is a very specialized thing that is worth a fucking billion dollars and you also hit that little tiny ball on this calm quiet golf course I don't need you to be in the waves trying to learn how not to drown and fight sharks it's like taking a dude who bought a brand-new Ferrari and taking them on one of those crazy dirt courses they have those off-road Porsches drive on oh my god you know those uh you ever seen those things those guys are like they have one guy next to him I never I need to ask someone what the fuck they're doing don't have like Chris Harrison I'll ask him there's another guy with a notepad the rally car is the map and he's going to clicks left one turned right he's his navigator yeah exact course like that on who's reading it those guys are maniacs good pull up some video of rally drivers or get rid of the fucking dead weight telling you the directions use MapQuest which boys you can't but they could step up their app game you know you have to have that guy needs a job his job the coolers taking care of the guy with the fucking notepad but and he knows like how long it takes for you to get there too because if you're driving at your fastest even if you're off for five or six seconds you're in the neighbor who knows what's up those cars a wild man those cars are so it's like such a different style of driving because the dirt makes the tires break loose like constantly right have you ever considered going that the Porsche track here we can take all the cars yeah let's do it I know don't they have a new one near the lar yeah oh they have a new one not far from here but the guy was told me they have like great restaurants he's like just booked it will take care of it you got the car they take care of the time no nuts go not our cars flatout scrooge mcduck it's possible edibles give me that gt3 RS wow I don't need some co-pilot let me do my thing come on don't go full circle seasonals [Music] holy shit there must be best friends Jesus that's why they're best friends you'd have to be best friends [Music] this is nuts man you see that red light that's the shifter yeah that is a sequential manual it's a manual but you you just push up to go up and down to go down you don't have to find it here yeah speed quickness yeah yeah you don't have to find the perfect gear you know like if you're using that h-pattern you're going up and then you go into something up to the right yeah so it's down 3 down 2 up 1 you know the way you're doing it is it's very different although my new Porsche peaked the PDK will shit on this yeah yeah it'll shit on it but this is probably more fun for this not sitting in traffic I jump on that road I guess in that dead heat traffic I just open that bitch get some rest too yeah but it's not as fun as driving a manual to me if I if it was like the one if I was driving in traffic all the time I would is not a chance in the world I wouldn't want a manual like you don't drive your gt3 in the 405 sometimes not five it in the afternoon sure I do really yeah even like yep oh wow yeah you just like sometimes just like driving that thing I just want to drive me to like sometimes I take the long way home right at night I just jump on the Pacific Coast Highway 2018 BMW m5 pack 600 horsepower and m-x drive all wheel drive system here to 60 and 3.2 whoa that's a big car too you gotta pay for the extra that doesn't top out at like 140 it only tops out at 111 less you pay for the package BMW needs stuff though I feel like they're losing a battle with everyone else right now well but Hades is just it's definitely ahead of them you know what BMW has coming out though an 8 Series the 8 Series Sedan locked the back makes you remember the 850 yeah the front end they were all s Amer dude but yeah look at this new 100 saw a green Sun look at this what you're only seeing the front of it wait till you go on the side look what this thing looks like it's wicked bad damn that's like an i8 but not the electric no no no no no no you know what it's like it's like the BMW i8 'yes s-class coupe yeah those are so it's like and it's this the big body I'm assuming twin-turbo I don't know what the fuck that's got under the hood I think all their cars are turbo it's anything like 50 back in the day look at the back end though damn the thing is bad yeah give them here they'll spin around I like that that's a Tron car I test all that they like get the fuck out of my face man there's too many different colors too and you know what France skinny tires yeah yes can't I need Fat Tire to like the tires on the Corvette how about that I need some fat-ass tires I like it even though it will the truck window man shut your hole I like the way it looks me too I like fat asses and fat tires fix it and take old bitties fixed and nothing is stowe it's pretty sick you used to have to m6 right yeah at the m6 that thing was right nothing was a monster heavy yeah straight up v10 heavy smooth Highway right yeah nothing fun in the tribe now that Porsche GTS is you know they say that's the best of the Porsches there was a article that I just read in one of the car magazines sure semi that said yeah see if you can write to my friends go to Porsche GTS is the best Porsche it's like a very recent article that I I read this morning on google type move yeah they were saying that it's the best version of it you know you got you gt3 which is like super hardcore I test drove that room and I called you I was test driving the gt3 and I'm like Joe you love this thing you said unless you got another vehicle man for you driving every day is a bad idea it'll get loud and I want you to pull the GTS is low - I escaped the front I felt like crying it's another inch or so but the gt3 has a button that raises yeah yes front end the GTS doesn't well it's not the gt3 it does because you buy it that way it's an option that well option wasn't there but tech art make some a aftermarket one so you can get that and get it installed and it'll raise it up I know a bunch of Porsche dealership to do it yeah is after my GTS yes my gt3 has it aftermarket my gt3 safe today yeah I have to park on the street cuz my driveways like this mm-hmm yeah I had to take one of my one of my other buttons from something else and have it dedicated to that gt3 button a matter of fact I think they took it from a blank and they installed a button in it you have above a blank we can put it my light Oh mines right on my my rear view mirror rather when I go near something I'll hit that button with the best corners what you say was Porsche GTS 2018 Porsche GTS is the best 911 they were saying they were just going over like it's like hardcore but not too ridiculous I got a gt3 RS and that it's pretty slick if you see that one guy he spent a shitload of money to take it was the Porsche the brand-new gt3 RS is only the PDK they got make it in a manual this guy's been a shitload of money to have a six-speed from a Porsche 911 are installed in a gt3 RS must cost so much he must be screwed screwed screwed Porsche well if you even have one of those things this it pull up pull up the top of the article what does it say quick take not the fastest 911 but possibly the best when is it from August yeah the things that's fun though that's it yeah well it's something the fastest though the 911 turbo turbo things a goddamn space machine like have you test drove on yeah 2007 are 2007 2009 or 10 I drove one the new ones it like the gt3 and that yeah I was just in love my car there's so fast they're stupid fast and they're four wheel drive yes but the new ones even fast way faster than that one the one that I dropped they're insanely fast they're insane the gt3 is just you I felt like it was like so hard boil but yeah so hardcore the you would love the turbo if you got one of those new turbos you'd be like what in the fire test drove that in the GTS I want the GTS why'd you go with that I might because my car it's like that lava orange has the duck wing on it it's just like a vintage Porsche to me like yeah I got right I saw on the show right away like that's it I'll look at these own that the atomic that's it that test-drove g3 everything I I just Darkwing Duck we got wings so because when I was a kid I always had it's all posted for a Porsche and had the old-school duck use green and I forget how to duck wing on it I'm like that has a duck way yeah that's like that's important 73 RS yeah it's so cool man you know those cars was 1973 our asses are worth over a million dollars now so sick like what if you bought it back in the day was like 20 grand now it's worth a million dollars don't you aren't you doing some of the Porsche old-school pores not that old-school it's a 1988 something 86 or something shorts just turned that thing into Berlin it's a an RS America a 964 it's like one of the last the air-cooled cars the last the air-cooled was the 993 which is like a little bigger this is a 964 they are cooled everyone's obsessed with their showned that's just a different animal yeah you get are pretty cheap too you know they're just not it's not it's a different kind of car and if you go earlier than that you get a meme cheaper and get him pretty cheap for like the 1980s cars I say I say that one that found it was a 78 career 911 but it had some reconstructive like stuff to it looked fun it's a bad investment cause like I saw that car you sent me a picture yeah still those are ass crazy man those things they're dangerous do you know about how to drive those like you when you really taking turns you have to keep your foot on the gas I know there's no if you let off the gas they have the throttle over see like what does it call the throttle let off oversteer so there's no power steering I'm trying to I'm trying to go out like James Dean silver - well they're really light yeah I know they look fun they feel different like my friend Alex from shark Works has a 964 and his it feels different because they're so small it's like it's it's a you're more connected to what you're doing it's really light and really small which is cool yeah especially this day is like going down to paying a cane I'm not using everyday cars yeah I thought and I want a new Bronco as a daily driver the new new brother who knew when you seen that thing and I live over by there what's up who was gonna buy the juices car they're gonna put that up for sale but an auction company just passed on it didn't go for 300,000 the actual like right 350 why I know this I've known you'd have to be a

making some kickass cars now see that Cadillac right there yeah things say no I don't they're cool and to go from a Porsche or a Bentley and gentlemen calcul all right kind of basic yeah interiors a base that you've spoiled I know the German little baby I know they got yeah they got me it's true right there's no American equivalent to like a Mercedes s-class they just don't quite get there we just were not there it's not weird like why don't they get there like why doesn't someone just dig in and go let's just throw our fucking dick into this hat let's just get our dicks in the desert thank fucking yeah I just build some beast of a fucking like what's the best American car Lincoln like you get a Lincoln no because no one cares no one cares it's just for the older color yeah you show up at a Lincoln Avenue are you from 94 not a bad car the new ones are actually pretty nice I know the point is it's not a Mercedes just not what American car q pull up and shit on people know it's comfy nothing eldorado now that they don't have a Viper you can't even pull up in a sports car now all the demon attacked an American muscle car engine so it's a muscle car muscle still kick-ass I'm talking electric ax well they have the market cornered when it comes to muscle cars when it comes to a stupid car with a giant engine that makes a ton of noise so we're killing it and it uses a manual transmission marek all day they still make the Corvette zo6 in a fucking manual it's one of the few cars the Germans are the only ones in the Porsche Porsches the only ones that have had the balls to bring a manual back after they took it away Ferrari still hasn't figured it out yet they refuse to well because douche bags are buy Ferraris they're all just trying to floss don't even know how to drive that's not real it's no it's not a track car have you seen that Porsche Turbo you can buy it's like the Platinum Edition the wheels are made out of carbon fiber and the whole it's gold it's a it's like a dark like not a like Scrooge McDuck gold coin but it's like a gold color bring that shit up Jamie this is this special Porsche Turbo like Platinum Edition Platinum Edition turbo but it's in gold it's a gold and then it has black rims that are carbon fiber dude why is it Platinum Edition but it's in gold shouldn't it be implied yeah it should be platinum I don't know I think it's

gonna get shorter than that you're not even three seconds you're going 60 miles an hour because with those those new rims are all carbon fiber so how sick is that those rims are dope I was kept it off first those rims are killer and I like the black stripes too yeah it's a nice car but you know what a lot of people don't like the way 911 turbos look way my friend when you get into it you cannot be my friend it's the first look at that fucking car bro it's badass the stripes on the seats comes with that luggage to Jamie bro I would flop that everywhere look it's gonna watch a longish but it's like how much does it cost sixty six thousand over we get a walk jested coupe and then hundred fifty seven thousand dollars but no it's more than that right the five piece ah doesn't tell me what the five piece luggage by that bitch 6324 for the luggage sir every penny how much you get for the watch dope is that thing though it's nice I prefer silver especially that thing that is a spaceship I mean your flex on people if you pulp another gold poor person matched matching luggage I will pull up in a red Ferrari and double flex you I don't know nothing I feel like I've seen fries yeah I was in Italy and a guy had a Ferrari in Italy I'm like this motherfucker I was right in Italy he that's pretty classy it was read right in front of this beautiful hotel on the Amalfi Coast I like that guy he's bombed all in and he probably had someone look at that Jamie Jamie Foxx Jamie Foxx has a shiny gold Bugatti he wins he likes his wheels or fucking gold he wins Jamie Foxx wins yeah go back to UM the the what is the new Ferrari what is it they the fuck is it called no one I'm not I'm not a brawny guy I like sorry see for me it goes Porsche FRA then I'm not laying bikini guy yeah Lamborghini

of Ferrari 488 look sighs a beautiful car man that's exactly what the guy had in Italy that is a thing ridiculous but I'll tell you what what looks better than that the new Ford GT that thing sick that looks better than that data that might be the American Ferrari oh it's based off the front yeah I copy the front of that thing go fullscreen Jamie I'll take the hips on that bitch Jamie do you

fucking drinks around there yeah why where's the car let me get my hands on it you have things filthy it's a beast their bull just you know what they are here's the thing they're goddamn gorgeous they're they simple incredible agree but they're gonna probably break yeah you have some problems yeah with a Porsche you never have problems really yeah it's like the difference between a girl who does CrossFit and she's got like thick ass and big legs and her shoulders a little snap and she's that great in the dress yeah right versus a girl who's like a model who's gonna turn an ankle if she goes to the beach with that I don't even say the crossfade curls gonna like eventually break down cuz CrossFit something shit now the CrossFit girl is the Viper that's the Viper ACR burry that fuckin shitty Ferrari that new Viper nothing breaks racecourses everywhere it's Barry in that fuck you know in a kid rock song not even close it's gonna kill the Ferrari but the Ferraris like sexier looking yeah like it's got perfect features yes it's got amazing what shit goes wrong yeah it goes wrong and when it comes down to fuckin you're gonna want that CrossFit girl push our way through a spin class this is deep like you do a 90-minute cross yoga class yeah you don't want a girl who's got like perfect jeans but she's lazy no hell no and she just takes adderall for a few days before her big shoot doesn't eat look at that thing that's a Ford GT that's a gross color though I saw one a sick blue collar for tourist killer fuck you look at the body on that thing though colour damn I'm out a man

Jamie black with red stripes without my people look at that yeah Jesus Christ look what the exhaust pipes come out of the back like that that that might be the best looking car ah fuck I gotta agree
