the Joe Rogan experience so um a woman who is into nice clothes and nice now I didn't say that no I didn't say he's into it I can tell by the type the type but what is the type the guy should look out for if you're like you're gonna give a seminar on how guys should avoid nightmare horrible women in their life what should they avoid okay you okay okay first of all it's case-by-case basis there's plenty different horrible things of course if she's got big old french tip nails she's a little bit of white trash okay french tip nails are bad like long press on french tip nails what if they're real nails they're French French tip is to me it's just such a trashy look but that's okay what about like dark red like Spanish girl red lipstick and dark red nails it depends on the girl it's a whole package because you can have trashy elements like I'm wearing cutoff jeans right now and a see-through tank top that's what I'm talking about bye it's ready to judge you but the rest of me is not polished it's not like the rest I've got like messy hair and one foot painted is that okay it's okay because I'm like not trying okay I think it's just there's a certain look that women have and I don't want to say oh it's this hairdo it's that there's a hole and you know what I'm talking about it's a whole myriad of elements that come together does she have and there's nothing wrong with having like enhancements does she have fake lips and fake tits and hair extensions and claws and is she wearing stripper heels well then she's probably fucking horrible like let's get serious lose sight heels indoors okay that's pretty rare though isn't it we came with some pretty extreme examples I I don't even know what realm we're dealing the fake lip thing is a that's a crazy one too like they never really worked that out and so many girls jumped on that bandwagon excuse me jumped on that bandwagon they fucked up their face forever I think women in Hollywood make a decision they're like I would rather look super weird them look super old because when like a lot of women you can't tell what they are how old they are this is so weird there's this woman that I see at my daughter's school when I drop my kid off in the morning and she's it makes me sad because this lady it she she looked like she was probably pretty when she was younger and she's not that old she's probably in her late 30s maybe early forties she has turned her face into that of a monster a monster and there's no going back it's rubber it doesn't move it's frozen it's filled in in weird ways where it looks like she's got a fucking toothache or something like her face is swollen and she you know what the kicker is she might have gone in for one thing had a weird reaction or whatever and like now it's like that and she might be a super cool lady or something and that's just like like you're stuck with that well you know what I think it is I think it's a dysmorphia like the same thing where anorexics have it bodybuilders have it women who have boob implants a lot of times never think their boob implants are big enough they want to keep going and going go on and get them bigger and bigger they get they get crazy they'll look at them and they're like not big enough like they don't see what everyone else is seeing what we're talking about before about MMA training I think it's still in a learning period I think I'm still having got it down the way you like say football has it down they know exactly how to train to develop like top-flight football players basketball same thing you go to a basketball camp you're dealing with top-flight strength and conditioning coach they really know how to deal with I mean you're dealing with multi multi-million dollar athletes and they have that investment and they want to keep it healthy and really no one should apply that more than MMA fighters who the fuck gets hurt more than MMA fighters my time which I probably is the worst taught sport in the world especially in Thailand because there's no history of teaching yeah so is life white is teaching fighters well they just copy boys moose I was like that's one of the first backwards sports and whatever whatever may and there's a lot of smoking and drinking as well we had it really better now like they've got a lot of you know fight against oak or fight against drugs means a lot of promotion now you've got a lot of guys like yachts and like fairtex and Malakpet oh he's actually American you know and Bork out these guys are heroes so for people there's a lot more push towards would be healthy get fit you can make good money now you go to Japan you can fight in America it dives yeah so yeah our friends that that trained in fight in Thailand and they were telling me about everybody smoking cigarettes and my friend Chris started smoking when he was in Thailand because he was fighting he's fighting in Thailand everybody was training and smoking and he starts walking to just like to be one of those you know I smoke cigarettes you know cham cham park you know the name he's the one who like the Tong PO sort of based interviewer me oh really yeah we broke Rick Rufus's leg you've seen the fight I'm sure you know the one who he he boots him and he you know breaks his leg the fly didn't see that it's on you too it's worth watching but we saw him and he's it means a legend for Andy hood for all these guys right we go to Thailand and Pattaya and he's just sitting there smoking so if I buy him a box of cigarettes he'll let me film him kick in the bag yeah he's eating a box of cigarettes and he kicked the bag for me yeah show me the technique you know like they're just smoking and alcohol there's out of control Wow there are at the moments being on the top of an industry especially an industry that's involved in technology is a very precarious position you know if you talk to Kodak a decade ago do you think they would they would realize that suddenly the largest vendor or manufacturer of cameras in the world would be a telephone company nokia nokia within three years became the world's largest maker of cameras and suddenly the entire industry changed right and how do you compete against that they're not even in your industry they just came out of left field it's like you're suddenly the horse buggy manufacturer and Ford is taking your business and you never expected that was gonna happen well Nokia has a camera phone now a Windows Phone that is some insane amount of pixels it's like 40 fucking megapixels or something something create 41 41 megapixels says Jamie Jamie's on top of that shit 41 fucking megapixels on a phone I mean this thing I think has have the note 3 I think that's 12 or something no it's better than that you familiar with Moore's law yes so so for your listeners to Moore's law it was created by Gordon more processors right processing speed and yeah and what he said was that he estimated because of the way silicon works every 18 months the speed of a computer would double or the price would drop by half and that has been true now for more than 25 years and and that thing then play in camera megapixels in storage on SD cards in the size of the of your smartphone in the number of sensors you can put into the smartphone and it's battery battery life is the one that's lagging behind and it's the main thing that's holding back this technology Moore's law also applies to things like Bitcoin it also applies to networks like the Internet and what it means is that if you're in an industry that's established and suddenly you have a competitor that's coming at you with the power of Moore's Law you no better watch out because you're in it's not a matter of whether you will be able to compete in a decade it's a matter of whether your industry will still exist in a decade right right yeah that fascinating that whole industries can just vanish 150 years of Kodak and then suddenly film doesn't exist gone
