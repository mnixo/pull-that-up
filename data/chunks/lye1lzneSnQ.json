hello freak bitches this article I want to talk on when we got here a transgender woman she was a woman she applied to an all-male call all-female College well was Wellesley Wellesley College ice actually no girl from Wellesley back in the day it's an all-girls campus and so she applied for the college she was born a female but then decided to transition into uh she had a very hilarious this is hilarious listen to the description of how she introduces himself herself whatever masculine of Center genderqueer exactly exactly yeah I am in love with this story I am in love with these kind of people I am in love with people that are so fucking preposterous that they take preposterous to an art form and they they become living parity whether they like it or not listen to what the fuck I just said she goes to a college she applies to an all-girls College a super liberal all-girls College she decides that she is transgender and decides that she wants to she introduces herself as masculine of Center gender queer changes her name to Timothy decided that she's jimothy and asked people to use the male pronoun when referring to him okay so welcome on campus until the day that she announced he announced ten Tina whatever that he wanted to run for the school's Office of Multicultural Affairs Coordinator whose job is to promote a cultural culture of diversity now who you would think would need diversity more than someone who's a transgender man you know I mean that's that's a very small segment of the population and they're often maligned and you know this is a socially marginalized group and it would be nice for an open-minded liberal college to accept someone like this and to recognize what a perfect person to be a part of our campaign incur urging people to uh you know to be more open-minded and accept people no they attacked her because now they felt that she is a white man and they don't want a white man in that position because if a white man is in that position then they're supporting the patriarchy so there was three other candidates for the gig right all women of color wonderful if one of them went and then you got okay you know your problem solved you got a woman of color in that position plenty of diversity there you're good right and no they all dropped out and then they stayed it they started an anonymous Facebook campaign encouraging people not to vote at all to keep a white man from winning the position ah this is amazing this is the left eating itself that's what's happening they're eating themselves it is a feeding frenzy I stab piranhas okay and one of the things about products is well one gets a limp they just Jack that motherfucker they are the most ruthless cunts when one piranha would just speak you know sometimes you have a fish tank one fish will just start swimming weird they start swimming kind of half sideways for some reason like that fish okay and you have to look at them like what's going on with that fish that shit didn't last in that tank baby those motherfuckers are just poor did you start taking chunks out of them that's what's happening here the left is they're turning on themselves they've run out of outrage they've made so many safe places they don't want anything to be safe anymore and they want to be able to go to war over everything they're ferocious they're piranhas they are social idea piranhas and they're attacking a genderqueer genderqueer masculine of Center man for not being diverse enough for being a part of the patriarchy Bart a woman born a woman lived as a woman no you're a white man now you fucking piece of shit you're a part of the problem haha it doesn't make sense though it makes sense because it highlights what this movement is all about it's socially retarded people that are left alone to their own devices and they're just devouring each other like zombies they're just tearing into each other like like zombies that are trapped into a fucking room it is right it is ripping each other apart you're not diverse enough you're not progressive enough fuck you you're such a pig I'm triggered it just triggering each other left and right this is this is an onion article this is a fucking onion article and it's not this is a national review this is a goddamn onion article and it's not transgender woman can't be diversity officer because she's a white man now ha ha ha ha mix urethane it's all it's makes all the sense in the world that it's not a fake article I mean that's a gene perfect representation perfect it's perfect it's amazing it's beautiful it's a rose it's a rose in a bad neighborhood pops out of the concrete and it comes out perfect it's amazing this is art it's the universe creating art with our own folly that's what it is it's culture it's called it's its people you know there's something that happens if you when you deny reality when you don't look at things objectively like this I think like priests that molest kids right some of that has to be from suppression some of it has to be probably they're abused themselves there's probably all sorts of but some of that perversion has got to come from suppression it's like the Catholic schoolgirl thing that everybody knows you know when I was in high school there was no scientists in my fucking ninth grade class but we all knew that girls went to Catholic schools were hoes and why they host their hoes because everybody tells them they can't be a ho everybody's talked to them constantly about you are going to go to hell do not touch a man's genitals don't you do anything else cause we're freaks they were the biggest freaks and we all knew it it was it was there was no books on it there was no YouTube videos that we could watch but we fucking knew it man we all knew it and I think it's a suppression issue and this is suppressing in visual identity this is suppressing free speech this is suppressing objectivity you're not allowed to have unique or intertwined thoughts you're not allowed to share opinions with the left and with the right you're not allowed to you have to have and you're constantly worried about being called out you're constantly worried about being outed and doxed and called out and shamed everyone's shaming people and attacking people it's this fucking feeding frenzy ah I love it I'm happy I'm so happy when I read a story like this I would encourage this woman to fight to the death for her position oh man she's a man now fight to the death to that position I mean literally I want you to show up for school in a fucking armor with a sword and let them know that you or you are here because you are a warrior for diversity and you're going to get it you're going to take this to the very end to the very end of time oh it's amazing this is an amazing story took one of the greatest stories the universe has ever told because it's it just and it highlights that story that we were just talking about where the the thing that was up on the other thing earlier with the the United States is like a powder keg this is like what we're talking about like entitled ridiculous people that they don't live in reality you're you're not look and you're concentrating on nonsense but why they concentrating on nonsense because they don't have to worry about feeding themselves they don't have to worry about shelter they don't have to worry about being in Ohio having no fucking power for a week and everybody has to stay alive you can't get to work everybody's like walking back and forth to each other's house sharing food and going out and getting firewood together and dragging it back at some little kids wagon that's what people do when they want to survive when when you want to survive you come up with ways that you could all work together when it's too easy to survive you start attacking people for nonsense and that's the fuck is going on here you got a campaign to keep through we're going to make sure that a white man's not going to win this like if she's really a white man why are we pretending that's a man left of queer genderqueer masculine of said to shut up lock up your girl your girl or a guy whatever you are who cares what the fuck it's probably way more to this story she's just a big fish you know like she's just got getting probably just eaten too much pussy on campus they're all mad yeah it should feel good at it she's too good at it but she's genderqueer so that means I don't think you do anything I don't know what that means I think they know what it means but you know ever pansexual there was a woman who was like she was making history this is hilarious this is a hilarious story she's making history because she was the first Gentile she was the first pansexual person to take office what the fuck are you talking about what does that mean she me and she doesn't sexually identify particularly sexually attracted to either race or either gender it's either one or both Miley Cyrus is pansexual course she is that's called being a freak pansexual what exactly does that mean but go find the politician first politician as pansexual it's just so stupid Penn sexual politician it's like a new word for bisexual it's not even bisexual it's because like they have to be special and it has to be Mary Gonzales Texas State Representative identifies as pansexual in new interview first of all good for her eat that pussy suck that dick have a party honey I'm not hating do whatever you want but do we really have to make a new name for it fucking christ and I posted something about this a while back on Twitter and there was people that were defending the term pansexual I'm like fuck you fuck you for trying to muddy up the world fuck you for having this on your mind unless you're mocking it fuck you for taking this seriously fuck you for this being an actual thing where you want to debate it how bad is your job how bored you at work you're sitting in front
