hello freak this is but the idea that giving someone a gun makes them more likely to kill people I'm not sure if I'd buy that when the LA riots were going on a lot of people had their own personal firearms and this guy I know he said he had to like go on the roof of his apartment with a gun because they were trying to break into his house and stuff like that and he actually had to shoot somebody shot somebody yeah and I'm like the arm or something like I think he said I who is this guy I don't wanna say it might be a bullshitter I can tell you off air is your bull sugar no absolutely not occasionally never yeah yeah what's his dick tastes like uh popcorn your poop it's not that far away this is people that we don't even know you don't even know they're working on these things nobody knows of them but yet they are like that close to go in public and they're fucking everybody has to swipe key cards before they go into building they check your bag they make sure you don't bring your phone your phone has to go into a bucket when you go into the into the laboratory because this is all proprietary shit they're checking their book they probably have those fucking fake buttons that are really cameras and shit i miss your glasses when you win ce o--'s fucking glasses glasses now they have glasses with little tiny cameras and I'm literally so hard to see if you look at your selfie camera look how little that goddamn lenses like the selfie one like the one on the back is tiny right look at my iphone here but the one the front is fucking stupid tiny it's so little and it's good it's really good I mean look how good a selfie camera is I mean they do a fucking incredible job of capturing your image like look at this look at that yeah that's a tiny ass little little pinpoint camera and it's got everyone in this room to the point where you could broadcast periscope from this thing that's like a sharpie if you took a sharpie and dotted a page with it just done that's how big that camera is yet it's crystal clear so that could be in your button that could in any if they're not physically patting you down you could easily have something like that going on yeah the one I use a massage parlours looks like a Kauri carlon see you're on the air teacher oh fuck man but it's a video it films 1080p film massage parlours do you no good I mean the one but now it's a it's like actually just looks like a little keychain but it does it does 1080p like it has a little memory card just put it in your computer next thing you know it's just like oh you got full video you just put it on the nightstand next to it pointed towards it's a girl hats anything that's really illegal though i'm creating I don't do it this younger she said the other thing you were telling me about where in Brazil I thought was fascinating was that there there there's a new type of testosterone that they're making testosterone from yams right grand that now they're doing it through animals yeah they are so you know one of the most accurate tests now to use is called the carbon isotope ratio test and what that's able to do is differentiate between natural testosterone which all men and women have in their body and foreign testosterone because there's a different carbon atom in that testosterone because it's made from a plant instead of an animal there's now you know Leeson research supply companies i don't think it's approved for use but there's animal-based testosterone floating around which has the potential to possibly defeat a carbon isotope ratio test because it has the same carbon atom as natural testosterone does is there any hesitation in talking about these things because you worry that you might educate cheaters no i don't think so i think you know I've always found that you know your credibility Rises when you're forthright about what's going on and because on the other side of things you know the sciences you know looking at these things and always coming up with new tests I think something that's fact I just read it today and we do this in our program as well is there was in cycling they will freeze samples both urine and blood and keep them for years at a time and cycling just recently went back and retested some of the frozen urine and blood from a few years ago for a new drug would say just developed a test for and they were able to catch a guy from a couple years ago that had used it we're going to do that in UFC as well so even if you know there's a new drug out there that you know scientists chemists are saying there's no test for potentially a couple years down the line when there is a test for it we'd have the ability to go back and test that now maybe that athletes no longer with the UFC or no longer competing at all anymore but you know there's still reputation and legacy at stake wow that's crazy so the UFC is gonna have like a giant meat locker filled with old blood and pee yes laboratories will have that yeah wow that's uh that's fascinating stuff but doesn't it well there's a chain of evidence issue with that isn't there was just sitting around in some sort of a lab somewhere what is it means yeah they'll be secure you know freezers where there is a chain of custody that goes along with each sample so outside that freezer will be guard the paperwork now but they're very lot of laboratories are very secure laboratories yeah try to get in them before the tough you're signing off your life to get in one of those things but no so there's the chain of custody will be good you know going on indefinitely on those things so so far as you know this hasn't been approved where people haven't used this animal-based testosterone yet i believe is being used now you believe it is yeah but it came to you out of nowhere yeah i got i remember the job we came to you out and it like yeah you're just listening and boom that's the homerun that people remember because it wasn't thought about ahead of time was just listening to the looking and you know when you're roasting people listening is also looking like taking a good look at assessing exactly what's been put him fine you uh when you were doing the prison thing you talked to the guy and you said you look a combination of a child at a child molester yeah yeah you're the rare everything looks like a child and a child molester at the same time and he did you know it wasn't like you know he did yea el de there i just said try to say out loud what people normally would say behind people's backs hence the karate no offense I do remember early instances of hecklers before I knew anything about roasting is just a comedian you know usually I'm seeing you know on the road or Jersey you know or you had a lot of characters and in the audience I remember you know a few times people taking swings at me or just walking on stage I was working with rich Voss at a firehouse you know I'd only been doing comedy a year or two and I opened for him at some sort of fundraiser at a firehouse and I was about five minutes into my routine Saturday night these firemen are in their firehouse there's this is you know this is before there were any rules to anything as far as you know and just just they kept telling me make fun of Larry make fun of Larry he loves it make fun of Larry and I don't know who Larry is and you know of course Larry would turned out to be the biggest asshole on the planet who doesn't love it at all and he literally was gigantic and walked up on stage and took the microphone out of my hand put it in the mic stand and said you're done wow you know was the audience laughing before that I don't remember I'm sure they weren't laughing enough you know I just remember being so hard and it just builds up your you have to have thick skin and you got to be able to like stare you got to have confidence that you know you're on the right you
