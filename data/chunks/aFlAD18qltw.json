will you go through all three of those no okay we know one other ones for you okay guys you wanted to good figure out how much I think these are 270 milligrams of caffeine if you drink three of these Jamie that would kill you right okay you know wouldn't kill you fuck you up I thought you walked in with three coffees I was like yeah okay you're gonna die like SIA what is for you hopefully we won't need both Wow I don't know I've drank both of them before Nichelle which is like 500 plus milligrams I'm addicted to coffee though man I will just drink it when I'm I don't even need a high I'll just drink it I love the smell of it it's so good in the morning man oh that's the best and I I love it with cream I love it black I love espresso I love it all see I I got rid of drinking the whole coffee I'm now an expresso drinker really two shots in the morning a double shot a double shot and then like a couple hours later another I'll do like eight double shots throughout the day because to me that's better than drinking one coffee yes but it's not it's not it's actually apparently espresso has less caffeine in it than coffee does even though it seems like it has a lot it doesn't what you have to drink more shit yeah stays like shit but it's definitely an acquired taste I enjoy it but it's one of the rare things I drink is that big and I'm holding my finger up like yeah - in two inches yeah it's that it's two inches and it'll take me 10 15 minutes drink it for an expresso yeah it should be like a slow guy so slow I like like a gentleman pinkies out there's only one way to do it with these fat Neanderthal fingers cuz if you're holding that little tiny ya know you can't get your whole hand in there like a man drinking an expresso right it's like a beer stein now about rhino horn you cannot look tough drink I'm an expert but I drink mine in like three seconds - you just go to town and then I go to the gym like I do that - one time I I drank five I have an espresso espresso maker and I put five capsules in there and I fulfilled a mug up like a coffee mug and I ran four miles know this fucking animal through the hills agos being chased by wolves you're just Holley chasing you I was like why drink so much so what is espresso at what does it say there Jamie okay coffee brewed see but it all is all depends on the company because Starbucks is extremely caffeinated yeah see Starbucks is way up the chart look at it there Starbucks tall is like closing in on 200 and what it looks like about 270 yeah somewhere in the range of two hundred and 70 milligrams caffeine but that's a coffee that's not right expresso coffee it would be better to go to Starbucks and get a tall coffee that there's an espresso see how low it is it's below 100 yeah so that's why I'm drinking so many oh so when I drink five I guess I think I paid five hundred million which is basically less than drinking two of these things so yeah these caveman nitros these are shit yeah I live off these goddamn things they're responsible for half my productivity basically I'm too chickenshit to go on adderall so I just I just drink this stuff there's nothing wrong with coffee I'm scared at all but people admit they're alert they're addicted to coffee and everyone's like ah me too if you go dude I am so addicted to Adderall they're like okay Joe I'm not like you you're gonna think I'm lame but til five years ago I didn't even know what adderall it was no I think you're smart like I did you like all my friends in Houston they did it and I asked my friend like I text them and I go hey man you got what's your a D and he goes yeah we got adderall I'll say what are you dressed to go to your house like literally he thought I was talking about adderall and then he explained to me like when you're in a club and you want to stay up and you want to stay like energized you take adderall and I was okay but I I don't drink so I can stay up till three four o'clock in the morning be fine what's fascinating about adderall is what they've essentially done is taken in an amphetamine and made it so that if you prescribed it for a condition right like they give it to people ad DS one right whatever the fuck that means and it's very debatable whether or not you have it or don't have everybody here think I have it for sure if it is real if it's real I have it but they give you adderall yeah it's just fucking speed and because it's a medication that you give to somebody who has supposedly has a condition and by the way I'm not diagnosing you if you're out there you're getting frustrated with me right now just listen to me it's fucking speed maybe you need speed maybe you're that person that needs speed maybe you do need it legitimately as a medication but there's a fuckload of people that are just doing speed so by somebody giving you speed is supposed to slow you down so you won't have a DD is that the reason they say legit if you have the legit a DD look I am not doubting that some people have 100 bucks I have worse than I have yeah there's a spectrum right with everything but for some people when they take adderall or similar type of substances it actually lets them focus and they can they can actually be on track so by speeding it up somehow it focuses at it I think I don't know in the system it's I think the idea is that it's proof that their system is wired wrong which is why when you give them that speed they can send her out and mellow out my friend my friends a doctor and I was talking to him and I used to you know just pop by to say what's up and he goes hey man just to let you know the more you go to a doctor the faster you'll die and I go what yes he's like I just want to know yeah yeah he says the more you go to us you come to us the faster you'll die I was like what are you talking about cuz a lot of doctors are crooked and they'll give you something for what you think you got and then after that wears off they have to give you something else so now you just keep filling yourself with stuff to fix the other thing that was wrong and he goes some some doctors are not good people and he goes the more people go to doctors the faster they die put it in point my mom beat breast cancer twice right and my dad's never been to the doctor he's 75 years old never been to the doctor once because he's like well soon as you go to doctor they tell you something wrong you die you know literally yeah but if you have cancer you should go to a fucking well he didn't have cancer my mom did right but if he had cancer he should go to a fucking I don't think he would go even if you had yeah he's just my mom beat it twice and she still here yes yes in the second time she didn't even tell me she had it doesn't your dad want to beat it if he gets it yeah my dad's kind of dudes like hey I've been through a lot I'm fine like he's he hates going to the doctor don't only time he went to the doctor he had a back problem and I said like if it's all doctor what have you met a good doctor like a doctor that he likes like a guy who plays golf with or some shit like my dad my dad is not social it's not no no no I'm totally weird you're so social I totally opposite like my dad's story is crazy like he you know you went through segregation he got a PhD in nuclear physics Wow oh yeah my dad's a genius vibe shit by out there talking shit failure cuz you're a success at it so he's gotta go alright yeah yeah you know he's the one that told me to drop out of college really yeah I played football for the how did he say it though he said you need to drop out of college you're not smart Michael you need to drop out of college chase your dreams oh no no no he's like my dad's whole thing is I got a PhD in nuclear physics I know what wanting to be in school is and you don't want to be in school and you you got a personality go do that but you're dumb like he would say that my parents were not supportive they were just not supported like my mom wanted me to be a doctor but she knew I wasn't bright enough to be a doctor so like my dad said you got to drop out I see I don't think you're not bright enough to be a doctor I think you're not interested in being a doctor now see cuz I see how you pursue stand up and show business you're you're a bright ambitious guy you just don't want to be operating on people that are on anesthesia at the fucking headlamps on and shit and rubber gloves covered with blood get though I don't like I don't want nobody dying on me that would be the wars having somebody die while you're working on them and then you got to go tell them hey man sorry my bad you know oh the pressure of those people Jamie was he was telling me yesterday about the guy who's the EMT who sees tell me tell me what you told me he said he said he was listening to the podcast we did with Lewis J Gomez about people getting head injuries and he has been doing I believe for like 15 years orso like doesn't do it every single day because you don't work every single day but on a three day basis or so every day he works he sees at least one person dead from a head injury whether it's an elderly person there's slipped on ice something people fall and hit their heads oh yeah like that's why please folks if you're listening to me and you want punch somebody and knock them out please don't do it just go to a gym get your frustrations out don't fight on the street you could kill somebody or you can get killed even accidentally even if you really don't hate the guy that much you punch him in the face go unconscious their head hits the ground people die all the time I mean I've told the story about when Kevin James used to work as a bouncer in Long Island a guy that he was working with punched a guy and killed him or Hillary yeah Kevin Kevin wasn't there but he knew the guy and the guy accidentally killed a drunk guy drunk I was coming at him he punched him I guess I don't know the whole story but that shit happens all the time I've seen guys and it's not about the punch though it's about when they hit their head you're getting hit by the world yeah think about that thing of the world just drop on your head that's what it's like your body mass bouncing off a completely especially concrete there's no give so your head just a clock it sounds horrible why listen to someone's head bounced off concrete is one of the scariest fucking sounds oh it's horrible even if you do it to somebody and you wanted to hurt them when you hear their head bounced off concrete you're like oh shit like that's not as simple as like you punched them you punched them and then you know whatever they weigh 190 pounds with all the mass of grass all their mass and gravity pulling them towards the ground with nothing slowing it down but meat and head bang bone I shoulder that reminds me when I was 10 years old I was sitting on the curb and this is the first time I saw death in real life from a head injury I was sitting with my friend on the curb and a guy was driving a motorcycle and he was speeding up and down the street and right on iris wood in Houston Texas he's flying down a car pulls out and he hits it packed into anywhere helmets so he literally flew up in the air and landed about 20 feet from us his head hit first oh and explode like a watermelon and this is like I was 10 years old watching this so the next morning you know the police come my parents gave me to tell me don't look at it the put III go out there the next day it's just blood stains everywhere and his wife is picking up his hair that's stuck to the concrete and I remember it so vividly I was next door neighbor was Eric and we were sitting on the curb watching this lady pick up her husband's hair that was stuck in and that's the first time I ever saw death and it was and it was a gnarly death - it was like that faces of dead stuff like it was bad it was bad I never rode a motorcycle because of that yeah there's no there's not a lot of reasons to ride a motorcycle other than that's awesome yeah fuck fucker danger I took motorcycle safety classes and then two of my friends wiped out one of them got hit by a car and one of them fell going around a corner and fucked his shoulder up i I after that accident probably about six years later you know when three wheelers would be back yeah and my friends same friend that was on a car we were three willing and and where I grew up there was bunch of ditches so we're going and he thought he could go down in the ditch and come up the other side but I think he forgot that it's flat on the bottom of real ditches and so literally we're going and we hit the bottom and I flew up and literally half my face was like just wrecked I was in a hospital and it's and we didn't have helmets at that tars and because we're young and dumb and just wanted to like stupid stupid stupid - twice you shouldn't like when you let boys just wander around it's never good it's never - dumb shit that they do that they think is okay let's try this hey take those fireworks and stick them in this tree this old rotted down tree let's blow it up and the problem is I think I think today parents at least we know more I feel we tell but like our parents at least my parents they didn't really give me guidance you know they were kind of like I figure it out on your own mine too yeah and that was that generation though yeah yeah like my parents is the parents that didn't tell you they loved me till I was 29 and I forced them to yeah that's different yeah my parents time Oh my stepdad hippies I don't know I may be in a good way and a good really nice people yeah yeah man that they didn't tell me shit those like what to do tell us on why you grade so bad like Oh what the fuck do I do tell me someone someone but they've worked man you know like when and you have like if you have a full-time job and the wife has a full-time job and you're raising children man how much time does that really leave I mean I don't get home until six seven like when you get out of work at five by the time you get home the kids been home from school for three hours already exhausted they just want to eat and go to sleep yeah you're not learning anything about each other for like five days a week well I that's my my mom worked for my dad so I got to see my mom a lot but it was a type of relationship where when I was growing up my mom station my dad's black I guess there wasn't that hey we love you I mean I knew they loved me but they didn't ever say that's it and the only reason they said it is because I was dating a girl at the time and they used the I love you think all the time and I thought that was very strange because I've never heard people just say it all that hey I love you I love you I love you so I called my dad and I was like hey I love you and he goes and he hung up like literally he got like kind of like he was just like okay you know it's all right cool and then he hung up and then now after I got married and have a kid now we say it I love you all the time you know so cuz I don't want my son to grow up wouldn't know I love you it's just this is different time for them man it was a different time it's a foolish insecurity because if you say you love you if you say I love you to someone um either they love you back and it feels great or they don't you don't hang out with them I reserved it for people that I love and usually they love you too yes you're there's something wrong with your wiring these are looking at it wrong you know yeah I know I just never happened to me Joey I told somebody I love them and they said nothing it can happen is it dudes clam up sometimes tell friend you love them hey I Love You Man yikes I grew up in Nebraska but I think it's also a young dude thing too when you're young you're macho you don't want to say I love you to another dude now sure when you get older like actually if you live in Nebraska yeah I'm just kidding Nebraska don't get uptight somebody sent me a box in Nebraska t-shirts like a shit 100 once like a listen something wearing that oh my my wife's father is from Nebraska is he yeah despised any those spots they used to suck they don't suck as much anymore I mean the Internet really I mean what's there to do in Nebraska let's be serious like in pheasant hunt I think it's a good pheasant hunting coupon okay they got the corn Husker they got corn if you just want to be alone sort start a cult I think it's a good spot start out great yeah if you want to start a cult oh you got to live in an attractive climate you know I think that's why that's why boats that place know Arizona that everybody goes to Scottsdale no no the other one Sedona yeah that one that's the one where all the cult leaders go to how do you explain Waco then that's the armpit of Texas it is but it isn't he needs a dowel is pretty quick from ranch at Waco go check out a Cowboys game back bar yeah no I couldn't this whole cult thing I don't get it Sedona is a weird one right because it's all like crystals and healers it's all people looking to be spiritual they've given up on on traditional religion but they seem to need that sort of vibe yeah so they they get into like spiritual stuff and channelers and healers have you got it in that I knew it all day long are you what all about channeling broke I'm in a channeling yeah right no no I think we I really do believe and I've been believing this more and more lately though that our understanding of what our memory is is very limited and that the reason why people are scared of things some things is probably because there's some sort of genetic memory of someone that they knew like I bet your kid will have somehow or another that knowledge of that motorcycle accident and that fee there's I think that goes through DNA really yeah I do I think that's why kids are scared of monsters you know why is kids scared of monsters why are they scared of bullets or fires or you know why don't they're screaming they're scared of something that I was scared I've grown up know there's animals used to eat people yeah that's what I think I think monsters represent like Jaguars and shit like you going through the jungle try to get some water and you get jacked that's our ancestors all of our ancestors every single human being on this planet came from Africa all of us 100% of us everyone Absolution black white all of us got eaten all of our answers so get our DNA it's wired that's out there yeah what are you afraid of monsters in the dark those are cats man we got jacked by cats like all the time yeah yeah so that's why everybody scared of things under the bed what's in the closet they're hiding their cats big cats looking to get you I don't know about that this is very scary for a moment but I don't believe it men think that animals have instincts right look here's a perfect example we have instincts right but what kind of instincts animals have weird instincts like they all sniff each other's assholes yeah they all piss on spots where other animals did they don't nobody had to teach my dog how to do that my dog I got him when he was six weeks old and I've had him for two and a half years that motherfucker will sniff something and he see somebody peed on it he pees on it but he learned that from his he's learned from nobody know he learned that from his dog people like I'm over here he didn't know jack-shit so no I think it's in his DNA okay yeah I get that but what is the DNA like doesn't your DNA carry some traces of information on to your own children like what I notice in my children okay they share certain weird traits that I have that I don't fit like like obsessive-compulsive traits that I don't think they see because I don't really bring that home like especially the workout stuff and like some things that I really get kind of psychotic about martial arts stuff my middle daughter has that in a crazy way and I'm like oh okay this is me if I was a girl okay like if I was a little girl this is me like what is this my memory that's in her or is it do I have like some weird obsessive gene which it is because I see my son he's only 2 he just turned 2 but he makes facial expressions and looks like he does certain looks that I do and my wife goes he's acting like you right now do you think he's act like you because he sees you act like that oh yeah acting like you know because he knows in his head that that's how he's wired like that because when I watch it he doesn't not like a lot of this stuff he does I'd only I don't even do he just does like my mom I'll come over and she'll watch him she go you know he's just like you when you were this age and it's so weird yeah it's in the DNA it's in something right whatever it is whether it's in cellular memory DNA some sort of genetic information gets passed on but the parents to the child you could say that about athletics though like if you that's a little different though but it's in the DNA yeah it isn't but it's not an ethereal thing like a thought mm-hmm you know I mean yeah like set like here's one a fiddy of phobia or arachnophobia fear of snakes or spiders those have you ever seen anybody who has a well you were on fear factor with me oh my god that was that was the work I should say you were you made it out bro no do you remember seeing one episode one I was the pilot episode of the episode that's where I met you for the first 60 can you believe 16 what 2001 yeah what is that where it's eighteen years ago we met because that was that was right after 9/11 yes yeah right after in they flew us down and the first time I met you it was that saddle ranch and you're like wow that's dude this is later this way later when we did the new season of it in like 2011 yeah you tried to get me to eat that spider yeah it's bad bro dude dude that's not a normal and you just chomped it like a chance so this whole scene I'm acting like a little bee a little fearful you had to eat cheap saibra eyeball stuff which had to eat dude now those were disgusting yeah yeah did you eat it because I felt bad for you guys that was before I had hardened I've been hardened to the world guys were episode 1 season 1 it didn't seem right for me that you guys would have to eat these things and I didn't eat it I said all right if you guys needed all you two but they didn't show it like they wouldn't show it on television that I ate it because they didn't they like they didn't want it to look too easy yeah so weird but yeah oh my god I remember biting down into it and it kind of like burst yeah I didn't that retina then you had to kiss yeah you had to chew on that red and we had to eat three of them yeah they weren't good no they were horrible but you know it was surprisingly mild I ate a roach I'm not not bragging today I'm pleased like much this a roach even though it doesn't taste like much would you eat a roach is that part of the show yeah I was um it was a celebrity fear factor and um there was a young lady who was scared to eat a roach and she was gonna get eliminated from the show and so I said listen I'll make you a deal I'll if you do it I'll do it and she's like you will I go yeah I will and she wouldn't do it so she made the deal like like three worms she decided I'll eat three worm like we can go she ate three moms and so then I remember when I was on that show the question they would ask you in the survey is what's your fear of dying and I wrote down dying on the water cuz that would be my biggest fear is dying under water and so our last stunt was when they dumped us on the water and my friends still send me screenshots of that because that's when I had long here and I put a bunch of gel in it and they dumped me under the tank and literally it looked like a squid shoot oh my god you if you you could google it Google Michael yo for your fat and it's my friends will just screenshot that and they still play that to this day they still play that episode all of them they play them on different like truTV or something like that one of those I remember those I remember that when we were talking I'll go because you were what show were you on at that times radio you were on news radio that was a couple years earlier there you are look at that what happened yeah and okay so that see five Oh Michael yo cheap sciples so at the end at the end I go to Joe and I go hey man I can't do the last stunt look at that I can't okay so this is you talking to me Joe goes Joe goes hey I go Joe I'm not gonna be able to make it through this whole stunt I can't hold my breath for that long and you go I'll just make it look great for the camera I was gonna try to talk you into it but I wasn't good enough at it then I did I had to figure out how to talk people into it cuz I knew there's some people that were just psyching themselves out yeah in the smoker one-hour episode the guy that we thought I was going to lose oxygen yeah it's fucking system is having no oxygen and that's when they casted fear factor off a personality and then it just became a hot fest like if you're sexy of it it was also you know they kept ramping up the difficulty of stuff like the last season scared the shit out of me when they were launching a car through a moving train and an explosion happens in the car it was like what you're gonna kill somebody look and when I came up to your I think it was the last season y'all were doing something with a donkey dong don't you come come that's what got us cancelled yes yes because I remember showing up at Joseph's come here yo was gonna quit when I showed up that day they brought the paper into my trailer and they told me what it was gonna be I don't think I knew about that one before some of them I at noon about knew about before but I don't think I knew about that one I think when they brought that in I had no idea and I was like you can't do this I'm like no one's gonna do it first of all they're all gonna quit but what was hilarious is I'm sitting there next to you watching them drink this dude how about an intern how to drink it an intern had drinking I think they only got like a hundred dollars what for what well it was like part of the thing is that they would have to test it when when they would like say here's some fear factor info so I'd say if you had to eat like kidneys yeah right how many how many kidneys can someone eat in a minute you know like how much how much meat can you actually like consistently dried meat can you consume mm-hm and so what we had was certain interns they would volunteer for it and they would get like an extra hundred and something dollars and I would always give him money to I was giving a couple hundred bucks on top of it they would they would eat whatever the fuck it was and they would determine all right well Mike usually can put it down like like like no one and if he could only get through three and then some other producers would come and go fuck this we're being pussies make it me for like for you guys are crazy and this was like the debate the big debate on the set would be like how much blood should they drink one gallon one gallon of blood like they never drink blood but you know I'm saying how many horse dicks they never ate a horse dick but they did eat like what it was six and elk dicks and deer dicks but the donkey come was the worse oh yeah and I even remember after shit you were like yeah I think the show's over after this like dan/erin I think they didn't inherit they heard any other countries though oh did it really yeah so you could get it like and I think it's like Dutch and so it's like you hear you hear us talk in English but then they have Dutch subtitles yeah that that was that was such so stupid it's so Doug are you surprised how stupid people are to go no because I think people like look it's an experience I'm here for the experience I'm gonna have some fun this is crazy but when you get to donkey come you can't be rude you know you got a donkey this donkey that been the donkey come is like an advantage of their need for fame in a weird way no you are but hey they gonna give you that's the game and I remember you showing it to me first and was in this large glass container and they and it wasn't a little they had to drink no no we had to drink a lot yeah it was like the aforementioned rhino horn yeah no it's even more offensive donkeys are they're not fertile look at there it is oh that's it yes so that come is useless it's not just come but imagine it's like it's it's come that could never even be babies okay it's now shit but I remember when y'all used to do this is disgusting I remember I used to do stunts it was actually a delicate like people in other countries actually ate it sometimes sometimes yeah like balut so that's not that's just being no that's just being me okay that's no other country is doing that just for fun I gave up on that whole this in other countries this is considered gave up on that a long time ago yeah you had to push the envelope on that now one of the things that made things gross smell wise was actually really expensive cheese they would go to this expensive was if a full marjorie in what do they call them what do they call one of those cheese places yeah that's like italian for cheese for my homage if for Maserati sure isn't it French to someone oh yeah Jamie's my that's my translation but anyway this cheese that we would use was disgusting it smelled so bad but apparently it tastes really good if you're into that kind of cheese like Bourdain was really indistinct jeez like he would talk to me about it like with passion like that just the fucking stinkier the better like disgusting smelly cheese and the taste is fantastic I'd be like I would think that the smell will turn taste bad absolutely okay I don't know it's like one of those things where I guess you catch like the right vibe like you're going in with the right attitude there is no attitude if it stinks fuck that dude he's anything that smells cheese and they would squeegee it off into a blender no I mean they blend it up with the other stuff like worms and shit it would make the worms taste horrific or smell horrific oh so you were just messing with the smell sense so it could make it seem like it was worse than making it worse because it smelled worse so it was making more you smell it but whew people just start retching it was it's a ridiculous fucking thing it's a ridiculous thing like the show is really silly no but I love that these people wanted to be famous oh no me too bro but I was because how it happened I was in Austin Texas and there was an ad in the paper that goes hey have you ever done anything adventurous and I was like no let me go in for this case I was a radio DJ out there and at this radio station so I go in and then Mikey they called him the chimp he was the casting person yes and literally two weeks later three weeks later I'm in Hollywood shooting this thing and then I meet you and then I remember going up to you because I was in awe it was the first time in a Hollywood okay and I knew you from newsreels yeah how do you do it and you go just fucking beat yourself you can be successful and that's what you're doing right now just fucking being yourself are you doing - we're trying ridiculous piece of advice just be yourself good luck that's all you need bro that's it just believe in your dreams make a vision board just trying to get me on this base I'll just be you all right but that is the right advice especially if you want to be an entertainer if you can figure out how to be yourself as long as yourself is actually something interesting and if it's not working yourself yeah and then you even said that about acting usually I remember specifically say act it's not hard it's just you yourself and you play that emotion and I was like oh that sounds easy like if they're easy in comparison to stand up in some ways but it's not like a disrespect like the kind of shit that like Daniel Blake Daniel day-lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio what yeah when they when they get into a fucking role and you like god damn that guy just own that shit like they get into what I'm talking about like sitcom sitcom acting yeah sitcom act and they were hiring you too yeah so it was a slightly dumbed down version of me who was into slightly more conspiracy theories than me when I was on Newsradio that's all I was yeah that was basically me like they wrote a lot of that conspiracy shit in after I talked to them about like JFK and fucking you know UFOs and stuff you believe in UFOs oh my god yeah yeah see I believe in there's other other life forms out there I don't think they're coming here they might thing they might well why not think it just because here's it here's one thing I do believe most people are full of shit you know it comes to like most of their stories like it's it's hard to find a person that could just tell you what happened based on what they really remember people want to jazz things up and they wanna add salt and pepper yeah they have sex with me don't they don't necessarily tell you the truth they tell you what they think is gonna be an engaging story that kind of represents the truth maybe especially when it's a weird thing like you saw something in the sky what did you really see how long did you look at it for how many seconds was it well I mean here's the problem I have with UFOs it I believe there are UFOs but I don't think they're coming here I mean because that means they're tech first of all if they're coming here that means their technology is far way more advanced than ours right so why would they care if people saw them they would show up if I was an alien and I was that far ahead of us I would lay in that bitch right in the middle of Times Square and be like what we require why would you do that but why wouldn't I why in fields where nobody can see us are you aware of how we treat uncontacted tribes yes to a point but the point but what I'm saying is if you're that power advanced they know if they're coming here they know they're they're way smarter than that's right because they've traveled here right and we don't even know other from far distances we can't even imagine and they're here they don't have to hide it's just like they do it because they have to hide or do you think maybe they do it because we can't handle it because we can't handle it why would they care if we could handle it or not because here's the problem whenever any civilization has ever encountered a civilization far superior to them the results have always been catastrophic every single time every time Europeans have invaded North America every time the Spanish visited the Mexicans every time that this has happened it's been a disaster and this is human beings if there was something that came down here from another planet was so unbelievably sophisticated that they could travel through vast distances in space and had insurmountable impossible technology that we would look to it for all of our answers it would become our new daddy it would completely disrupt all of our governments it would disrupt all of our religions it would disrupt every single belief system we have and people would fall apart they wouldn't know what to do psychologically it would be devastating look I'm not a doctor a psychologist but I know most people would not be able to handle it I understand that but why would they care because that's my whole point because why would they care about because it would be affecting our culture it wouldn't care but why wouldn't they care well why they care we care about animals bro there's a reason we have wildlife protection agencies we have that because we care about animals and animals don't even know we're a thing okay if you're a deer living in the forest and you're 2 years old you might not have ever even seen a person you even know what the fuck we are but we're trying to keep those deer alive we spend billions of dollars every year protecting them we do that because we care about wildlife if we cared about a rare monkey that we found in Indonesia in this or some strange monkey we would do whatever we could to make sure that monkeys populations thrived if there was a way to help them I mean that's one of the reasons why zoos exist they take rare animals they try to breed them in captivity and but we're also sharing the same earth well they may be they look at the universe that way okay nuclear civilizations like our civilization I mean our civilization is a very dangerous one because we're we're a bunch of semi hairless monkeys with nuclear weapons I mean we're fucking nuts bro oh yeah we're obsessed with sex we jack off to our phones where we're taking pills to keep our dick hard we're all on speed these are we're at and we lie we lie about shit we lie about things that people did to us we pretend people think did worse things we pretend that we didn't do things to people we lie about stealing we lie about money we lie about all kinds of things I mean people are so so you're thirsty you're thinking aliens are thinking about all that before they come down of course they would why wouldn't I guess I'm coming from a human point of view where we don't give a shit about anything there's a thing that's not true we do give a shit about things that's why when you go to the Galapagos Islands you're not allowed to take your shoes that you walked around Los Angeles and walk around the Galapagos Island because people have done that and they've gotten seeds from their shoes stuck in the sand over there on the ground over there and then new plants grow that are invasive species that we're worried about ecosystems that we're really a humans that's we were worried about invasive species and when new species get introduced to new ecosystems it's like we were just talking about this yesterday Everglades like people are doing whatever the fuck they can to get the pythons and the Africans they these assholes have released pythons and there's a real fucking redneck Jurassic Park going on in the middle of Florida yeah you know we care I lived in Miami man and at the time I lived in Miami talk about you did radio out there right yeah I 100 miles after a few factors after fear factors it landed me that big gig radio was radio back there oh yeah it was it was like huge man but I remember they had these lates and if you go back like ten years ago and look up Florida people were just jogging around lakes getting snack by alligators yeah like just alligators did not give a damn that they were just snatching people yeah and I was like why are people jogging like I like stop jogging well we definitely don't jog near the water no and that's the thing I believe like eight people within six months got snatched just jogging my real Oh a hundred percent probably about eight to ten years ago just jogging I didn't know that there was that many deaths ever from Allen oh yeah they were getting snatched one of my favorite ones was a guy who was running from the cops near Miami and he was in a stolen car parked his car on a bridge jumped off the bridge and landed on an alligator I'll get a jacked him in front of the cops oh and they were just sitting there going well there you go guilty jumps off the bridge splash that would be this oh my god - oh that guy didn't even notice - no last minute no that's what I'm saying like that happens in Florida at that time that is so crazy that is such a big thing that eats deer and shit look at it opens its mouth on him but meanwhile it tries to get away from people well what's interesting the dude didn't even speed up yeah oh really tired - fuck these things man fuck these things but the craziest thing is we were showing it yesterday that pythons eat them alligators whole but now dude one Python ate this fucking big-ass alligator and it blew its body apart apparently another alligator came along while it had it in its body and tried to eat the Python and so then it was like this disaster of a Python with an alligator inside of it with no head yeah but the whole thing was that this Python and ate the alligator and then once they eat it they can't move because they got a fucking 900 pound alligator but you love that shit I can't take out oh yeah I know you do you do problem with I just I love animals eating other animals I think it's important to recognize that we're we're we're very insulated from what the fuck is going on by cities yes and that in houses and cities and even towns even if you have a town it's rare that a fucking wild predator makes its way into your town but man that's the whole rest of the world that's the whole world including the ocean everywhere is all just predators and prey predators and prey predators and prey we've figured out a way to instil but-but in insulation the problem is when we rice elated from it we neglect it as an aspect of nature we put it in some weird box like oh my god this is weird no that's not weird that's normal yeah that's normal life normal life is big things eating a little earthy and you don't respect it got it really don't respect it when you don't see it like yeah my parents want to go to Africa on a safari I'm like man you can have that yeah I would go if I got one of them like Jurassic Park mobiles that they have with it's all around you say these people are just in regular Jeeps where they open their jeeps where Lions just walk about like how dumb are you and most the time nothing happens no most most of it but it could be one or two times where if you're in it you know years ago a woman who worked on Game of Thrones she was there on vacation and she got pulled out of her fucking car right she rolled down the window to take a picture and the cat came and snatched her out of the car but don't you think people kind of like that deserve it like people that roll down Windows and not safer like that's like people jumping in the pit at the zoo the other day well they take a selfie the roll down the windows thing I think is really just it's what we're talking about that you're not around it in there so you don't understand what it is but do you have to be around it to know hey these are wild animals and think they can get away with shit if they've never had anything happen to them like I've never been punched oh this is this this is a cheetah cheetahs are actually not there they're actually very curious and they're not dangerous to people so this one has no idea this thing is in his back seat no he's filming it oh he's filming it so he's not moving don't move I think so man I think the move is don't move you don't want to scare them you definitely don't want to go fucking rip your face off they don't have laws they don't have claws like a cat does they're more like a dog yeah you know they're a weird animal they're like a weird cat dog thing you know they're super super fast like I've never seen one run in real life but apparently people who I know that have seen and say you can't believe how fast it is you know one thing that blew me away I was reading about it that hippopotamuses kill more people year than all the animals combined all of them all of them yeah all of them and it's just like people just like don't respect hippopotamuses in they're fast and they're strong and they'll rip you apart they're like a giant pig yeah they're in the pig family look about cousin to a pig or some shit yeah and they're vegetarians yeah like ditches killing people estimated 500 people per year and they kill 500 a year they're aggressive and they're very sharp teeth and not only that man people think there's 750 kilograms what what is that dude 7 pounds that's more than 5,000 pounds at 2.2 times that so oh my god that's that's well people don't respect because they think they're slow too so when they see them I think they run like 24 25 miles per hour we're like a hundred person that runs 100-yard dash in the Olympics I think average around like 29 to 30 miles per hour hippos rode 19 my own age so that's still fast yeah you're barely getting away well that's me I probably can't run 19 miles now I know I couldn't I'll probably get eaten fuck can you imagine you're like 20 yards away from this thing like ah it's not gonna but and then it just runs up on you well they say if you ever get chased by an alligator - the thing is - Jew come go left and go right that pictures terrifying mom scares the shit out of me that scares the shit out of me I mean look at that guy's he's he's he's launching himself in the air trying to get away not look at that yeah they chase after boats in the water they swim fast yeah they try fuck you 500 people a year dude hippos husband sees hippo bite out wives heart what oh my god imagine wife falls into the water and that you see the hippo rip open a ribcage oh I would be a hippo Punisher I would go back to Africa every year and kill out every one every one of them I'd be responsible for hippo extinction they'd be like you can't do that a bike but I'm gonna that may stop me don't I'm killing all the hippos why not I'm killing all the snakes for if everybody anyone knew got killed what the first day that something gets killed by a fucking Python in Florida when a human gets jacked we should send in the Marines Jesus go through the fucking swamp and kill them all just like they're the enemy you just get a giant line of human beings go through and kill those fucking serpents they're in the Bible okay yeah they're in the Bible snakes elite your baby they will I mean are they cocky with monsters living in your fucking neighborhood is there any purpose of them though yeah they killed rats but the problem is in that area it's not established for them so there was this rich ecosystem of mammals and reptiles you're talking about Everglades right now yeah okay it used to be there were some snakes like hot melts and stuff like that and there was alligators but then there was like marsh hares and raccoons and skunks gone they're all gone there's they're gone there's nothing left there's just anacondas look event pythons and Nile crocodiles now if this got another one eating a fucking well let me ask you something and be honest with me if that guy got eaten like a guy that actually tracks reptiles do you feel sorry for like if you put yourself in harm's way yeah because I want that guy to be out there look into an eye of a snake and you go oh this thing doesn't give a fuck about anybody it's like it doesn't I was watching this video of a crab and it's a crab a mother crab just sitting there eating its babies it had like thousands of babies all around it that had just hatched like a couple of weeks ago that's just sitting there eating its babies and I'm like yeah yeah fuck you yeah you're going in the boiling water and I'm gonna crack you open I can hear if I heard him scream when they go in a bullring oh yeah I don't think they're really screaming I think it's probably air escaping their body look at this cunt they're kids this is crazy I was I was at a friend's house and they caught crabs and they would throw him it and I think they screamed man I think it's like vocal cords but this video Jamie for people to just listen it says monster red crab eats babies the dark side of nature yeah she's an ass I'm telling you Joe they make a noise when you put him in a hot boiling pot of water what is that bottom of her she's got a charcoal briquette stuck under her doesn't that look like one of them little babies go they come right back out is so gross she's such an asshole she just sitting there eating her kids like that anybody would give a fuck about crabs oh well I'm gonna sound like I want him to go extinct but that's one animal that we in our house kill ourselves and no one has a problem with it it's like if they brought him a rabbit and you gotta throw it in the water like fatal attractions it's like that was the only way to keep nobody would eat wrap no no no no and we throw them in like a lot alive most the time most people even bother take it off the lobsters yeah and lobsters we do not give a shit get in there get in a fucking bug was crazy is though this whole animal kingdom thing but one thing that scares me that you were doing when I walked in is playing these fucking shooter games dude that game is a real problem Jamie and I have been going to war for the last what two months in this star like two months ago yeah maybe like that time I'm in full-blown addiction mode now what is the threat like I what's the thrill yes do you see us we're all sweaty and adrenaline yeah no great ass time yeah I walked it looks like I just finished working out it was like crazy Jamie now we're going to war we go to war we talk a lot shed - we go to war I tried it's fun it's fun we kills me talk shit to me it's rough you're like god damn it he got me fuckers is that a game where people can go online and play with you - no we don't help people we jump online this is the game this is the game yeah dude it is a fun ass fucking game it's called quake champions okay and people right now listen and going god dammit he's talking about but me and Jamie have been and and Jeff are their employee been playing this fuck see okay see this isn't bad because they're like characters like I was playing one where it's like human beings like and when you shoot somebody like I got scared when you get scared to go into the next room because you're really that nervous like it freaks me out these shooter games are too realistic I grew up with Frogger dude this is like you're always in like some sort of a castle yeah and the the people that you're shooting against they don't look anything like a person they look like a cartoon character but the graphics are sensational but more importantly like the gameplay is very precise and you you have to have like real hand-eye coordination and skills like you learn things like tactics you learn how to move around maps you learn how to control resources controlling resources is giant like that thing that guy just picked up yeah that's like a hundred and seventy five health and you want to get all the armor that you possibly can then you also want to be like clever about weapons choices because you're always engaging at different distances different kinds of fights you like sometimes you're stuck in like a corridor and sometimes you know you're in an area where they can't shoot you but you can shoot them if you use the right weapon man you need to bring back to old-school Atari that one red button that ran oh that one red button did everything on the joystick you never killed a guy with a railgun once you kill a guy with a railgun you'll understand wait I don't want to kill a guy with a real person I mean I know why you do it if you jumps at me and I shoot him in there with a railgun I ki shot me in the face of the day with a rocket and I was like dude in the mug I was like in the mug it like right in my face and I exploded like my whole screen just becomes a big red splatter my fuck it's fun I can't handle it man it's too much for me oh what the older i get i'm just a puss man i need a man up i used to be so aggressive you're a big dude you're strong that's why nobody messes with me because of it ya know what it's like it's like like like you you like fight and all that stuff i can't even like if somebody punched me in the face today i don't know how would react like I don't know I used to be a bouncer at clubs I play college football like I was a tough dude now after all apart a dude could get you a gym no no I'm in shape but I mean like a fight gym no no no I never fight a little bit no not to fight people why do you so you don't worry about it I never worry about it okay well then don't worry about because I'm at home at 8:30 I saw you at the improv the other night nobody's gonna jump on stage I'm talking about family oh man you never know people crazy has anyone to do jumped up on the WWF and attacked who did he attack he attacked Brett hiring his speech that's crazy yeah always gotta be like how old is you know makes do you want any stroke survivor so fucked up and the guy tackled them yeah Jesus but Joe seriously you think anybody's gonna jump on stage when you're on some dude and could either add you would fucking kill him no there's there's a lot of people that can kill me you don't get good but I I just don't see me doing stand-up talking about family or love and a dude cuz I hate family I love I'm a jumper now it's that it's not rational no you're right a rational person wouldn't do that but you're not worried about rational people anyway okay so so say I started to go to a fight gym like where would I start at my mom what I do I would say you should try jujitsu cuz it's fun it's really good exercise and you'll learn some stuff okay you learn how to do it it's it's a technique based art where it's like say if if you like there's there's guys that I will do jujitsu sparring we call rolling okay there's guys that I will roll with that are weaker than me smaller than me and tapped me every time I roll with them and I'm a black belt okay like that's reality like if there's there's guys out there that 150 pounds that I could roll with that I know will tap me virtually every time we roll because their technique is sharper they train more often than I am they're more focused they're more in the groove but I also heard you say like a lot of your podcasts you've got to watch out who you train with because they might just try to hurt you that's all I need I need you got to go to a good school with good ethics because yeah a good school with good ethics they get rid of those guys you know do you know one in Studio City oh sure I'll get you ya know do it I want to learn there's a good spot just a little further than that in Tarzana ok Machado's where I got my black belt so John Jacques Machado I trained there sometimes and he used to have a place in Malibu but it closed down because of the fires but they they have an outstanding gym it's like one of the best in the country and it's in that area like as far as teaching yeah top notch like but there's a lot of really good jiu-jitsu schools now it's not like like when I started in 96 it was hard to find a good gym there was only like five of them in all of California right because it was just starting out I was like 93 is when jiu-jitsu sort of emerged in the public consciousness because the UFC and then they were gym started like popping a pop enough but I was really lucky there was like Hicks and Gracie's which is where I took my first class and then Karlsson Gracie's I thought they were like the same and the other one was closer so I just switched to Carlson's I didn't know shit you knows wipeout but and then there was a Machado's and then like a couple other places how long did it take you to get to a black belt like four years some guy took me a long time I was a brown belt for eight years but it was just because I wasn't training as much as I should have liked that you don't they don't give them away like you have to be a real black belt but besides what is somebody just watch instructors yeah and you do well no okay well everyone knows it's like like you know when a guy is fucking killing like he let's take like Theo von for example like Theo I love him he hit a groove some time ago whether it's two years ago or whatever it was and I remember being in the back of the store and I was like dude this motherfuckers on fire yeah he started hittin that groove that where you go and sit down you want to watch his set ya know and I think when that happens in jiu-jitsu it's the same kind of think I start talking about like - Mike has been tapping everybody he's just his jiu-jitsu so sharp and you're like man I'm gonna watch them roll and then you watch them only like - that pass that guard pass then guys start asking like how often you training I'm going five days a week now really yeah and I'm taking two privates block then you know like this guy is on the quest and you'll see a guy go from white belt to black belt in three years but they have to be super exceptional like really unyuu athletes unusual mindset unusual discipline it can happen most of the time like a garden-variety estimate is like 10 years is realistic white belt a black belt for a regular person if you really train hard and you really dedicate yourself but freaks can get there quicker like BJ Penn he won the mundi Isles which is the world championships after three years of training three years of training he was a black belt won the world shall be doing that to bj's a special guy though I just also got legs that are like arms he has leg dexterity like no one on the planet yeah I got chicken legs that's actually good is it really yeah you could cinch up triangles on people with chicken legs people everywhere there just think about it in terms of leverage guys with longer limbs like Roger Gracie is a perfect example he's a really tall long guy so when the best jujitsu players ever they can do things with those limbs that a shorter person can't do in terms of like leverage from joints and stuff like this like there's the advantages to every frame like there's a guy like who Samar Paul Hara is a famous like tank of a guys five seven two hundred plus pounds and just rips guy's legs apart and he uses this like short style to dive in on people's legs and get him in heel hooks and bars and rip their legs parties terrifying yeah and that that style heavily favors being built like a little tank whereas like that long like you are you're a tall long guy you would have like good Darce chokes good rear-naked good are good arm bars good triangles you would have lengthened leverage with that length especially with triangles because long-legged guys they can like sometimes a guy like me with short legs like I'll get my legs crossed yeah and I have to adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by triangle whereas you might be able to just close it up right there so you'll have like more opportunities for triangles because the length of your limbs have you would you have ever been at a point in your in your career when you were doing to just where you how would you have been in the UFC like at your prime like I have no idea I'd have no I would have had to have gotten way better like when I was fighting I was just kickboxing yeah I was kickboxing and first of all first it was Taekwondo and then with the kickboxing and by the time the UFC came around like on the ground I was useless or there's a straight white belt I would get ripped apart every day I would go to the gym and if I if I tap to anybody like if it was like a a week went by and I tapped one guy be like whoa I fucking tap to God yeah there wasn't that many people doing it you know so I was going with like there was a couple of white belts maybe and then there was like blue belts and purple belts and brown belts and those guys would always tap me guys so that's just how went for a long time when you're you know unless you're some kind of freak like some big-ass football player or some like super athlete you're probably not gonna be able to hold these guys off they're gonna they're gonna choke you now was it true you're gonna fight Wesley Snipes that was way later though way later that was a brown belt by then and I'd been doing a lot for beating him I don't know cuz we never did everybody there's a real martial artist I was real martial arts but he doesn't know jiu-jitsu the thing that must have been exciting though excited yeah cuz I was thinking like I knew that he was a real legitimate martial artist like he throws kicks and punches and it looks really good like he really does know his shit but I also know he never fought and there's a big difference between throwing kicks and and I haven't fought in a long time but I probably fought a hundred times yeah so I've been I've felt that nerves I know what that's like it'll be crazy as fuck to do it again that's what I was thinking I mean it'll probably scare the shit out of me but I think I know what to do like I think I know how to like get in there and start fainting and start giving some movement see how he reacts and then the worst case scenario is like I'm like in a scramble I'm gonna strangle this guy like this if this comes to a scramble yeah because the average person really doesn't know how helpless they are until a jiu-jitsu blackbelt grabs ahold of you and then you just go oh shit like I'm helpless because in a fight you really think like you might be able to punch a guy like maybe if he's from me and he's swinging at me and I'm swinging in him maybe I hit him first you really think that but there's no swinging if it's a jujitsu fight if you guys get into some sort of a tussle and that guy grabs you and trips you and boom and he's on the ground with his hand on your jacket and knee on your chest you're a dead man you're a dead man because there's no lucky shot yeah jiu-jitsu blackbelt is just gonna close the distance like that evil fucking crab and he's just gonna your fucking neck and there's no way you're gonna avoid it and there's no way you're gonna survive it you're just not going to that's why you don't fight people like like you can't fight people like I'm just you can't fight random people on the streets like when you're young that was the thing you could go to bars yeah feel like I had some friends that like to throw down when I was younger and I wouldn't go I was watching but good fee now it's kind of like you got to watch everybody because you don't know what kind of training they're doing like everybody's so educated on and it's so big right now well some guy fought off a guy in the subway that was attacking with a knife with some moves that he learned watching the UFC never even trained before he just knew what to do yeah he like knew what to do because he had seen guys like get the mount and drop ground-and-pound he like knew what to do based on watching it yeah I think it's good like when you mention it I think it's good just to learn so you would feel better about yourself in case danger comes yeah you want to be the person that gets to make the decision here's the thing right if you don't know how to fight and there's some drunk asshole who doesn't know how to fight either but he might come over and punch you in the face and some to punch you and he can hurt you or knock you out in front of your woman you want to be the one who gets to decide yeah if I'm in a situation and some guy and he's like reasonably close to my size and he's being an asshole he's drunk and he gets aggressive with me I can decide what to do with him mm-hmm like I can it gets I don't want to hurt anybody but I'm not gonna let you hurt me yeah and you get to decide like you don't want like you've we've all seen these 7-eleven fucking parking lot lights on YouTube or some asshole and both of them don't know how to fight but one guy might fuck that guy up he might kick him in the face while he's down you don't want to be that guy yeah but you don't want to be in that situation to definitely walk away whenever you can always we are so opposite because I've only been in one fight in my life it was in ninth grade playing basketball it was against a dude named Mitama like I'll never his name is Mitama Drake and I threw one punch and I hit him right in the face and he looks at me and goes what's up and I was like [Laughter] oh yeah we start playing bass thank God like that was it like literally I hit him as hard as I could if I could take a shot oh it was just like what's up I was like nothin nothin is up so that's the only bucket you back no wow no because I then I started you know oh you okay it's your ball yeah man yeah did not try to get you back I mean and then I I was there was a club in Houston named power tools that I used to make a bar no it was yeah it sounds like one shot was hardcore game Houston the gay bar was called Rich's at the time but I worked at power tools and I was a bouncer so that's when I was like 250 pounds you know you're a lot bigger when I met you oh yeah because I play college football for Arkansas so I played outside linebacker so I was just stop lifting weights or do you see a little bit no I'm all cardio now because yeah you know like trainers any trainer I work with since I got a big frame they're like well put some set no I want to stay lean right you know but that's good for old age to men you know Wow back problem like I'm 44 years old now yeah I'm a crazy dude to ramp flies 51 C or 55 zero do it it is so scary when you read stories about people just droppin dead do you like a writer age Luke Perry that's what I'm saying mainly my age well they said what what is the danger zone zone is like 45 to 55 with heart failure it's like creighton ah man dude I beat my body up I'm running that bitch until the fucks wheels fall off I'm always getting stem cells shots and I'm fucking running hills and lifting weight I still have heavy weights retarded yeah what do you do that word I said it again trying to get that rid of that word out of my vocabulary it just comes out sometimes why are you still lifting weights like heavy like that like what is it do for you well it does a bunch of things first of all if you want to train jiu-jitsu it's okay very good to be strong yeah it makes a big difference first of all for defense especially for defense you know like for offense for sure - but really you want to be able to defend you're like defending is you have to be strong but also you just like being bigger it helps yeah I like it yeah I like being able to pick up things I like the physical ability of being strong I like being in shape to being able to run for long distances I like knowing that I can go rounds on the bag like I'll do five hard rounds on the so you can run my knees a messed up I can't like get on a treadmill and run I can do like I've done the stem into me and it's helped out a lot but I'm still that dude that's on I'm like on this super fortunate I'm super passionate about my knee injuries I've had knee injuries but my meniscus I only had one meniscus scope on my left knee and wasn't terrible like I was back to full 100% function after that and my right knee it didn't I have a little baby tear that I got some stem cells shot into but I had both of them reconstructed there is yells were replaced but no problems they work they work great yeah I see I just need to I listen to you and it's like you always taking something and I'm like oh I got to find out what that is and now I just want to get in better shape I'm in shape but I it's when you get older it's just like tough it's just it just so he is writing it down like you have to do it do you keep a daily sketch it you have to do know I just wake up and go I I do have I wake up I work out like a cardio workout and then I do infrared sauna which has changed my life so you do life right every morning i infrared sauna for dowsing it's the best you sweat all that shit out you're like you feel great your skin glistens like I think it's actually like changed the game for me I have more energy now everything's better it's so good for your body they did a study that showed a 40% decrease in mortality mortality amongst all causes heart attack stroke cancer 40% decrease with people that were doing the song of four times well I will tell you this because the whole thing is everybody wants to feel young and when you were young the thing you did most was sweat and I feel like when I sweat it's just it's a it feels I don't know I just feel good sweating because they were mine's me when I played sports it reminds me even though I'm not doing on the you know I sweat a little on the treadmill but when I do that infrared sign it makes me feel great MA I think it's there's a bunch of shit going on with this - yeah for sure like it's good to feel good like you're sweaty but there's heat shock proteins your body actually produces anti-inflammatory properties it's really good for you it's really good for joint aches and all kinds like this I used to think of the Sun as being nonsense like what do you want you fucking lie asana for like what are you doing they're just getting hot yeah score capital look at that what kind of a sauna do you do though I do a regular song okay see superhot regular sauna telling you you need to try the infrared yeah you can yeah I mean but look it's all just about getting your body huh yeah like it's good to try to infrared I'm sure I'm sure it works great but this study the 40% decreased mortality that was with a regular stone so okay yeah yeah that's why I got a regular sauna cuz dr. Rhonda Patrick told me they'll come the studies that have been done have all been done with a regular sauna and she said there might be some benefit of for infrared sauna but I don't know what's published what does it see if there's a benefit see if this they could say what's the benefit to infrared something cook in my organs I don't even know it no I don't think so no I think it's great for just feel amazing after that's supposedly what happens right it gets deeper in your tissues yeah it's I remember us texting back and forth I was like you got it like if you do the infrared sauna for like a week it's a game-changer it's just sauna is - so I don't know I would like you to try regular sauna - how hot does the infrared get like a hundred and forty 140 that's finding the air though - it's a difference yeah it doesn't like you walk in and it feels it doesn't feel like it's that but that's microwave shit probably burnin up all my organs right now but I love it I like living in and feeling that super heat are you going there oh it feels so good love it yeah do you fuck with cold do you ever do like cry or anything I tried that once yeah and it was right after the infrared sauna or like try the cold it's just I don't know man it wasn't my thing what do you mean it wasn't my thing at anyhow so like it was fucking freezing it's just I don't want to I I want to do it I don't know no I love heat but the cold thing is like now I'm good I'm good on the understand you know it's if you love it I love it I do it too I love both of them do you go back to back that's what they say you should do have not gone back to back but I've gone and done both of them in a day yeah like I like hot yoga - I like hot yoga and then doing the cryos which they say you shouldn't do it because they'll give you a heart attack Oh doing it hot pussy yeah who's doing be a man who's getting a guy you used to do hot yoga I need you back here - I just got to get flexible man it's just that's the tough thing about getting old and you know ability flexibility because what they say most most older people died on the toilet because they can't get up you know they they have some problem and they can't get up from wherever they are is that real yeah yeah oh yeah that's a great yeah just on the toilet you only imagine like Elvis like as you're dying but can we you know I just don't want to die stupid right now some stupid like you'll be reading in New York City some guys just walking and something falls on them you know front o or a person how about that so yeah suicidal person lands on your fucking head I was at adidas in the flagship in New York adidas and like five minutes before I got there you know a person just jumped off and killed themselves right outside the store like all out of residents Jesus yeah it is that's one of the craziest ways to go like the feeling of regret you must have when you feel the air under your feet and you're falling you can't do nothing that's a wrap dude he made the decision you pulled the trigger here it comes the great beyond bang what goes through your mind when you're going down like that like in it's your choice you know what I mean I'll be filled with unbelievable terror unbelievable terror even though it's your choice there have been people that have survived jumps into the ocean they've jumped off like the Golden Gate Bridge yes all the time I mean it's like one of the number one suicide spots in the u.s. yeah but some will make it they survive suck yeah or like if you really wanted to die and you didn't die maybe not maybe you got a new lease on life yeah you hit the water you know like what I'm alive fuck I I never could get myself to that place like I I like my life too much right now yeah well you're happy and that's an awesome thing but you know we're talking about spectrums yeah there's clearly a spectrum of that yeah you know and some people I think have it horrific alee they just have whatever Everett whatever reason chemical imbalance life experiences that are awful PTSD whatever the the formula is they have it to the point where it's almost unbearable every one hundred percent a hundred percent like my dad you know you he served our country in the army and it didn't seem to affect him at all but I you know he has friends that it's affected I have friends that have served they're affected by it and yeah what was that movie it was about Benghazi I forgot John Krasinski did it but I had to interview the real guys that pulled off got the people out of Benghazi and the normal world is so boring to them like literally they got excited when they talked to you know how it feels a bullets whizzing by your head you knowing you shooting at people like literally the real world is so and that's why they keep going back because that's the only way they can get that adrenaline rush which is you know to me I'm like that's crazy but to them that's where they get their high and that's that's life to them that's how they're living and I interviewed the three or four soldiers that went out there and save these people and you saw that look in their eye you know what I mean it's like they would go back now if they could hmm and they hated hearing how one of their own lost their lives out there yeah you know where they rely could have done something about that and that's what they talked about is like why we always want to go back is every time we hear one of our one of our fallen soldiers they they fell we could have saved them and two of them were snipers and the other two were on the ground and they were like man it's just it's just real life is it's very tame for us you know it's almost I'm putting now I'm paraphrasing kits a bore just living our normal lives and unless they're fighting for our country and saving people's lives like everything else is just boring yeah I mean you're talking about literally life being turned up to ten there's yes nothing nothing else that compares to it on the planet other than being a police officer yeah can you in a shootout or or just just imagine like a police officer walking up to a car that's freaky enough you don't know what's inside that's like you're playing roulette yep you don't know what's inside that car yeah you know like look there are some bad police out there but as just put yourself in that spot where you're a cop getting out your car walking to a car with tinted windows yep knocking on the window you don't know what you're gonna you don't know if it's a barrel of a shotgun you don't know you have no idea you have no eye and people have to realize that tension they carry with them all day they might have 20 of those interactions absolutely all day and and a couple could have been really bad yeah and if you have you give them any bullshit or don't appreciate a respect that they're immediately gonna go okay yeah you fucking asshole and that you're the enemy now and it's horrible it's horrible that we give a person the kind of power that police officers have when they abuse it but it's also horrible that we create this relationship between fellow citizens a purpose a cop is just a citizen's just one of us where we are the enemy if we're not following the book especially when the book is stupid like it's pot laws or something dumb like that one yeah or you're catching guys getting jerked off like Jesus cry you know I've been pulled over a couple times and I I gotta say you know most of them like my dad you know they say a black thing to do when you have a black father they tell you very early on when a cop pulls you over hands out let them see it you know it's taught to us yes well we're when we're born and raised especially where I grew up so I you know I even been profiled and I you know like and I'm half black you know you don't know what I really am a lot of people but I've been profiled so I know what I see when I hear the stories and I've been in cars with my friends that are dark skinned black and they've been pulled over and it's a thing where you're up set because you feel like you're being profiled but man what's that cop walks over you need to show all due respect because they they control that game now it's a hundred percent their game once they pull up to your window you're in their cart you also should think that they are entirely necessary for a civilized us a hundred percent and if you want to be able to call the police if some shit is going down you should appreciate them when they're there and you know this does not discount all the bad cops yeah absolutely not discount all the things we've all seen the shootings or unjustified punching czar unjustified this is what we have to keep though perspective because there's so many interactions there's so many cops out there that are dealing with PTSD all day long because for a decade or two decades of their life they have been dealing with crime and violence all day long every day and they dress like the enemy they're not just a cop they're a cop who has to wear a cop outfit so everywhere you go like when you won't playing quake and you playing TV dude has a special flag over his head no that's a target if you see if you see cops like bad guys see cops as the enemy you're being paid to be the enemy even if you've never had an interaction if you're a bad guy and that's a cop that's the enemy and that is a crazy but you should ask people to be but even for people that don't have interactions with cops yeah a lot they still considered the enemy sure like because if they pull you over for speeding like I it's gone through my mind it's like nobody's on the road right now why are you pulling me over for speeding like I'm not hurting anybody it's just a waste of time well you know how to write a ticket because there you have to write a certain they have to write and that's and that's when I think it goes over the top where it's like come on now I was talking to a cop about that I said okay now let me ask you this what if everybody agreed to never speed like we made up like a six month agreement in this country where we would never speed and no one speeded and there was no more traffic violations in terms of speeding tickets what the fuck would happen and he was like people would just get laid off left and right they were just really yeah you just they were like I think they would just slash solis Department they put quotas on you cuz you're a glorified revenue collector I mean that's that's a problem though like when you're feeling people over and I think that it all look problems with the police and people start from the core and that's a major problem if you have to pull over people even if you're a cop and go and they're not really doing anything bad but I have to meet my quota of tickets that starts from a very negative place terrible terrible place terrible place and terrible place for both parties terrible place for the cop to bury his head in the sand and realize he's writing someone to ticket for no reason you know I could catch someone the speed limit 65 they're sick they're going 69 you pull them over like it the fuck really yeah you can't even pay attention like there's no way unless I'm not looking at the road like unless I have cruise control or I'm not looking at the road oh I might get to 69 I might back up to 65 again even if I'm trying to go the speed limit but I know people that have been pulled over for miles over a hundred percent yeah but as a driver of that car going four miles over you're pissed yeah like automatic jacked yeah you just got jacked in your mind you're protecting and we all know he's writing a ticket just to write a ticket it's probably the 27th or 28th of the month yep and they got to meet their quota and he's like that's where they drive into Vegas is the worst they set up traps yeah and especially close to the end of the month you know if you're driving to Vegas go to speed limit because we're waiting for you I got pulled over by plane you seen this going to Vegas they have planes that now radar you they don't even and then they send out cop cars so suppose the radars you and then a cop car pulls you over yes yeah yeah and that was the last time we went to Vegas I went with my wife and son and we got pulled like a cop car came out of nowhere and my wife here's a difference you know that this shows that my wife is white from Wyoming right and this is the big difference that's real white that that's what I pilgrim that's like Casper the Friendly Ghost white yeah it's like cowboy white translucent right yeah only Cowboys up there Wyoming Cowboys yeah did you your wife grew up on a ranch no shit no no I think that cities yeah they she's grew up in Gillette Gillette Wyoming that fuck is that Wyoming how many people there 80 I think 3,000 come on no seriously they're like the Brady Bunch I'm married into the Brady Bunch like seriously their real life right it's like good morning Michael how are you like they are those paints kind of cool no it's great so a cop pulls us over for this Vegas trip and this is the difference in cultures we have and this is why I try to tell my wife when the cop came over his name let's say officer Andrew he comes over I'm very polite I said yes sir you got it no problem I was speeding no problem my wife and the cop goes we pulled you over by a plane so he gives me a ticket I'm like hey officer I have a great day slight you too sir my wife is in the backseat with my son rolls down the window when he's walking away and goes excuse me how do you know it was this black SUV I see lots of black SUVs passing us and it's from a plane are you serious and I'm like I'm about to die the cop turns back around like comes to my side of the window and says excuse me ma'am and it but just a privilege to be able to talk to a cop like that because she has no idea she has no idea that's the real white privilege that's the real one and I'm like and I'm like telling the cop tell me about I'm telling the cop I'm saying hey baby it's okay I was speeding you had this on stage no you fucking shine I know dude that's hilarious and I'm like you should for sure about the stage it's it's just it scared me because I was scared because she's the cop comes back I'm out write that down right now okay take that pad write it down write it down you must talk about this sun's light wife plane Rivlin plane radar black SUV play Wyoming cowboy white people okay we'll see let's tango catch - so she warns horseshoe he comes back over and he's trying to explain to my wife like about a plane and she's given this cop attitude oh no yeah well we drive off I go baby you cannot do that like you almost killed me she was like stop being ridiculous I'm like no no you no you really got me killed you never never know wrong guy wrong place wrong time wrong history wrong backround wrong state of mind that he's in what if he didn't like a black dude married to a white woman for sure yeah like and she didn't get that but now she gets that cuz we have a son you know what I mean so I think once you have a multi-ethnic son now she's like oh I'm all about Moana I'm all about she doesn't like she's all about the ethnic cartoons and not the way she's trying she's trying he's got a good mindset yeah she's trying and her family's trying you know it sucks that anybody has to ever worry about getting accidentally shot by a cop and the problem I think is not gonna go away until the problem of crime goes away and that's not gonna happen either so it what do we do to make life safer for everybody that's a real good fuckin question well I mean we're Nisour like people being aware of all these videos that's one thing that I think that blacked-out black lives matter did that people don't want to accept but it's really important as it became a national thought yes it's not just another story in the news it's a national thought like this is a movement to try to eradicate this and all the times were you seen guys plant guns on after they've shot I'm like the OCZ videos yeah you see videos of black people with no guns getting shot and then here's the problem they go to court and then the cops are innocent you see the one where the guy throws the gun down on the ground was it was it a Taser what did he throw down on the ground there was like he shot him and then as he's coming after the body he dropped something on the ground when I was growing up at least I don't know when it changed but cops were supposed to shoot not to kill you but to handicap you like shoot you in the leg shoot you in the arms you guys are not that good a shot there's a lot of cops that are just not good at shooting guns I mean there's a lot of that are military trained that are very professional and very serious who are but it's like look I watched a video the other day of a guy getting in an altercation an off-duty cop got into an altercation with this guy and he tried to pull his gun out the guy grabbed him grabbed his wrist I did not know how to fight at all and probably only knew how to like shoot people yeah he gets taken down the guy obviously knew jiu-jitsu took him down mounted him took the gun from him threw the gun away and beat the fuck out of him from the mount pound guy turns his back he gets his back he's beating the shit out of him it's horrific because this cop thought he was safe and pulled his gun but this is like one example of it just because someone's a cop doesn't mean they're well-trained prepared there are those out there for absolutely there are also some slobs like I've seen some guys that are there a cop and like bro you can't run a block fuck are you a cop yeah yeah you know like this is a ridiculous position for you to put yourself in and anybody else you're trying to protect you're handicapped by gluttony you know but but at the same time we do need them we need the cops we need them to be more respected and appreciated they're not very respected and appreciated by a lot of people I think that's a and C what a huge me service what I hate about this conversation whatever side they're on what the cops are gonna pull whatever they want because we've talked negative what not negative we said some things about and I hate how we're in such a polar place where him oh you're either form or against and that's like with everything and that's what I hate you can't have a conversation anymore yeah and that's where we're at right now it's like you can't say anything wrong with cops because then you don't support the cops if you support the cops then you'll get attacked by the other side going oh well they kill innocent people what I know I'll take a clip of anything you've said today without further elaboration because most of what you said you further elaborate absolutely they could take that one snippet and just put a little clip up somewhere Michael Yost said this or worse yet quote it this is what he said about cops look fuck him yeah I thought he was pro cop like this well that's the world we live in today yeah this is the world we live in and that's why it's so horrible man well it isn't it's not it is that part is horrible but it's the best time to be alive ever the best time to be alive in terms of our ability to understand our affect on each other the best time to be alive in terms of our ability to access information the best time for for it if something is going on you'll alert people that this thing like a crime is taking all things I say we could spread the news of it so quick we just have to we were just not used to so much we're not so much that we have to deal with all day we're not designed for so much and it happened in 35 years you know like like you just think about like our parents right when we were growing it the TV was black and white and in a wet color and that was racing for them for us there were no cell phones or Internet yeah and then in our in like the last 35 years I'll I don't think you'll ever see a technology boom like in this last 35 years so many advancements happen so quick and that's why we today can't react to them fast enough we don't know like like now parents are doing like parents that are our age or doing the same things the kids are doing where my dad never cared about playing Atari or doing anything he had totally different interests we're now the kids that are coming up since this boom is so fast we're still learning new technology and now our kids are learning it with us and there's no separation III agree and I think it's definitely like untreated territory but I disagree that that will never see a boom and Technology like we've already seen I think we haven't even scratched us early yeah we haven't even but when you have but I I guess I'm saying things that change the world like there was no internet Joe do now this isn't that in my mosque is working on called neural link and I don't know exactly how this works II wouldn't exactly explain it but the concept is about increasing the bandwidth between human brain activity and information somehow or another to get information quicker to you and have you access it in a quicker manner I don't know what the fuck that means it's something you wear on your head some dude just tried it Jamie there's an article that just yeah some dude just said I might or might not have tried Elon Musk's neural link like he's kind of like bound by silence but there is a real possibility that think about what here's here's how to look at it think about Wi-Fi right mm-hmm Wi-Fi is in this room we use it you can access you could shut your phone off and turn your Wi-Fi on and you'll be able to access all the information in the internet but where is that coming from where is that it's in the air it's the sky it's all around us if you can wear thing that picks up on that in the same way picks up on Wi-Fi in the same way it picks up on cellular signals whether it's 4G or 5g which is coming out soon which is supposed to be in unstoppable yeah if that can feed information directly to your brain through something that you wear just the way they do these you know they have these electrodes they put on your head and they send magnetic pulses to different parts of the brain helps people with traumatic brain injuries helps people with depression they've been able to do this by taking these little things and they stick them to your head and they they'd send this pulsating magnet in there they could already affect the brain with external stimulation they already know how to do that if they can figure out how to do that in a much more sophisticated way we are on the edge of becoming cyborgs and it's not far away we're talking about within the next decade maybe two decades there's gonna be something that changes a person and makes you like if you're a person with a limited education and no phone think about how within but think about how little access to the 100 sense knowledge base you had now if you're a person with limited access to information and education but you have a phone and that phone is online you have everything so that changes everything this person now can access all the knowledge it's not perfect if you google things some of the things are bullshit yeah some articles are dumb they don't make sense but you have possibility of finding all the information so now in the future I think that as going that's going to be escalated and it's going to be escalated exponentially there's going to be some new leaps and Technology that happen that guys like you and I that don't work in the field we're not we're gonna see it coming and as people are working on these things right now and they're competing with people in China and Russia and all over the world that are also working on these technologies and they're gonna get through and they're gonna make something and that's something is going to change reality as we know it and it's probably right around the corner the same way cell phones and the internet changed our reality as compared to our parents this is gonna change but thing is it I I get that your brain gets it right away but I don't know how it worked but but let's say your brain gets it you put this machine on like this and then it sends it straight to your brain what's the difference of that it besides quicker than you being on a computer and looking up you're still getting the same so I don't think that's the case but you're giving the same information don't think that's how it works what does this guy say this is an April Fool's joke it's an April Fool's joke Oh what is the title the article you know I must might have let me try a neural link post but oh really but let's say it I know you don't know about but let's say you put on a device and all the information goes to your brain mm-hmm you're still getting the same information maybe not what have you ever seen someone using exoskeleton you know next to no what is that exoskeleton is like suit that you put on that's like say if you work in a factory it allow you to pick up much heavier things like remember the movie aliens yes the Gorney Weaver she's fucking up that thing she's inside that robot yeah okay that's like a giant robotic exoskeleton this is an exoskeleton that they use for people that are paralyzed guy helps them walk okay they also are developing exoskeletons oh that's a chair huh that one has extra legs oh that's pretty dope there's things that help people like that gal right there is not a big person but she can work in a factory and you can carry things that are much heavier than what you would ordinarily be able to carry okay now they think that as technology moves and improves they're going to get to the point where they develop what's essentially like an Iron Man suit that's like an exoskeleton you know the Iron Man suit like when he wears that he's invisible he flies he can smash things and pick things up and throw things that's going that that that is entirely possible that this is going to be our future that there's going to be suits that we wear that make us impervious look at this guy's got one that lets him fly around and then he's got rockets that come out of it you think the government would ever approve that for us but you don't have a chance it's not whether or not they improve approve it it doesn't have anything to do with them it has to do with the technologists it has to do with the scientists it has to do with the geniuses that are creating these time these because they're gonna come in waves and these fucking dummies that don't even understand what Facebook is yeah these are the same guys are gonna stop these people from putting out Iron Man suits they're not gonna tell them until it's way too late through later already when they tell them they're gonna make them for sale and they're not going to give them the option as to whether or not they regulate them they're just they're gonna make them for people and then you're gonna have to figure out the laws once people have them and then once grandma has one and all sudden grandmas playing tennis again you tell me grandma I can't play tennis because some bad guys want to use an exoskeleton to rob a bank because that shit's coming all of its coming bulletproof exoskeleton I still everything you've said so far still to me is not bigger then not have an internet well or that turn the door but we don't know if that technology thing that you can like talking your phone and you could say hey Siri when was the Constitution formulated yeah you know hey Siri what was the first draft of the Declaration of Independence written on you can you can ask those questions as serial answers Google search will answer those questions for you but what if you just know it what if that thought interfaces with your brain in a way where it describes things maybe in symbols or direct feed of information through some unfathomable technology that literally just permeates language it just gets through to you as you information I speak to and the different language is automatically translated things like yes that's well they already could do that you know they have these Google earbuds yeah there's pixel buds I think they're called really that worked would they just get rid of school or at school and be to tell you how to need scholars because you would need to know whether or not this this stuff is accurate you would need women and men who are educated in this and that's this is one of the reasons why the scientific method is so important one of the reasons why when people shit on like ridiculous things like like grievance studies and a lot of the things that are overcoming universities these days where you're taking away with your preposterous social justice ideology you're taking away from the real pursuit of knowledge and information because you want it to match up with your ideology this is a dangerous time to fuck with information absolutely because people already puling up in these little Cote chambers well they you know whether it's message boards or Twitter groups that you're in and and they they feed off of each other and agree on each other with each other all the time it'd be really careful with information these days and also you know what they have to keep scholars to keep the real information because it's just like that uh one show I forgot what it's called black something black box black black mirror lighting they can change reality like literally like if you don't have scholars to oversee this stuff they can be like oh you know what slavery never happened or this never happened yeah and it would go away because the people born today will never know there's people that to this day will deny the Armenian Genocide if there's people to this day that denied that oh and this is a real thing yeah there are certain human beings that deny that and what's it going to be like 100 years from now I mean how many of those people will exist then there's a lot of those circumstances in life where you have to be really careful about what information is what's process like we had a move to you have to be a hundred percent accurate if you're saying something that is a historical record and you can't fuck with it at all but they are now but the everybody has everything history but that's the reasons why all religions are different right because everybody has their own little version of history I mean there's one of the reasons why many different religions have stories of Jesus but they vary what they vary yeah yeah as telling the truth well I mean it's it's thing where where what's scary to me about this world today is that misinformation is out there all the time people believe it and people just people don't read anymore they just listen to the bullet point and scream that out like literally and I don't want to get political or anything but but I remember when everybody was saying Obama's gonna raise taxes and they were interviewing people that didn't even make $30,000 say oh he's gonna raise my taxes like nah he's not even talking about you but you're yelling out a bullet point if you would have read the article you would have read you were fine that's the thing people are in today we want to yell out bullet points if fox news if you watch that and they say this you're just yelling at that but you never read like if CNN is your thing you're just yelling what they're saying but you don't read like me I watch both I actually read both articles I could talk politics all day like I think I think there are good things that Republicans do I think there's good things that Democrats do I think Democrats right now are in a state where they're they fight amongst each other they're gonna crush each other before the election even comes it's it's like Obama said it's a circling fire squad they're shooting at each other and and here's the thing the good thing about the Republicans bad or good however you take it if one of us says let's go they go with Democrats it's let's talk about it I mean it's more intelligent way to do it but they don't have each other's back I feel as much and that's why their messaging is always off that's why Donald Trump Donald Trump could have never been a Democrat like if Donald Trump said I want to run for president and been a Democrat they there's there's they would have mesh where the Republicans it works because oh we just want to stay in charge and whatever he says we're gonna roll with you know George Bush weapons about let's go you know it's just a hundred percent behind it where I think do you think that is I want to say you know I when I was I grow I voted for Bush after 9/11 right cuz I'm from Texas you know and I think it's not allowed ID allows you to isla G that oh we want to pay back in its I don't want to say good old boys but it's like hey rah rah let's go yeah that's the whole thing it's it's more remember when the flags weren't everybody's car oh yeah oh yeah and it was like we were all behind it - that was the weirdest I remember I was driving somewhere and I made a turn on the street near my house and it was one or two days after 9/11 and I never saw more flags on cars in my life it was like the world changed Oh like everybody had a flag on their car and everybody cared about each other and they said and that's the thing that's sad about the world today is I tell I tell everybody and I'm not a politician but I will say this when you have two different teams that arrivals they'll never come to the same conclusion unless there's tragedy mmm right when that was one of the things that Reagan said once we was talking about they were meeting with Gorbachev and he said I often wonder how we would put our differences aside if we were faced with an alien threat from another world oh we totally would with the idea that this global conflict that we think about in terms of Russia versus the United States but if there were some fucking aliens coming down here war a world style it would be Independence Day everybody would join forces everybody cuz now you have a common enemy and I also believe the way the our country is being ran right now you know Trump is good at making an enemy that he survives off the enemy this person is an enemy right now everybody attack now this person is an enemy everybody attack him I'm not saying it's right or wrong I'm just saying that's the way it is you know he just fucks with people apparently there's some dude that's his head of secret security a secret service that he calls Dumbo cuz it dude has big ears dude he is he's a fucking wild man and he's probably on speed I'm just watching this it is hilarious I mean if it wasn't the fact that you think that like the moral fiber of our country's deteriorating is this it does have big ears that's some big massive ears Wow well well but I know a lot of people big ears that I like dearly but don't you but but don't you believe this yo let's be honest if America like the whole country could look in the mirror when Donald Trump was elected it's a reflection of America when he got it when he got voted it's a reflection of a percentage of us no no but egotistical it's a trauma of some but I don't want to generalize like in terms of like say that's America I'm with I would for a joke yeah but I mean if you were being serious I'm being it but I am being serious bold then why were there's why was there the women's March we're a million let me tell you let me tell you why because I think Donald Trump here's here's when everybody was depressed Donald Trump was president I go you got to look at the positives if Hillary was elected those women would have never got together to March Donald Trump has brought more people together against him Margaret we were marching Americans were marching for Muslims after Donald Trump became president the positivity that Donald Trump has created with the opposition and the in the togetherness yet a million women March because Donald Trump was president yet people marching for the Muslims but cuz Donald Trump was president he's brought for the first time I feel like they the side that opposes Donald Trump they're more together than ever and even though we say it's rip the country apart you know because you know there's some problems in this country but it has brought a bunch of people together and I don't think if Hillary was president you wouldn't have had the women March she wouldn't have had the March vote Muslims you wouldn't have people back in immigrants she just start executing men so she would do should take my town square so shooting them first with Bill bill be the first one she had him on television well that was the whole thing like just like Iran all right just like our allies in Iran but no but don't you but don't you think as Iran do public executions to this Syria Syria does right but don't you think like when Hillary didn't stand up the bill that's where she lost everybody it started way before the election because women wanted her to stand up to him back then they don't know what she did or didn't write was totally did publicly and publicly why would she do that it's that seems like it's crazy to do like why you you're you're a dignified person you're gonna publicly well not trash him but you don't have to stand next to him even Melania Trump bounces on Trump you know Hillary without bill didn't exist I think that guy was a dick sling in Buccaneer and he made his way in the fucking White House and she rode that wave yeah there was a giant v12 sucking gasoline like it was going on stop blowing a big wake behind it and she was hanging on to that fucking wakeboard line Jesus but where she wasn't gutting out of Arkansas she wasn't getting in the White House she wasn't the Secretary of State settled down so you can sense so it's kind of like hey you know what you got yourself into is that what you're saying well there's that and he's also she's a liar liar yeah like and maybe it she's a liar because she's a politician but when just you compare what was public like her knowledge of what went wrong with the email servers and all that jazz and many other instances to just one will talk about and what Comey said when Comey was examining the evidence and what what they did wrong what she said they did wrong there very different things everything very different things and this is politics right if your base hears you say something that isn't true but you say it with confidence even though the evidence doesn't support it that argument takes place and it blurs the gray area in the middle between guilt and innocent do you do you think when when somebody gets elected precedent they have a meeting with okay and then they say these are the things you can go after and these are the things you can't because if you go after this we can't protect you from it I really believe those conversations happen in the White House like yeah and when I say think they they say they can't protect you pal I think like after the Jews no no no no no I'm saying like there's certain organizations like the Rockefellers or certain organizations we talk about the CFR no I'm gonna Bohemian Grove if I just think there's a list of corporations big corporations that run America that they say you can't go after because a lot of presidents go in there saying I'm gonna do this against this core I'm not gonna even say the corporation because I want to live and I feel that Secret Service really calls these people and the presidents and go hey this sue you can't go after here's who you can't and if you do go after those you can't on your own because we won't be able to say because they're too powerful well believe in that mr. giant corporations that have incredible influence on politicians because there's no reach yeah and spend so much money to keep them in power and get them into power and help contribute to the campaigns then scratch each other's backs if the president were to go in and say i'ma get rid of all lobbyists that president would not make it through his term well it's hard to say that no it's not no there's too much money Joe I mean I know if I'm gonna agree with you in this day and age it's hard to say that because you'd have to get everybody on board with killing a president I think they definitely did it with Kennedy oh you mean I think 100% you know I was talking to you know do you have to get everybody Bauer's no but do you have to get everybody on board yeah I mean it just get everybody on board who knows about it because otherwise people are gonna tell if you couldn't kill the fucking president you you have to get a lot of whores as what we're probably gonna get raided by the Secret Service right now but I'm saying if you want to kill president it's not like it used to be I think it used to be less consequential not that it was all I mean like John Wilkes Booth days right they're easier to kill the president and then Kennedy way easier to kill a president in 1963 than his kill President 2019 could you still do it yeah but you're probably going to get caught like you would probably get caught it let you'd have to have I mean there would have to be I'll you would have to have a tiny small circle of fucking sociopaths and Psychopaths and they all agree to keep it hush to me is one person calling another person saying do this pay him off and then you can get caught but one print look we have Secret Service you have military protecting them yeah that's different yeah cuz you have takes a lot of layers to get past all that you know and some would have to make a mistake in mapping like that was one of the things I said about a Dealey Plaza I mean they rolled Kennedy through they're like what fucking security person would ever agree to let someone roll through the convertible with Bobby's yeah yeah and then also you have to take that long slow turn where you know it's something just drive by going 50 miles an hour and you got to get your gun down shoot them quick no the guy was driving slow it's ridiculous like you're asking for someone to get assassinated but I just I just really feel like there are rules like that will never ever know about but once you're in there they're like hey here's what you need to know here's what you need to know not to go against I would think that if anybody's gonna tell us that it's Trump I think the best thing that could ever happen is that Trump gets out of his terms in the White House just starts talking it's it starts writing folks everything yeah you want to be the king of the world right a fucking huge book on exactly what it's like the day you become the president that would be insane how how do you think he's gonna be treated once it gets out though they'll love him you think so they love Bush people hated Bush they called Bush a war criminal now he's an adorable grandpa paints no it's true it's true look man whatever Obama when he was in office they're gonna love him within a few years I mean most people that were supporters of Obama they love him now yeah I mean he's like yeah I I mean I don't know I think they're gonna I think a certain percentage of the population loves Trump right now period and you know they have reasons to back it up in terms of like the economy what they think it's having this job creation all these different things that he's doing that may or may not not have devastating implications depending on who you talk to that's an expert and I'm not one yeah me neither but there's obviously and then also people say wow this is a trend that was actually going on during the Obama administration he's just riding the wave maybe I'm too stupid I don't understand that stuff but I'm saying there's in terms of numbers it's not like the country is completely imploding right now I mean maybe some people buy some people's metric it's not doing as well as he would like to pretend it is probably but my thing it doesn't even matter like when they say the stocks are up and all it it's it's what matters is your personal like are you in a better place because he's president like I think for some people they're not right some people like if you get rounded up by ice no you're not yeah you know I mean that's it's horrible this is the worst time ever for perception of us in terms of like the way we handle immigrants well you know you know the the bad part about immigrants it's all bad but you know the problem is they've they've dealt with this problem what for the last 30 40 years mmm I mean and if they make nicer facilities let's say they know they're coming and so they don't have enough judges did the facilities are horrible so let's say they make nicer facilities the government thinks the the whole thinking of the government is if we do that then that's going to encourage more to come because now it's nice yeah they're like bro you get over there delicious food yeah they have a taco stand fuckin party over there bro margaritas your party with the guards once you get to know them they're good guys and that's the thing it's like what do you do what do you do like I think I think this is a problem that will take generations to fix and really there is a problem the only way it's really gonna get fixed really is two ways one you got to make drugs legal and - you got to prop up all these countries all these countries that are third-world countries where these people are fleeing because they don't have any possibility there's no hope for them wherever they are they're in incredibly poor countries there's no future they don't they don't have the resources they don't have anything to do so the only way you can keep people happy on a global scale is you've got to figure out like we've the highest of the highs right there like wealthy people in the industrialized Western world right the lows of the lows are people that lived in that are living in these places that are disease ridden poverty-stricken horrible with no future you got we've got to figure out a way to bring everybody to a comfortable middle all over the world so that there's no extreme poverty in any location anywhere but we want to eradicate diseases okay for sure we do right we all do don't we want to eradicate the the problem the disease of poverty is a dis-ease it's a terrible feeling to be poor and scrounging for food in a crime-ridden environment and the only way to fix that is put attention on those areas and use money to try to raise it up they're not gonna raise up on their own they never have no they never and never will yeah yeah I just think globally if if people ever could get their shit together and this is what I hope this is my well if I had like a pipe dream of technology yes that technology gets us to a place where we can read each other's minds and I think this is possible and I think once we can read each other's minds we can understand that we're not that dissimilar and we're not nearly as far apart as we think we are and that most of our problems that we have are problems of ego and problems of ideology and problems of ethics and morals and truth and lies and that reading each other's minds will sort a lot of that out and then we're gonna figure out a way to I don't want to say like for redistribution of wealth I don't think you should just give people things what I think you should do is try to figure out a way to rebuild communities and give people opportunities to live better lives and we have to do that globally I think but I think the problem today is presented too because I listened to both sides when you travel as a comic you'll people just come up to you and tell you their views just random things so you hear from both sides one side it's like I don't want to just give out stuff for free you know I why should I give them stuff I worked hard for mine and the other you got other people that go we need to help everyone out because we are the world type of situation you know both right this is wrong it's confusing yes yeah 100% both right but you don't want to give people stuff but you don't want to just you got lucky yeah you got lucky as fuck you're born in America I mean you're from Texas I'm from Boston dude we're from like the industrialized Western world in the the pinnacle of civilization in terms of like opportunity there's never been a place like this we're the luckiest fucking people in it anybody who doesn't acknowledge that you got to be crazy Matt was I became friends with this lady at a restaurant and me and my wife and son would always go in there and we got really close and she was just talking about like you know her family's from Ecuador and her kids she can't afford her kids to be over here so she's sitting in a school over there and she keeps sending money over there but like it's riddled with gangs nothing but gangs out there and if they find out you're in America sending money back they'll hold your family hostage you know what I mean and it's and that's real people don't believe that they think they oh that's not it's real like this lady we've known for over like eight years and she tells these stories about like her sending the money and she has a person out there that basically you know lives in a little house and keeps everything secret because if it comes out that she's sending money to them they'll they'll hold family hostage and I'll have the features off and shed yeah like that's bad and we're living here you know we're lucky we're doing this podcast but there are people struggling in when I hear people go ah you know that's their problem no that's that's terrible world you're you're a awful human being yeah my perspective sucks for sure it's terrible and it's going on all over the world and it's creating this and I feel that you know we're creating this me me me yeah situation but I also think we need to also have conversations about it I did a I did a show in Kansas City and I always talk about when I do stand-up I don't talk politics so you know you do the local press and things and there were people to come out to my shows and Trump hats like literally wearing Trump hats of a sad front row fuck with you I don't know but I thought we did also I don't care what they probably did they probably did because cuz after the show literally and when I say Trump's words like they look I mean like the big like that type of thing and they go we hurt our watch said you weren't gonna talk politics so we won't see you know and and then she goes he's right you didn't you know and they hide men wanna see we're gonna sit up front where our Trump at port our leader okay you crack any funny about his orange scanners fucked up and I didn't I did because it's not my comedy but they bought all basically they bought tons of merch because I didn't do it and they also said something that was important and I think this is important to know when you try to make a point to somebody when you start off yelling at them it's never gonna go well if you can explain it to them through your eyes and not yell have a conversation because I talk a lot about like you know I talk a lot about growing up in an all-white neighborhood and the racist things that I encountered and I didn't yell at them and I didn't say I hate white people I just told my point of view and they actually were open in they actually respond I understand now you know nobody's ever explained it to us like that and I think it's about conversation not because when we watch TV it's all about you suck you suck well let me tell you why you know is you got to start from a place but like this have you I I don't know if you heard of this green deal where they want to take 70% of anyone that makes over ten million dollars seventy percent of their income that's hilarious it's the dumbest thing that's a OC right yeah it's the dumbest thing ever I mean I wasn't calling her but no no no I I like her say good luck bitch as a expression yes I like her too I like your butt I'll agree with that but I like her but what I'm saying is my friend was like oh you know if the Democrats win that's gonna get passed because we hate rich people and I go that's the problem we're starting at hate the reason why you think it's gonna pass because you think people hate rich people see and that's you gotta have a fix it here's nothing first of all you've got incompetent use of funds like where does the money go artax worse I go yeah that if you tax the rich that all sudden all the problems will stop existing that is so silly you still have incompetent people that are attributing the money they're just create more jobs they'll be more red tape and we get one more in debts yeah we got to do is figure out a real plan for engineering our civilization better that's that's what people have to do and they should be like real discussion from like real experts biologists historians people who really understand you it psychologists people really understand human beings really understand what's wrong with our society today and we have an open discussion but you know that uni that never out that but that can never happen of course it can but another right now because of the government because they here's the thing what do you mean that can happen we have to look at it in terms of a little priority but no it goes by it goes by the whoever parties in charge their priorities it's not like my problem is to make it a priority for the nation that's what I'm saying but it's not impossible but until you have a person I believe everything to be fixed this is a simple fix if you just elect a person that takes some republican values and some democratic values the thing is right now in politics you have to be one or the other like if I can if a person came in as go you know what I like these Republican ideas I like these democratic ideas less role imma be down the middle and less role with both call being a centrist yeah yeah that exists yeah it needs to win but that can happen it can happen all of it but a person little bit until that happens does it mean though does it every four years we figure out what happens right and before a trump won we never thought a reality show fucking guy could win but that guy won yeah and you go okay well now we know that happens yeah all this stuff can happen this it's not like we're not asking for alchemy we're not trying to turn lead into gold we're trying to figure out a way but you're going against the system that then is is you are no we there's a new system the new system is the the system of public opinion which is readily accessible absolutely and that's never happened before there's never been a time where everyone had a say in one way shape or form whether it's through commenting through Instagram or Twitter or social media that's one of the reasons why upholding the freedom of speech and these things is so important even if people are saying things you don't agree with yeah the only way this all gets sorted out is we get to figure out a way to express ourselves and there's gonna be arguments back and forth but what you got to do is someone's got to put forth an educated plan like a plan that's based on science and reason and a plan that you can debate against opposers of that plan but when you have people that don't believe in science a lot of it how do you how do you slowly but surely you have to get there it's gonna take generation this is what I'm saying it's like the momentum of our stubbornness and our past and the the sort of the systems that we find ourselves stuck in systems behavior and thinking culture all that stuff is gonna take a long time yeah we sort the wheat from the chaff we've got to figure out what's good and what's bad and we're doing it we're doing it but it was doing it actively it's frustrating because you're like god dammit this is the worst time we still have all these problems we still have cops shooting people we still have crime we still have wall street theft we still have all this stuff yeah but you know what I like him but you know what I like is we know about it now yeah where it's not hidden like 20 years ago like you heard in let's go 30 years ago you heard NWA make that sound after police yeah and they're talking about the same things that are happening today except you would hear the song and go oh that's a great song that's not Rodney King yeah rowdy key you watched him get the fuck beat out of him yeah on TV here's the thing about the Rodney King thing that guy apparently was a look he done a bunch of crazy shit right he got in a car chase with the cops he beat the fuck out of somebody before that there was a lot going on you just got to see the end of it while this guy is was young what was he on I don't know if he was he on a drug and I think he was on PCP PCP apparently makes you like superhuman strong I had a buddy of mine who got his finger bitten off while he's on PCP say didn't even know I written off by who a street fight yeah it's like he didn't even realize his fit because he was he was on PCP Dean realized somebody bit his finger off and he went to yeah he had his toe removed and his toe put onto his finger where his finger used to be was it the thumb no it's his pinky fingers up his trigger finger so on one of us and he had it curved so he could always throw right hooks so is when you'd shake his hand he would give you like this weird handshake while he would shake your hand but there was always one finger that wouldn't he took up the middle it didn't move good yeah because they it was really his toe that they replaced his finger with a toe that must have looked weird it was weird it was real weird yeah but that's PCP son crazy people in Boston man he was a boxing coach ah yeah I don't know ma'am it's just we need to get to a better place yeah we're getting to a better place but I think it's a long slow process I think we are in there I mean there's people that say you like hey to minimize the suffering that people feel right now isn't just for you to say that is outrageous and it's just a hallmark of your delusional perspective that's not true this is not denying the awful things of the world the awful things of the world exist but if you try to look at this as a mathematical equation if you looked above you would say well there's a lot of problems here there's a lot of competing factors there's environmental factors like what are they doing in the world what are they doing at the ocean what are they due to the air oh Jesus everything's warming up and people are fighting over what's causing it like they're not even paying tent this is madness but look how much knowledge there is look how much discussion there is movements are moving and growing and people are even when they're misinformed it's still there's activity there's all this stuff going on even when you know someone says hey we're gonna tax everybody that makes more than 10 million dollars 70% like bitching taxes shit yeah just stop stop stop stop stop just because someone works really hard you can't take all of it look stop people from stealing money stop people for but if you if people say well we want equality of outcome okay as soon as we get equality of effort talk to me yeah this soon is weaker because some people don't hustle they just don't and I don't know why maybe it's the way they're arrays maybe they have poor nutrition maybe they hook worm I don't know what the fuck it is but don't say that everybody's supposed to hit the right spot everyone's gonna get to this spot and then after that spot we're gonna divvy up all the money so nobody ever makes more than one hundred thousand dollars a year in the world's a better place bitch that doesn't make the world better knows that makes lazy people happy yeah that some fucking juggernaut like Mark Cuban or one of these billionaire characters is like hustling constantly and gathering up massive resources yeah he's playing the game of Monopoly but he's playing it 24 hours a day seven days a week that's his option he can do that you can't stop people from doing that well you can stop them is from doing in just things with that money and wait maybe you can do is like help someone like lean towards a like a Bill Gates type situation where he does so much good and so much charitable work and helps out so many people there you go huh well maybe it's not a bad thing for a guy like that to have all that money because you don't have to think of him as just mr. moneybags like maybe you think of him as he does have access to all this money but he's also this incredible resource for hope and change and and prosperity for some fun I think I think like I think people wouldn't mind giving money to something that they see being built like if there's work into it right people hate the idea of just giving money and not seeing something from it sure you know guilty people that don't know what the fuck to do with yeah they're just gonna find a use for it because that's what bureaucracy is yeah I don't know Joe we just I don't know either but I do know that it's fashionable to say it sucks it's fashionable to say everything sucks well it's it's easy to say that but like you said but I really think it starts with if the government is not on the same page and they're always fighting you can't you can't move forward did all this great stuff you just can't move forward because it starts from the top Joe that's true but it starts from the top what's interesting is one of the things that's cool about the government fighting is you get to see that like even the president can't do the things that he wants yes he has to consult with people and they have to agree on something and it has to be reasonable they have to present to the American people and so the people have to represent their constituents and so you're seeing this really fascinating thing because you've never had a guy like Trump in office before so you see him say he's gonna do things and then you see the rest isn't going the fuck you are yeah the fuck you are and then you watch this stalemate you watch this this go down and you watch these people being forced to negotiate in the way Trump is forced to talk about Nancy Pelosi because she has so much power you know you know you have to call her cut oh yeah that's a car at all which like fuck adding but he has to pay the respect cuz he knows now golf claps right in his face man I it's so fun to watch it's so fun to watch right now it is a fun time man and what social media being so big how do you how do you deal with people like the haters because there's so many people I call them thumb thugs but how do you do you just hating in the dark I don't know what they're doing you don't read all that comment say I don't reach it anymore man yeah a very very rarely going to mentions if I do it's usually a mistake I just I just do my best do my best I post and I go host and ghost you don't even look at people's feeds do know I look at some people's fear and when I'm bored yeah you know I'll read some things you know what look at some cool pictures i watch some inspirational shit I like going to the rocks seen him lift a loose man pumped up wanna go to the gym let me let me tell you I see Fletcher I interviewed the rock the first time I met him was like 11 years ago during the game plan and we just hit it off right game playing the game plan that's where he played a quarterback he was a lot thinner you know his his first breakout movie okay that put out he disc or pinion and in the game plan and after that interview he took some time and just talked to me he wasn't the rock then I mean he was wait and then over the years every time I interviewed him he would pull me aside and go are you going to my acting coach are you doing this are you doing that is there anything I can help you with and I'm like like and then he got bigger and bigger and the last time I saw him same thing yo are you doing are you going to the acting coach are you working on your goals are you improving like literally his Instagram but in real life and I'm and it's and he'll never know this but it's a thing that's for me just average mo Michael yo to take the time out every time I interview to ask me if I'm achieving my goals if I'm moving forward in life giving me positive things positive thoughts to take that time like 5 minutes after every interview and this dude is booked non-stop but to actually take time and it's just so inspirational in to see him be the biggest movie star in the world and he knows everybody's name he's very respected I don't know if he has an earpiece but like he's like the president when he knows he could be President he's under percent a hundred percent could be President reform I would too because he but he's just also comes from humble beginnings yes you mean he's in Hawaii right now and he's filming on his Instagram was talking about all the neighborhoods that he goes back to the check to see where he was worst from when he was poor and starving yeah you know I mean he really is from humble beginnings I mean he had only like you know it's the story like five dollars left in his account and then he got discovered in wrestling and I knew him in Miami when he was doing WWE I interviewed him a couple times over there and and he played for the University of Miami my favorite college football team so it's the thing where you know the history of 11 years but for him that big to take time to motivate me separately and you know I know if he sees me out he knows my name but it's not like I'm texting I'm not like Kevin Hart with him and just to be a random dude that he takes time out every time he sees me to make sure I'm hitting my goals and moving forward with my career and not that and then offering hey if you ever need anything get in touch with me you know I would never take him up on that but it's a thing where I'm nobody he's the rock and to be that inspiration I mean it just does so much man like it little things that big celebrities do or somebody that really inspires you like they don't know how much that means like just just that little time he spends yeah it Lisa knows I think he does know I think he's a genuine leader he is you know it's wonderful I think that's why so many people like him because what he says is its authentic like it's really who he is there is nothing fake about that man I don't have to be fake you must have to be successful and if you want to work as hard as that guy you could be successful I I asked one day I was like do you just take a bunch of pictures at the gym like didn't just post throughout the day because you're always get that big from taking pictures oh man that guy's picking heavy shit up that's too bit but you know what I left that's just too big Joe he's an action star dude and he's the first action started looks like an act like I would love him to save my life in real life Wow he's what is he like six seven or something yeah his giant he's a little bit taller me I'm six giant yes giant he's built like a fucking like a legitimate superhero like Will Smith was my guy but I left Will Smith for the ryeom you left him no no I stayed he's tough oh no I know no but like I gotta do what you gotta do but burning building a burning burner who's gonna save you who's gonna save you well spent might save you two aliens coming at you Independence Day did you not see Will Smith look I love Will Smith but earthquake well if you want someone to hold one hand on the top of a building you and then hold your wrist with another and know that he's got you according to the movie poster that's the rock see I never saw Will Smith holding the top of buildings Will Smith by the hand Will Smith your shoot a gun those those zombies he did I am Legend oh man what a great move a fucking move oh my goodness God you but Will Smith in the rock need to make a movie together they never have so no that was he a Mesa be the biggest move in history in the history and they Bowl outs Tom Cruise get them all together Tom Cruise Will Smith and the Rabi over interview Tom Cruise no but only with my brain when I'm in my sensory deprivation tank he reaches out to me does he really makes a mind-meld okay he puts on his Scientology earbuds any astral travel I tell you it's amazing interview Tom Cruise what's amazing about it it's it's because you hear so many different stories you wake up with your pants off no I didn't no not not that time Who am I hypnotized me but he doesn't break eye contact with you mmm that's what I like no he just like hey what's up yeah yeah and what he'll do is that gay nervous no no no no no no that's what he's doing he's nervous or he's just wants you to know he's like he's locked in right like he will not break eye contact like if you look over here be like pie makes it hard for you to ask fucked-up questions you know what he does and I tell all my all my friends when you interview Tom Cruise he will take ask him a question he'll try to make it three minutes long so he doesn't hat you can't ask him that many so you got to learn you got to build a relationship with them so then you can ask him a bunch see I've interviewed him so many times I'll walk it I remember one time I walked in rows like hey Tom I got five minutes so we're gonna have to answer these questions so I got to that point but he he's great in a nice guy did you ever get the Scientology no never part of the deal you can't ask him about that well I I heard a part of Scientology is for you to walk out the room saying how great they are and I just make sense I just did it right yeah so maybe the arcs it did it's just well that's just a philosophy on like how to influence people right yeah positively influence people you want those people really thinking the best of you well good strategy well everybody was like Holly's crazy as this is that every time I interview he's great I love I mean I love Tom Cruise some of my favorite people are crazy yeah yeah tell me someone's crazy that doesn't shake me I'm not like okay well they're crazy my favorite people are all crazy yeah like literally crazy my favorite people so if someone tells me that someone's crazy I'm like okay what else you got crazy not scary to me like Will Smith is awesome he's got to be crazy Will Smith sure you know No all going on - nice - nice - smart no get out of here see that easy no you Scientologist I have no idea what the problem is when I do probably my the problem I had the problem I have would be the entertainment before they give you questions to ask and you have to ask them or literally it could be your job so they float out like a bunch of real dumb ones did they give you any room to like oh yeah you can do whatever you want but they'll be like hey you gotta ask this question and it's like if somebody just got divorced you gotta be like hey alright whatever they're divorced yeah oh and it sucks yeah ask women that yeah that's why I stopped doing it man I couldn't laugh one time what's her name Anna what's her name she was in devil's wear Prada not Meryl Streep but and Anne Hathaway so they gave me the dumbest question that has me I had the way Kim Kardashian Kanye West were on the cover of Vogue and right before that it was a in hathaway and so they told me they go hey why don't you ask her what she thinks about the cover because everybody was like oh this is bullcrap that Kim Kardashian's on I asked Anne Hathaway that question and she goes well you know I don't run the magazine so it really doesn't matter to me I'm like fine so I finished the question I'm walking down the stairs and go they're not here she goes why the fuck would he ask me that question I don't give a shit who's on that magazine and I was about to turn back around cuz I kind of got mad but now I was like man she's fucking right that was a dumbass question maybe you could say I'm sorry they made me ask you a question yeah it's too late and it's too late yeah that's a poopit producers like winding you up like a little robot click click click get out there ask the questions don't ask yeah they get so bubble oh yeah yeah they threaten your job with it well that's why those shows are always soaked and you know we don't have people talking to entertainers and everything's soaked and it just seems so inauthentic like they wanted me to ask my first interview ever was with Jennifer Aniston and Marley & Me and this is right after she broke up with Brad Pitt didn't want you to ask about Brad but they flooded me to ask and I was like no I can't do that - tell him no no I know is my first gig - so no I didn't so I said what if I figure out a different way to ask so I found so what I they're like whatever you get we need a clip you know and this was when I was at a entertainment and this is my first big shoot ever Jennifer Aniston and they were like you're gonna go out there so it was Marley & Me so she just broke up with Brad Pitt so I go since the movies about a dog I go what's the what's the what's the similarities between a dog and a man she laughs and gives a great answer about you know one will be around but a dog is always forever you know like men can treat you right so I got a great answer and I didn't have to ask about Brad Pitt and that's the thing is if you find a smart way to ask it you can ask it but they just sometimes want you to be just so brutal it's it's I can't well it's because they don't have to do it and they don't keep the relationships exactly and they just don't care about you you're a little trained person that they send out a little money person little person listen to me little person you have to listen the person who signs the paper yeah it's to send you off and give you a little fucking direction oh it's the grossest I mean it is amazing cuz I got to build relationships with people but like good for you for recognizing it Oh a hundred percent one hundred I knew they were doing so once you I mean not I mean that but I recognize you got to get out of it Oh a hundred percent it's my soul couldn't I couldn't ask people about them breaking up or something tragic happening in their lives like how are you doing now is run to some of them TMZ dudes that feel bad I'm like look bro I feel bad too but I'm not talking to you like yeah there's nothing good ever comes out of these like it's no disrespect to you I know you're doing a job I'd probably the same job if I was in your place probably yeah if I was a kid when I was a kid if TMZ was around I take that job yeah just try to ask some famous dude of a funny question but it was it's just like it's not the way to discuss things know we discuss things and you're coming out of the airport or you're on your way to a fucking restaurant somewhere and someone sticks a camera your friends like come on well I wasn't doing that that was I was we were going to junket no no yeah yeah like but I mean there's these these junkets are a brutal assault on reality you're saying the same thing over and over and over again you're asking this everyone asks you the same question you know tell so tell us about this show yeah Michael you play play Michael yo is your real name this is crazy oh by the way write this down okay Michael yo average SMO that's your your first comedy special you're gonna call it Michael yo average smile Michael yo average smoke because you could that's what you said when you're talking about the rock yeah it's like yo average smoke so that would be my second oh that's right you already have one I just came out with it yeah and when did it come out uh it on Amazon Prime is free came out two and a half weeks ago Oh miss consolation blasian cuz I'm black and Asian I get it yeah Tiger would say something like that no he said he's Kabul Asian when I Oprah and told her told her she wasn't he wasn't black and black people got so whoa that's a tough one to swallow I tell you what stuffer is I was up for a job it is a very prominent black producer told me I wasn't black enough for the job hold on there's tanning booths close by I'll be back in four days Rock the fucking world because dude like if you go to like a tanning booth everyday I could not get black yeah but I wouldn't get blunt I can get dark you could get dark but not black you can get by well what do they want whether they want it black like Wesley Snipes like no disrespect no this is buddy I guess they said but I think it was more than just skin color but they wanted a certain there's a certain woman yeah they want to like I don't like me you don't they Oh straight-up black dude right all right yeah you know something for me that's the thing that look if you're making a story and you know these characters in the story like say if you have some big fucking goon who terrorizes people you can't get Kevin Hart to play that role that doesn't make any sense no that's where the rock comes in all right big giant dude you know I'm saying I love them everyone has to have you know that's a weird thing about acting - it's like man you got to hope somebody has something that you would do good in you know like you've always hoped that someone's got a project that you could slot into that project yeah or you just got to create your own yeah that's true to me that you the best is Billy Bob Thornton that's Slingblade thing yeah I know what he did with their know he apparently he was like working on some movie like edit some bullshit part in some movie and he was like super depressed started doing this fucking character man man you know does that character from slinger and then would do it in the mirror and shit and practice it and decided to make a whole fucking movie about it and that movie will launch them like one idea well I mean it's kind of like what you're doing you just decided to do your own thing and now you control your own destiny that's where we all need to get to like honestly this you know I what I love about comedy right now is I like jo koy was my mentors and he's blown up in comedy you know so I see people like you Joe and you know pill / and just a feel Vaughn who took me out my very first time doing comedy ever did it really yeah Madison Wisconsin you know it I think it's called state on six or six and state that's the first time you ever got paid that's the first time I ever got paid and he's the first person to ever take me out and I remember we landing he goes you're not you're gonna see grown men eating cheese like like sharing bags of cheese as soon as we got off the plane literally two men on a bitch sharing a bag of cheese and he was like I told you like it is very weird so as we're the culture of cheese in Wisconsin anyway it's so good to make it now now - yells blown up like you're making your own path and I think what comedy now is the time where people can make their own path and control their own destiny and get paid really well I mean just go to Comedy Store look at the parking lot now Yonex well it's what it is now is you not dependent upon networks anymore yeah the networks that we've created or what I was like to refer to as an organic network like there's a network of friends like when you're talking about Bill burr or Tom Segura or Ari Shaffir whoever these people are crystally all these like really successful popular comedians right now Theo and so and so and so Andrew Santino these guys are all we're all friends with each other yeah and everyone knows like if someone says this guy is funny you're like well listen to the guys who are telling you these guys are all hilarious they know who the funny people are they know what the pretenders are - yeah they don't talk about them and they avoid them uh-huh and then you know who the funny people are and you just it's an organic Network like there's no paperwork but everybody helps everybody and one of the beautiful things about it is no one's fighting for scraps anymore it's yeah like there's TV shows and there's only like if you and me are in the audition room and we're friends but we're both auditioning for the same role like I don't really wish you wery well yeah I hope I might fuck with you I'm like dude you sweatin me doing nervous you okay easy Yeah right you're done nervous about that right you're gonna go in there and perform so you're not eating each other yeah eating each other you're not you're not scratching and clawing for scraps everybody can support each other because first of all there's fucking thousands of places to perform just in this country yeah thousands mm-hmm and there's not only a certain amount of comedians like there's plenty of room for everybody well what I love about like are you guys doing the podcast and blowing up it's Jason Segel I used to interview him a lot when he was making movies and stuff and he said the thing about Judd Apatow is after Freaks and Geeks Judd basically made his own network you know James Franco and those guys and they supported each other no matter what and I see that same thing happening now and it's good with comedians like comedians are pairing up and saying this is our group and if you're funny you're funny and let's let's watch each other's back instead of competing it's now like four you know I've only been in at nine years you know I know you've been in a lot longer but my nine years I saw at the beginning a lot of hate and now I'm seeing people like now jump on each other's podcast in it and actually encouraged each other you push each other which i think is a great shift for comedy right now well that's the big difference between podcast and radio cuz when you guys always hated other radio guys yeah they always thought of other radio guys like I want that morning spot this guy's gonna try steal it from me and he's he's across town fuck yeah the podcast don't do that we we get on each other's podcasts and we support each other's podcasts it's like there's plenty of people man does this famine mentalities would fucked everybody up it is but that's what Hollywood puts out there you know it's just the circumstances it's not like it's an organized effort no it's not there this famine mentality it's just that this there was a like we were talking about earlier like if you're an actor you you gotta hope somebody's got something that you fit into yeah so all the other dudes that are like you man you're competing against them and then you know you hear fucking some James Franco type dude got the role you like of course yeah he's famous fuck I can't I'm never gonna catch a break and this is the this is the feeling that a lot of like really depressed actors have well it's interesting because I was up for this huge hosting gig like last year and looked like I was gonna get it and then the night before they said oh we gave it to this bigger guy like he was just amazing no I won't say his name he's like no no no no no no no no make it rhyme no no you know me Joe I'm very safe I'm very safe Joe you gotta end in my ages goes you don't sound upset I was like nah cuz the way I'm wired is I need to get to that level where I'm getting jobs I don't deserve I see why you wouldn't say his name you playing it safe but you're not but he knows who he is no he's out there listening when they say you're better than you're better in the audition to him you did this but I said about you no no that's what they're telling me but your agents are telling no no no no the casting people are telling me this and but I don't try to fuck you no no not sure I'm positive positive so what I get to that point I'm just like IRA first I was like dude when you get to a certain level you get shit you don't necessarily he probably didn't even know he was going out for the show it really like hey we got a new contract and we heard you could do it you know what I mean yeah maybe but that's this industry once you get to a certain point you get gigs you start getting thing once your podcast blew up you can people send you stuff you know and that's how this whole thing works and so my mentality is I need to get to that point will start giving me things and that means working harder okay great working harder building my brand doing stand-up I'll do that don't ever say building your brand don't say that ever get building my brand don't do it ok don't ok that's some nonsense talk they throw around brand you're building your brand man hey dude I really love with you doing your through with your brand that's like a Hollywood thing that they said yeah yeah yeah I love what you're doing with your brand the fuck you don't think a brand is real well brands are real oh yeah I'm wearing converse sneakers those are real but see to me what I hear are same where Under Armour yeah I like the rock you always support campaigns my buddy campaign look at that nice wait a minute I like them no no no but but like what I you're probably having brand your podcast is a brand I don't think of it that way really well but it is an experience it's a brand but building my brand like literally there's zero thought of that ok got you know you just doing you I just just do what I want to do hey man just be yourself it's possible yeah I am absolutely just doing that you know I'm just really lucky that there's a slot right like that I have interests that are like there I can act like like the fact that I do stand-up comedy I also do cage fighting commentary yeah that's not supposed to exist right but you created it but it exists because there's a slot I got lucky that there was a slot there you know that this exists the sport exists and I have an understanding of it now a deep appreciation for it and then the comedy exists to then I like that too like you don't have to do comedy nobody has to do comedy but for me is like oh like you could do that but isn't it amazing like when like way I'll be honest with you when I came out I was like oh my god this is such a big show it's a huge show people get nervous I talk to a lot of people that come on the first time people get nervous coming to the show but yeah but what's amazing is do you ever think about like if somebody's on your show literally whatever they're selling or like you'll get somebody on this show that becomes a regular and now they're selling out all across the country and that's pretty amazing the power of that you hold you know what I mean which is great which is great which blows me away that you know like the last time I saw that I remember you know I was at Chelsea Lately at the beginning of it and when that show was at its peak I say Chelsea Lately Chelsea Handler was the American Idol of comedy and then if you were on that show I didn't even do stand-up like literally I was three months in I would bring five comedians and do like 15 minutes in between everybody and bring in sellout shows because I was on issues that's how much power like she brought comedians that were retired back she brought in that was the first time I saw like one show could be so powerful in a niche audience where if you love comedy you have to sell out all these people shows while it's hot and now it seems like this show is that like comedians come on here and they're just selling out all over the place and that's that's a tribute to you man and your audience how they're so passionate about you and I'm not here to kiss your ass but well it's just not not bullshitting people you're not having people on that suck yeah like doing your bet like I try to go after like to get guys on like guys that I don't know yeah hear about them you know like Andrew Schultz or Tim Dylan I hear about these guys from New York and people people tell me hey you got to see this guy this guy's fucking funny Joe lists a lot of people told me get these guys on and you know look I am a whatever I can do to support comedy I'm a fan I'm a fan of comedy I love it even if I was never doing it if I never decided right now I don't ever want to tell jokes on stage ever again I will always watch I love it I love stand-up I'll always love stand-up so if I can do something to help stand-up and helps comedians be successful and it helps encourage more people to try it because I think there's thousands and thousands of just unexplored stand-ups across the country they just never take a chance never do it never have anybody encourage them never think about doing it if you ever bet on say I think it's a superpower I really do because your senses are so high I've never been in a situation where when you're on stage you're saying your act you're thinking about something else you're hearing conversations like you're hearing a waitress take an order and you're noticing what people are doing like it's almost like an out-of-body experience like I in I can't think of any other normal time throughout the day that would ever happen where it's pretty amazing what your mind can do when you're on stage we have to Train it oh no I mean that's one of the reasons why I have to do so much stand-up yeah like even for me after 30 years of doing it I still have to do stand-up four days a week I do stand-up four days oh yeah if I don't do stand-up 40 if I take a week off that's fine nothing wrong with it I'll take a month off nothing wrong with that but understand that when it's time to roll again we're going four days a week we're gonna do two three shows a night you're gonna go Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday or you're gonna do Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday that's what you're doing and that's the only way to do it because if you don't do it that way and you don't do three sets of nine two sets a night four sets a night if you don't do that you never stay you got to get a laser beam sharp and the only way to get that that whole fucking samurai sword edge you got to constantly be doing it it's you that thing that you're doing where you're talking about hearing all these things but concentrating on what you're saying and being in the moment is the most critical cuz they know when you're not in the moment yeah they somehow another know when you're you could say the same words or the same inflection and it won't work that's what's amazing about it though that's what I love about it like oh I love how you could do two sets in a night and get a totally different reaction back it's so exciting I was talking to tar down Rowlett so he was like he was talking about one night he had a great set and the next one he didn't have too good of a set he says I went to a grocery store II got on the mic just to get a laugh cuz you can't go to bed on a bad show Donnell is amazing on podcast I try to talk him into doing a podcast oh he would be so good he's starting it he's already got a logo he's got it it's called it too soon with Donna wash cuz half his shit so he is so funny Manny he's perfect he's such a good dude too just like a good dude you know who's who's who's a person that I know you're so established down you got your crowd but who's a person that like after they go on you're like oh shit I got to bring it is that still that for you but because your crowd is sunk about it with everybody but I don't think about in terms like oh shit I like comedy this is the key to following people yeah like comedy enjoy it go onstage happy laughing and then do your stuff because it's you're working on it anyway it's good right if you if you take enough time and enough effort enough care on your craft and put together an act it's good the people are gonna enjoy it so don't worry yeah enjoy like if you like that's why I brought Joey Diaz in the road with me for so many years because I knew that he was just gonna erupt that place and by the way but when I went on stage they were already already in a great mood they're all laughing they're laughing hard this the keys just everybody should have a good time man everybody including your opening act in the middle act you want murderers to go on in front axle oohed Lee I you know like the comics I bring aren't as well known yet but Leo flowers Nick care Orlando labor but I tell you any room they crush they crush in sorry one way for great comics to get great bit it's like playing another gotta see them they gotta see him absolutely there's a lot of guys out there that people just haven't seen but they're good you know and I love coming in after energy what about what about the first time you went after a big comic when you were first starting and you did well and it kind of blew you away okay I don't even know when that happened I ate shit for so many years that's all I remember yeah I remember eating shit after everyone good I didn't have one good set for like mitts he used to set me up to she would do it on purpose she would put you like one more spot in my 20s I was young little cutie face and I would go on after fucking murderers yeah like Martin Lawrence when he was in his prime oh my god do when he was wearing leather jumpsuit I stayed leather shirts America in the room I mean Merck in the room where people were falling out of chairs and throwing drinks at each other Martin Lawrence was it's like church in his later church he was an assassin man I'm telling you people forgot how good he was for a few years there was a few years where Martin Lawrence was nuke and crowds just like boom yeah and I would get on after him and literally people with just three quarters of the audience would get up and walk when he was off they were done they were done they were ready to go home they were there were they were crying they were holding their body like Jesus and then I would get on say some nonsense let's get the fuck out it let's go eat and they would just leave and that was the reality of my time at The Comedy Store where Mitzi Widow she wanted you to know you ain't shit yeah I don't get crazy and you got to figure out how the fuck can you go on after all these murders well when did you figure it out took a long time yeah I don't know man when I came here I was only six years in a comedy so I really I didn't have any seasoning I was I was really like a scrub you know I was like I had some material I had like I could do an hour on the road but it was half of it was bullshit yeah yeah I was trying to figure it out but I had a few good bits but they weren't good enough and I didn't have the confidence to go on after a Martin Lawrence or a Dice Clay or anybody who was really good you know anybody who was a really famous I would get nervous or Jesus you know but that's that but through that I figured out a way to do it you know I figured out a way like okay I have to figure out a way to grab people and let them know that I know the situation yeah like all this unknown fucking loser has to follow Martin Lawrence what a thrill what a thrill for me watching everybody get up and so I think material for like bombing like like inevitable bombing and recognizing the bombing and addressing it with all the rest of the audience and then people start laughing you know I got I had a follow Pryor for five weeks in a row when he the comedy sort at The Comedy Store when he was really sick and the late great Marilyn Marilyn Martinez her husband and Chewie who was the door guard comstor used to help Richard Pryor to the stage and it would take forever because they would walk him this you know yeah losing control of his body and they sat him down they would crank the microphone up to like as loud as it goes so it's like you would hear the feedback and he would drink wee probably wasn't supposed to be doing because he was on medication drinking and just just talking and a lot of it was really sad because you realize like wow this is the greatest comic of our time I mean yeah he's on the wall here in the studio yeah I mean he's if he's not the greatest ever he's certainly in the conversation it's like who's the greatest I don't know but there's a handful of like it is super important pioneers is Lenny Bruce and there's Richard Pryor those are the two hop in my opinion that's the ones they're the most important for the art form this is obviously George Carlin and Kinnison and he's go down the line in AD Murphy who were talking about the show to still this day I think was one of the all-time great oh my god I was telling you before I got a chance to talk to Eddie like two years ago he came out with a serious movie more dramatic I forgot I forgot the name of it but it was really good and I asked them you know being a comment it's like why haven't you shot another special and he goes I have to put too much of my personal life in it and I'm not ready to do that yet and it kind of hit me where you know if you go back and listen to this comment he talked about his real life he talked about his parents he did a lot of what Richard Pryor did you know he's very personal and you gotta remember that he murdered a lots gone on in his life over the last 15 20 years and I think if he didn't address things when he hit the stage people go why didn't he talk about that where Chris Rock and Kevin Hart they will address whatever story is out about them and go full steam ahead and I think Eddie Murphy probably respects the craft too much where he's like I can't do it halfway if I if I'm not gonna do 100% I'm not gonna do it that's what I took from that conversation from him that makes sense and also just think about it he has two of the best specials probably ever made back did like the two biggest where everybody still no good at guca like people still can say laughs I know that's a lot you know like people still look he's he's an all-time great even if he never does a joke again but he still got it that's what's crazy hundred percent gosh did you ever see that thing that he did where he was roasting Bill Cosby when he took away his honorary degree dude his timing was sharp like you were like oh my god he could go do stand-up right now but the pressure of that because he has two specials it's kind of like I compared to dr. Dre after dr. Drake made the chronic day I was oh oh he's gonna come out with another one and then it got to a point where how do you back up I mean the greatness of those two specials I mean it's a lot to live up to not saying he ever couldn't but people are always gonna say man you remember delirious and raw I wish she was like that you know and I think that's the fear mean maybe I mean you can make that a lot of guys that did keep going you know a lot of guys but those guys that kept going to have a delirious raw you know like to net word that like I remember first time going to a movie theater to see a stand-up comedy special two times delirious and raw like who does that Kevin Hart does it but like that's your fellas my firt oh my god Eddie Murphy yeah on the big screen and those are locked in the history of time people are gonna know those two stand-up specials for raw for sure yeah serious I think was on HBO wasn't it I don't remember what's wrong I I think delirious was on it was it I think was an HBO special all I remember I think raw was in the mood raw okay so raw was in the movies but it's a kid like me going to the movies to see it and he was so big at the time and just to follow those up that might have been part of the problem with him - he might have got too big that happens to certain comedians like that happened to Steve Martin yeah and I see Martin talked about that uh-huh I mean I don't think either one of us is ever gonna understand how famous Eddie Murphy is like what it's like to be a Murphy at that time no I mean come on now man yes people see him and they get weirded out I got weirded out when I met him they put it in theaters four years after it aired on HBO delirious yes a Dice Clay had an HBO or a movie theater film he did he did a misread that Oh didn't Dice Clay had a movie theater one Gabriel Iglesias has done one that's been in the movies of course Kevin Hart has um there's been a few guys have done them in the movies but yeah but I remember like you know Kevin Hartz was great everybody but for some reason maybe because I was a kid it was so big to me but to me it was like an event yeah you know I'm older now I'll go to see Kevin Hart in a movie theater but when I was a kid stand-up was in a I wanted to like like that yeah because you're hearing curse words and you know you're hearing all these you're to this day still reciting stuff from in that's a lot of comedy specials you don't know the words thirty years later yeah well I the first special I ever saw for sure was Richard Pryor live in the Sunset Strip I thought my parents took me see it you were there yeah no no no no watch it in the movie theater oh okay okay now I was watching it in the movie theater my parents took me and I couldn't believe it like I had never seen anything that funny I couldn't imagine it it's so hard today for on anyone to understand what it was like to hear that stuff back in when I was at 79 that one was one was live on the Sunset Strip through that bear joke about the fire he was doing jokes about burning himself and we were crying laughing him years delirious what years it released in 83 was it really yeah in the sense that taped an ATT really okay so yeah that makes sense he had to tape it twice no I wasn't 39 16 well don't say 80 4583 18 15 I was 15 years old let's see I was I was nine so I saw I saw both of those movies and I remember I remember Richard Pryor I was like wow Eddie and Richard like you could tell Eddie studied Richard because they should same mannerisms they yeah a couple of the same jokes too just in a different way you know what I mean so it was kind of a thing where I fell in love with Richard Pryor because that was my first except I was nine you know in I saw Sunset Strip and then I saw the documentary where he had to shoot at two nights in a row the first night he bombed and he told everybody to come back the next night and that's the one they shot he's yeah he shot he shot at two nights in a row first one he apologized to the crowd it wasn't going well and the second night he said y'all need to come back and we're gonna try this again and so I would he want the same crowd because he felt like he did a disservice to them but what that's so weird the Rajasthan yes any Mesa teacher is true 100% it's in his documentary you don't believe it I believe it I didn't I mean that's what was in the documentary yeah but a comic wouldn't want the same crowd to come back well here the same material unless he stopped it short well no he didn't finish the show he didn't finish is wrong with him he said he was just off like he was him it was him and he goes any and they were talking about the first like 15 minutes of the set or twenty minutes of the set did not go well and he just stopped it and said look I'm not bringing it tonight it's off y'all come back tomorrow night Jesus Christ and they kept the cameras and they shot it the next night and that's and that's what you have in the nineteen so in 1983 I was either 14 or 15 and Meredith hears sorry I came out 82 this showed recently oh okay so whose 82 that means I was 14 yeah I was eight yeah I was either 14 or 15 which makes sense documentary this is a fun fact I definitely know it was pre pussy for me thought forgot all most of his material yeah College eyes to the audience and ended the show early leaving the audience angry Pryor pulled himself together and gave a much better performance to the next night most of the footage in the film was from the second performance yeah completely messed up his performance during the first filming of the show yeah but that doesn't say brought the same audience back well in the documentaries I said well because it was only one show what do you mean they didn't shoot to show specials like they only take one night well he said they filmed one and they filmed it yeah he filmed it again the next night right so that crowd I mean how are you gonna to get a crowd he can't get a crowd anywhere I in the documentary it said he used to say he told everybody because he felt so bad that he cares he just stopped the show he stopped the show is like yeah and he brought what the document says he brought the same crowd back the next night and he murdered and that's what you saw yeah Wow and I still remember that but I mean those two like raw delirious in the Sunset Strip life forms forever it will stand out in my mind it's just it's just amazing and then like bill burr special the the black and white one it's like incredible incredible you know and I just I love watching comedy of people with jokes that I know I never could do like that's my own thing you know I I don't like watching cuz I'm a family comedian so I never watched like fam what does that mean to me I talk about family most of the time like well you're you know I don't curse that much how often you curse in an hour show twice maybe what words use shit yeah you ever say fuck no no no hmm but person real-life freaking this freaking guy do you say that no don't say frickin whatever you do frickin that's a more offensive to me than fuck yeah oh no I just thought frickin guy it's not him I'm sure I curse a couple times in this pot but I don't it's not in my normal conversation like I even what I'm hanging out with my dudes I don't really encourage that much yeah hmm oh no and I'm sensitive yeah it's it's a lot going on that did you change oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it changes the shit out of you well it's a biological change it's also like you girls all girls it's also it's a recognition change like you you kind of understand life in a different perspective that I don't know if it's really available to you if you don't have children I don't think it is I just think it's I don't think everybody has to have kids I'm not one of those zealots it says if you don't have kids you in truth I don't I think that's offensive I don't think that's what life is all about I think you can affect people in a very meaningful way never have kids and there's nothing wrong with that but I think for me at least for being the caveman that I am it's like it was very important for me to see these little girls grow up and become you know human beings that are interfacing with the world and getting an understanding of what that means and like it's realizing that if you can do just a little bit to make the world a slightly better place that could greatly affect all the people that your own children will come in contact with as well and they can actually affect other people and have those other people treat the world in a different way and treat people with more respect and be nicer to people and you can we could have a better world for everybody well I your kids my kids everybody's kids the thing that struck me right away as soon as my son was born is I've never had the feeling of you I would as soon as I would die for him like as soon as I met him you know I would die for his soon as he touched me it's like a goddamn Prince song gone too soon yeah what about that guy God you want to talk about a super powerful fucking entertainer Oh one-of-a-kind human being I remember I was a kid I was delivering newspapers almost driving around uh-huh and I was I listened to out a cassette of I want to be your lover yeah like his first big hit mm-hmm and I was like holy shit listen to this guy like listen to this guy and the cover is just him with his long hair with no shirt on looking beautiful in the car what is he like what is going on here I was almost you know because I was like fucking 18 or something I was almost like turned off by the cover that's it right there oh yeah I was like this is just I'm not buying this it's too beautiful must have been weird feelings right and then I listened to I would you know I mean I listen to I want to be your lover no it's like god damn what an unusual dude did you see Purple Rain I'm sure you do have course like that whole Morris Day Apollonia like that wanted to meet you Prince I bought overcoat just say we're a long overcoat sought some Prince would where were you too old for the Michael Jackson a the the I had the thriller jacket no I don't know why that I thought the Michael Jackson thing was interesting because I thought he's obviously stunning incredibly talented performer but he was so weird and so unrelatable and everything like so oddly feminine and childlike even though he's in his 30s it was baffling to me I was like I get that he's super talented yeah and then when the plastic surgery started happening it's faced her changing and morphing like this is just strange did you ever see either one in concert no no one ever saw Prince I saw Prince now was an amazing show I had an opportunity to see Prince at the Hard Rock Cafe and I blew it the Hard Rock in Vegas below it I should have seen him I never thought he was gonna die yeah and that's what I'm seeing everybody now yeah you should Tom Petty is another one I never saw Tom Petty yeah I went to one of those print shows at the Palladium like four years ago a random 7 nights there wasn't anybody there there was maybe 500 people there really the whole floor was empty I don't know if why I don't know why I don't know if nobody knew or something they didn't announce at the right time it didn't make it to Twitter whatever I only heard cuz my friend worked there I only the only reason I knew well I think when we're looking at Prince now we're looking at Prince as like a dead legend I mean he's a legend that's going on and we think of him as like god damn it he was so good he had so many great songs but I think back then people thought of him as an older guy that they would didn't really care as much about anymore who hasn't put out real relatively popular music yeah for quite a while he turned into an artist I guess they could say where the music was just for himself and he wasn't really just a new yeah right it wasn't a new smash hits no you know it's like there's some guys right that like one of the things that keeps Kanye West relevant is that he's constantly putting out music yeah constantly puts out stuff that people love he constantly put some stuff that smashes and some guys lose their enthusiasm for productivity yeah but for being prolific they lose that and then they don't put out stuff anymore and then they become like Rod Stewart yeah Rod Stewart I'd like to see Rod Stewart I'm a giant Rod Stewart fan like it when Maggie Mae comes on the radio I get excited I love that goddamn song I love a lot of his music he was it but how many tickets we sell right now yeah I'm saying will he sell out the Staples Center I don't think you know you know you know when you I know you're still working on Kanye coming on the show and that's not even the United okay you know what if he wants to do it but I don't want to put any pressure on anybody absolutely I don't necessarily know the podcasts are the best place for someone for everybody it might not be the best place to just talk about shit but better just do music did you get to talk to him at least on the phone oh yeah yeah a nice guy let me tell you man he is so opposite his persona like on the outside like that you see in like in gossip magazines and on TV I I used to host his done to West foundation event in Chicago and a lot of people don't know the good he did in Chicago if they had perfect attendance he would go there every year throw a huge concert bring like common and all different types of Chicago artists he would bus everybody in from all over the city and throw a free concert for all these kids that had a perfect attendance and it was good to interview him that way because he sat at that time at that time when his mom was still alive he's such a down down the earth humble guy and actually shy and shy like he was really shy so wet and this is at the time I would see stories about him yelling at sway yeah yeah and like this is not - dude that I interviewed he's volatile yeah I was all over the place yeah that's part of why he's such an explosive artist oh he's incredible and crowd oohs guys those the people think different and that stupid Apple ad think different yeah there's people that really do think different mm-hmm differently that's one of the problems with that Apple ad - English Channel but the the there's people out there that just have a different vibe there they're on a different frequency they're different wavelength and they're the ones who create great shit man he has a gift I mean he is you know a lot of people outside go oh he's out there he's definitely out there yeah yeah but he's a genius yeah he is a genius he's doing something in a different way and that's that moves our culture along that's what it's like that's what when you're doing stand-up right like if you're if you're nailing something if you really lock down something and boom you put out live on the Sunset Strip or a delirious or somebody that you're changing culture you're you're making people people are gonna spread out in these ripples yeah gonna go to their job in the morning like we saw Michael yo holy shit he doesn't joke about his cat and whatever the fuck it is whatever the joke is people be crying and laughing and that there's ripples to that it's positive ripples they change things it's amazing that like when you do stand-up like what I love about it is when I was just a host doing the entertainment shows I would go into castings and I go oh you're a host go ahead now being a comedian it's the mote I will say that it's the most respected thing in our industry like I was honest most balls yeah I was on the set of Modern Family when the show was huge and the actors are like oh my god you do stand-up how do you do that and they're on the biggest television show at that time Modern Family even actors respected so how castings have changed I go in now they go oh we saw you have to improv oh we saw you're here there and you can host this is amazing you know so just the respect you get from doing good comedy you know it's it's better to me than a Taylor Swift on stage because she has a whole band she's having a bad night she can kind of like lip syncs sinker songs they have a quote it says Michael Yost says he's better than Taylor Swift and all she does his lip-sync god damn him you know when he was on e he respected her it's flipped you gotta wrap this up dude we all hope three hours in that crazy stops three o'clock dude what the fuck what the for three hours three o'clock bro no way goddamn time warp in this room dude yo that was a lot brother well thank you so much thank you my tell people how to find you on Instagram Twitter everything at Michael yo that's why oh and my specialist stream it free on Amazon Prime and now is right now go to it blaze everybody's got Prime yeah everybody's got problems out man I would appreciate it thank you my friend that was fun glad we
