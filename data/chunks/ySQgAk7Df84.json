streets MDMA and I I'd never taken any drugs I didn't even smoke pot came out of the Navy and everything else you're an attorney right yeah in in Houston I was an attorney then in Dallas I started a computer company I had a personal computer company that well in 1981 we out-grossed Microsoft you know I had four color picture and Forbes magazine made the front page of The Wall Street Journal and

with 16k of RAM and it was a 12-inch black and white monitor and a cassette tape deck is what we use for input and output and you'd have to load your your your boot program and then you get a crc error so you're just the tone and rewind it and then load it again and and we sold hundreds of these for 3,000 bucks each why and in parents that say you know why do I need this you know you got recipe program and pong and a couple games and I said I don't know how you need it but if your kids don't have this they're going to be left behind why when they're 30 years old and later I was talking at one of the Java conventions in San Francisco and a guy came up to me and gave me his car and he's CEO of a company like a hundred programmers and all and he said you don't remember me do you and I said no he says my dad bought a computer from you and you told him that would help me Wow so I don't know if anybody else got help but at least one customer turned out what what year was this uh let's see we went out of business i started in in 79 79 and we made it till 84 and it was it was great it was you know you heard of the dot-com bubble well this was the pc bubble before IBM got in and you know we'd run short on memory chips and I'd call it my friend at osborne he'd shipped me some and then when I got some back I'd ship him and it was a closed network is pretty good old boy thing you know fascinating and there's a lot of fun it was great fun but we didn't know what we're doing you know we're geeks and I didn't know anything about cash flow or business you know I've been an electrical engineer and a lawyer but I didn't know anything about business and so we we just sort of sold ourselves out of business and by the time we were done the last six eight nine months I was financing the thing by selling ecstasy what I know a guy my acting class you know how long I was in acting class years I loved it by the way for a lot of reasons mainly because it was just fun
