trained my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night all day it was that was a nutty scene man being there in the weigh-ins felt surreal I felt really like finally it happened yeah it was like it was crazy like the weight of the event was thick in the air it had this feel to it that was very different than any other show we'd ever put together it shows that that's the one show I wish I was that because it's so special it's gonna be tough to beat that but it'll never be you'll have big giant events for sure but it'll never be like that because that was the last block yeah corruption correct I was standing in front of the UFC getting into New York I got a little worried when I saw where was I think uh where I was in Atlanta doing light show by saw on the on Twitter like the crazy press conference with Connor doing that stuff oh my god it was kind of weird as like well it seems a little gimmicky blah blah blah and then the weigh-ins he looked a little more serious and then the night of the fights is like I mean you couldn't have written a better show I mean that the the fights the night the way everything happened it was amazing man nightmare far the best UFC I've ever seen in my far the the main event was almost it was almost bizarre it's almost bizarre how good Conor is almost bizarre the way he picked apart Eddie Alvarez almost bizarre but like magical that's almost a word I want to you correct like he touches motherfuckers with that left hand have you ever seen Eddie Alvarez just like they didn't look like they were in the same planet like one guy like looked like he was from Mars the other guy look like he's just a normal dude trying to figure it out but it looked like Eddie the moment he got hit was like what the fuck we could see on his face he was like holy but Jesus what am i doing it and they goes well alright this he's not very good at rest let me try this wrestling colors like that was your shot all brilliant for a long night I think Eddie realized like holy fuck oh he's already touched up a little bit when finally went in for the shot you know and I just think Connor knew then also that he had them and how calm was he ridiculous just calm upright and just waiting and then the accuracy of that combo that finally finished Eddie that's what I think makes Connor show specials is accuracy when he throws punches Eddie's moving as he's laying the stuff I've never seen anything like like you said it was straight-up magical I'm like alright well we've never seen a guy like this we just haven't I don't know if we ever well either it's really interesting too and I was interviewing him it's like you've gotta have some attributes if you want to beat me gotta beat all you got to be big give me these guys my size do what he's doin oh it's so he's a once-in-a-lifetime guy because he sent in the ceiling like there's no there's no boundaries for him like he's just like I'll fight Nate at 70 forty-five sure I'm murk although in 13 seconds and not come to 55 like we've never seen this kind of creativity and we've often never seen the UFC allow someone to do this either yeah well he's just such a unique personality it's undeniable but also his style in a lot of ways he kind of does a lot of like what Wonder Boy does but with less kicks like he throws kicks to the body he'll throw like some front kicks I mean you know like maybe 70% as many kicks wonder boys a little more kick heavy but it's that sideways style and he's but he I think he does it better like there's maybe something about the focus of the shots that he's landing the precision of them because wonder boy very rarely like touches somebody up like that with a punch she just doesn't have that kind of power yeah you're right I think Wonder Boy is better at surprising guys with his kicks and his angles but Connor sets it up nice landing combos yeah that are also precise in this power like he's touching dudes and you can see it on their face yeah touched Eddie that he's like what though well not only that he's like he's hitting him in a surprised way and I'm telegraphing it at all like his ability to like go from bouncing around to launching that shot is so quick it's so it's so precise and it's so focused and there's no fat in his movements it's just pop yeah and they said there's gonna be a big announcement afterwards and I'll say his girls pregnant which that's a personal big announcement for him but it I think he says he's gonna take time off and he wants a piece of the pie he wants a piece of WME and what you know what they're doing now which which is hilarious right I love it me too I love it and he's the first fighter ever that can talk like this how old he was kind of 26 maybe 27 26 I got think 28 I think he's a smart guy too I don't I mean I would hope at least I don't see him fighting deep into his 30s no especially the way he talks as he goes now that I have a kid I know what I bring the table I won't be set financially for the rest of my life you guys want me to fight again yeah I mean you need to be set for the rest of my life I wanna I want a part of this pie and he's his next fight and it's gonna be such a fight is with WME it's not with anyone out there if you think he's fighting first it could be mixed you're batshit crazy that's not happening for a very long time maybe maybe they work it out I don't think so I think the next fight again I don't know this just me going off whatever the hell I think Joe but I think his next fight would be Nate for the belt at 55 because if you think if you late could be even Tony they're both deserving and we're MMA Pierce we're balls deep in MMA we love it and one of those guys deserves it as far as numbers in a big pay-per-view it would have to be native do you really think they would do Nate again 100% Wow I don't think nadir Khan will fight unless it's if it's that's that if that has to be the matchups I think Connor will fight someone I think Connor might even fight Woodley you I think you'd see a fight with Woodley before you see Kabira Ferguson I think could be in first and we'll fight each other before anything else you know fucking crazy would be if he decided to go up and fight Woodley this it's so not obviously really has get through wonderboy again but does he it has to you think so well Dana said that's the Nets this immediately said a lot of shit he says good boys fighting for the title it's good point nah me sure if I have a title nah yeah he does that all the time I don't think that means anything thanks good point yeah I'm just going based off what your boy said he's like that's the next rematch but put it on me how these your more your friend and mine you're real you've worked on forever I'm not like the guy yeah yeah yeah I like Dana I just think you know you have close relationships I say your boy but he does say things and pulls back yeah if Woodley and that's there this is a thing I worry about though not you don't have to worry about some to think about how much power are they gonna give Connor forty five fifty five seventy just wraps up all the dude you know crazy that would be if he did it though I say let him do it let him try us he's gone we can't he's got to he'll say it would we'll say let me try fuck yeah would Leah say let me try weather would love that dude how crazy at math Square Garden after the fight the lights on the state in which they've never done before in the arena were Irish colours is pretty intense do you and Brian our arguing this do you think Conor McGregor is more well-known than Floyd Mayweather currently yes he boxing a bigger sport yeah cuz you look like did you look at Floyd Manny like the paper you numbers destroys anything Connors ever been close to that's true maybe not maybe no right I was arguing Conor is bigger guys social me and stuff like that but Floyd has more followers and on Instagram Twitter we can't judge it off that here's the thing the amount of excitement that Floyd generates does not even fucking compare to the amount of excitement that Conor generates that doesn't mean he's more popular to understand but it does kind of because the intensity of the popularity the love people might know who Floyd Mayweather is but when it comes to how many people love Floyd Mayweather is not even close it might be like some ridiculous 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 because when Conor gets out there they go fucking crazy crazy how many people are there to see Floyd Mayweather lose how many people are bored after Floyd Mayweather fights like Floyd Mayweather fights so skillfully and surgically that and doesn't take any chances hardly ever gets hit it's not Conor Mercs motherfuckers he wins the world tighter in the fastest ever title winning knockout ever what does he do after that he comes back and makes Eddie Alvarez look Eddie Alvarez world champion the guy was defending all diamond hall-of-famer and Conor makes him look like he has no business in there with him no business has zero success at all except for a couple of body shots this is why I think Conor's bigger and more trend just that because you just bailed on that word I did sorry Maron send a transcendent be because I just bailed right just fucking out like the heads of that I was like yeah I like I think I'm using it wrong like a family go and operation eject you um but how many successful black athletes do we know of Jude Gillen how many white Irish superstars do we know one yeah one one Wigan was a big star before he came to the United States and came to United States and eventually lost his belt but Barry McGuigan at one point in time was a huge star but nowhere near dizdar the Connery why in in this it goes for all athletes Connors the green elephant in the room everyone else we've seen before every once we know what they can kind of do collars this green elephant amongst all these grey elephants and there's nothing like him totally different the wholly different animal it's Crazy's elephant with two fucking trunks two got fifteen decks 15 bigs two tribes old with a leprechaun outfit erect high and now he has a little son on the way and they gave him a fucking Rolls Royce with his face on it how crazy is that what's interesting is how well he manages it all it's really interesting you know like that's the pressure in particular he doesn't seem no problem that at all it weird that's what makes him so special because that magnitude and the pressure and he has to deliver and he has to do those antics and then back it up yeah but he keeps pulling it off like you at the breast I was like all right this is stupid and this getting old to me but then we pulls off on like that was brilliant and you know I mean the guy steps in he loses to Diaz right takes the Diaz fight on short notice oh by the way after a staph infection here's something a lot of people only know a pretty significant staph infection was on antibiotics until like I think two weeks before the fight if you don't think that drains your gas tank you never had a staph infection and you never had to take can't abide acts antibiotics are brutal on your on your respiratory system yeah they're brutal on your whole body it's just your body wedged up yeah your body's made up of all this shit that you don't consider to be you but it is you stomach flora is a real part of you you know your body is essentially like an ecosystem and when you have a staph infection staph infections are dangerous it's fuck people die from them your and then so they hit you with some heavy-duty antibiotics I've had staffed twice and it's not fun and the first time I had it and I took the medication I couldn't believe how I felt so weird I felt lightheaded I felt weak I was whoa I trained right yep no energy super-strong stuff too and I was like wow imagine this guy fighting two weeks after this saying cuz there's no way you peak correctly No so he comes from that and then he fights Nate again you know few months later in a fucking crazy five round war and beats him by the narrowest of margins right don't you agree yeah that is very very close fight where some people thought that Nate won I mean not very good but it should be easy right I thought the decision was correct but I was like wow that's close fight so takes that fucking crazy chance comes back at fights that guy he Conor weighed 169 that's what he weighed when he weighed in that's what he weighed during the fight and they wanted to fight it fit in five years no I can be about seven let me do 70 Nate weighed probably around 190 something yeah he did I mean everybody says that nate is a 155-pound he is 100% but he's a way bigger man they've been then Conor is he just is you know so it's like who's gonna weigh more when they actually get in there Nate's gonna weigh more so he does that and then goes from there and just starches Eddie Alvarez like a world beater and just so relaxed and loosen they're so amazing I'm fuckin Madonna was at the show Madonna was in a dominant show Madonna was at the fights how crazy is that Madonna's instagramming momma we made it mama we made the red panty night it's red panty night in Madonna Europe think she's single where the fuck is my second belt I envisioned this where the focus me bail nuts man yeah he's fucking young actor man he's such a character and a and you know I thought he was gonna make a big announcer I thought his announcement was he's gonna retire but his NASA was I got life I'm gonna continue doing so you guys need - I need a share of the company yeah that's probably what the announcement was gonna be all along you know that he wants a piece of the pie I mean he's got an argument that he probably should get a percentage of the promotion because the the what they're selling is Conor McGregor they're selling the UFC plus Conor McGregor the question is how much of that card what would it be what would the paper we don't know what the numbers are so let's pretend the number is two million which would be like the greatest card of all time right probably wouldn't hit that I don't know whether I bet it's around 1/7 let's just say 2 million because it's easy to correct so let's say that what percentage bought it because a connor it might be a million 1 million plus for sure might be 1 million literacy might be 1 million plus 1 million people might have bought the pay-per-view specifically because of one human being that is not outrageous to say and but this is the other thing in Connors favorite name another star who can do that
