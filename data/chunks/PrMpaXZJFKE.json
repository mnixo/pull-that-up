hahaha hello freak bitches what were some when you were treating patients in the you know clinical pathology thing like what were some of the the patterns that you saw that were you know really for some of the real challenges that people face like growing up you know like what were the main themes that were the hardest hardest to deal with and bring into a healthy adult life trauma and disconnection mmm disconnection from like what Joe is saying in regards to mentorship having having a big brother or somebody in that role that they get aspired to be like that could coach them through challenging situations and going through trauma because trauma is so rampant and it's also our representation in our internalization of trauma some people take that on as an identity that they've been traumatized or they've been abused and and because it's not discussed it's in fact shamed it's not really dealt with above board whether it's people being traumatized sexually because the perpetrator the person actually doing the traumatic event they weren't integrated in their own sexuality so it came out in a perverse way or it was the internalization of something that seemed mild but because they didn't have the languaging and the opportunity to connect with somebody that it it held and seated over time like if you see animals in the wild when they get traumatized like if you were driving a car and you hit a deer the first thing that deer is going to do when it gets to the side of the road it's going to shake it out it's going to just move that somatically out of its body because trauma gets imprinted into the somatic infrastructure like but all he was talking about into the like the fascia trauma gets fat kids gets programmed into the body it also gets trauma will change the genetic expression you actually see the DNA genetic code change its expression at the time of trauma and that can be recapitulated transgenerational II so from generation to generation to generation I can still hold my parents term that my grandma is like epigenetic phenomenon yeah it's a transgenerational epigenetic phenomenon right so that's so crazy it's so crazy so we we are and that's what the Native Americans talk about like our actions right now do affects seven generations down the line because it takes that long to bleed it out of the genes unless you clear it that's one thing that's weird about opening for bands they will tune up while you're on stage well in that level yeah i mean when i work with shara was classy because she was the one that there was the by far the best job I ever had an opening for anybody because you know she had a great crowd she had transvestites and mothers with the grandmothers with their grandchildren the audience yeah collect 'ok if they do you know what that security told me if they ever saw a single straight guy along this thing and he looks straight they would they would track him all night because no no guy alone goes to a cher concert if you straight well that's a gay guy dancing and happy no problem ah so if someone's gonna be like a crazy stalker it's gonna be a straight straight guy but you is fond of them for ya you enjoyed working with her right yeah I really liked her do you have like a friendship with her do you contact her not anymore but you know she's very isolated yeah good person and yeah she was like she asked me about the world like she wasn't really in it because she wasn't really in go what's it like Angie you know she asked me about people and then one night we went to I said I talked her into going out much y'all I should look why don't you drop the outfits stop wearing a head top hat than a cane and like maybe nobody'll notice you know she really sure I could just fix her with the fucking tails does exactly flopping around the dead the dead just camping back and forth good knowing the ridge and she is you know so we go to an ice cream place and some like old but then I go and liquid french guy hey aren't you dude they're famous one what's her name that's all she had the hairs goes yeah who could ever forget all what's your name so they validated that she can't go out you know but I one guy that's yeah yeah but we have a good time you know we say it was a funny thing in the casino we would meet when I like in the in the arenas I would do my act then they'd have a break and then she'd come up so we'd never see each other except when she had it like a team prayer and sometimes I was in that but one night which when she's we would cross each other one night her grandmother and grandfather were there and she said to me she goes you just did a jizz joke my grandparents there I said and by the way your ass is out and your grandfather's looking at it did she started laughing I got flagged for a while where I was pulled every time I went to Vancouver Airport because one time I was leaving is weird my wife have got me a new bag it came with like she bought me some Cologne and then it came it was a Calvin Klein bag like just a duffle bag that came with the Cologne so I packed my stuff it was like a two day trip to New York was when I was first doing the Union I was looking for crews and I was interviewing producers and stuff like that and it was just a quick trip but then I came back and then they pulled me aside and then they test in my bag they're like your bag has tested positive for cocaine and I was like what I was like bullshit i was like show it to me as I I didn't know understand at the time when the like we found cocaine all over your bag Mike bullshit let me see there's no cocaine in my bag they said no no what like we tested it there's particles why would it be on there do you do cocaine I'm like never in my life not even tried it yeah well how was it all over your bag my I have no idea and then so we went in the back for hours nurture like that I can't quit playing this game we talked to your friend am I good well he would have told you the same thing so it's traveling with a friend I was like he would have told you the song to try to go good cop back home I yeah he's like he told us the drill and I was like what was real yeah that we went to New York we're looking at developing a documentary and then and it finally came down to where I said okay like tell me how this particle thing works because I did the night deposit for my night club the night before right and they say a large majority of money especially in nightclubs in stuff I ask cocaine on it right people do a rail wiper and grab the bill and I'd done the cash deposit for the night club right before our flight I put it in that bag went to the night deposit put it in the bank and then I flew out of like six or seven in the morn I like pack my gear and so I said could it be that like cocaine was on the money that was then in my bag that in there like yes we can trace particles like that I'm like well then there's your answer but then they looked at my club strip club she does this and then there's an just like we're in there longer and I was like oh so every time I came back and here's the interesting thing is every time I came back to Vancouver yo flagged they pulled me aside pull me and finally it was so mad it was like one in the morning I was like please just don't pull me aside I'm so tired I gotta drive to the outskirts of Vancouver to stay in my buddy's place I just want to go to bed to make Trina please go to the side I'm like so I was so mad I just laid on their metal counter I was tired neck because you know they do the thing where they put you over them and nobody comes for like half hour you just make you sit there so I just laid i start napping his exhaust like 130 in the morning coming back from New York I laid up there and the girl comes to get down I'm like I'm tired 130 in the morning i'm really tired and I'm not playing any games like she and I finally just said why am I getting pulled over all the time I've never broken a law you can't think there's nothing every check your thing I've never done anything I've never brought over items that I shouldn't I haven't mean and she's like well the big problem is is that one time your bag of tests and I was like I explained that and that should all be in the notes right said yeah but we always don't trust it when you say you don't do the product right and it's all over your bag because then we think you're a smuggler she's like you're almost better to just say yep I did some cocaine with friends or whatever and we don't have any on me and I was like but I don't I don't do it I'm not gonna say I did it she's like well that's why they think you're maybe a smuggler you're doing quick trips to New York it's on your bag well it's like the guy who got in trouble for structuring yes I can't like the same you did it similar to it is we're gonna take your money was just cash yeah they have a bunch of different techniques that they teach these knuckleheads to try to like recognize shady people and so they like think they're fucking spies or they think they're detectives staring everybody I don't know about that Jamie Vernon look at his face I i saw a deceptive tick sir i immediately pulled out of the line i actually got the guy really pissed off on it because i used to get these were the canadian guys and I'm a Canadian so I was like you can't kick me out of my own country so I battle with them a little bit harder right and the one guy asked means like have you ever done in narcotic and I was like no never done narcotics like you never smoked weed I'm like that's not a narcotic narcotic comes from the Latin word meaning narcosis causing a sleep induced state which is usually applied to opiates and heroin supply I know if I was like Meryl dear i was like marijuana is a psycho tropical dragging he's just like sucking tropez psychotropic right inside goes like a part of the world and and uh and he was just like let's not get to the nitty-gritty and said no no your border guard you're asking me questions i'm answering honestly so if you're gonna ask me questions you make sure you answer the you ask me the right one and i will give you the recur echt answer and he was like go yes I you can go that's the difference you Canadians in America Americans are fuck this guy make them way Canadians more willing to admit defeat excuse me sorry
