do we have enough left for tomorrow we don't have tomorrow good Ben Shapiro we are live the people have spoken well thank you for having me thanks for being here man I became a fan of yours when I watched you with what the fuck is his name the CNN Piers Morgan oh that was glorious when you went after him dissent with the Sandy Hook thing like right away immediately like it was just glorious and you could tell that he didn't know what to do with it and he literally said how dare you which is what I say with to people all the time when I'm joking yes thank you was clutching his pearls he he was really pissed he was it was a two segment interview and during the break I said to him thanks so much for having me on it kind of growled at me he was not a happy camper yeah well you crushed him and the other one of my other favorite ones was Chelsea Handler crushing him or she was literally talking like you don't even talk to me in the brake and the brake you're checking your phone and checking Twitter and you could tell he was like oh no he just you know he came from that weird British tabloid environment and you found out that the company that he worked for did really creepy shit like check people's voicemails they hacked into people's people who are dead and they gave the family false hope because they had checked the voicemail and they found out that someone checked in they thought oh maybe she's still alive and then we made him a host unlike the x-factor and brought him on Sienna is awesome I just decision all around why CNN thought that we have this fascination with British people yes if you have a British accent we automatically had 20 points to IQ yeah they're great for like selling mops late night and nonstick cookware and I enjoyed John Oliver I think John Oliver is great apparently he has you know a lot of people think of all British accents as being the same but he has like blue collar British accent but I don't I can't tell the difference too much except when I'm watching my fair lady or something well I could tell people from like Manchester and stuff like that because they you know they they have like this sort of like way of talking so fast that all the words kind of pile into each other but uh yeah Oliver's his his recent one any Bravo got really matter the recent one about Alex Jones is fucking hilarious well you see it's almost impossible to make something not funny about Alex Jones yeah you gotta meet Alex have you met him I don't know that given how much I've made fun of him strip off his shirt and start he might calm down you're a good guy we're basically on the same team come around if you remember the Piers Morgan thing happened two nights after Alex was on Piers Morgan so element so appears was like flying high because he had that whole debate with Alex and Alex did his schtick and it was really over the top and he thought I was gonna be like Alex Jones par tunas gonna be peers you know succeeds again and Alex and I could not be more different than richest no you're very rational and very reasonable and you know we've been talking about some of your debates there's not a lot of guys like you out there which is really interesting it's like you're a fast thinking fast talking very smart young guy who's also a conservative like there's not a lot of those out there and this is one of the things that we're encountering today is they're especially on college campuses there's this very strange separation between the left and the right to the point where the right is like almost non-existent or at least doesn't have any representation and they're actively shunning that representation like they're pushing people out I know what's going on with you and Berkeley has been resolved yeah I think that so Berkeley after the publicity they said they're gonna explain to people if they don't know the whole story yes so UC Berkeley if you recall last year I actually spoke there before any of this happened I spoke at UC Berkeley in like April 2016 and then Milo was supposed to speak there and he actually went there and there was a riot where an Tifa infiltrated the the student community and there are all these pictures of them bombing things and you know blowing up cars and under setting them to fire at least and throwing things at windows and so Berkeley shut down that event for safety reasons then Ann Coulter wanted to speak there and they basically used what they call time place and manner restrictions to stop her they kept saying we have safety problems we can't figure out how to do the events and in the end they just canceled that because they didn't have security and then young America's Foundation which sponsors me to go to a lot of these campuses they said we want Shapiro to come and again I spoke there like a year and a half ago and they give them two and a half months advance and Berkeley said well we have no venues available and so this seemed to be another cover for we're not going to allow a conservative on campus because there are security problems so we made that public and then Berkeley said no no well we'll make we'll make sure that you get in they give us an alternative venue and so they even said they'd cover the security they didn't like the bad publicity oh well that's nice yes that should be good well you know what happened with Jordan Peterson yesterday yes yeah just yesterday Jordan Peterson was banned from YouTube and YouTube has a new policy that uh it's very it's very weirdly worded but apparently they're allowed to block and restrict any kind of videos that are about religion or that could be deemed offensive which is almost everything yeah that's right anything that's remotely if I mean anything that's interesting is going to be offensive to somebody so it won't be monetized it also won't be in the emoto's of interest or I know they did this to Prager University as well they blocked like ten of their videos a couple of months ago so it's it's yeah I mean this is nasty stuff and listen YouTube's a private company they have the right to do what they want but don't proclaim that you're a free speech promoting institution if you're gonna block people like Jordan Peterson for God's sake well the problem is they're not blocking things that are offensive to other people they're not blocking certain things that are representing Islam in a positive light that's right there's there's a lot of weirdness with this left-wing choice of what to censor and what not to censor and it's it's not just dangerous it's also bad for the whole idea of being a progressive or being a liberal because it makes you look it makes them look really petty and really weird and really resistant and hesitant to actually have real debate yeah for sure I mean this is one of the reasons why I'm very meticulous in my terminology about people who are on the other side of the aisle actually separate people who are liberal from people who are leftist so when they're people who try to ban speech I call them leftist and if they are not interested in banning speech then their liberal meaning they they want bigger government they disagree with me on politics but they're still willing to have a conversation they want an open forum people who are on the hard left think that it's actually an insult to their identity to disagree with them and this is what I experience sometimes on campuses you know at Cal State LA where there's a near riot when I speak or University of Wisconsin where people storm the stage and stand in front of it and won't leave Penn State we have again another near violence incident over at Penn State or DePaul where they actually banned me outright so sometimes you get this routine from people who think that they conflate their viewpoint with their identity and then if you have a different viewpoint you're denying them their humanity and it's like no I'm not denying you I just think what you're saying is dumb like that's a very good point that's a very good point is that they have their identity completely connected with their ideology and when you oppose these people when you have these debates of these people what's really fascinating is the level of a stereo that gets reached while you're staying calm yeah that's what I've noticed is is that there's a ton of you know I tend to keep relatively calm just as a human being and very often when I'm debating someone you see them getting more and more and more emotional and people on the right love this because of course it's the triggering of the snowflakes but the easiest thing in the world to do is trigger some idiot college kid who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground and what's what's hard to do is actually discuss issues with somebody who's intelligent enough to make the to make the point but it's it that the level of hysteria on the campuses has really increased I mean I don't have to travel with two members of security to every campus just because you don't know which campus is gonna go off I never had to travel a security before it's the weirdest thing in the world how long did this start happening well February of 2016 is when I started traveling with security so I spoke at University of Missouri they remember they had a big blowup at University of Missouri with black lives matter taking over campus offices and suggesting there's some sort of big racism problem at Mizzou which is just ridiculous and so they flew me and I did a speech there and then the next time I spoke was Cal State LA and they brought in a couple of security guys and I was like what do I need security for man I'm just speaking on a campus who cares we get to the campus and they had already tried to cancel my speech because of security and I said I'm coming anyway so tough I had to be escorted in by 20 armed police officers I had to be escorted off campus by motorcycle cops flashing their lights there were 300 students who had blocked all of the entrances were physically assaulting people trying to get into the theater the police had to sneak the students in two-by-two into the theater they told them that until I left the campus they couldn't actually let the kids out of the theater because they were afraid that if they let the kids out of the theater they'd be attacked as they got as they were released it was that one was pretty wild so after that it was like okay well I guess the security is necessary what is shifting like what what is what is ramping I think the identity politics is ramping things up so I think there's a new mentality out there it's the this intersectionality politics on the left that says that they're a bunch of victim groups basically are their blacks and Hispanics and gays and Jews and Asians they're all victim groups and we get those all those people together to attack the system because the system is keeping them down and if you and there's a hierarchy among these victim groups and if you are a straight white male you're at the very very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of viewpoints that should be acknowledged because you're the creators of this vast white supremacist system that keeps down everybody else if you're a black woman you're near the top right if you're LGBT you're at the top if you're a white guy and you challenge the viewpoint of a black woman your viewpoint is an attack on her identity and therefore she has the right to shut you down and so the idea is that your words are violence to her identity and therefore she has the right to react this is the term you hear on campus a lot is microaggressions this idea that my opinion micro aggresses you now even that terminology I think is really stupid because normally in regular life we would say that's insulting and you said something I don't like the terminology microaggressions suggests aggression like I'm actually doing something aggressive to you and the rational response to someone aggressing you is to use physical force in response and so you saw you start to see a more violent response I think that's it's been growing in our politics I think there's a reactionary side on the right that's that's growing and if there's an identity politics on the left that says no black eyed any politics gay identity politics female identity politics I think you're starting to see in some areas of white identity politics that's almost formed in response like okay well if everybody else gets to have their identity politics why can't we defend ourselves on those same grounds I hate that shit I hate that shit too and I would like to find the person who invented the term microaggression that fucker whoever it was they they created quite a mess now I'm sure you saw what happened in Evergreen with Brett Weinstein where literally the left is eating itself and that's where it gets crazy is like you're not progressive enough unless you're literally submitting to leaving your class because you're white like you can't be there because you're white they want a day of absence meaning the professor's the white people and then when you don't do it you're somehow another racist and a Nazi I mean the whole thing is the whole thing was very bizarre to watch but but not sure not surprising because you see it so much so often all over the country right now and it's almost like some new flower of ridiculous thinking and behavior yet has blossomed and it's in bloom everywhere and when people could point to it existing in other places like in Missouri with that woman that was your name Crick was that woman who click yeah yeah whatever her name was yeah but when you see it in video when you see her on video saying can we get some muscle over here exactly like this is fucking insane like you're telling a photographer and by the way a minority an asian asian man taking photos of a public place that you've created some safe space but it's it's it's this weird thing where it's half of it as identity politics but it's also wrapped up in this need to control people and control people's behavior control their vernacular control the way they communicate and how you know how much you give in to groupthink it's it's weird it's it's scary and a Jonathan Hyde is a social psychologist over done why you hit a really good piece for the Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon this kind of safe space trigger warning phenomena on this idea that you must never be forced into a position where someone has an idea that opposes yours and what he said is it basically makes people crazy you know it actually makes you crazy that the idea in psychology is that if you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome if you're depressed or if you're depressive then you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome the way that psychologists deal with that is with cognitive behavioral therapy they say ok we're in this chain of thoughts are you going wrong are you attributing to somebody a motive they don't have right is your wife really being nasty or is it you just attributing nasty to her and that's why you're getting depressed you're spinning off right try to control your own train of thoughts what the microaggression trigger warning culture does is it actually grants lay out the more you are offended the more value you are granted and therefore you have actually an interest in being offended we give you awards if you're offended right you're you're treasured if you're offended because it demonstrates that you're woke right you're well the more you are offended the more we can show that you are woke and because you are woke therefore you're granted this virtue you get to lord it over everyone else I mean I say in my speeches if we could somehow identify like the LGBTQ half black half Hispanic 1/4 Native American little person you know then we would finally have the the person who we could go to to answer all of our questions because their identity would be unquestionable biota right if we could find Yoda we could just get rid of democracy in discussion all together he just rule from on high he she I don't want to put a gender on Yoda right I don't think yo does Genoa gotta be a guy deep voice maybe we're being rude but inside no but yeah you're absolutely right is no one is uh no one's left enough yeah it's it's I don't know where the limit is and it's they're so far left that they've actually made come and cross with the people they hate right so then they talk about safe spaces and say it yet Missouri yet all these black students protesting and they actually said we don't want white people who think like us and who want to help us in our safe spaces we feel insulted by that I just thought to myself oh the KKK agrees like if you want to do safe spaces for separate races I can find some Jim Crow racists are totally up for that from like 1962 well there's the the really bizarre statement that I've heard over and over again that black people cannot be racist against white people because they don't have any power over white people yes Wow which is just it's inane I mean it's in the naiton statement this idea that you have to you have to have power in the superstructure in order for you to even to be erased I can understand the argument if they said look you being racist is not connected to racist action if you don't have the capacity for action that affects people then your personal racism is not as important as the racism of people in power then at least is an argument right the idea that you can't be racist at all if you're if you're black because black people don't have enough power first of all the idea that black people have no power in the United States is utterly crazy I mean it's utterly crazy well especially when I was going on more well Obama was president the Attorney General was was president yeah we said this about Baltimore we kept hearing you Baltimore right were they the riots they but with a dry 'its and they were saying well Baltimore PD you know they're they're cracking down on black people okay the chief of police was black the majority of the City Council was black and Democrat the entire day the the deputy the district attorney was prosecuting the case was black the majority of the police department was minority the Attorney General of the United States was black the President of the United States was black but up here in the majority of the city of Baltimore is black but apparently it's the white guy's fault like I just at some point you're gonna have to make your ideas actually work in concert with reality okay I can't like do this with you do you ever step back and look at this trend and look at what's going on in popular culture and looking what's going on with identity politics in this war between the left and the right and wonder where it's going I mean how it feels like the people on the left are completely emboldened by the fact that you have this guy in office who has said things like grab him by the pussy and he lies all the time and makes fun of people's plastic surgery and you you think that having this guy in in this position I guess in some way emboldened them and makes them even more convinced the fact they're right you know fight but put up the resistance and the huge tag resistance hashtag resist it's all over the place where does this go I think well no place good I think what's happening and it's one of the things that I personally am not a fan of and this goes all the way back to the Piers Morgan debate that you mentioned I mean I started off that debate with Piers Morgan saying to him you don't get to in tribute intent to me that I don't have right right you're standing on the graves of the kids of Sandy Hook in order to promote your political agenda implying I don't care enough about dead kids because I don't agree with you that is the sweet spot where a lot of people like to live which is if we disagree on politics it's because you're an asshole right it's not it's not because we disagree on the best method to get to the goal or we have different goals is because you're a bad person and I think that what you're seeing is with Trump there's an attempt to cast all of his voters as people who love all of the things that are bad that he does and says it's not that they voted for him because they thought Hillary Clinton was the worst presidential candidate in the history of America which is true right it's they they voted for him because they liked to grab him by the p-word stuff right they voted for him because they like that he's vulgar and he lies a lot they voted for him because they are bad people right there this is why people misread I think Hillary Clinton's deplorable speech and the implication was okay everybody who voted for Trump is a bad human being they tried this with Romney too I mean they tried to cast to get Romney who's whatever you can say about Mitt Romney Mitt Romney was maybe the most honorable person ever to run for the presidency they tried to cast him as Jill Biden said a guy who wants to put y'all back in Chains and he said that he he straps dogs to the top of his car is an evil man Stieg i oh yeah this was a big issue as dogs so there was there was a there's a story and he was in the Boston Globe about how like back in 1982 he went on a family vacation and when they're traveling he put the dog in a cage and put the dog on the top of his car and this is and this was like a big campaign issue right remember binders full of women and you remember in the 47% number exactly he's mean he hates the poor he hates what the binders full of women thing was particularly stupid because the entire point he was making is that I was trying to recruit women to my administrations they bring binders full of female resumes to me right so I could staff more women and they turned it into binders full of woman he's like Hugh Hefner yeah Mitt Romney like really so this attempt to castigate the other side is really bad and I think that you see some of that on the right but I think it's more reactionary I think that the unearned moral superiority that the left likes to kind of wallow in I think that's that's more on the left and on the right although I think that there is an attempt by some on the right now in response to do some of that well it becomes these sticking points that you use to win you know and it becomes something that people repeat over and over again you know like the deplorable thing racist sexist bigoted homophobe yeah it's just I was walking down New York City down the street right after Trump won when they were protesting and there was this guy right next to me fucking screaming he wasn't even in the actual parade itself he was like on the sidewalk but he was screaming Donald Trump KKK racist sexist anti-gay yeah ed just boiled it down to this thing but the best part about it was he saw a black guy coming towards him and he just started screaming black lives matter I just I just I saw him I saw his soul like in that one move exact shift to screaming black lives matter when he saw a black guy yeah there's the intersectionality for you right you know you have to know how to appeal to every racial group on the basis of a stereotype it could've been Thomas Sowell they wouldn't have known yeah it's almost like the the laziness in having the ability to communicate is one thing but having the ability to express a complete thought that covers something as nuanced in this complex as American politics in 2017 that's too hard so let's just yell out Donald Trump okay and this this ability to like boil down what's the difference between the left and the right to like a little statement is or you know a bucket of deplorable basket of deplorable whatever it is you know but binders of women it's so tempting cuz it's like it's so powerful that it works you put it on the back of a bumper sticker and I think we've also been shaped a little bit by a look we all we all live in Hollywood I mean you live in Hollywood I live in Hollywood that means that and I think all of America lives in that milieu because everyone watches TV everybody watches movies so when we do politics we tend to see it through the prism of house of cards or any of the other political movies you've ever seen and that means there's a bad guy right everybody there's a bad guy there's a villain and the villain house it can't just be the de villain is somebody who's incompetent like usually in politics if somebody is bad sometimes they have a malevolent point of view that's pretty rare usually it's somebody who's misguided they have some bad ideas usually they're just stupid or incompetent like this is what I keep saying to people who oppose Trump like why are you attributing to him malice when stupidity would do well you keep saying that everything Trump is doing is out of some sort of malicious genius are we watching the same film like if you have a problem with Trump it seems I have a solution for the left by the way if they if they really hate Trump this much listen I thought Obama was a crappy president I have a deal how about we just minimized the power of Washington DC and then we don't have to give a crap who's the President of the United States you think anybody in 1832 really cared who the president was he had no impact on their lives but now the presidency has this outsized impact we care about Washington all the time we treated that mean the truth as we watch it for fun I mean right now the last week particularly with Skinner Moochie you know it's impossible not to watch it for fun but it's actually kind of serious business like there are other world leaders who are actually looking at this like this impacts my nation for us we look at it we go well I wonder what's on TV on tonight's episode of Trump the series when you say reduce the power of the president I think there's a lot of people that would think that would be a great idea because having one person has the authority over 300 plus million people it is kind of ridiculous at this point time but how would you go about doing that like what would be the best way to implement something like that I mean it really isn't just the presidency you'd have to reduce the power of Congress as well I mean you have to you have to go back to a federalist based system where localities and states have more power over over local issues and the federal government isn't that powerful because what's happened basically in the concert to tional structure the federal government was never supposed to be anywhere near the speck right that there are very certain delegated powers in the Constitution of the United States that Congress has and they are very small I mean it's things like building post offices and interstate roads and regulating interstate commerce but the idea that they could regulate you know your toilet flushing is just that that's silly I mean the founders would have thought that was ridiculous yet you have a federal government that that's that's that big so Congress regulates on that but if you're in Congress the last thing you want is to be answerable for that so what you do instead is you drop vague statutes right you say things like we hope but we're passing a law that says that we should fix the environment and then you kick it over to the executive branch and the executive branch you know run by President Trump or President Obama has a bunch of executive branch agencies like the EPA and the APA puts together all these regulations that you've never seen never heard of you never elected these people they put together all the regulations and then those are the ones that actually govern your lives so if you're in Congress and things go bad you say well that's not what I meant to do I told them do good stuff and the bureaucrats were not elected don't have to care so basically we have everyone kicking the they can to the other person for purposes of responsibility the only way this is going to happen is if the American people just decide they're sick of the federal government running all this stuff and they start actively working to elect people who want to minimize their own power which is difficult I mean most people in power don't want to minimize their own power yeah that seems almost impossible it seems like no one who's worked so hard to get to the top of the game he's gone truck the other way to do it is to elect people on the state level who are pretty zealous about their own authority right you've seen this from like Greg Abbott in Texas that every so often he'll say to the federal government listen you're telling me to do something go screw yourselves like what are you gonna do about it well Texas is a weird one like they're almost ready to leave yeah at any point ready to put a fence up and go fuck you I mean weren't they for the longest time they were they were not really a state right yeah they're still called the republic of Genesis right yeah I mean people in Texas I mean it it's a wonderful state I love that when you drive through Texas every single store is called Lone Star yeah you know Lone Star brewery or Texas this everything is named after the state like nothing is really named after the country it's all named after the state like a lot of state pride in Texas there's a lot of State pride maybe more than any place else I've ever been yeah well not a lot of state pride in California because everybody's a transplant and yeah it's um you know people who get here and it represents something that they always wanted you know some sort of a liberal paradise where you could get famous for doing nothing there's some city pride like there's how enterprise or San Jose pride but like California pregnant on the state are idiots well California is so confused I mean we have a grizzly bear on our flag but we don't have crizzley bears we have we have a team called the Los Angeles Lakers not awaken them our legs are all man-made we have to keep pumping water in because they fucking dry up a river is just a giant concrete yeah Raveena yeah is hilarious when when I've shown people the LA River my tester LA River they like shut up yeah the LA River like it just it is la it's a fucking concrete shitty slide for water the city is so dirty I mean it's it's like I've grown up my entire life here I mean I was born in Burbank grew up in North Hollywood like this is the Evolet of my entire life the first time I realized I liked it is when I moved to Boston for law school because at least the weather here is good yeah but yeah I mean it's gotten so shabby lately it's such a shabby city the weather is amazing but have you ever been to Mexico City no I've been a couple times for UFC events I'm not going back because I would get headaches from the pollution and them and what Mexico City to me is is like LA in the future but with zero respect for the traffic lights what I mean zero I've never seen anything like it it's crazy they're very nice people everybody's worried about getting kidnapped over there I find Mexican people to be some of the nicest people and real friendly and easy to get along with but they don't give a fuck about traffic lights when we were stuck in traffic look there's bumper-to-bumper and two green like going this way cars just go in front of you and they just sort of make their way through and people hit the brakes and they make their way through the intersection it's a straight up red light and they just go and it's not just one one guy goes and another guy goes behind them and then you got like 20 cars and and it's just gridlock yes but it's actually indicative of why the United States works that people actually follow traffic it's like it's true in Italy also it's true in Israel like when I visited Israel with my wife when we got married like no one pays attention to the traffic rules everyone's honking their horns at each other I'm American so why are these people so rude all the time that's like honk the horn she's really but it is why in America because we have a baseline and this is what I think is breaking down actually so not to get too deep on a point about Mexican city traffic but I think that you know the country was based on this idea there's a social fabric we all have respect for each other enough that we're gonna follow the basic rules of the game and that's true as far as traffic lights it's true as far as financial dealings with one another and when you lose that when you lose the basic respect for the guy who lives next to you you know you need to get through the red light you know screw him it doesn't matter if it's red then it's kind of indicative of a culture in collapse generally when small rules start to go broken like in Italy the problem in Italy is that 50% of their economy is black market because they have high tax rates and no one pays them you're starting to that in California too California is the highest taxes in the country by far we also have the number-one rate of deductions so we pass all these high taxes so we can you know congratulate ourselves for social justice and then we avoid all the taxes as much as we possibly can to want to pull for the accountants yeah exactly those people are making a freaking fortune well I just also feel like when you get a giant number of people smashed into a small area and with la it's not even a small area it includes Greater Orange County and it goes into the Conejo Valley and it's just like there's so many of us there's so again it's it's almost like you get that sort of diffusion of responsibility thing where there's just too many people to care about and you lose this feeling of value that you have for fellow people I lived in Boulder for a little while and when I lived there the People's Republic of Boulder you want to talk about lefties oh yeah holy shit if you have a if you had a right wing anything on your lawn like a sign for someone running for they would take it down they literally take things down but when I was there I was amazing how many people are polite when they drive and they wave and like there's only a hundred thousand people exactly so that I was gonna say I'm looking it up while we're sitting here it's like 110,000 people in there and the population of LA County is 10 million people it's it's plus Mexicans you gotta count Mexicans and then you gotta count everybody's - connected to all the other counties around it's not like there's some border yeah let's drive around that's exactly right so it's it is the first time I visited Oklahoma I had this you know I was in Oklahoma for doing a radio show California will be about twenty three point seven seven million yeah sorry go away yeah I'm in Oklahoma and I'm walking down the street and the first thing that and and just some lady and I catch eyes now in LA you're from LA you look away right you're only gonna stabbed you know that if you catch eyes with somebody you meet it's rude you don't catch eyes with people in LA and among the street we catch eyes that he goes how are you I called my father I was like what the where am i what's going on here like this is not regular but I do think that there is something to the idea that if you have too many people in too small of space well we're all up in each other's business so much that it's very hard to say to people okay Liberty stay away from one another leave each other alone it's like yeah but he lives next door and he's a jackass hate that guy cuz he's like right next to you run Oklahoma the guy next to yous three miles down the hook there's that and there's also it's been replicated in rat population density studies that you get more mental illness you get more weird aggressive behavior when they stack rats and these cubicles and then just jam them closer and closer together and that's exactly what's happening with people to what Manhattan is famous for it I mean I I enjoy visiting Manhattan and every time I'm there I'm always like no I can't I can't right here oh yes too many humans there last week and I like the sky so you can't actually see the sky in Manhattan right I mean you see the brick buildings and you know 25 stories high and I noticed that we were walking back to past a store and there was a shirt on sale and the shirts entire text was fu you effing eff and I thought only in New York could you sell this right I mean try to take this anywhere else and people would've been like wait what now but in New York I'm sure that's a best-seller that's why honestly I think it's one of the reasons why Trump won is because he's basically just a guy from New York he's like a taxi driver from New York who's really really wealthy and you know he does what a taxi driver from New York would do if you're really really wealthy he marries models and builds gold toilets and all this kind of stuff and people in the rest of the country actually take that language seriously so when he says stuff like yeah we're gonna bomb the shit out of him you know people in New York like he has so he do you know and people in Oklahoma like wow he's serious it's actually gonna happen and I think probably not probably this just have people from kind of talked we saw this last week right he's talking about the cops and he was saying this thing at hover in her hands he's talking like a Long Island or you know he's talking about like you know the they throw in the back of the paddy wagon and we do all the in and you don't put your head on that it's fine he they bump their head they just Mick Holtzman and so the entire meeting wouldn't know how dare he he's talking about how cops should rough people up listen is it appropriate for the President of the United States to talk like that about treatment of suspects no is are we supposed take this super seriously like this is like Trump is actually recommending a policy change with linearity in the room hey that's what he does he works the room he's a he's a New York real estate guy who works the room and more than anything else if you understand New York and you understand LA you understand Trump he's not a giant mystery right he's just any other reality TV star he's a reality he's a marketing image guy I mean that's what he does like he's not even that great at real estate he puts his name on the site he brands himself he puts his name on the side of buildings they pay him not to be involved in the real estate business so they can put Trump on the side of his hotels great I mean that's what he does that's why I'm kind of shocked that he's kind of crappy at the imaging as far as being a president you'd imagine that he'd be better at this part of it at least I just think he didn't understand the volume of hate that was gonna come his way and I think he's such an egomaniac he has a hard time dealing with it like separating and that's one of the things that I've read about him that he's getting better at getting away from the comments and not reading comments on Twitter but he fucking blocks people yes yes may suit him yeah well there's people a group of people suing them and now they're actually starting to rule against public officials people who are in the public light being able to block citizens that in having their own opinion about what this person doing or not doing so then you have to say well are you allowed to be vulgar towards the president I mean how far does that go I mean what are you allowed to say I mean maybe you should be able to a whatever the hell you want about anybody but it chance threatened I'm late but it's it does go more to the the level of pettiness he's the most powerful man on the planet when I was busy blocking people on Twitter at 3 o'clock in the morning well ghetto Scarborough and what is her name Mika Brzezinski that was just what he says name he was saying that she should this is the fucking president he's saying she showed up with bloody scar she was bleeding from her recent facelift exactly and it's it first of all it turns out that it probably wasn't true but second it wasn't true I mean it fuck goes out when you're bleeding it I agree with you I agree with you but it's it and and but this ever piece about a National Review about this you know you say that the level of hatred directed toward Trump is warping Trump I think that it's also warping some people on my side of the aisle who are who are so you know interested in the fight that they're less interested in advancing the policies that I'd like to see achieve so I think there's a whole group of people where let's say that Trump would just resign tomorrow he'd say you know what I've had it screw it I'm out and Mike Pence becomes president and then Mike Pence proceeds to do all the things conservatives want him to do you know you get tax reform and we limit immigration and we do all of these things but but he does not tweet about Mika Brzezinski bloody face I think there's a whole group of people on there I'd be pissed they'd miss it yeah I think that right I think listening now cuz it's fun what exactly what they want is somebody who pisses off the left more than beats the left right this is them off if you piss off the left I think Obama sort of trolled some of the right into insanity I think there are a lot of people on our side whereas like this jerk he just he keeps saying things just to piss us off and Obama did do some of that and so Trump is kind of a Twitter troll and so he does the same thing we're like yeah that's awesome like two days ago Trump or yesterday there was a report that Trump said that he thinks the White House is shabby now I can say is somebody on the conservative right my entire life if Obama said that we would not let him forget that for 1,000 years that the White House is shabby I mean it's like it's an ass move to say that the people's house is shit first of all two mansion right like in second of all this is the most iconic building on the face of the planet yeah oh it's shabby how much at what was he saying about he said he they were asked him why he that says visits his golf courses so much and he said oh because because because my golf courses are nicer because the White House is shabby and and but there are people on the right who are like fine it's funny like you know at least he's trolling the left at least it's ticking them off and say guys ticking off the left is not a substitute for defeating the left if you actually care about the feeding the left like this is one of the things that drives me nuts because my you know what my life goal has been to promulgate particular ideas not just to piss off the left but I think that in the fight there are a lot of people who have fallen into the trap of thinking these two things are identical right you pissed off the left that means you're winning there's like no pissing off the left maybe part of it but that's not how you win you wouldn't by saying things that are true and if they get pissed they get pissed well my good friend bill bird did this piece about Obama back when Obama was mocking Trump and saying the one thing that I am that you'll never be is the president United States the crowd went nuts yeah remember when he did and Obama was saying this on stage and you see Trump in the audience boiling with his you know big frog double chin you're sitting there eating it all and that fucking stuck in his craw there's there's a whole story that came out from BuzzFeed about his interaction with a guy named McKay Coppins a reporter for BuzzFeed in which McKay was basically like saying to Trump like you're a joke you're not gonna run I I think Trump ran just just because he was sick of people telling him that he wasn't gonna be President so yeah I really think that's that's half of what drives him that doesn't mean that he can't do good things I hope he does do good things he's the president I want every president to do things I like but you know he's gonna have to get it under control a little bit because I mean he was willing to keep the mooch I mean the mooch the boots was only ousted because of John Kelly and the mooches was it what did the mooch say what was his was about why would he think that he could say that once he's in the office I mean first of all I would see Ben and could even possibly do that I mean ban is not that flexible I know Steve that's not that's not something skills repertoire a giant unit but it doesn't matter just the idea that he would think I mean it's guy he must be emboldened by the fact that Trump has had so many outrageous things well I mean the reports from the New York Post that that he actually the Trump liked it that all that happened is that there was so much blowback that he had to replace Kelly you know puts Kelly in there and Kelly's like you can't do this right and Trump's like okay fine but doesn't it seem more crazy to fire a guy after ten days and it does to sit him down and say hey man don't say that again right let's move forward that's what they should have done the next day but the problem is he'd been doing it for a week at that point right he was out there like saying that Reince Priebus was leaking on the president was an enemy of the president for a week and he was saying that he was going to get him fired right and at the same time remember this is the same week that Trump himself is tweeting out that attorney General Sessions who is his most loyal supporter for a year and a half that that guy's like a traitor right and that he wishes he would go away cuz he recused himself yeah first of all Trump can fire any of these people at any time like this is very passive-aggressive a guy who made his living saying you're fired on TV it's amazing that all the people the Trump has fire had been fired actually through surrogates yeah Mike Flynn resigned James Comey was fired basically threw rod Rosenstein and sessions and then Rosenstein had to recuse himself which is how you get the special counsel and Comey found out on television on TV right here emissary to go to LA and and give him a letter and like everyone he fires has to be fired in the most roundabout I think that Trump actually this I think the dirty little secret is I'm not sure Trump actually likes firing people and I think I think he I think he kind of like toward any kind of like torturing people but I'm not sure that he actually likes firing them well maybe he doesn't like people being mad at him face-to-face I think that he wants them to love him in front of his face so like when he's not there you know he can make a phone call fire him Jetson hang up the phone you don't have to actually see the guy he wants that guy to like him yeah I don't the Comey thing was really bizarre because it was like oh you can do that like you this this guy is looking into improprieties and you can just say no you can't do that anymore you're fired you can't look into the things I've done wrong yeah it was a well the way he did it was the stupid part so I was calling for common to be fired since last year I thought the way he handle the whole Hillary thing from beginning to end was terrible and I thought that Trump should have replaced him before he became you know as basically day one here's my new cabinet call me he did a great job you know uh sure him out the door bringing somebody new he kept him around and then the first thing he said to Comey you remember was when he met him he said you're more famous than I am well when Trump says that to you it's the writing on the wall right there first of all it's not true but second of all I think maybe there was also a part of the problem was that commis a giant yes no chump come easy six eight six nine years giant dude towered over thing is such a comedy and Comey saying he was trying to hide in the curtains to avoid Trump they just see Herman Munster over there hiding in the it's now what did you join the show I mean it's it's wild if I didn't think that nuclear war was a possibility to probably join more but if I see a fucking Korean missile headed our way I'm gonna be pissed when Comey was handling the email thing what specifically did you not like about it what I thought it was was crazy was when he restarted or reopened the case because of whom having used her cleaner with wieners all that stuff is like that's not enough like that seems crazy the the deleting the emails to me seemed like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA and he said essentially anyone else would be in jail for what she did sure for sure sure well Comey that this is so he screwed it up and then he Reese crude it up so when he originally said publicly we're not gonna prosecute Hillary Clinton he was doing something he didn't have the authority to do the FBI does not decide whether to prosecute people they refer the information to the DOJ and then the DOJ decides whether to prosecute people it was attorney general Loretta Lynch's decision whether to prosecute or not the statute itself mammal lawyer the statute itself did not say do you have intent to commit espionage you have intent to to make classified secrets public or expose them to the possibility of being made public intent is not an element of the crime right if you do it it's a crime so my wife as it is a doctor and that means that she is under HIPAA requirements there's no elements under HIPAA that says that if she reveals somebody's you know proprietary medical information by accident well there's no intent so she's okay that's not part of the statute if she brings somebody's medical records out to her car and somebody steals the medical records you know she's working at the VA or something that's a crime doesn't matter if she intended to do it and just left it in her purse so Comey read the elements of intent into the crime to get Hillary off and then he said okay we're not gonna prosecute this we're gonna leave it alone he shouldn't have intervene in the first place remember he made an entire case basically for why she should be prosecuted and then at the end he goes but were you no but no we're not gonna do that he also said we're gonna keep Congress updated on any future development well you got October and there's a future development they found this laptop with all sorts of information on it with new emails from Hillary Clinton they haven't seen before and now he has an obligation to inform Congress because he told them that he would and so he screws the pooch again because he's afraid that if he doesn't reveal that information Hillary goes on to win and then it comes out there's something criminal then people are going to blame him for Hillary winning and putting a criminal in the White House Sin City - oh well I'll be fully transparent I have to honor my institution I'm gonna put this out there of course then Hillary loses and now he screwed up twice and then he gets into the White House and now he's supposed to be investigating the Trump Russia stuff at the same time so now he's investigating basically both candidates in the 2016 election he handled this the wrong way every step of the way because he was so focused on what will uphold the in the integrity of the FBI and the integrity of the investigations and the integrity of the DOJ he was less worried about okay what do I actually have to do under the law what's my obligation under the law his obligation under the law is to shut his piehole hand the information over to Lynch if Lynch wanted to kill the investigation let her do it so in a sense Trump was right and saying that he's a grandstander yeah for sure I mean I think that part was right but the problem remember was not the firing of Comey it was that two days after he fired Comey he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he said the reason I fired call me was not all the excuses I gave about the the Hillary stuff it's because of the Russia stuff I was angry about how he's handling Russia I mean that's really stupid yeah that's intensely stupid it's intensely stupid but it's also strange that it didn't go anywhere right like that was it like that that's against the law well it's so it's you know observation so obstruction looking at the statutes obstruction is a little bit more than that so you have to actually obstruct an ongoing investigation into criminal activity there's a counterintelligence investigation going on but not necessarily a criminal one so not to get too specific about it but you should get specific about it yeah I mean the obstruction laws I mean I've looked into kind of the statutes that they've used to suggest obstruction and it's not clear that there's any statute that specifically governs something like this plus it is true that Trump does have the power as the chief executive to fire as the commander-in-chief to fire the FBI director for any reason he chooses now all that said he can be impeached for any reason criminal or non criminal right impeachment is not a you don't actually have to have committed a crime to be impeached most people don't even understand when impeach means they think that some are another impeach means you kicked out of office right that's not right it is there's the house and they have to vote to impeach you and then there's the Senate they have to vote by a two-thirds majority or sixty yeah I think it's two-thirds majority to actually convict you of a set of crimes that they come up with but these are all political definitions right when it says high crimes and misdemeanors it doesn't mean they actually have to prosecute you like they would in a criminal court and you'd have to go to jail or any of that kind of stuff like they could impeach anybody at any time Clinton didn't even have to commit perjury if they didn't want if they wanted to you know impeach him they could they could have impeach every president you can impeach it's just a vote it's just a vote so all the talk about what's criminal and what's not criminal the problem for Trump there are two ways of reading Trump's behavior in the whole Russia thing right way one is he's got something to hide that's the most obvious way he's got something to hide that's why he gets her to Flynn we don't know why he got rid of Flynn he gets rid of Comey we don't really know why he got rid of Comey and then brags to the Russians that it's a pressure off him on the Russia stuff yeah so the way one is he's hiding something and now he's firing everybody who gets in the way and there's you know the chain of evidence doesn't not fit that I mean you know the people he's angry at in order are attorney General Sessions the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the former head of the FBI James Comey the acting head of the FBI McCabe and and the special prosecutor right robert muller so those are all people involved with russia those are the only people he's really angry at so there's something to be said for the idea that maybe he's trying to hide something on the other hand we haven't actually seen any hard evidence of collusion itself so we saw an attempt to collude by Donald Trump jr. but we haven't actually seen any evidence that the Russians were providing special information to the Trump administration which was then being weaponized for use in the campaign we haven't seen any of that stuff so here's the other plausible theory and this goes to Trump's personality he's so petty and he wants to be loved so much that he is angry that people keep saying he run because he won because of the Russians and so now every time people say that he just gets pissed and he fires people so call me I mean this is totally plausible right Comey comes to him and has said privately that you are not under investigation and Trump says Tim well why don't you just say that and Comey says well I can't say that cuz if I say that I'm gonna have to update Congress if you do fall under investigation and Trump doesn't like that he wants the public to know he's free and clear she fires Comey and then he goes up public and he says I didn't like how he was handling the Russia thing I'm innocent why will these people leave me alone right so he is so there's two ways to read this either he's totally innocent but stupid or he's trying to hide something those are the only two plausible ways of reading the situation the Donald Trump jr. thing was really bizarre because he released all the emails like I just yeah it's like look I've got nothing to hide like you aren't supposed to do any of these things you're saying in these emails yes that was not a good moment for for Trump jr. do you think he got I mean and then you hear that he was coached by his dad again you know this is none of this is good stuff I think that Donald Trump jr. releasing the first of all it is imperative to note eight minutes later the New York Times released basically the email change right so he was meeting he's beating out of the gate and so he puts that out there which is a smart move I mean it would be smart if you it would be smart if he had found a way to spin it right right like have you done it if you don't this is the thing in politics now the way politics works now is your smartest move if there's dirt about you is to be the first person out the gate with it and you put a spin on it right so like Barack Obama imagine if Obama hadn't said anything in 2008 and then we found out a week before the election that he did coke in high school now a lot of people wouldn't care a lot of people would write in 2000 george w bush was hit with a DUI charge from 1973 and it probably lost him a point in the polls so what obama did is he wrote an entire memoir and he just kind of dismissed it right in the middle of the memoir he goes you know when i was in high school did a little blow no problem it'll blow everybody and everyone oh okay did a little blow alright you know cool so if you're going to release this kind of stuff you have to put a spin on it trump turn your didn't you just put out the emails and the emails themselves contain the damning material right it says right in there right you know there's a russian government lawyer the russian government sees this as part of its effort to aid mr. Trump's campaign and Donald juniors like thumbs up guys like I love it sounds awesome right and so that does not look good it's not quite as much as you know people on the Left want to say it is meaning that there's no evidence yet that any information was actually exchanged with the Russians or that anything came of the meeting most of the people in the meeting who've said something and said nothing came of it you know but we don't know whether Trump knew about the meeting I find it kind of hard to believe he didn't you know considering every major campaign figure was there but but you know then then they then they just keep lying and this is this is the part that's proud that's a problem are they lying because they just think they can get away with it and they're stupid or are they long because they're actually being meticulous about their lies yeah I tend to think the former because this isn't a professional administration I think these I think Trump you know fibs a lot he says things that I mean like on stupid things he says things like the leader of the Boy Scouts called me and told me that he loved my speech ever and then leader of the Boy Scouts like what so if so is that a calculated lie to hide something or is it just the Trump lies by nature and so he does it a lot well I think he's just so used to putting that that spin on things that publicity spin right and the thing that he said about this was that this is what politics does what happens in politics you get dirt about your enemy and people exchange information it's just what happens it's just you're seeing it now so a lot of people like yeah well that makes sense right and this is something that again I think that we're shaped by Hollywood a little bit politics is dirty but some of this stuff is not usual right it's actually not particularly usual to meet with a government that is really not friendly to the United States to receive information about your political opponents but if you've watched house of cards you think well I mean it's like two steps down from throwing somebody under the subways I don't because I work in politics when I go home at night the last thing I want to do is watch and read about politics now watch Game of Thrones that's as political as a guest yeah house of cards is a great show but if it's half right like I always wonder the thing the thing that gets me is when people suicide themselves that are on the way to trial I'm like okay I don't want to be that fucking guy I don't want to be that tinfoil hat guy but how many people are gonna suicide themselves I mean for sure someone's been murdered somewhere along the line someone knew something some powerful people got to them and they murder them it's gonna happen it has happened it must have have I mean I think it happens a lot in Russia I don't think that I don't believe what Trump said and again I think this is what Trump has a skewed vision of what politics is and because he thinks that the outer limit of politics is Russia he thinks anything inside that limit is now okay but do you think it's ever happen in the United States or just in Russia like political assassinations I can't name a specific example of where it has I think that that was you open to the possibility I'm open to the I mean if someone shows me and Johnson Lynda John I don't think Lyndon Johnson wackadoo Kennedy I don't think the Kennedy whack anybody about Hillary I don't think Hillary whack any fired up fired my last thousand bucks I'd be super tempted to bet on black have you super tempted to go you know what I think she went dark a few people let's see what we got here like you wanna see white water I'd want to see Vince Foster I want to see that Enron guy who shot himself in the head twice you what if I could if I could really if I could you know man I think it's happened I just don't know I'm sure it's happened at some point but again if I don't know them and when I'm hesitant to like why I think that we and I think that we tend to think things are regular when they are they never really irregular Yeah right so we tend to think that this stuff is happening like every day and that's why you see Trump on TV saying well Putin like America hasn't killed people and it's like well no not quite like Putin I mean like Putin legitimately murders his journalistic enemies yes like I haven't seen you trying to DoubleTap Jake Tapper so I'm pretty sure I'm sure no it's not a regular thing around here even Obama wasn't trying to like kill Chris Wallace right but maybe they you know maybe well Putin is obviously the extreme example right well obviously the extreme example is the North Korea but Putin is in that range like totally feared essentially a dictator who's I mean they're a bunch of Omer I mean Iran and Turkey Maduro a song yeah Assad Maduro now in Venezuela who's literally oh like a complete dictatorship and this is very recently right but America is a I mean would you believe it if I said like leaders in France had people regularly whacked I'd find it a little bit hard to believe I don't think we're significantly worse than France and the whacking people in politics business I don't think regularly but I think every now and then the move is I'm open to the possibility but I'd have to see the evidence the lawyer and me well I don't think we're a house of cards I don't think it's gets that ridiculous but the point I'm making is if you think that's a regular thing if you think that it's not like a rare thing and maybe once in a while you know once every 20 years somebody gets whacked quietly for political reason if you think that's like a regular thing then fibbing is like way inside the line right right like you you hiding documents is really or you like writing your son's stupid statement about a stupid email exchange and then fibbing about it publicly like that's really inside the line so again I don't think that I think some of this I have a rule about the Trump administration I never attribute to malevolence what I can attribute to stupidity because I think that that's more likely to be the case it's like the Occam's razor of the trumpet ministry that is a smart way to think but I think sometimes malevolence is real like I'd like member the Gary Condit Chandra Levy thing yeah that was weird that was a weird one where people don't know the story this guy was having an affair the girl turned up dead and then 9/11 happened right away afterwards so people kind of forgot about it but they they found her body in the park and everybody was like Jesus Christ like this is a woman that was about to testify that she was having an affair with this guy and that one was a good one yeah in terms not not good one obviously a terrible ones I think so let me say this I think that you know if there's murder in politics it'll probably tend to fall more into the personal than the political mmm-hmm it'll probably fall less in terms of like I have a political vendetta against this guy and I'm gonna kill him we haven't really done much of that since Alexander Hamilton and burr but it's it but there are eminent listened Teddy Kennedy left a woman in the back of his car and a body of water so right drunk driving right that was the thing with him he just didn't want to be responsible for something horrible that he did very similar to Dick Cheney not meeting with the police to feel like something like 18 hours after he shot his friend in the face yeah I mean I don't think he was trying to assassinate his friend drunk hunting and that's can't rule that one out so yeah but honestly I'll find Teddy Kennedy a little more suspicious you leave the woman in the back of the car swim out of the car going to a house sleep come back the next day and my god she's dead yeah well yeah it turns out when you leave somebody underwater for 12 hours they tend to do that yeah that's weird how that works well unless he was so drunk that he didn't know what he was doing which can happen you can get blackout drunk I'm gonna wake up and going wait a minute did I crash my car so I don't drink that heavily is that really a thing like you climbing out the window the card swim out to the river bank go to somebody's house come back like a day later like oh shit there was a girl in the back seat I've never had it happen but I have I've had what I would call slideshow nights you know where I get hammered and then like I wake up in the morning with a pounding headache and and I just just have these flashes in my head like who is that person like where was I where were we oh yeah there was that and then that you eaten breakfast with your friends ago you remember that thing and you go oh yeah Jesus necessarily blackout like I did something horrible and I completely forgot about it but I forgot a lot of it okay but some people I have a friend and he goes gerbil eyes there's which that goes off three or four shots in and he's gone and he's not there anymore he almost kind of like nerf the world around him protect him and get him in his bed and he wakes up in the morning he doesn't know a thing doesn't know a thing about what happened and it's really bizarre it's a terrible things Tim well he's now we're nice to him but your your instinct is to get the fuck away from him he just let horrible things happen but the stories are legendary but he does he gets shark eyes he gets he's black like soulless eyes where he's gone and you go oh no he's gone yeah it's weird but I wonder what that is I feel like that's a neurological issue I feel like if alcohol does that to you there's probably like some switches that aren't connected right in the head I'd imagine there's something going on yeah mmm yeah so Teddy Kennedy who knows I mean he was obviously a raging alcoholic and that could have been a part of the problem I mean literally might have gone home not even knowing that he killed somebody I mean that'd have to be his only defense yeah you'd imagine well that was one of the things that they said they would have used as a defense again with OJ that OJ with the CTE that he might not have even known what he was doing and he might have flown into some blackout rage that note an amazing defense like I would like to hear that like everyone who has CTE now gets to like run around chopping up their ex-wife and randos who end up at their house that'd be a hell of a defense total at the Twinkie defense right yeah well the Twinkie defense was hilarious but there are people that think that you know there's you're gonna see more and more things like that out of former NFL players with massive brain trauma issues it's actually a serious legal question you know like that there's always was a couple weeks ago this kid he doesn't even know he did this oh god oh wow former NFL player Devon hall accused of killing his mother he doesn't remember in jail right not doesn't recall yeah well that's real it's reason yeah I don't find that wildly implausible I mean the fact is that we have an insanity defense and what it means is you don't know right from wrong well if you know what you're doing like it this is something to teach in law school if you're sleepwalking you kill somebody and there's no motive so it's difficult to like you need mental treatment but it you should be in jail for that not not really cases where people are like sleepwalking and they think that in their dreaming at the same time so they think that their wife is actually like the this defense has been used where they think the wife is some sort of monster in the room so they like clubbed her to death and then they wake up and like oh that was my wife it's a really creative defense or it's true any one of the two so well if we know that people can go crazy and we know that brain trauma is a real issue mm-hmm the two of them together I mean there's something about getting knocked around in the head where it's so completely unpredictable and then you add in this impulsive nature of their behavior that happens there's something really weird about a brain trauma it causes a lot of very strange impulsive behavior in people they really can't understand even why they're behaving the way they're behaving MMH it's not good obviously this is way off track from politics to brain trauma you don't want a former NFL player being the fucking president and shuts they the CTE study there was a hundred and eleven players and a hundred and ten of them had CTE I mean then you tell me I mean you have more experience at this I mean I didn't find that shocking at all I mean they've been calling people punch-drunk since yeah 1910 so we'll see the thing is when you get to that when you get to the slurring your words part you're so gone like you're already gone there's a lot of people that have CTE that speak really well and they're very articulate and they're very reasonable and you wouldn't even understand that they're dealing with all these this host of neurological issues the by the time your avoid obviously I'm not a neurologist but by the time is it's been explained to me your voice is slurring and you're dealing with like real heavy-duty symptoms like you're fucked like you're so gone like you're you you're you're way off the deep so here's a weird question for you I mean what would you do about it like I think the NFL is gonna start losing viewers because of us I think they are I think you're right and you know I wonder about MMA do you it's a factor I think there's there's two things going on there's the fuckit factor where people like I don't care I want to watch people get their ass kicked it's fun it's exciting people love it it's consensual it's primal yeah and people know what they're signing up for when they do it they know the consequences of it and it's worth a glory to be the guy who do delivers it versus the guy who receives it so I think there's that but then there's also look you know like the Colin Kaepernick thing I think that probably costs a lot of ratings for the NFL yeah there was that poll that came out that said I think of the 12% of people who said that they were not watching NFL games last year 28% of that 12% said that the Kaepernick national anthem thing was the reason yeah I mean it's smaller said he's probably emboldened them they probably liked it and they wanted to watch it more this was fascinating about the cultural breakdown of the country basically white people hated and black people loved it this is this is how the polls were there's like 72 percent of black people thought it was great and like an equal percentage of white people thought that it was just terrible no which is it which is a fascinating look at sort of how race relations work in the country at large is it's actually one of the reasons I think that ESPN has been losing ratings like I used to watch ESPN religiously and now I all I want is to just watch my sports and not be bothered with the politics right as I say I do that during the day there's a pet peeve of mine that every time I turn on ESPN I have to lecture about Caitlyn Jenner or about black lives matter it's like shut up Caitlyn Jenner hasn't even been athletically relevant for since before I was born I was born 1984 well the Caitlyn Jenner piece when they did it for ESPN and I don't know if this is true or not but the word was that her getting athlete of the year or whatever the award was she's a hero a hero of the Year award hero was directly tied to the exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer that make sense they sold the two of them together as a package deal which I buy a hundred percent if you do her if you don't come on where she came from she's a fucking Kardashian okay she's a giant Kardashian that's what she is now notice I'm saying she yeah you're saying she I would say very politically correct yeah I'm not but the video where they circled her house and she was like moving in the shadows behind the drapes did you ever see that no she mean it was like the first time she was revealing herself as a woman so they're circling her house she's this glorious house and like looks like it's in Malibu or somewhere well they're circling the house and it's in the hills with a helicopter like the filming he's like fucking high production value shit this isn't just like hey you know we met with Caitlyn at home Caitlyn tell us your troubles you know like Kristen back the former Navy SEAL you know right who just sits down very reasonably and says this just feels better for me is Who I am right no no that's there was like curtains and shadows and then she starts talking like war wars but man he's like oh god and then there was a weird weirdest part where she said she got surgery but it doesn't make me any I was it wasn't like I was any less of a man or less of a woman before the surgery well this is the case about gender right well then why get the surgery that was like this is well there are there a lot of questions as to the logic of all of us I call Caitlyn Jenner she Caitlyn Jenner is a biological man sorry triggered sorry to break this to some all the people who listened to your show Caitlyn Jenner I had a tweet this week all the people agree with you the number one retweeted tweet I have ever had had a hundred and nine tweeted I think a day ago and has a hundred and twenty thousand likes and it's it was there was a headline from CNN that said transgender man gives birth to translate one was transgender man assigned the female sex at birth gives birth to a healthy baby boy and so I tweeted woman gives birth to boy right because it's a woman I mean this is like that's not a headline I'm sorry like I'm just because the woman believes she's a man doesn't make her a man like biology still exists sex still exists if you want to say she's a woman who feels like a man that's fine if you want to say that and by didn't care if she gets hormone treatments or if she wants to have surgery like it's a free country what the hell you want but when you start insisting that I you that I just throw biology out the window I don't understand why that's any better than I is a religious person saying every time you say something you have to mention God right like I don't have the right to do that to you like well that's idiotic are you fascinated by it are you fascinated by the transgender like the obsession with it yes that's a good way of saying it there's a there's not just a an obsession it's it's compulsory and it's rabid so I think that there's a couple of things that are going on one is that it's it's very dark but I think that there is an element of like this is different and we get to we get to revel in the in the weirdness of it but we're gonna pretend that it's all about the civil rights of it right we're gonna feel like special because we're cuz we're on their side right we're not watching Caitlyn Jenner because it's a curiosity and because it's weird and entertaining we're doing it because we're on Caitlyn Jenner's side but we feel very good so forever yeah right I mean renee Richards was a trans person yeah I mean it's happened throughout history I mean there's there's what was a reading a couple of days ago about a Roman like the the there was something about reports of some trans soldier in the Roman army you know one thousand years ago it's got to be if it's if exist now and it's existed before it was popular yeah I mean there's got to be a lot of people that turn trans now just because it's exciting oh there it is right there a trans soldier in the ancient Roman art that wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be surprising I'm not shocked no I'm not sure I mean it's a condition I mean it's the DSM called it gender identity disorder and then they called it gender dysphoria it's it's a condition I mean like dysphoria and but that in a lot of people's mind is labeling it somehow are a negative well I mean it is highly linked to suicidality there's a forty percent lifetime suicide rate for people who have this particular gender disorder that seems to me not to be like a great positive whether or not they transition yeah yeah I mean do what you want to do but but the idea that that we as an entire society have to redefine what sex is and we have to blind ourselves to a biology is this is something I'm not willing to do I think that it's actually damaging the kids particularly I'm more than willing to call her a she and chain but you can only change the name once I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner is she because you can't change her sexting change right you change her name to whatever you want I don't care but you can't she Caitlyn Jenner is not a chicken Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman Caitlyn Jenner is a man a biological man and if a man lost his penis and and you know in a tragic accident it wouldn't make him a woman and if he were born with high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream he would also not be a woman right you're that you were determined by your chromosomes and there's not even talking about intersex people like intersex is an actual status intersex is a biological status but this nonsense that if you Joe Rogan decide tomorrow that you are a woman no surgeries nor homo no homer and trip nothing you just tomorrow you wake up and not not decide but you feel like a woman then you have always been a woman we must treat you as a woman you don't have to change anything about yourself for us to even determine whether you're a woman we just like no I'm sorry no I mean like I had mental illness yeah I had a grandfather I got I get so much shit for this but I had this is not me being unsympathetic to people who suffer from a condition that is really tragic and obviously harms people you know in terms of again the rates of suicide and depression are astounding my grandfather was it was a bipolar schizophrenic and it would have not been good for him or my family if people had said to him Nate you're right the radio is talking to you Nate you're right the curtains are talking to you he went that they put him in a mental hospital they gave him lithium and then he was better and he could actually live a normal relatively happy life there's no good treatment for gender identity disorder gender dysphoria whatever you want to call it but to suggest that it is a condition that doesn't require treatment there really it's just that you're actually bringing female again this is a scientific there's no scientific evidence to back this whatsoever even these studies that have been done talking about there's a female brain and a male brain first of all if you say this to a feminist you're a sexist right if you say to a feminist there's a female brain in a male brain and male brain works differently than the female brain the feminists are looking like how dare you well it's also rare times we are allowed to celebrate classic definitions of female beauty when a man embraces him when he becomes a woman lipstick high heels short skirt this is like not Caitlyn Jenner was only a woman when Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair and a bustier right right but if he had just said listen I look exactly the same as I did yesterday but I'm a woman yeah if he got a short haircut and dressed like Billie Jean King right it's the reason why the why the media loves Laverne Cox because Laverne Cox has had surgeries and looks a lot like a woman so I don't know who the guy from well the transgender woman from Orange is the new black I never watched that I've never watched that show either but she's on the cover of Time magazine Oh or he's on the cover of Time magazine well there was the woman in that show isn't that the one where the girl who Ruby wrote is that the girl that's Laverne Cox okay that's a woman or man that's man it used to be a man it used to be a man's woman very tricky no still a man but transgender so out of the loop I'm not old man I'm that old man that headline there right it says America's next civil rights frontier and that's the key you have a bunch of people in the United States who are suggesting that they want the next civil rights fight always the next civil rights fight right yes is it the civil rights fight is immigration or the civil rights fight is gay marriage or the civil rights fight is transgenders okay how about this how about there was only one real civil rights fight it was about black people who had been historically oppressed in the United States for 200 years who had been slaves yes we'd been slaves and genders this is correct okay the worst that Caitlyn Jenner had experienced was being incredibly wealthy in a high net-worth suburb this is not to say the transgender people don't you know aren't discriminated against right and some in some areas of American life I'm sure that's true but it's also like behavior is not the same as being born black or being born Asian or being born with you know disabled if if I'm a business owner and I hire you and you're a man and you come in the next day and you're dressed in a woman's clothing saying you're a woman but you still have a full beard like I don't see why I as a business owner I'm expected to eat the cost of that like that seems bizarre to me eat the cost is a great way to phrase it I didn't have a dog in this fight I didn't I I was completely open and liberal about it until there was a case where a man who had been a man for 30 years became a woman for a little less than two years and then started MMA fighting women yes exactly exactly eating the fuck out of these women and not and not proclaiming that he or she used to be a man because what in quotes it was a medical condition that I did not need to disclose like that's not a fucking medical condition right and if you ever watch the fights she's now in fact yeah yeah she wasn't winning because she was skillful she was fucking manhandling these women it was ugly horse it was hard it's like this is it but again it's it's so funny how the transgender movement destroys the feminist movement by living off of the the sort of lies that the feminist movement promulgated so the feminist movement said stupid things like women and men equally athletic proficient well that's not very repeated very recently that there's no biological difference in the genders and it's all social absolute horseshit I mean I'm sorry there's there's no scientific evidence to back that and it's particularly true with regard to actual physical capacity this is just nonsense there's just no scientific evidence but I'm Alan Turing yeah yeah yeah I mean mountain of it my favorite study on this is you know there was remember there's that those commercials about like throwing like a girl running like a girl right there's feminists commercials saying what is it to be running like a girl no true an adult woman and she'd be running all girly and then they would show a little girl and she's running and it's still a little girly but she's running you know like normally it's only it's not more exactly fierce it's it's only society that has forced the little girl to run like woman first of all I have a three-year-old girl she runs like a girl it's not because I'm teaching her that cause her mom runs because she doesn't write but she play with dolls because you're a sexist pig it's because of that my daughter started off liking trucks like in the first year and I give a shit and then and now she likes playing with dolls and dressing up in princess dresses I could care she's a girl she's always been a girl she'll always be a girl but if she likes trucks oh I think that was an issue with one of my daughters too my daughter was a little worried about our girl she's gonna be a dyke she's like no what's the big deal you like lesbians who cares I don't care I do not care and she's like and then she turned the corner and then she got but we just let her be whatever she's in but she was really into like Batman for a while yeah my daughter is in a band then she was into one woman like who cares but is it but but what what's funny about this is that the left kept saying even when I met my wife right who's a conservative and I made her more conservative when he got married cuz that's what men tend to do to their wives but she but she you know we remember early on we had a conversation about this and I said women don't throw like mine and she got like all offended and I said but that's factually true she said right but it's but it's insulting it's like no that's factually true like I'm sorry like there have been studies out of a thousand if you took a woman throwing a baseball and then a thousand men throwing a baseball the woman will throw faster than out of those thousand men this is in the book the sports chain the woman will throw faster than two of those men out of a thousand and we're not talking about like goose Gossage here we're talking about regular human we're talking about the accountant from down the block we're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a baseball yeah right I mean that's not the way this stuff works well that was the counter that Fallon Fox used was that she actually lost to a woman she lost her woman named Ashley Evan Smith but what I said was no this proves my point is you're not good you're just a man well this was you know John McEnroe got slapped all over the lot when he said about Serena Williams she's right Serena was great and all but if Serena Williams were competing he said she's the best female player ever and they were like well why not just the best player ever is it because she's a woman like if she were a man she'd get her ass kicked and everyone was like no how dare you there is something called the universal tennis ranking she drank in the mid ranks of college male players if she were a man and Serena Williams is said like five years ago now I never want to play it like Andy Roddick he'd kill me she did this there was a 200th man in the world who she wanted to just warm up with and they they played it like just a normal match for he won six one six nothing right and he was and he was like ranked 200th in the world and the only shock was that he dropped a dropped a point to her well there was the issue of renee richards when renee Richard started playing tennis against women and kicking their ass and he was a middling player at best as a woman or as a man rather but as a woman he was a fucking killer hey I mean this is what should insult feminists it turns out the Caitlyn Jenner when all these hero of the year awards and everything we men are so great that even when we decide to be women we're better than women that was the woman for six months but he's amazing he's incredible he's just he was a natural even if being women than women no wonder feminists are piss and they should be and and it this whole glossing over the the difference between feminists who have been claiming that women are distinct from men and important and different and better in certain ways like I don't understand how you hold these two simultaneous thoughts Hillary Clinton needs to be president because we need a female president but also Donald Trump if he said he was a woman tomorrow would be a woman how do you hold those two simultaneous thoughts I always thought that in the last week of the election of Trump thought he was gonna lose you should have just declared himself a woman and then he too could have fires a woman I'm the best looking woman ever I've been I've been voted as the best looking woman of all time the great arguments that I got in online when I wasn't even arguments but so many people were calling me a bigot because of this Fallon Fox thing goes it was stunning because it was so confusing to me I'm like I'm talking about defending a biological woman like you these biological women at least two of them got the fuck beaten out of them by Fallon Fox before they found out that she used to be a man I'm like that's not an issue to these people and so this one woman said she's always been a woman and I said okay she gave birth she impregnated a woman and got her pregnant I go what about then she goes even then yeah even then she was a woman she was a woman she went she was fucking a woman with her dick and getting that woman pregnant like we are in Fantasyland it's it's it's crazy town so this doesn't mean this is what's crazy like you can't just because something's illogical you can't just decide it someone's a bigot like that you're you you were in a weird area we're talking about bone structure and here's the crazy density there there there's a crazy thing is that they always rely on these gender reassignment doctors to define the terms and it's really interesting because I got deep deep deep into the rabbit hole with this because I was really shocked at how many people were angry at me yeah and there is one doctor who is a board-certified endocrinologist who sort of broke it down she's like not only is the science behind this crazy but when you have gender reassignment surgery one of the big issues with men transitioning into women is bone density who she's like when you have gender reassignment surgery you're taking estrogen which actually preserves bone density she's like not only do they have less bone density once they become a woman they might have more well because you're preserving it like it's not you're not gonna automatically be just like a woman in a year or so I don't think surgeons I mean I know too much about doctoring from having spent 1,000 years with my wife's medical education to believe that doctors have the capacity to magically change a man into a woman no maybe it's gonna happen one day with like CRISPR or something like that when they start using you know genetic birth maybe and if you actually entered the chromosomes before birth but no I mean like no if it once once you're didn't once your genes have been defined once your chromosomes in default like this is fifth-grade science people its fifth grade science what scares the shit out of me is when you hear these stories about people deciding that their child who's like eight or nine years old that beyond belief it's scary because you can nine year look a fucking 17 year old doesn't know that was the thing about the Ruby Rose girls she was saying that when she was young when she was a teenager she wanted be a man she wanted to be transgender and that she had gone through that phase and now she's so happy that she didn't do anything right well they say that that eighty percent of kids who experience any sort of gender dysphoria as children grow out of it so when you have a society that reinforces it and then in Canada they're now having their passing laws now that say that if a kid says you know you have a girl and the girl says I'm a boy and she's three that the government can come into your house and take the kid because obviously if you if you don't want to humor the kid and get the kid treatment or surgery or hormone blockers then you're obviously doing something wrong to the kid this is just it's insane first of all if anyone tried to do that with my kid I would meet him at the door with a gun I mean that this is this is the kind of stuff where you're talking legit Civil War like when you say that the government can take people's kids from them because the government knows better than you how to parent your kids on basic things like are you a boy or a girl that's gonna get violent pretty quickly if you send someone to my door with a gun saying I'm taking your daughter from you because your daughter says she's a boy at school and you and you're not gonna take her to a psychiatrist to start her transitioning process oh no but one how did we get so far down this rabbit hole of insanity and this is again this is not taking away the personal choice of a 60 year old man like Bruce Jenner who decides he wants to be a woman you want free country go have at it have a good time but how did we get so crazy that that becomes an option that people aren't they're not paying attention to the the the massive variables that a child encounters psychological variable stress variables what's going on in the home what's happening hormonal e what's happening psychologically what is happening to you and how how can you decide like this is it your get you're gonna allow this kid to make a like a locked-down decision to begin gender transition surgery at like 9 or 10 years old hormone blockers in there to an eight-year-old yeah and you know and then they'll show you like this girl who's like 13 who used to be a boy and you know you see her act and talk and they go how could you imagine that this isn't a girl okay I don't you know I don't know I don't I don't know I mean I just don't know what happened I'm gonna go with the fact that there's a y-chromosome in every cell of that person's body except ironically for some of his sperms to tell me that that's probably a boy and and yes you can block the manifestation of some physical characteristics that does not change the chromosomes and there are legitimately intersex people right mean they're people who legitimately have conditions like Klinefelter's syndrome I mean they're like these are these are actual biological things but if you're telling me any boy can be a girl no no the answer is no and it's that's that's not biologically correct and you're not doing any sort of service to a child especially we evidence less I mean you know you're doing no service to a child by bringing by humoring what is obviously a mental condition and a mental condition by the way again linked forty percent lifetime suicide rate is higher than any other population on planet Earth by a whopping margin I mean telling kids that we are going to force you into the like you express when you're five that you think you're the opposite sex and now at eight we're gonna transition you into this and your suicide rate is exactly the same as somebody who didn't do that railroads very similar to someone who didn't do that and and like this is somehow supposed to benefit the person it's just it's it's beyond imagination I think it's cruelty well it's very strange for sure and as someone who doesn't experience gender dysphoria I like to mean i when when someone's got some sort of an issue whatever it is whether you call it an issue or a condition or whatever the fuck it is and I don't have it I try to be as as standoffish I tried to be as objective I tried to be as as kind as possible this is a weird one though this is a weird one because it's it's become some sort of a fad and any criticism of it whatsoever even discussion of it you are labels as a transphobic piece of shit yeah I think it's only weird honestly because it's run into the weird sexual politics that dominates in the country because if we were to talk about anorexia which is a form of body dysphoria yes alright or if we were to talk about I mean they're actually something body identity integrity disorder right where people like want to lose an arm and we would be saying well the problem is in your brain it's not in your arm right like chopping off your arm seems a little extreme but if you want to do that like go ahead but if you were a kid and it's in five-year-old wouldn't say oh well this kid's gonna suffer with this their entire life let's just chop off their arm now let's let's prevent them their arm from developing like this is not and to tell the entire society that this is a positive good is is a whole other thing it's one thing to try and people who have a disorder humanely has another thing to redefine in terms of the entire civilization as well as biology in order to fit that this is it's valuing the subjective over the object of science is objective your feelings about who you are is subjective you can have those feelings but once you are trying to translate those feelings into the objective standard we almost all by now you're encroaching on my territory it's not just it's not just you're doing what you want to do anymore you're telling me what I have to do that's a different thing right now when people say that there's this 40% suicide rate amongst transgender people one of the arguments that I've heard is it's because they're not accepted right I've heard this do yeah yeah and that if they were accepted and then they felt themselves and they felt loved for their true self then it would be just like everybody else and I've seen no evidence to suggest that if there's if there is a decrease based on treatment then it's marginal at best but not just for yeah it's is it uniform like I would like to know like is like gender dysphoria is it in a similar percentile as anorexia or what bodybuilders get or what strippers get when they get triple left it's like the anorexic suicide rate I think dysphoria is a weird thing you know it's it's it is met people there's a girl that goes to my yoga class that's anorexic and it's so disturbing sad oh it's it's horrifying it's horrifying and listen I'm not so I'm not saying that we should mistreat people but if again you're talking about an entire society being forced to redefine basic biological terminology right then like it'd be an adult like like live with this I'm happy to treat you with listen what I would hire a transgender person but I'm not going to see I'm not going to change what reality is in order to humor you like if you call yourself Napoleon I'm not going to call you Napoleon or not would you take it into consideration no I mean when you're looking at this still it goes what if someone was really good at their job and someone else was equally good at their job but not transgender would you lean towards the not transgender person because you say well the transgender person they're dealing with a host of psychological issues obviously well I mean I think that you would have to think about you know typical aspects of reliability just the same way you would with and their mental disorder if you knew somebody was was manic-depressive which is super common and you have somebody who's equally qualified he's not manic-depressive you might think well that might have an effect on how they do their job yeah so maybe I mean I'd you know I haven't had enough personal experience with transgender people to know whether it would impact a secretarial job or something probably not you know probably not but it's but again to pretend that like transgenders in the military this seems to me like in a decision that should be made by military people will actually have to determine how much does this impact the job and if you already have a group of people with a 40% suicide rate who have high levels of instant higher levels of instabilities a group not individually as a group and you're choosing which groups to pick from to be on the frontlines in small units living under severe pressure for months at a time you know like is that something that is that what you're gonna go for or is that something where like you'd have to overcome certain presumptions in order to get there yeah I tweeted something that Kristin Beck wrote the other day but when the military band went trump apparently there was not a real bang that was bullshit I mean base track from the sessions thing yeah yeah it's later who's back to 20 my sessions yeah this was the part about that I didn't like like I actually agree that there is a question as to whether the military should be recruiting transgender people because I think that the military has certainly it creates a bunch of questions not just questions about who showers with whom but also questions like okay you have a transgender man does he have to fill the female standards of fitness or the male founder that standards a fitness bra like these are actual questions yeah does it how does it work with troop cohesion where you have a group of men and they have a man he was technically a man but he's did you treat him as a woman like does he have to carry the same amount of stuff is the guy like how does that work exactly does this the cost of gender transition surgery and hormones and psychologists like does that come into play at all here would you recruit from the anorexic community for the military Mike these are like real questions but that said that's why they commissioned to study from general mattis at Department of Defense he was going to look into all of this and then give a report in six months and Trump just sort of tweeted it out there I agree that I think that trumps general you know his general attitude on it is probably correct in terms of what the military's that are doing what what it's not there to do but what I don't agree with is how he did it at all because it's disrespectful to the people in the military or transgender I mean like I wouldn't want to find out in a tweet I don't want a better rationale than two tweets and then we're back to and then we're back to you know like look they're doing more than I I mean they're suffering the military I didn't serve in the military it seems like it would be pretty hypocritical of me to say well it's perfectly respectful to say in to tweets you're out because that's the way it is without any sort of supporting argumentation and he didn't actually implement a policy he didn't give the policy to the Defense Department so they could even implement it the Pentagon says they're not implementing it because they don't have a policy this is a PR thing is a weird PR thing but it really stirred up people in the designed to do right I'm sure well either that or he just felt like tweeting I think that's what I think that's what it was I mean he wanted to shift the conversation and it was the funniest thing about that is that he did it in two tweets and the first half of the tweet was in consultation with my generals and my military experts we have decided that we will no longer accept ellipses ten-minute gap transgender people in the military so there was there was a there is a story of BuzzFeed that was kind of funny they wouldn't interviewed a bunch of people in the Pentagon and a bunch of the people in the Pentagon were like during that 10-minute cab I didn't know whether we were going to nuclear war what right is that first we was like except North Korea's North Korea's missile missile test program Wow yeah this again is evidence you know I think it's an example of even if I think the policy is good good policy done the wrong way is actually counterproductive for the policies that I want to see done like I want it laid out by mattis I want it laid out by Defense Department I want all the reasons laid out so we can have a good discussion over it I don't really want just like thought vomit on Twitter that's just not I don't think it's effective well it also seems that this issue is such a hot issue and it's also an issue that you're not really allowed to have an opinion on other than the standard opinion this is always a woman trapped in a man's body and this is the way it is and by the way healthy this day Guardian notion that it's like a man that it's like the the the soul in the machine and that's the there was a woman and deep down for 40 years who had three children with a man's penis and now is now is escaping there's a Ghostbusters like again have you seen the man in England was it in England no it was Germany the man that identifies a six year old girl yes and so they turned him into a six year old girl so there's this click yes is that clip of me that's gone around the internet a fair bit where I'm talking to a college girl about this and she's saying like men or men can be women and women can be men and I said well how old are you I love that clip why aren't you sixty to sixty yeah and she's like baffled like what and then it finally hits her and it's like well you know ya say it's I think this is what's kind of frightening about the age we live in is that we can't even come up with common definitions of basic things how we supposed have conversations with each other if you can't decide what a man is or what a woman is or or whether a scientific fact ought to be relevant or not you know like like at least we could decide what was a scientific fact or not before and now it's like the subjective has just eaten everything if I don't think it's a scientific fact it's no longer a scientific fact x-parameters of the argument it's become about freedom the freedom to be your authentic self versus biology and right and again be it be your authentic self I don't give a shit they will do whatever you want like you know yeah more power to you but it is no longer about your freedom to be authentic self when you're talking about either legislation that impacts how I run my business or hi raise my child or you are suggesting that it is my duty to humor your authentic self like I think there's a lot of people who do stupid crap their entire lives it's not my job to humor their authentic self I mean I'm Pro drug legalization but I've never done drugs and I think the drugs are stupid you know that don't tell me that I have to like cheer when somebody smokes a joint like do what you want but don't tell me that I have to redefine what I think is good and bad behavior like that's silly yeah it doesn't make any sense and the other thing that it became this weird political hot point where we were talking about bathrooms yeah then it become like the number one toss was easy for people to sort of boil take the argument into that right of course like this what about my children my children we go in the bathroom and a man with a dress is gonna come in he's gonna claim that he's a identifying as a woman and it got to the point where so many people were upset about it that people were boycotting South Carolina remember that oh yeah you know that and this the one I thought was amazing was was the n-c-double-a saying they were gonna remove the final four from North Carolina cuz they passed the the bathroom bill right in North Carroll and I asked online okay so when are you gonna abolish the separate male and female divisions of the n-c-double-a like I mean you've said that we can't have separate male and female bathrooms we're biological males play and you know we're biological males go to one bathroom and biological females go to another so why do you have separate divisions why do you have a whitey of an NCAA women's division in an NC double-a men's division yeah where does this go I mean eventually it just boiled down I mean eventually it goes to one place or another like either we just say this is a step too far it give me a break you know science says no or we say anyone can be anything at anytime a man is a woman and a woman as a man and you know it's in just pick have you ever seen any videos of people that are gender fluid I have seen those videos those videos are fascinating they wake up one day and they're a woman the next day they're our man and son there was a guy on NPR on radio lab on the podcast who transitions at times of stress makes perfect sense to me in the middle of having a conversation I just switched I'm Paul now I'm a man when he's more stressed as he switched into a woman because that'd be really sexist right I mean I think they're like if he was stressed at work and he switched into a woman and started crying that seems kind of sexist to me that's implying that women are the people who cry at work so that is sex also this raises a bunch of other weird questions like okay if you're like there's there's been this again you want talk about weird there's been this this this weird push in parts of the trans community to suggest that a male who doesn't want to have sex with a biological male who says he's a female is a is now a sexist against foam is it transphobic you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man a biological man and it doesn't make you gay to do that right if you have sex with the biological man who says it's a woman that's straight sex but if you were to have sex with a biological woman who says she's a man you're gay mmm yeah weird it's definitely weird but I have seen the arguments and the blog posts and the tweets about men who discriminate against trans women who do not want to date trans women and people keep saying well it's it's culturally defines like no that's called evolution have a baby together correct yeah correct it turns out that evolution wants men to have sex with women like I'm sorry to break it to everybody but evolution relies on you reproduction okay if you put that thing in the wrong place it ain't gonna reproduce like that's just sorry I I don't know I don't know why I have to keep apologizing for science and and then they say that my party is the party of non science like what like you say that two minutes before my baby is born it's not a baby and a man can be a woman but I'm anti science I'm just I'm wildly confused by this well the whole thing is wildly confusing but it's just it's such a strange subject it's such a strange subject that's been brought to the phone I think it's about more than moral posturing than it is about people who actually think this is a major issue I think you're absolutely right and I think people love to be virtuous they love to be on that side they left a virtue signal how dare you yeah how dare you with dicks or lack of fake dicks but they don't really have a lot of fake dicks they don't really go that far they just sort of take testosterone and see what's up but it's just it's a it's a weird facet of our society today that is uh unexpected I mean you go back twenty thirty years and it was an oddity and you know even there during the renee Richards thing it was it was more of an oddity than anything this is why I say I think that it's I think that a lot of people who are virtually signalling are still treating it as an oddity they just won't admit that right I think that they're watching it because it's a circus to them and I think that's actually cruel I don't think that you should like put people who suffer from mental illness on the cover of magazines I just don't I think that that's bad strategy what about body builders I mean you know I don't know that I'll be honest with you I don't know that much about bodybuilding I mean look like I know that more of a marathon runner what I've heard the argument about body builders they suffer from it as well is that in order to get that big you almost have to have some sort of a body dysmorphia you have to not understand how insanely huge you are yeah I'll be really into it their argument is they're really into it and which makes sense to me but I've heard people say that that it's it's like we're almost like a reverse anorexia like they never feel like they're big enough yeah I've seen that people say that before yeah well it's weird that the human mind is suspect or subjects really variable and it's really open to suggestion really open to suggestion there's people above children transition for sure for sure I mean listen you you see it in everything including fashion like how many dudes wax their chest now 30 years ago nobody wax their chest do they waxing dudes are waxing Jeff shave their chest wax their chest whenever whatever it is questions about the youth or turn to young Jamie yeah but I mean you watch TV now and every dude on TV has a chest as bare as my you know 14 month old sons area and it's like where did this come from and this game was great then one work chiseled it also came from TV and was it like TV it was gonna be men are gonna be hairless now this is this is the new trend men are gonna be hairless mmm you don't even get the Burt Reynolds like you know bare chest anymore and so if people are susceptible to even that with regard to fashion like people will have first for five years people convince themselves that skinny jeans or a thing you know what people are open to virtually any sort of suggestion bell-bottoms to come in they come out and when they try to bring bell-bottoms back I did not a good coffee they tried and people like nah not this one platforms when these two are platform shoes that's what I'm just keeping around on my dad's old clothes because eventually they're they're gonna come back in again you never know yeah the idea of fashion and culture also being like the same sort of mechanism that allows people to be variable when it comes to their gender and that's I mean you actually said there's a study I thought this is chastening there's a study in Britain or Poland Britain about sexual orientation and what I found was 95 percent of people over the age of 60 identified as exclusively heterosexual of people who are under the age of 30 only 42 percent identified as exclusively heterosexual it was like okay well in two generations it's not that half the population became bisexual right that is not a scientific thing that means that people are open to suggestion about their sexual behavior which you would assume hmm right so so assuming that culture has no impact and this goes against the whole you born this way aspect of even the homosexual rights movement the gay rights movement that says oh you were born this way agree that there's a genetic component to sexual behavior but the idea that that's what why 50% of the UK population has shifted toward you know I'm open to anything the culture has some thank you person as I say 95 percent people over the age of 60 and then 42 percent of people under the age of 30 so that's it so that's 42 percent say no okay no 42 percent we'll say they're extremely extremely a heterosexual extremely forties exclusively heterosexual so 60% nearly 60% 68% say that they're on the spectrum but not exclusively heterosexual that's fascinating I wonder if they only talk to women or drunk like young drunk girls they get crazy like if you think I'm trying to you know laughing right we're Adam Adam has a whole shtick about like in the future there's gonna be a point where guys are considered gay if they won't kiss another dood like what are you gay you afraid that you're gay kiss another dood and show me you're not gay we've gone we've gone around the bend a little bit we have well there's also this thing that I think happens when you have two very clear sides you know where you have teams and you sort of have a line in the sand you're not supposed to cross there's the right side and there's the left side and we have that in this country we really don't have a third party option no there are third parties are kind of a joke and whenever you have two opposing viewpoints people dig in if you've seen this new documentary about William F Buckley and gore Vidal and the debate is any good it's great it's really interesting debates they had during the 1968 election it's fascinating we have watched some of those debates but yeah it's intense yeah particularly the one where Buckley threatens to punch fit all because I'm a queer and says I'll sock you in the face and you'll stay plastered it's weird because it's spectacular and it's such like it's so in the the speak of the day you know the Brahmin accent it's great like it's almost British accent yeah it's fantastic it's really interesting and then but but the these I mean it's that thing this my team versus that team and I think the left is guilty of it as much as the right is guilty of it it seems like it's it's a real issue where there's a lot of people that have ideas and opinions it's sort of crossed party lines but they vote on one side or another and they vote for their team I think that's right I think that especially in this last election I think that was true I think that people felt so alienated by the other side like to understand a lot of people who voted you have to understand that there are a lot of people in the country who felt insulted by the left they were just sick of being called the racist sexist pig at homophobes every time someone wanted to advance a policy on the left and so they said okay screw that at least Trump's not calling me that bright so I'll do that and then they're a bunch of people on the Left who now feel insulted by Trump's even presence and they think all the people who voted for Trump are those people and so they're fighting racism sexism bigotry and homophobia by voting against Trump again it would go back to this day and there there's a hardening of there's not one bubble in the country there's two you know the right likes to accuse the left of being in a bubble in the coast there's there's a bubble on the right too which is the idea that everybody on every piece of the media is lying to you right there's always fake news everything is fake news you don't like it it's fake news these bubbles are not healthy for the Republic I mean we can't have conversations with each other if we if we do this routine no deception is not healthy across the board and there's another thing that's going on where everybody's a Nazi like I've never heard people called a Nazi more than I have over the last six months I mean it's been crazy if you support Trump you're not see you're a neo-nazi you're here somehow or another you're a fascist if you didn't vote for Hillary you're a Nazi like we some people have boiled it down to like the purest form yeah I agree I mean first of all it demonstrates tremendous historical ignorance forget the Holocaust like you just look at what who Hitler was and the prophecies he promulgated like he was basically he was all over the place when he wanted to talk to socialists he was a socialist when he wanted to talk to capitalist he was a capitalist he was he was a top-down government guy for sure but he would speak the language of you know what would be considered the European far-right today on a lot of a lot of issues but then he would talk about redistribution of resources and universal health care and all this kind of stuff and removing guns but he's just a convenient Club I mean that's just a convenient Club because then and then to this part that scares me once you say that somebody is Hitler and then it actually becomes obligatory to physically resist them then we can say you can't have a conversation with Hitler yeah like once you say somebody's Hitler the KKK what are you what are you gonna do let have a conversation with them at the very least you won't talk with them and at the most two might try to punch them that is really a problem with that those the nomenclature right that's really a problem with identifying someone in that way that they are someone that you have to resist and they are someone who cannot be reasoned with they are someone who is absolutely evil there's no like variables or variance in their behavior and listen I like fiery political rhetoric I find it fun but I think once once you label somebody you know completely evil you you you have responsibility not to debate with him the first one's going not to talk with them even the conversation legitimizes them yeah I mean that like I mean listen I'm sure you're gonna get a bunch of shit from people for even having me on because the idea is gonna be well how could you have on somebody election period or legit amazing his point of view by having him on I know a lot of people who I pull it eclis disagree with who have had that experience what will have me on their show and it's like how dare you have Shapiro on because you're just granting him cover you know like or we can just have a conversation and maybe we'll disagree maybe we'll agree yeah I'd really don't give a fuck about those people I think that's a silly conversation III feel like you should talk to everybody and if you disagree or agree I have friends on that I my friend yesterday I had on Eddie Bravo he believes in everything's a fucking conspiracy I disagree with him wildly and I love him like a brother I don't think you have to agree with people and I don't think you have to at the idea that you can't just have a conversation with someone about something and see if he can find middle ground or see if you could clearly define their point of view or find their perspective that's missing today in a weird way and one of the weirdest things about the election was the ping-pong match between the left and the right has played out on national television by the media I would watch especially cable news I would watch fox news and then go to CNN and go back and forth lip channels you know you have that previous channel but yeah on the directv i would just put it on both of them go what what world's my mom said this in 2012 with Romney and Obama if you read the right-wing media there was no way Romney was gonna lose and if you read the left-wing media there was no way Romney was gonna win and she said which one of these do I believe in it sounds probably somewhere in the middle like I have a basic rule which is that if you have a New York Times report and then you have a report from my site The Daily wire and they share the facts you can probably assume the facts are true but the opinions that are you know embedded with the facts those are opinions right and that's what's so hard about I think the modern media landscape is trying to separate the facts from the opinion and so this is why when Trump says fake news he's not wrong that CNN hates him and the New York Times hates him that he's right about that but just labeling it all fake news is inaccurate also because most of what they're reporting is true right it's just that it's biased something can be both true and biased yeah I'm true and biased right I say things that I think are factual but I'm obviously conservative that's my point of view you know touch it so that's and you're a commentator right that's what you do I mean half of it is you know riling people up saying provocative things I mean that's it's this is and this is where I think the right is correct about CNN in the New York Times and some of the other networks like though if that's the right what pisses you off more CNN or the MSNBC most people on the right will say CNN not MSNBC because MSNBC is honest enough to say we're on the left and CNN pretends we have no bias we remove all that same thing with the New York Times you know we're above all that and then they run the most egregiously biased headline so we go well that if they're lying about that they're lying about everything you know one of my fast my most fascinating characters if this whole play was Scott Adams and particularly because Scott Adams and when I had him on my podcast he was saying he doesn't even vote yeah he was like what I am what I am paying attention to he goes I'm a trained hypnotist and I'm paying attention to the powers of persuasion and I'm looking at trends and I'm making some predictions that turned out to be accurate and he's like he's looking at trumpet he's not talking about trumping these glowing terms he's talking about him as being an effective persuader and he lost millions of dollars because of that opinion talking about a guy that he's not even gonna vote for I mean this is all leading up to the election where people were fuckin furious at him yeah and even more furious at him after Trump won because he would do those coffe with Scott things he does on periscope where he wakes up but he's just starts asking questions and he's so measured and calm and I did he had a podcast recently with Sam Harris where I think he was just like a little too far over the edge of apologizing for some of trumps behavior and and sort of attributing some of trumps behavior to that you could say was incompetence and in tribute to the like some some sort of a master but this is my only quarrel with Scott I think is that he tends to believe that everything Trump does is 987 degree underwater upside down Hungry Hungry Hippos like everything is it's all just apps of genius and it's three steps down the road instead of like stumbling his way to victory okay I knew everyone involved in the campaign like every single person who's involved in the campaign I knew this was a stumble their way to victory like it is amazing the minds human beings are we need to think it's sort of like the Joker says in the Dark Knight we need to think there's a plan we always need to think there's a plan and so if Trump won it must be because there was some master plan that he unveiled over the course of the campaign three weeks before the election he was caught on tape saying that he wanted to grab women by the p-word no there was no master plan okay it's just that Hillary was an awful candidate and no one liked her okay the idea that the Trump was like even the idea that there was like broad national movement for Trump that wasn't there for other candidates he won fewer votes in Wisconsin than Mitt Romney didn't he won the state and that's because no one liked Hillary I mean this is the untold story of the elections this was not a referendum on Donald Trump this was a referendum on Hillary Clinton particularly in the heartland and people hated her guts right Barack Obama won Ohio walking away everyone talks about Michigan and Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin nobody talks about Ohio Trump won Ohio walking away one of the reasons he want Ohio walking away is because in 2012 Barack Obama really drove out the black vote the the percentage of the black vote typically in Ohio it's like 10% of the general vote in 2012 is like 13 to 15 percent of the general vote and that was the entire margin of victory for Obama in the state of Ohio Hillary got you know closer to sort of the traditional percentages and she lost in a whopping blowout in Ohio no one likes Hillary Clinton in the left was so arrogant that they thought we can take the most unpopular unlikable unqualified nasty boring human being anyone has seen for 20 years and will run her she's the one we'll run but do you understand how incompetent you have to loot it how incompetent you have to be to lose to a celebrity game show host like like you have to suck at this in a royal manner I don't know now now the thing the floodgates are open but don't you think senator big rock man yes oh he's gonna win the primary if he didn't win the primary and then he would have to run as an independent then he'd be indie-rock right kid rock is gonna win the primary oh well we can only hope once he's in the office he grows into it he becomes adult Rock how is Ted new do not run for office yet that's what I want to know how does he not you know him rock give me a conversation about running for president you know and that you know if the people really wanted it he would do it I was like oh good Jesus oh I just can't wait for the rock Oprah you know the rock might win The Rock might win on it if Oprah ran in 2020 yeah she the rock with Oprah it's a fucking dual slam-dunk of me yeah the rock and Oprah together so I have this weird idea that we should actually reinstitute a monarchy and it should just be ceremonial and they can be a celebrity right I'll just make a celebrity monarch okay and that person will just be there to look pretty and so what Queen of England exactly but don't really have anything no power no power because we keep conflating the presidency with like who actually has to do things right with like people who want to represent the country yeah we have unpopularity contest see who gets to control the nukes which is insane that's pretty wild that's pretty wild I think that you know this is we all think in in cinematic terms now and you know Hollywood is run by the the dopiest jackasses like I grew up with all these people right these are not people who you want controlling the narrative and then we're like you know what let's take if Tom Hanks would only run if Tommy what makes you think Tom Hanks would be a good president like did you look at trumpeting what god he's doing such a brilliant job but we really need now is the guy from castaway we need is an actor again we did well with Regan we need another actor we did great with Schwarzenegger as the governor hey at least Reagan was governor for 20 years before he before he was the President of the United States I mean let's let's put him let's put him through the wringer I mean Schwarzenegger proved in eight years that he was not capable of doing anything except kind of sucking well you ever heard him talk about it the way it from his perspective he's like you don't really understand how much red tape and bullshit you have to go through he goes I would meet with people and they would agree with me that it's a good idea however they would say my voters are never gonna agree with it so I'm gonna oppose it even though I know you're right there's a bunch of farmers that are gonna be mad at me for doing that so I'm not going to do that well this is the other thing in politics that really drives me not so there are two promises that politicians make that are complete bullshit the first promise they make is I'm gonna go to Washington DC and I'm gonna get things done no you're not okay the system the system is built for gridlock it's built for gridlock it's where we have two separate houses of Congress it's why we have a president who can veto is why we have a Supreme Court that rules on cases is built for grid lights why we have States that are supposed to be able to check the federal government all this is in the Federalist Papers it was built for gridlock and some people are happy with that because that's how Trump is being like sideline that every time he tries to make something really important I think we all should be happy with that because the only way things were supposed to get past was with wide public support right which is probably a good thing we don't want the government shifting wildly and veering on its axis every four years or every two years I like the gridlock my big problem is that the gridlock now protects a huge system that I don't like that's been built up over a hundred years and in the case of growth of government but I like the gridlock but that's one promise that's made and then people are disappointed oh if we get in there we're gonna repeal Obamacare it's like no you're not you're not I mean like you can promise it but now you're not gonna do it because you're full of crap when you said it and now you're not going to do it and the gridlock is there and it's hard to change things you know it takes a tremendous effort of will and electoral power to actually change things in a big way so this idea will let Trump and Trump like Trump would say it's not gonna be so easy it's like no it's not it's it wasn't easy for Obama Obama passed Obamacare and that was it for his presidency can do anything for the next six years right there were no major pieces of legislation nothing happened after that he lost Congress and that was it okay so that's promise number one the other promise is your anger is justified and this is one I hate even more and that is the idea that you know in in regular life when you have kids I have kids when your kid is angry the first thing you have to teach your kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry sometimes your anger is not justified if you want to make good human beings you have to determine whether they are right to be angry is is your anger correct politicians are in the business of justifying people's anger oh you hear this about the Trump voter a lot right they're so angry they're so angry okay well I'm angry too about things but are they angry about the right things right and Trump would say you're right to be angry because you've lost your job in podunk Ohio because it's being stolen by the Chinese or by the Mexicans or something and it's like well is that factually true or you just are just pandering to the anger and on the left you hear people say this to black folks in the inner city it's the system that's keeping it down it's a racist white supremacist system that's keeping you down then well is that true or I just pandering to the voter because it's hard to tell people hard truths why you're not right to be angry get off your ass and do something with your life and this is true for regardless of race you know go out there no one cares enough to stop you and your life your life is your own no one in the United States cares about you wants to stop you wants to throw obstacles up in your own way I'm not sure you can win an election on the basis of go live your own life even though everyone keeps claiming they want to live their own life I think most people are full of it I think most people don't want to live their own life they want a politician to tell them they're all of their complaints about life being unfair are justified and the politicians gonna solve all that we don't want people who stay out of our way we want people to be mommy men and you know that's that's a tempting a tempting proposition for politics there's certain a lot of that when you're talking to adults because you're dealing with people that have the momentum of all their failures in life and all the different things that are not going right and then here they are at this moment today right now and they want to figure out why and why they're not on track and how to get on track and the easiest way is to point the finger or blame someone else and everybody has their own hand I'm not saying that people's hands are fair and that you know it doesn't have it easy a lot of people that have it easy I have it easier than a lot of people for sure for sure absolutely but the reality is there's a tremendous amount of psychological factors that go into why someone does or does not succeed and to placate them or to you know to play on those psychological factors as you know not being their own fault it's very tempting because it works with people people love to hear that they love to hear that it's not your fault yep and I think that's what politicians have become in the business of doing and it's both right and left it seems people saying that it's it's not your fault because you're being screwed by some foreign country it's not your fault because the immigrants are doing it to you um it's not your fault maybe some maybe some of that's true but you have to show me why it's true you have to show me what the actual like did you lose your job because of and because of China or did you lose your job because you're in an industry that is being crowded out because of technological change and because your unions struck and created wages too high to be globally competitive like let's look at the actual logic here is to and out and then how can we change it how can we make it better how can we is it something we have to do or is it a matter of you need to broaden your skill set like you see a lot of people now who are stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago that you're gonna work and stay there for twenty years and then you're gonna grow and then you're gonna you know leave with gold watch and that's not the way the job market works anymore I mean if you're if you're entering the job market right now as a college student you can expect that in the next ten years you'll probably work four jobs you know like the the turnover is too great and you have to be constantly increasing your skill set also with every new innovation there's businesses that branch out and become new and then there's also businesses that die and there's no bringing them back you're not going to bring back the printing press no there's a lot of stuff that but for the guy in the printing press industry you tell them that try to get elected from the printing press guy well I mean right now they're trying to stop automatically wrote like within the last day or two to try to block automated trucks yeah yeah because there's a tremendous amount of people that yeah but it's gonna be a lot more efficient when it's not people and you know that this is the great fallacy that's been people have been trying to fight since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution as this idea okay well the new technology is gonna kill jobs and then no one will ever work again we've had the same unemployment rate in this country for the last hundred years and the technology is a little bit better Teamsters convinced Congress to block driverless trucks that's yeah that's crazy crazy seems crazy it seems like you're fighting an inevitable tide well I mean imagine that like how is that gonna work for all the other industries that are affected let's say that you now have you're artificially raising the prices of all the goods that now have to be brought in by the Teamsters and now it's more expensive so it's more money out of your pocket in my pocket that's that's money that I'm maybe I was willing to buy American but now I'm gonna buy Chinese cuz I have to feed my family like this is that's not how economics works it's just not how economics is there any argument that they're not ready yet that these that's one of the issues is that with a lot of these so the automated trucks basically in order for them to work you need dedicated lanes because otherwise human error is is something that if like if there's a Google car on the road and you're a bad driver the Google car is probably gonna get in the crash or maybe more likely getting a crash than if we're human driving have you ever seen people freak out those Tesla cars and see what they could do to them I haven't I haven't seen those tests I actually saw somebody do two Google car when you're when a car is on that automated thing if you just swerve they slam on the brakes and back up on you like people have done it to people and filmed it when I see people using automated cars it's it's it's not done it's not ready yeah it's the mix again it's sort of like how there's a lot of fuel-efficient lighter cars on the road but they're a lot more dangerous than the heavier cars because the heavier cars the clunkers are still around from 1970 in their tanks yeah there's one through three Priuses how do you feel about universal basic income because that's a subject that comes up a lot lately when Elon Musk is talking about these driverless cars one of the things he's saying is that one thing that we're going to need is universal basic income he said we're going to have to figure out some way to feed all these people they're gonna get taken out of the job market because their jobs are become irrelevant so I think that universal basic income is for when the technology gets so good that they're legitimately are no jobs I don't think that we're there yet so if you have a machine that can make everything basically for free and then there's a bunch of people who you don't need anymore to do work then you can talk about a universal basic income because there's no scarcity scarcity is what creates a need for labor so if there's scarcity in any industry then there's going to be need for labor there's gonna be need for new labor people are gonna still have to you know work on these trucks and deal with technology and the computer industry didn't destroy jobs all over the United States when typewriters went out so I think it's a little premature I'm not sure there will ever be a day when there's a machine that when the Machine Society is so well developed that it can take over all jobs I do think you're seeing a bifurcation in the labor market so I think people who are in jobs like yours in mind like we're lucky this is a creative job it's hard for machines to create but for jobs that are single tasks jobs a lot more of those are going to be technologically driven and so people are gonna have to you know work the right side of their brain a little bit and we're gonna have to train people in a different way but my perspective on universal basic income is when you have a four percent unemployment rate it's very difficult to say you need a universal basic income like it's again 96 percent of people in the labor market who can work are working so that's not that's not that's not suggesting to me that there's this vast underclass of people who are totally incapable of working and once you do that you see what you've seen actually with the disability programs in the United States right we're now everybody's on disability like the fastest growing government program in America is the disability program where people declare themselves disabled so that they can get government pensions basically once you have universal basic income is there an incentive to work and also I'm not sure that you've solved a lot of people's problems like people still see need something to do with their day yeah 16 year-olds do you see who retired and they're dead within three years the utopian idea is that somehow they going to open up these people's inherent creativity and they'll find something Joey I mean how many people say thirty-three using the term hooey yeah I love it it's a again you know I'm never I hope I'd never retire because I just know too many people who are retire and their oh I'm gonna retire and I'm in a Gulf another paint I'm free and six months later they're dead yeah well people enjoy doing things and feeling like they're valuable you know and I don't know if that necessarily has to be a job but it's a very clear definitive test of whether or not you're valuable if somebody gives you money and you get that money you're like look I'm valuable I'm doing something I'm contributing I got a check for my week exactly there's there's a lot of hours in the day and it's gonna be hard to fill that with watercolor painting and beat poetry classes ah I don't know man I'd find shit to do but I see but I I've been fairly self employed most of my life yeah I think I just I've gotten and some people are driven like I would find stuff to do too but it's there is a difference and you know not all human beings are the people who would actually go out and take classes and find things to do do you have aspirations outside of commentary when it comes to politics maybe some point down the road do you think you run for president or something like that I mean apparently anyone can and this is what I'm finding is sure so um but you're a reasonable guy uh I don't know I mean I I like what I'm doing in the sense that I get to work on what people believe which i think is sort of the root of politics I'm not sure implementing is the same thing as I said I'm not sure that the president can get like I'm more focused on getting people to think in the terms that I'd like them to think you know about limited government and you taking control of your own life and I might be able to do more good you know promulgating that message using a growing medium like we're very lucky I mean or the podcast went from having three thousand listeners you know three hundred episodes ago to now we have three hundred thousand listeners a day you know so it's it's it continues to grow so as that crowd continues to grow it's actually harder for me to said I'd want to jump into politics not easier I think the limited government thing to me has always been a fascinating subject because the people that don't want limited government they're always that is the utopian ideal in my mind yeah somehow or another the government's gonna be effective if you give them more money like well this is an argument with a friend where he wanted people to be taxed more because he felt like that money could be distributed to people and you would get like more funding for the Arts was one of his arguments but my thought was like first of all the arts like when their value when people like them they pay for him yep that's not get it and funding for the Arts means you're gonna have like fucking LACMA I'll show the LA County Museum the art fucking box on the ground that someone's calling a piece of art that guy whether you went to it was either in San Francisco or at LACMA where he went there and he took off his glasses and he just put them on the floor and then he stood next to them going you know kind of standing there and kind of stroking his chin seen there were 30 people all around him staring the glasses on the floor it's like it's amazing yeah it's fucking horseshit right that the modern art exhibits like there's there was another one recently with someone like left behind a pineapple yeah I remember this yeah yeah it's just it's crazy it really is crazy and it's all so pretentious and it's also stoking those fires of pretension and making something that's not legitimately creative making it celebrated because you don't really have the ability to create something that's legitimately creative yeah yeah I was pointing this out today with regard to it's funny how a lot of people who want bigger government they embrace states that start to grow the government and then when things go to shit they're like nowhere to be found so Venezuela is the most obvious example right Venezuela has turned from what was the richest country in South America and had the best oil reserves of anywhere in the Western Hemisphere basically they've turned it into just a garbage heap people waiting in lines have a friend named Nami Horowitz who went down there did some documentary stuff down there and he was I think his cameraman got shot he was who's watching people like literally shooting dogs in the streets for food and this is I mean it's Caracas is the most violent city in the Western Hemisphere now and all of this is because Hugo Chavez was a piece of garbage who centralized all power to himself redistributed the wealth to all of his friends and cronies and then and then supposedly up did the poor accept that now everyone is poor Wayne Ranney wasn't he friends with Sean Penn I don't even know what you're saying exactly so so I'm my show today I played like Sean Penn and Jesse Jackson and and that Freak Jeremy Corbyn who's the head of the Labour Party in Great Britain and they're all just praising Chavez right he's the great guy he was a hero to the poor and now Venezuela's going to shit and we're all these people like what would someone stick a camera in Sean Penn split face like now and just ask Sean Penn so like five minutes ago you were saying this was awesome but there's got to be some sort of a left response for that like what what is their take on the no true Scotsman fallacy right though well you know this is them living on it's because they never really got rid of enough private industry if they'd just gone further it would have been better it's like low Soviet Union and didn't work out that great either but like I got actually got a response it was really funny today I tweeted out that according to the World Bank Venezuela has one of the least income unequal societies on earth so it's actually pretty income equal reckons nobody has anything right and then it's garbage and so the the Socialists the official Socialist Party tweeted me and they said this is because socialism has never truly been tried okay all right sure [Music] well the wonderful idea of socialism is that it's going to even everything out and that you shouldn't get paid more for that no one should get paid more and then everyone should have some sort of a like a peak that you could reach right and think there's some sort of competition involved there's got to be some there's got to be some sort of incentive but only so much right this is like the Bernie said this is democratic socialism like formal socialism is the state owns the whole thing but democratic socialism is there's private industry but only to a certain point and then we tell people no no then you find out about Bernie and his wife and his wife's idea was to buy up a bunch a land and expand the college and then the fucking college went under and now they're being sued vacation homes yeah come on man it's all based on a lot of myth making about like Western Europe and and the Netherlands right so there's always two outs democratic socialist countries they're working great first of all a car in Denmark has a 60% import tax and costs literally twice what it would cost in the United States tax rates in Denmark are insane except for corporate taxes which the left in the United States really you know they love corporate action they want those higher Denmark has some of the lowest corporate taxes and regulations in the industrialized world so everybody is coming in and investing in Denmark it's only the citizens who are getting screwed by paying for this giant welfare state then their GDP tanked and now they've had to elect right-wing governments to slash back the the level of government I mean it turns out that capitalism is the great engine that dry like Singapore is there's nothing on Singapore right Singapore is like a rock ok City there's nothing there Singapore has one of most powerful economies on earth because they basically have no business regulations no taxes and no tariffs so you need whatever you want and when people can do whatever they want they make a lot of mutually beneficial exchanges end of story this is not that difficult but but it is difficult if you think that life is unfair right so what would you propose like what would you propose for the United States like the United States obviously what Trump wants to do is reinvigorate manufacturing make things in America again bring back the labor force make take away the jobs that are going to overseas and other countries in South America so I think that that's a bunch of slogans from him and I don't think it means in it so so number one I don't think a manufacturing job is more important than a tech job right ok a job is a job and in industries that are thriving you actually need more jobs and in industries that are not doing as well if the jobs disappear that's just the wages of a global economy and that's I know that sounds harsh to people who are in those industries but it's not a referendum on you or your value it's just saying that certain industries over time always you know are outsourced like we used to make t-shirts in the United States we don't make t-shirts here make them in Vietnam and it cost us like five bucks right so the so my view is I'm not gonna privilege ones I understand a lot of this is politics you want a favored manufacturing bases because there are a lot of manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan Wisconsin but then they vote since I don't care right since I'm not a politician my view is that if you want a thriving economy you relieve as much regulation as possible you lower the taxes for everyone personal and corporate you attract as much foreign investment as possible and you allow people to build businesses with this little risk as possible and then you allow them to compete and if they succeed they succeed and if they fail they fail and you get rid of tariffs as well because I want cheap inputs for my products and I want cheap products on the shelves at the store so don't have to pay a bajillion dollars for a pair of shoes so I'm my view of this is that economics is an element of freedom I am a free person I get to do with my money what I damn well and you don't get to stand in my way unless there is some sort of moral thing right like if you want to say let's put sanctions on let's put sanctions on Iran let's put sanctions on China right China's funding North Korea right now it hurts our national security we want to put sanctions on China to try and pressure them into ending North Korea that's a national security thing but the idea that like today Trump rolled out this new plan on immigration and he says I want to cut down on legal immigration but the reason is because I want to raise wages of people in the United States and I think well that's not productive because what you're actually doing is you're restricting the supply of labor artificially increasing the wages which artificially increases prices which means it's not competitive on a global scale which means the company's outsourced right so it's the exact same thing as minimum wage you create a minimum wage you're artificially increasing wages that increases prices that makes it non-competitive people outsource so it actually achieves the opposite of what you're trying to achieve all government intervention in the economy save for interventions that are designed to prevent externalities now things that I do that hurt you all of those are unjustified in my view what about an environmental protection so those are externalities right so like if I were to pollute a river it's not my River I don't get to pollute it right I get to throw my trash over my fence into your yard right that's a that's that's a different thing that's it yeah that's one of the most disturbing things about this administration is the cutting the funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the changing of their standards removing some of the funding for things like satellites that they're using to track the climate change and things along those lines and that that scares the shit out of me like it scares the shit out of means they're gonna ignore the environment in favor of the economy so I think that some of the environmental regulations are badly drawn and some of them are overwrought when it comes to for example fracking you know Obama pushed a lot of environmental regulations on fracking or the Keystone XL pipeline that kind of thing how do you feel about fracking I'm very much in favor of fracking what do you think about like when you hear stories about more earthquakes happening and in stable water supplies from what I've seen the the earthquake evidence is extraordinarily weak yeah the myth from what I've seen you know I'm again if you present me evidence that I find convincing I'm happy to change my mind on this right and as far as the as far as water pollution again the evidence has been pretty weak so if that changes then I'm happy to regulate it as far as when you say that's been weak there's there has been instances of fracking leading to pollution right sure but that's not every fracking leads to pollution right and so the question is is the regulation or how many are you willing to accept right which is the truth for all business right like how much we all drive cars how much pollution air water bottles somewhere there's a seagull choking on a cab correct so like how much are you willing to accept like what I don't appreciate is when people kind of futz the evidence or it's like oh well I accept my set my water on fire because of fracking it's like no that's not because of fracking that's because of the groundwater but in any case the you know as far as the satellites and global warming listen I think that it's pretty clear that the climate is warming I mean the greenhouse gas effect is a thing the question to me is less whether it's happening and more what are you going to do about it because even the left seems to have no real solutions as to what to do except for massively cutting economic growth and it seems to me that if we're talking about an increase according the IPCC if something like 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of the next century then on average right not not universally on average then it seems to me that it's easier to just say that the climate changes over time and maybe cities that are on the coast are gonna have to pull back a little bit over time like a hundred years a long time a hundred years ago we would have said that the the pollution was the chief thing to worry about in the United States cuz we're all using smokestacks and it's exactly and and now not really even through regulation but just through market competition you've gotten better environmental products so I think that the market does take care of a lot of these things people don't actually want to live in in human waste you know like we actually don't want to do that I know what's been disturbing me recently is how many times I see Bill Nye on TV talking about climate change well he's it again he's he has the same qualifications I do I mean he's like a mechanical engineering degree yeah kind of a comedian yeah I mean I think he is my childhood yes I believe he was like a comedian he's a stand-up guy yeah yeah and he does you ever see is this thing with Tucker Carl which was great Tucker Carlson kept saying okay but you're talking about science so tell me how much of an effect do human beings have on climate change and what what is what's the science Chimay and all he wanted to say was that you know are you a consensus settle yeah exactly and like what is what is the difference or it's changing right give me a range like you don't even have to be an exact number but give me a range and then tell me okay what do we have to do in order in your opinion in order to stop the climate change right where it stands or if we can't do that in order to minimize it what's the actual risk also and people keep giving these catastrophic scenarios where it looks like the day after tomorrow and Dennis Quaid running into subways and shit weirder ones he said was that we were supposed to have an ice age now that's not gonna happen like Jesus Christ man that's good yeah you know Randall Carlson has been on my podcast a few times and he's an expert in collisions and asteroid collisions and one of the things he said is like he goes global warming is not great he goes but it's way better than global cooling this is true cooling kills ever there right though the Little Ice Age was not a good thing for the world I mean the global warm period was actually a pretty good thing for the world so I mean this is this is the other thing is that there are costs and benefits to the climate changing which would hit which it has throughout time right what are we willing to sacrifice in order to prevent in order to make that seven degrees into six degrees right and just losing some coastline is not the real issue intervention is far more devastating right I mean losing coasts so I think that if you're gonna worry about that if you're gonna worry about you know the emissions problem worry about the the the sea absorption of emissions right now like the toxification of the oceans like that seems to me to be a bigger problem than the climate changing over time we're pretty adaptable like there's a lot of land okay so we move we have historically right I mean Venice the the sea-level rise in Venice every year people are going to move I mean like that's just that's the way it works I am absolutely there's this weird idea and it's it's true in economics it's true with global warming that where you were born is where you must die hmm right and then you can never move and it's like well this is the most mobile society in human history we were on a plane and be on the other coast in six hours it's it's easier to move than ever before so if we if you really think that the climate is that bad first of all I'd like to ask Barbara Streisand if she's that deeply concerned about global warming why she doesn't sound a coastline of state yeah but is it's like am I gonna lose a lot of sleep of a bunch of Hollywood stars lose you know five feet off their coastline because we didn't kill the industry of the United States and lose four trillion dollars a year like me no and I'm not really sure that that would have worked that way one way or another the it has been absolutely proven that human beings are having an effect on this carbon dioxide levels of course of course yeah there's a greenhouse gas effect sure a hundred percent so modeling's been so wrong that like I want there's no level of certitude and then there's no level of solution that I know for sure is going to do this so you're talking about human being suffering in the now for the later and let's be real about this like yes there are a lot of emissions from the United States but the leading emitter is on the planet right now we're trying in India and they're not gonna stop this Russian anytime soon like that's not gonna happen well there's also this thing that happens where if you even discuss it you become like a Hitler or a Nazi you become a climate change denier and once you get locked into one of those labels you know you you're a piece of shit well this is and yeah nobody wants to be locked into those labels so they don't want to have the discussion of the debate and that's one of the things that I felt like Bill Nye was not prepared for because I felt like he's so lazy with this conversation because so many people just appease him and agree with it yeah I think that's when Tucker Carlson was challenging him on it he didn't have any data to support this argument he just wanted to sort of like play word games and and have this we you know say well you know you guys on CNN there was one time when when they had some guy on who was saying exactly what we were saying that the models did they have not been proven to be accurate and that Al Gore's movie predicted that we'd be underwater in 2014 he didn't it yeah I mean his predictions in that movie or not correct yeah they're not correct at all whoo and he's made like some insane amount of money he's gonna sequel out this week isn't he like the first billion dollar green guy yeah like he's made a shitload of money off of giving these speeches and cap-and-trade and the whole thing is very strange because it becomes this untouchable subject like what we're talking about before with transgender people or with many other subjects become you can't discuss them they're not even open to debate or Chris they they become locked down and when tucker carlson was pressing bill not like what is what are the numbers like what is happening tell me how much of an effect are we having and Bill Nye had nothing on it and became stammered and started getting angry is like wow this is weird yeah this is weird to see I mean if this is the cause of your life you should know a little bit more about it then everyone who disagrees is a denier and I think the way Tucker handled it was brilliant Tucker's best moment I think on a show yeah I think so too because he was saying essentially he was like I'm not denying it I'm not saying aside I just want you to tell me but the effect tell me he'll be hanged and he had nothing it's like so maybe Bill Nyes the wrong guy to have their I shouldn't be selling himself like you can't have me come on a fucking show and talk about plot global warming because I don't know anything right or at the very least Bill Nye should say listen the you know Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did this study right you can look up the numbers there I don't have them off the top of my head or the numbers right how about fucking numbers you're gonna be on one of those shows seven minutes so everybody in the media is lazy nobody nobody actually does their prep for debate or for TV appearances like because the truth is you think you're gonna be on for fight having done a thousand TV heads at this point most people think ok I'm beyond for five minutes I can get through five minutes right I'm gonna be that bad if I'm on for 10 minutes how bad can it be and the answer is you can get pantsed on national TV in five minutes if the person knows what they're doing well you've done that too many people one of the things that I think is do you talk fast always you're born this way everyone my family talks the family just talks from me as I was wondered if this like was a strategy developed to be really good at those shows no no it's it's it's been fortunate that it that it fits that way but yeah even even my kids don't talk this way even the three-year-old to see some people that are just really good at Baba Baba and you you get them in the podcast and after like Peter shifts a great example after like 20 minutes I'm like you want a drink let's have some whiskey I had a couple of glasses of Clank cheers and we settled down and then he settled into like a normal way of talking but he's just so used to like force feeding you fats and pans and it's just it's such an ineffective way to communicate with those three heads and the the one person who is the host throw the megyn kelly throwing a question this person's talking over that person and it's such an ineffective way to communicate yeah I mean it's one of the things that I do like about you know long-form podcast like this one or like mine I just I like the ability to actually expand on a point yeah on TV it's like okay you have 30 seconds of a point excellent we can make that work for us it's the only place left that you can do this unless you're making youtube videos and you know Jordan Peterson is obviously finding out that that's problem yeah but unless you're unless you're doing something along those lines where no one's there but you and you get to expand and express yourself there's no other form of conversation like podcasts where you're not getting interrupted by a commercial you're just talking and you know as well as I know that conversations sort of evolve and move and they you know when I get to know you better I see how you're thinking better and I kind of have more questions to ask and you expand more and you get to know a person for real and that's just those those television shows are so there it's so divisive and honestly it's hard for me to watch a cable television because of that I don't feel like I'm making tons of information that way well CNN had nine fucking people on the other day that's crazy the panel on CNN it's like it's Hollywood Squares no Anderson Cooper standing sitting there in the middle and there's people and then there's people that I do I made a diagonal cool and they're interrupting each other and said excuse me while I talk you mind not interrupting me for a moment like they're they're grandstanding and trying to have this this point they think is gonna be a zinger because they wrote it last night and it's just like oh the best you can hope for is that you have 30 seconds where you say something that goes viral that's basically this that's the extent of it yeah well you've done a lot of those yeah but it's like we were talking about before that a lot of the people that have debated you that are really they're really fucking lazy like like they have this supposed passion for something but when it comes to preparing for this sort of interaction they're not really doing that they're not for sure and I think that you know part of that is there are people who are experts on particular topics who could I'm sure know more about their specialty than I do on a lot of topics like if I were discussed climate change with a person who was like an expert on climate change I would not know as much as that person sure but you know there are a lot of people who think they're generalists and have never read a book right you know I know one fact about one thing and it's that you're a denier you know and I well I mean if I know two then I beat you well that's that so the climate denier thing seems to me one of the laziest things about the left and this is not saying that there's not some sort of a real issue with human waste because I think there is I think it's a jet there's a giant issue with plastic in the ocean there's a giant issue with pollutants in our water system in our air and there's a lot of issues with the side effects of being a person in an industrialized civilization there's we burn things we create poisons and we've got to figure out a way to be sustainable I don't think there's any denying that by anybody I think it's also worth noting the market makes these things better in many cases I mean the fact is that if you look at the the areas where for example everyone is down on carbon-based fuels okay fair enough but if you go to places that don't have carbon-based fuels they're burning animal dung and wood there's nothing worse for a particulate than animal dung and wood so as we get banned if we if we did even better than than this we would get to nuclear power right which unfortunately a lot of people have banned because of on base fears like most of France's electricity is provided by nuclear power and that's about as clean as it gets so you know I do think this how it goes dark well till it goes to Fukushima a even even in worst case scenario at Fukushima I mean if you're talking about the if you're talking about global warming and environmental damage the amount of environmental damage supposedly done by carbon emissions is a lot larger than Fukushima right but the local damage oh yeah it's devastating that's the disturbing thing that they don't have a way to stop that that like they've figured out a way to like put a wall of ice around the containment area and that didn't work it seems so fucking science fictiony they'd really don't know what to do and yeah I don't know enough about nuclear containment to take off on that one better tomorrow let's just say that one disaster in and basically there been three major disaster right renoble Three Mile Island in Fukushima yeah the only one that's happened two of those three have happened in the first world right Fukushima and Three Mile Island Three Mile Island basically ended up having no long-term impact so Fukushima is really the only major disaster in 40 years of industrialized countries using nuclear power well apparently they had some weird meltdowns here at Rocketdyne weren't really discussed yeah tell about it well they're there you know it's it was all during the 60s 50s or the 60s when they're involved in the rocket program but the Rocketdyne stuff my friend's dad is a scientist who's explaining to me the half-life of whatever was released in the atmosphere it's nothing in concern but there's a bunch of rocket times like return Street there was a bunch of articles that were written about it like worrying about people that have higher cancer rates in this area and you know but there's also like I think there's a website called the sins of Rocketdyne really yeah see if you can find that I think there's a website dedicated to that that people but there's a lot of cancer just living in cities man like they say that one of the worst environments for human beings living in a place that has a lot of brake dust like if you're living in Manhattan and you get your window open you're just inhaling particulates from people there it is the sins of rocket time but the thing is like I mean how much more cancer are these people this is from 2000s sometimes the statistics on cancer are hard to correlate right is it because you'll have groupings that are sort of weird and that's just because random statistical grouping yeah so how much of it is due to X Factor or Y factor if we do that then presumably the cancer race would be going down a lot you know they haven't really in most cases so it's pretty rare you have like a lung cancer situation where smoking obviously causes lung cancer most cancers like breast cancer we have no idea why it happens also the valley itself anything that happens in the valley like you when you drive from like Thousand Oaks over the hill and you look down the valley and like Jesus that can't be good yeah I hear you I've been flying into the valley my entire life and every time you fly into the brown gunk soup that is that is the valley atmosphere you think that's not great yeah you mean that is one area where obviously we have gotten better I mean the smog alerts have gone down tremendously in the last 30 years yeah it's gotten a lot better it's gotten a lot better and but that's also one of the things that Donald Trump has relaxed some of the standards the kind of standards wasn't I don't know the mission standards he changed the car emission standards maybe it's again I wonder how much of the car emission standards like there's there's actually thriving debate and libertarian community particularly about whether cave standards are what drove greater fuel efficiency or whether it was the price of gas that drove greater fuel efficiency that as the price of gas has has risen and fallen you see people change their buying habits right in the 90s everybody but an SUV right and then the prices went up and everybody bought a Prius well the Prius thing is interesting too it particularly the Tesla thing because then you look at the environmental disasters of creating these batteries yes and you're like oh this is not totally green yeah like there's some weird gray area too it's pretty complex and and I think that the one thing we know is that there are millions of people all over the world for all of human history who have been living in absolute penury and misery and we now support 7 billion people on the planet and the rate of global poverty has dropped by 50% in the last 30 years a lot of that is technological change a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so before we you know we always have to ban these are two things that are worth thinking about balancing like and this is what's again a little frustrating is that sometimes you see people on the environmental left will say well this has to be done or it's the end of the world and so well how about those people in developing countries how many of those people you're gonna say have to live in poverty in order for this to happen right and then on the right you'll see people say well no environmental regulations at all just let it all hang out and you know sometimes the market hashes it out and sometimes the market doesn't hash it out and so you know I think a little caution is warranted I think that's a very reasonable point of view and that's one of the things that I really like about your commentary I know you're a right-leaning guy but you're very reasonable you you make arguments that are sound and easy to trace it makes sense well thank you I appreciate it I think we need more of that you know and I think that's it's rare that you find that in a 33 year old guy that's some strange sort of conservative character that travels around clowns so the Berkeley thing is gonna happen when is it gonna happen as September 14th is the date it's supposed to happen dude good luck with all that yeah well you know if they cancel will still del you're gonna go on a bulletproof popemobile yeah hey where's bunny Han so do I do yours this a low profile though yeah we keep it on the DL around here let you when you when you do show up at these places and you see the anti-fur people and they're screaming and yelling cheering and that's got to be a surreal thing that it's just you and your thoughts and your opinion I mean you're not selling babies you're not there slaughtering dogs and this win festival exactly it's weird I think that you know I'm not I'm not arrogant quite enough to think that a lot of those people know who I am I think that what happens is that they're sort of a call that goes out from a select few saying this KKK members coming to campus go would go stop him that's what happened to Cal State LA like when I spoke there there were actually a couple professors were telling their students that I was a closeted member of the KKK you might show up wearing a yarmulke I'm their favorite person I think okay I'm like a charter member it's my thing I was literally in his larry's that year I was kid 2016 is a wild year so I was so David Duke accused me of being a far leftist black lives matter accused me of being a member of the KKK and I was the number one recipient of anti-semitism from the according to the anti-defamation league I was the number one recipient of Twitter anti-semitism in the United States for journalists last year's little trophy at my house green frog it is it's a green frog and then a little model of the gas chambers murder number one yeah by a huge margin by the way hello out it was like 40% of all anti-semitic tweets on the Internet directed a journalist in 2016 were directed to me personally holy shit it was a good year has a good year you know some years are more productive than others what did that feel like well I mean it felt like my Twitter feed was just out a dumpster fire did anybody I get somebody get people emailing me please don't retreat me because I really thought they'd just be hit by waves of these people that's died off yes since the election it's really gone down a fair bit but you know there were some pretty serious you know death threats like I got people calling my cell phone up my security I had it I already had a shotgun but yeah well what what started at all probably me quitting Breitbart so so when I was you know I was not I was not a trump supporter I didn't vote for either candidate in this year's watching or support in the primaries Chris yeah Cruz I support him his positions he was the closest to me politically um so you know I was not pro Trump during the primaries he didn't earn my vote during the general action I thought like there's two ways to look at your vote and this is what I always said to people I said vote for who you want to but for me there's two ways to look at your vote it's a coupon that expires November 9th right and so either user you lose it or it's just it says something about what you are willing to accept and it's possible that there can be election where both candidates suck and you just don't want either of them so what did you do during the election I voted down ticket I skipped the top of the ticket so which it first time I've ever done that so I didn't think either of these people was qualified to be President of the United States once Trump was elected then it was like okay if he does good stuff I'll praise him if he does bad stuff well I'll hit him as I would any other presidents mhm so I've been sort of you know calling balls and strikes with him and some of the stuff like Gorsuch I love and some of the stuff like Mika Brzezinski bloody face I'm not so hot on so it's but yeah so the I think what led off was it was a combination of three things one I'm Jewish too and obviously so too I was working up right Bart and then I quit in the middle of the election cycle after there was that whole remember the Michelle fields incident where a Corey Lewandowski grabs a reporter from ripe are they gone after bruiser and then right did he actually bruiser a bruiser I mean like she took picture she reported to the cops it was you know unless unless you believe she bruised herself it didn't look much like a I mean when I watch the videos like it looked like he just kind of grabbed her arm it looked like he her body didn't like move like she was being injured yeah I mean she let's put it this way she that was her account I was also the accounts of Ben Terrace at the Washington Post right was that she was grabbed hard enough to bruise and then she had bruises you know what let me as a fight commentator there's a lot of things that I see live that look a lot worse than when you watch them on video mm-hm you know when people get knocked out like that wasn't much of a punch like oh you had to be there yeah I mean the most the example that comes to mind is the alley Liston punch right number two yeah might of mine is that that she there were three there are a bunch of different excuses that Breitbart won through on that one one was that she was never grabbed at all the second was it was a Secret Service guy and then the third was that that from thought she was a security threat and Corey Lewandowski had to protect Trump from this 90 pounds soaking wet you know girl and so once Breitbart did that then the real question for me was not you know what a horrible thing had happened to her it was much more about as a journalistic entity do you stand by Europe or do you stand by the candidate who you support and once Breitbart made clear to me that it like I already knew they supported Trump that was in a great shock but I was kind of their token non-trump guy and once it became clear that they were willing to sort of sacrifice journalistic credibility on the altar of getting close to Trump then I was out then it's no longer journalistic outlets I quit and and that sort of started the ball rolling so I really didn't get anti-semitic responses on Twitter before that and not too much not too much so I won't see the Breitbart directed dynamics I don't think they did but I think that there are a lot of people who follow Breitbart and you know my low-key innopolis and they're pissed at me and they'd see me as like an ally and now they saw me as an enemy and this kind of thing so and you know it's a war for them right oh yeah I mean people enjoyed it obviously that's a weird thing about the online hate is how much people enjoy it what's anonymous you never get me never get tagged for it for now it's not us for now for now I mean I've said this to a bunch of college students about you know the alt-right the first of all I think it's important didn't mention a lot of people who say they're alright aren't actually alright just cuz you like a meme doesn't make you alright but like there's a group of people who actually like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor and the race-based identity politics of white supremacy and those people are actually alright when the alt-right is is coming after you then it's not a lot of fun but there there are a lot of there are a lot of young students who will retweet things from like things that are obviously nasty and gonna hurt them in their future career yeah right where they'll build like be joking around on Facebook and using the n-word and I'll say to them like guys you may think it's funny and ten years from now your employer's gonna find that and you're gonna be toast and there are a lot of people who sort of fall into this idea that what you do online is anonymous and it is not it is not going to remain enough it's just a matter of time for it blows yeah I mean any anonymity in ten years I agree I think that we're moving in that direction and this is actually a thing that bothers me in general like did you follow the entry to the Donald sterling saga yeah sure so it really bothered me yeah I mean did everybody was willing to like take Donald Sterling's team away from him because he said something shitty to his girlfriend right about Magic Johnson when there's no evidence that there's actual discrimination among clients at the Clippers only right again if there are actual evidence of discrimination then sure boycott his team and do what the MBA has to do but like I'm pretty certain that every human being says crappy things to their intimate loved ones about groups of people and other people it was the standard then I think that we're all toast oh for sure in his defense of it was like very reasonable she's trying to get laid he's like I was just I was just saying it was like he thought he was alone he thought he was with her and no one was recording him and she was trying to say that she had recorded all of their conversations that it was a part of her job he's like a senile old guy and he's obviously not with Vee stiviano because she's a Nobel Prize winning physicist I mean like this is it like he bought her a condo and a Bentley and a Ferrari and she's a fucker his interview his interview with Anderson Cooper was one of the classic interviews of all time I ever saw oh my goodness that the moment where he says because there's a moment where he turns to Anderson Cooper says Anderson have you ever fallen in love with a woman in Anderson Cooper who is you know super gay yeah everything goes he starts laughing goes no I've never had that experience well I understand when you do fall in love with a woman and he just get he's so unaware it it's like I'm sorry like I can't consider this guy like he's a KKK threatening figure like the guy can't even like find the toilet in the mornings he's like stumbling over his ottoman like I had I did about him defending him I was like because if you look at what he actually said everyone's like he's a race is a terrible person he said do me if it was I don't he goes don't take pictures of black guys he goes in the next sentence he said I don't care if you fuck them just don't take pictures of them I go in my world that's pretty reasonable like you gotta go you can fuck him she should just like leave well enough alone you're getting a Ferrari out of the deal no I think that was that whole thing was just like it was it was our capacity to get ourselves to outraged so we could show everybody how outraged we work well the president of the NBA whatever the fuck his name is what is Adam silver the guy that got on TV was talking about Italy was the most horrific thing that's ever been said to Jim Crow at clipper at the Staples Center he should have gotten on TV and said look this is obviously we know what this was this is a gold digger and an old man it's a story as old as time he said some stupid shit old people say stupid shit he's an old guy here's the thing don't take his advice when it comes to race and and he probably should have said look but on the bright side he told that she can go fuck black guy so hey everybody's like self-righteous bullshit and well I mean oh a lot of that again is I think that if you look at the NBA statistics and who watches the NBA the the out sighs number of people who watch the NBA are black and this has amount of time watching it and so you know Donald sterling pissed off a lot of black folks with that understandably and so a lot of people were like I think the NBA is like we're not gonna lose our fan base over there was a money decision in other words I don't think it was a values decision as much as money well I agree with you 100% but I don't think they had to make that decision that way I think they could they could have divested him and put him like put his kids or his wife in charge of the team like this idea that you're gonna force him to sell his team it's crazy disband the Clippers because there was a tape of an old man saying stupid ass things to a gold-digger is its to anyway and he wound up making more money from that team that he ever would have so much jillion dollars yeah it became much more valuable the whole thing is bizarre yeah um that's it dude we just hit three hours well that's crazy I appreciate clue bye that's great well listen people been asking for a long time for you to come on so I'm glad we finally got together and yeah me do it thanks for having me my pleasure let's do it again sounds good thank you
