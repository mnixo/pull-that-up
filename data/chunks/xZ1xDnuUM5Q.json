going into the rabbit hole today there's gonna be an interesting one there's gonna be a weird one we have here former aspiring tennis star is that true really you were aspiring tennis star was expiring tennis star yeah this is a man who eventually went on to become probably the most famous drug dealer in the history of Los Angeles I would say that's as accurate as you can get yeah yeah you're the most mean you're not the United States yeah if not you know it's not that biggest it's right up there the most famous but the most famous yeah you got a dude stole your fucking name no no no like three people stole my name for sure three people three people three rappers or three different drug dealers rappers uh let me see we know the god whose party the most famous out all of them is william roberts who goes by rick ross he's the rapper that is a former corrections officer correctional officer how hilarious is that and they say he's the best gangster rapper ever better than Park and Biggie that's nonsense and then we got my man who I'm cool with you know and I don't mind him using parts of my name is freeway out of Philly and we also have a it was a freeway rich out of Kansas City that did pretty good in the Midwest there are also some guys right now out of Ohio who go by the name of the freeway boys well that's four different groups that have taken my name in my you know parts of my persona and used it but one of them got very famous though very famous right now yeah that's fascinating and you know what's really weird it's kind of weird to you know that I'm Shorty's name and identity and claiming as your own in their background what's hilarious I'm gonna I'm gonna send Brian a link of where he talked about it he had he'd come on this dudes show and the guy asked him about it and his his reasoning response was so stupid is it's amazing the guy as successful as as successful as he is because he was like you know no that happened like ten years ago I got that nickname I wasn't even about that like the fucking answer is that she doesn't even meet when you know you know that the dude exists you know I know okay I'm a white stand-up comedian I know who Freeway Ricky Ross is you don't know and you're a fucking corrections officer who became a rapper and you're in that world and you don't know who Rick Ross is and you just happen to have his fucking name well you know the guy the guy one thing I got to get a guy is he's powerful he didn't put some moves together now yeah that he's getting courts and everybody to do what he wants him to do so whatever he's doing he's damn good at it I mean you know to have the judge to rule in his favorite other day was like really really ironic to me I could not believe that somebody could say that if somebody steals something from you no matter how long it is that it takes you before you catch them and can bring them to the jurisdictions of attention how could they say that the statute of limitations it ran out that was just so crazy to me how do you have a statute of limitations on your name and that's what I was saying I mean if somebody steals something from you I mean it takes you ten years to catch them within you catch them with it it has all the makings honor that is yours how could you not be made to give it back what I'm saying you said all we had is ten years old now it's he is well what's really crazy is that it's in the moat I mean wrap the world of wrap is supposed to be the most legitimate world ever like you can't get caught with any bullshit you can't get caught faking anything you could call faking anything people will turn on you you know he like that we used to be like that have you been at lirik yeah if it's somebody's run when they work and you are done yeah you know remember Nellie Benelli I mean those guys and ask Billy Vanilli belinelli yeah yeah well those guys were really rappers though you know but I mean it was like a time of genuine real yes and now I think that the time has changed so much and it's not about real anymore it's about faking it you know well it's once someone gets popular enough that they bypass the underground hardcore fans and they make it into the mainstream and then they become a part of pop culture like this every durham o saloon that just got into the mainstream culture because the the words in between that they're not good no it's not he's not a good rapper it's that everyday I'm hustling it's just so good you know when you hear that in a club you like damn that's good you know it's just such a good hook that that made them I mean that's where it all took off on exactly and it you know when you have Universal behind you pushing yeah you know they start pushing stuff down our kids throat you know and next thing you know they're taking it that's fascinating so he's got your name now so now it's legal that he's got your name well I wouldn't use his own fucking name what Rick Ross is it just a name you know what I mean it's not like star child beyond the grave you know I mean you don't have like some crazy fucking name you don't I mean when it's with his name his real name William Roberts what's what's wrong with Bill Roberts I don't know I don't feel Robert elders I'm ready to wrap it Rick Ross I mean if you're awesome cigar sells your real estate you can be like one of those those billboards that they have on the bus stops you know Rick Ross amazing I love your face if my mom woulda named me William Roberts my name would be William Robert yeah yeah you'd be fruit free ray well Robert exactly what's wrong with that well you know hey man we can't hear you in the background there's no microphone even even that uh uh everyday I'm hustling is something that I used to say he got that out of a book that Gary read world called Dark Alliance and you know I was telling Gary I'm hustling every day so he took that and turned into a song so I mean you know I don't know what it is with this guy you know he tattoo my name on his hand hahaha that's so strange you know that's so strange a little weird you and he used to be a corrections officer which is really fucked up because to become a corrections officer they got to do a background check on you oh man they make sure you're not a felon we get clean yeah you can't you can't be this gangster dude and be a fuckin guy who is a corrections officer we should get his application and read what it says when it takes to be a correctional officer all uh criteria yeah how about the pictures of him with the alpha dog you see I saw it's ridiculous I started with the smooth face what's really fucked up is there's a video of him an old video of him and you're on the video you're on the beginning of it and then he comes out like he knew who the fuck you were he put you in his video right yeah but he said he didn't know who I was I know the - how do you not bring that video in and just stick that on his face there should be case closed what a judge didn't want to see that whoa so this is judges getting bribed must be I mean you know has to be it looks funny to me how can he actually edit it that has to be bribery a hundred percent that that judge should be in jail there's no there's no doubt about it that's your fucking name man that's your fucking name I mean and and let this guy come in court and say that he never heard he ever heard of me you know that's hilarious and how he had been at the name you know it was like wow you know he gave us some an average story - well hell he invented what I heard him on this video was so stupid it was like not a name came brother like 10 years ago like what does that mean was it was like a non answer to the question and it was just and then he tried to like be past it the question just talk about our people just like to talk a lot of shit and start a lot of shit like what he likes a bolo you like the bolo people yeah when you come in and you know like either you're gonna do the interview - you ain't gonna do the interview I ain't gonna talk about this you know I'm gonna talk about what I want to talk about oh I see so he doesn't just come in and just have a conversation with you he comes in like with a specific set of rules exactly I think most of his interviews are rehearsed and written down you know the way I mean the way they seem like to me you know I mean everything about this guy you know is suspect you know when I was in jail somebody wrote me a letter and said hey his beard it's fake what could you imagine you catch this chick Tomi's little black cotton balls on his face yet is to grow me and said always beard is fake to me you know there's just so much stuff you know you hearing people you know shooting your messages and in all kind of stuff like that dear man matter of fact a couple weeks ago I get a call and it was a guy that was in jail while he was a correctional officer you should hear the story she hid a story this guy had to say what they have to say what is a oh man he said this guy was one of the worst CEOs that you could be you know he was one that since he already doesn't have power he has to go to his boss and tell his boss on you so he said this guy was running around the cells sneaking trying to hear what they talking about and if they shoot and I see he'd run up and tell his boss anytime they're shooting dice boss let's go really yeah yeah yeah that's the kind of guy that using for and then like when they do raids you know when they raise your sale he would be the first one they push in you know the big the big fat guy you know because everybody be kind of scattered a big fat guy so they would all get behind me and shove him up in the seal so all this big blob of meat is so he was there battering ram yeah oh that's hilarious wow that's it's so fucked up that that guy got legitimate that all of a sudden he's a legit rap star man it's fascinating it's fascinating how that's not by you know well you know our people just let him slide him on in the honest you know and then slowly and slowly uh he was accepted you know it seems like that can't last it seems like you know rappers have a short shelf life anyway a lot of I mean there's dudes like jay-z and Nas that will just stick around just because they're so talented you can't stop them but a lot of rappers they they come for a little while and I kind of think this is this is gonna take wind out of a sail eventually well I don't know you know when those people put new labels put that money behind you and you become a money cow you know they have a sense of just shoving you down everybody's throat you know keeping you on the radio right and anything people hear on the radio you know they believe it but once they can get money out of you they know they keep getting money out of you so they just use you as a cow you just use you as a cow so they keep milking you and keep milking you and and it's gonna be up to the people to say you know what we don't care how many times you shove this guy on our face we're not buying ya know we know he's a correctional officer we know he never sold drugs you know he's a fake and we know he saw he stole Rick Ross's name he's got your name tattooed on his body and we wanted to give it back you're saying that's what the streets need to tell him you know give Rick back his fucking man yeah give him back his fucking name bitch if it makes you feel any better he was on a TV show and he left his hat there and our friend Tom Segura stole his hat he wears it every every day Tommy oh that's hilarious that's beautiful yeah tommy was excited though I'm gonna talk to you he's a stand-up comedian good friend of mine now your story is you were aspiring tennis star and then you went on to make someone in the neighborhood roughly of like six hundred million dollars from selling crack in Los Angeles yeah in like two years I did that that was my last two years I don't know god before that I made a lot of money for those two years what's really crazy is that this all has a connection not just to Los Angeles but to Ronald Reagan and Oliver North and the Contras in Nicaragua this is what a lot of people don't know there's crazy conspiracy theories of people always talking about oh man the CIA sells drugs and and then you know Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone we never landed on the moon and when you talk about conspiracies people go what the fuck are you talking about you crazy asshole you really did the CIA so drugs well the fucking yeah they did not only did they sell drugs Michael Rupert exposed it when the CIA director tried to come to watts and have this big meaning to try to prove I remember that yeah I saw a Rupert's a bad motherfucker on Nightline uh no I mean even in the own investigation though - CIA admitted that they knew about it that their operatives of selling drugs now Ian Reed was to fund the Contras because the Congress had cut off funding absolutely so they needed money to fund the Contras war against the Sandinistas who were backed by the Russians right and this was during the Cold War and they were supposedly worried that the Russians were going to take over Nicaragua as of the there was a well yeah that was what they feared you know I read a couple books on it after after I found out at the story broke I want to know more about what I was involved in and what they feared is that the Sandinistas to Killeen Russia Afghanistan aneesa's like 100 million dollars and Congress had cut off all monies to the Contras so they had to figure out a way to raise this money to defeat this army that had 100 million dollars you know back then I guess one hundred million dollars probably would be equivalent to a billion dollars right now today so they were looking for ways to to raise this money so what they decided to do was sell weapons to Iran convert that money back to Nicaragua to these guys and these guys could take that money and going buy drugs that way wouldn't leave a paper trail back to the US and that's basically what they did and that's what got exposed with the the Oliver North trial and that's when Ronald Reagan had to get on TV and said he couldn't remember yeah you couldn't remember whether or not they sold arms to people who hate us and then you know - in the Kerry investigations they told him to stop right at the drugs when they started to go into the part about the trafficking in the cocaine they had it's not the hearings why did they have the hearing stopped right then I don't know that's - too inflammatory yeah actually I guess so addict I guess so my documentary is going to explore that my producing director for my documentary was sitting there in the Senate hearings so he's bringing all those tapes and they we're going to talk to better get to come out it's not come in he should be out in like November of next year we hope now did you find out about this connection between the Contras the Senate niece and all this while you were in jail yes I was in jail was in 96 so you had no idea about the CIA connection no I didn't care man I was just trying to make money you know I was a kid in South Central and and I was illiterate I couldn't really couldn't write and I found out that you know my - his career was basically over because I couldn't go to college there's no way I was going to college where were you playing tennis you like tournaments and stuff yeah I played tournament Southern California tournaments you know when you play those tournaments you don't have to turn in your report card you know you just go out and play they don't ask you that I also played high school tennis and I had dreams of going to college and playing college tennis and all that was derailed you know when it was discovered that I couldn't read or write Wow so how did you get through schools you couldn't read or write they just passed you yeah man you know teachers they don't really care about if you get in your education or not and for sure at that time and by me been a good student I guess they just kind of like felt they were doing me a favor by just let me get through but being a good student how can you be a good student if you can't read or write why didn't cause them any problems I see what you say some so you were just dealing with a wild bunch of kids and you were a nice guy right sitting my seat you know probably go to sleep in class most of the time you know Wow you know don't cause a teacher no problems you know if it was time for me to read I would uh go to principal office get my squats for being bad in class that day and you know the next day I come back and go back to sleep Wow this isn't amazing that the standards are so low that all you have to do to be a good student is not be crazy and a problem exactly you don't have to participate at all that's amazing and I never really participated in class you know none that I can remember well I've always said the number one problem with this country for sure is that we don't care about other people's kids we don't care about how other people's kids are growing up we don't care if it's not your kid that's that's a litter if not it's not your kid is growing up without a father it's not your kids growing up in poverty doesn't know in our next meal you don't give a fuck but meanwhile you give a fuck about what's happening in another part of the world you know freedom in Afghanistan all this nutty shit that went on in Iraq our real war is with our own people that we have to live with our own national community and our national community has six spots and these six spots are the ghettos and it's real simple if you're you get an unlucky roll the dice and you're born in that six spot well guess what you're fucked you're fucked you got to figure out a way out of that somehow or another but the odds are long against you long against you and that's a real travesty it is we as human beings concentrate on some shit that's going on in another part of the world that's not even connected to us and we don't concentrate on people that we're going to fucking come in contact with in spinning bill yeah spending more than that trillions and we're not concentrating on the people that we're really going to come in contact with the people that are going to grow up and be a problem with everybody they interact with because their life is fucked from the get-go and be a problem for your kids yeah unison just imagine you know in a few years your kid is walking down the street and he run into one of these kids the exact that didn't get it you know and you get robbed there your situation is so crazy it's so hard to wrap your head around you know that you you were involved you were like a part of this gigantic machine and you didn't even know about it no you just weren't you just were trying to sell crack they gave me away some money they gave me a way out you know you look at how did it start how do I start selling yeah oh man I was sitting on my porch one day and I was so broke in one of my big homies called me he said man I got the new thing I said honey he said man come over here right now so I jumped in my car I told 66 Chevrolet I threw a dollar worth of gas and then I drove to his house it might be my last dollar right Wow like what my last dollar to take I'm through now so when I get to his house he uh he made it out you know it was cocaine you know he was like man it's a new thing and I saw the movie Superfly and I'm like wow Superfly hahaha that's me you're not always wanted when I saw Superfly man I just love that movie you know when that's hilarious now which are watching now it's kind of hilarious yeah yeah I might have to do that you know when I when I when I finally bought my first VCR used to wear the dress the way they talk yeah he goes my haul my vines he was just all I ever wanted in life my haul my vines a white woman like you you know my haul like that's a tease they call that car my vines was his clothes you know it's like the nicknames were hilarious the ones that didn't stick I haven't watched that since like 82 or some man wow-whee when I bought my first VCR I mean that was the first one yeah I do it right up in here whoo Wow okay so so you you go over your friend's house he's got it all then this is crack or this is not just cocaine or crack it's powder right but he's cooking in Iraq at that time now who taught everybody to cook it how the fuck did that come about because that to me is a massive mystery that someone figured out how to take cocaine and turn it into a more addictive it was already guys cooking it when I started right but it was only a few of them but his freebase is different than crack right yeah freebase like Richard Pryor had a free baby brother but it's still the same product they were cooked but they were just taking coke and cooking it how are they doing it a you cooked it with ether Oh which was a much more difficult process but it's still the same product technically the only difference is that with freebase I mean with with what they call crackles we didn't call it crack we called it ready Rock ready Rock yeah we called it ready Rock the difference is with ready Rock as you use baking soda now what I did is in my neighborhood there's three guys that could cook it these guys were very expensive very very expensive to cook it so what I did is once I learn how to cook it from these guys because I kept watching them do it over and over and over again and they keep charging me to cook 3 grams they might charge you $175 so I'll keep paying was it how is 3 to 3 grams cost us like what is it when I sell in 3 grams bagged in 3 grams would have been about 900 dollars so out of 900 I was paying 175 bucks that's pretty pricey it was it was pricey but what they did it took him 10 minutes 15 minutes yeah being you think getting the coke is the hard part yeah really hard but then you got to cook it up so you know that was another part but once I learned how to do it when I did is I just started showing all my little friends how to do it you know so that became like a job for them they could just cook and make you know what other guys were charging 175 I could charge 125 and and and you know and just saw the market but it's weird that coke is expensive but crack is not not true that's a misconception is a misconception big misconception crack is expensive there is no crack without coke right so if you took a Kea coke and you cooked it in the crack the price don't drop so what is the benefit we rolling it up the price goes up you make more money you need less to get highs that what it is no no no it it don't really have anything to do with the high see if you spend 40,000 for a key or powder you still got to get at least 40,000 for the key or cooked right but people think that is cheaper there's some misconception that they have put in people mind that that rock is cheaper no no no no no it's still the same key of cocaine you still have to get your money back out of it if you spend 40,000 you still got to sell that rock for 40,000 so what is the benefit of turning into rock done they can smoke it yeah is that better it's a better high they say then bend in smoking powder is it do you need less of it to get high that way is that so so there's no benefit financially going the way of crack or post a coke if you're no you're fucked if you take powder and put on your bike it's going to burn different so it turns a pipe all black and gooey but rock it took all the impurities out of the coke so now you just smoking pure cocaine and and they like that better and that's what the baking soda that's what the baking soda comes with the baking soda did and that holds the impurities out so much right it cooked all the impurities out of it and turn it into a jail now you you meet this guy you go over his house he's got the coke and you know you decide all right this is it this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna be Superfly now it is it let's did a light bulb go off in your head not in believing man really he showed me something was about the size of a when there was little match his and told me it was worth $50 that's my boy too though you know it's my boy right if it have been somebody else I never would I wouldn't even touch it but this was my boy telling me this right man that's worth $50 I'm like wow come on Mike stop it $50 man the police would never catch me with that you're right I'm talking on something so small right you could barely see it you know I could put in my fingernails right and he telling me that's worth fifty thousand and I just spent my last dollar on gas and now you telling me that this little thing is worth fifty so I can make my money back what's $40 and he gave it to me here take it and go wow so you know I go and I'm going around trying to figure out was it really coke you know so I'm going everybody in accident accident nobody really knew what it was what year was this 79 in the 79 beginning 80 now in the 80s for people who don't know I I was living in Boston at the time and I remember when crack hit and it was it was like a wave a crime just took over it was weird it was like a real noticeable increase in crime once crack had become a part of the culture well you know what when people start smoking cocaine they don't do whatever they can to keep that eye going you know big steel bar oh you know I mean it was something about it where they said was so joyful that you never wanted to stop Wow some some guys just said it was the best sensation that they never had yeah you never fucked with it I tried it about one week maybe we can have for a whole week damn was this will in the bid that went way in the beginning in the beginning I caught myself early you know I went through a phase where you know we thought we had came upon some money and then you know I thought I was rich I had about ten thousand and then all my friends liked me come on let's smoke some weed Wow and I'm the good thing though I never smoked weed before in my life that's a good thing it was at that time yeah so that that probably what helped save me from becoming an addict so that you are used to smoke good things right I wasn't used to smoking I was a tennis player right right right you were healthy I was healthy so when I started smoking you know started putting lacing it in the weed and smoking it in I looked up my money was like wow man you you had ten thousand you down to like 500 now Wow yeah that quick that quick it was going to stop that's all right no no I just quit us him in this ain't what you went into the game for but was it difficult physically did you have withdrawal no wimps are awesome huh no but you have a strong mind you probably pulled yourself out in a week you know yeah well I think that's all it takes I I did I did it for about a week I never felt the addiction like I did the baking soda thing where how often did you do it I for that week I probably did it twice three times two times a day no no no I mean reach out to movements for the whole week oh but I mean I was also doing a lot of cocaine at that point and and I never got I never like it's not is it a some people get addicted some people don't is it well you know you got it you got to pull yourself and you got to find a reason why you want to quit right see some people you know like I got uncle he's been getting high since the day I started you know what he tell me what Oh quit Wow one more quick four we had a friend who was a comedian who was a heroin addict who wound up dying Mitch Hedberg very funny guy really really funny dude and they try to stop him a few times it's like bitch I ain't stopping shit those attitudes I know but this is me with like this I mean a person should be allowed to do whatever it is with their life yeah as long as they don't hurt anybody else infringe on your rights that they want to do I agree Harborside now you're you're sitting there you're how old were you when this happened when I started 1920 1920 so you 1920 you get started in it and then how do you go about going from that to everything branching out to you being the biggest most famous guy it was it was I guess you would say like a evolution you know learning process you know the first time I learned that first piece of cocaine I got I got beat out of it another one of my big homies beat me out of it you know told me that let him test it let him smoke in and you know wasn't big as a match hit so he cut it in half and he smoked a piece of it and he was like home that's what they used to do you know when they smoke it smack their lips in it tastes like meat I need another piece though to make sure it's good you don't want to go out there selling nothing right and shift it again and the whole thing was gone it was a little teeny-weeny piece left he's like man I'm gonna go and smoke that too and I just pay you Friday ah hey you Fridays never happened never has a hamburger - never it net I never got that 50 never you probably never will those those I'll pay you Friday guys than ever they don't so that was my business in a cocaine business right away you went okay I got to be a little more prudent with my fucking my resources here and starting and ending right there right I felt like my career was over how was I gonna go back to Mike and tell him I'm an I'm gonna tell my man man I ain't got the $50 man Wow I want to be up but I don't have a 50 but what happened is is that guy who beat me out 250 and he taught me another lesson he come right back that day with somebody than $100 seems like with with with with people who use if they owe you then they'll come whenever bring somebody else with him say ah man this ain't my money it's his money ah that's hilarious so he came back with somebody wounded $100 worth and I called my man I said man I ain't got your 50 but uh somebody else want a violin a knowledgeable if you want it and he shot over there serving that and next thing you know this guy who beat me out 250 kept bringing person after person after person and next thing I know I'm making two hundred dollars a day three hundred dollars a day but now I'm giving all the money to my man and uh you know one day I was just like man I'm going to business for myself so how did you get a distributor which started just like that I started off just getting it from him and then uh I've been uh talking about going to Venice skill center to do upholstery and mend this uh teacher there they taught the class had become really really good friends we played tennis together and uh I just stopped going around him because I spent all my time selling coke and one day I go down you know just the same because this was my man and I hadn't seen him and I said man uh how're you doing he's like lamb will you be in mana I was like man hey you don't wanna know where I've been right so uh I went on and told him I was like man I've been I've been selling coke you know what I'm doing now he's like what alright so he had a whole different attitude than I thought he was gonna have but you know he was flying you know I said like his little jewelry and he but he drove Brandon cab back and all that right they said man come by the house so I go by the house man and he lay it all out he's like man you think I got this house this Cadillac clothes like this heeled a teacher salary no way he said man I tried with the world he's hard to sell coke but I just backed up for a while whoa so it's hard to do that right had to Nicaraguan connection yeah you got to be really really strong to back up without going to prison I'm getting kill it's very few people do right feel if you do I I don't know I don't know not one person to just quit on their own I don't think we're not going to prison wow that's amazing so so this guy gets you the Nicaraguan connection yeah he called his guy up man and uh his guy was like I'm from Nicaragua you know spoke broken English and gave me some prices man and it was like all love I was like man I'm gonna be rich Wow so um are you familiar with how they got it into the country or at the time did you know how they were getting into the country no I didn't kid I was meet him when that big you know you're 20 I'm 20 years old never had nothing right you know I hadn't had but I had never had $1,000 before I started selling coke I don't know if I had ever had $500 you know I'm sitting right right so I'm just thankful that I'm in this position I ain't asking no questions you know I'm saying I'm like super flight only has no questions and long as the man that you be the man leaving it long you know and that's the way I was that was the attitude I had I was just just going along with the process wow that's uh that's got to be a crazy position to be in man - all of a sudden it starts taking off and you see it and then you're just rolling in this money I mean it really is like a movie right did it feel like a movie to you like all of a sudden you go from being broke to just ball it was like a dream you know you feeling like you know finally God had recognized you you know all this though all this time you've been ignored by God and now all of a sudden you know all the things that you'd prayed for and hope would happen in your life had just taken place wow that's a crazy way to put that what God have recognized you that's how I felt you know honest you know I felt that that it was a blessing from God that uh and I've been put in that position and now you know my family wouldn't have no more hungry nights and we wouldn't be what about the lights getting cut off the gas and you know those roaches and rats when they gonna be running through the house no more because I was gonna get some some rat traps rat traps or get rid of them you know and we're gonna patch them hos up in the cabinets and you know all the things that I regret it when I was a kid you know standing in line with food stamps all that was over with did you learn how to read at this time I don't know how to read I went to prison wow that's amazing that's amazing I was forcing on how to read what did you do with the money like how'd you bank when I had big safes I had safes I didn't oh they come out the Queen Mary wait twenty five hundred pounds one time they stole my safe on my house I said never do that again you know this do put me up on these safes that it took like a little train tractor rang through and wow they wasn't moving that zouk be a professional safe mover to moving them about your house when they stole the safe at your house how much was in the safe and I think I think one time you got like maybe a hundred and eighty thousand hundred sixty thousand Wow in cash in a safe and you just weren't home or something they knew when you were leaving yeah yeah yeah they knew you know probably was an inside job of course you know you know how that go one here family members open the door anatomy and that crazy that's crazy to think about isn't it yeah yeah so then you got a big giant safe and he kept it on and say you mean you had to be locked down at all times if you have that kind of cash around you're not you dealing with banks at all like oh no no no I didn't go to no Bank what my mom used to take Clyde a couple of properties in my name and someone when I'm actually let her go and collect all the rents my section eight checks and soon as you should just throw them in the bank cuz I pay the mortgages and stuff out my dope money in the the banker used to say tell your son to come in and sniggers he's doing it he's doing pretty good in real estate Wow that's hilarious so did you come up with a bunch of businesses to sort of mask your money yeah I had a coin I had I had a custom time wheel shop car wash shoe store beauty salon junkyard motel bought a whole theater and I had apartment buildings all over the place I so build apartment buildings that was like one of my hobbies did you have to show how you got the money to buy any of these businesses or started in these businesses I figured out how to launder you know people taught me how to line money right how you go to the bank and you get the cashier's checks and you know so so we figured you know we figured it out how to get around it now all this time you couldn't read no that's amazing but so when you went into the banks and fill out the paperwork how did you do that well I would just have somebody else to do it for me you know like if I'm buying a piece of property the real estate agent would do most of the work now I've had times where they told me one man and one what it was you know so those are the chances that you take when you can't read right Wow like one time I had a building that I bought and they told me that the note was gonna be 3,000 a month in the note turn out to be sixty two hundred a month so it cost me like thirty two hundred month because I couldn't read the contract well so I mean it's costly when you don't know how to read that's incredible that you accomplished so much without learning how to read that's that's amazing well you know what I felt is that I had developed a sense of people you know I could feel good people and bad people just just just sensing them whoo-hoo to deal with who not to deal with and you know you make some mistakes but you know overall I think that uh you know I did all right with them some of them as long as you were making them money everybody was making money everybody was happy yeah yeah you know I paid for Anita Baker's first album - Wow seriously Wow awesome yeah finance Beverly Graham music oldest Smith who was the owner of the label rest in peace he should take care of me when I play tennis you don't buy me tennis shoes and racquets and so when I came up I ran into him one day and he wasn't doing all that well so you know return the favor oh wow that's beautiful he got here tenfold you know yeah I said you get a tempo he still bought me a tennis shoes and ragas I get him six hundred thousand Wow so you know sometimes you do a good deed they come back to you might be you know took took a week ten fifteen years but so how did it all come apart man it was coming apart from the beginning right away was just crazy yeah well why not happening you know they created this task force called a freeway task force yeah that was these group of officers just to go after you yes you were Freeway Ricky Ross yeah yeah they said that my name was ringing so much downtown the City Hall had a special meeting Wow they say who is this guy in south central making all this money that everybody inside cuz what I found out is when I finally got arrested is that not the people wasn't really telling on me right to get me in trouble that was bragging about me yeah homeboy Rick he millionaire he got this he got that he'd run the whole hood you know so it this is creating a stereo downtown and they like who is this guy why is everybody talking about me and what I found out these guys are in jail talking about me too you know like they sitting in holding tanks and and they having conversations about freeway Rick and so the guards are hearing this and they go and report it and so now everybody wants to know who is this guy imagine if it was Rick Ross the fake Rick Ross I'm about the real Rick Ross and when a reporter you imagine we find that shit out hey and you imagine I mean that's a goddamn connection right there we might have fucking found the magic bullet that's hilarious so they hear about you to legend you just you just become now you aware of how famous you are just now I'm in a shell haha see my guys know the name you can't talk about me right didn't you talk about meeting your girls and nobody right I tell them what none of my business right right Dana and I business they only didn't know I've been this but it wind up getting past the line you know you got that line but it jumped over that line and everybody Lou yeah became public you had no idea I had no idea was public you thought you were just like like a cat hunting the couch and you think you're hidden but your tails poking out yeah they think you get serious here yeah yeah you are mine so and that's what I was living under I was living an illusion that that nobody knew who I was because I didn't drive a fancy cars you know I could walk in the restaurant nobody would spot me right right right they wouldn't be pointing oh they're gonna wreck over there so you kept it low key you stayed in the same house uh you know I had houses all over a bunch of houses bunch of houses but they wasn't you know I MIDI level didn't get you getting matches nothing crazy right Pasadena Estates with the giant lawns and fountains and shit know that right yeah you not nothing like that it's not worth what else I found out though is that see my guys have become so big in their own right is it they mentioned your name one time to the other the workers and the network was running out old man - homie Rick took care of us and these guys words was so powerful that they would only have to mention you one time you know they like I guess you would call them almost like evangelist and that you keep having these type of guys mention your name then the next thing you know your name is everything this is all what you surmised once you got into prison and really sat down with all the time in the world to analyze yeah what was going on how long did it last how many years did you sell for eight years eight years so you're 28 when you got arrested yeah Wow that's crazy so you would live long career for acting that's huge yeah yeah most of my friends who started you know and got big two years three years and they go what kind of car we driver and try to stay low-key man I had a Ford LTD station wagon with the woodgrain on his head Oh what great other side a little bird yeah you know little funeral home bird Wow on the side the windows and in 1981 of this wait a min the funeral home bird did you have that on purpose you put that on there so like a you know home car yeah the police pull up on the side they look the other way nobody won't look in that car that's a that's hilarious so it's almost like a hearse yeah how many people you know when I look in the front of Hong Kong that's brilliant that's fucking brilliant you were driving around in a scam car Wow with the police try to pull that thing over yeah yeah that's hilarious but do you must like looked at Ferraris and Lamborghinis goddamn I could just go buy one of those oh my gosh Anna you know if I want to go out in a Ferrari I just call one of my god man I'm gonna use your Ferrari tonight oh that's cool okay yo you're a bit you know without the headaches you right right I ain't got to put it up my god why did you get so smart that's it's amazing it just it just it just started coming you know just little by little you know some say no no way no jury would be where jury everybody gonna know you sell drugs right right well I wonder what I didn't want my mom I know I saw drugs what did you tell your mom you were doing I didn't you know she when she found out I had all that money man she one day cuz my spot is is like my spot was like to two or three miles from my house so what I would do is I would go to the spot work and every time I get like mm I run to the house and put it up and run back to the track cuz you don't want to be standing out on the track with too much money cuz police come over man well you get $3,000 what you doing standing all this money right problems so what I would do is every time I get a couple thousand dollars I'll run to the house and put it up so my mom see me keep running the house you know back and forth banging alone in all I'm doing this all day all night I don't do nothing else I ain't got a girlfriend I'm single right right this is my love is to be out on the track I'm doing this 18 19 hours a day Wow sleeping jumping right back at ya and all the time you sleeping you're losing my some time I sleep in the car on this mine you know wow what's up with shit on you just a little bit though but you can you packing a gun or you know I got my boy standing out he's standing back like citizen we stand out on the street and we Kurt we call the curb service now I would be stand out on the curb and then he would be sitting like in somebody's yard with the pistol uh-huh so if somebody got at me or something like that then he was just was out and start running right so he is he's from a different vantage point that other than seeing him as opposed even see him is not like the police if the police come in and raid they gonna grab us stand out on the block and then are gonna bother him cuz he's up in somebody's yard right so you know we had a little crazy system that we had lined up and that's brilliant so um you you had a spot was like like on a street corner something like that like there was an aerial person 81st in between Hoover in Vermont it was like apartment complexes you know a bunch of apartment complexes and how do you get a spot like what do other dudes try to move in on your spot because they know that everybody goes there to buy well at that time nobody was trying to move in on my spot because nobody really could get the cocaine they didn't they didn't know how valuable cocaine was they didn't really really I had to bend in the spot when other guys start coming in you know I had gotten so big that I didn't stand on the streets long because I took all my money and parlayed it back into the game so I got big so fast that I was able to then start selling these guys three grams and then they would go out and sell it and I was just making like fifty seventy-five dollars off every three grams that I would sell them and that started to be so much money that I didn't even need to sell 50 s and hundreds so people just a became to say it became a you were like the main dude and everybody sold it for you right right so then where did you keep everything did you have like a warehouse like how did you have it set up so you could go eventually what I did is I set up spots like safe instance if you eventually when I got real big I have like $50 spots and if you go to my spot and spent $50 would be like going to somebody else's spot and spend $100 you could do what they call a double up you could double your money you buy $50 worth you can make 50 more now if you would go there and you start buying those 50s and you get up to spend in 2000 then the people at that house would take you to another house where you would have to come there and spend two thousand then if you got up to buying ten thousand then you will get to go to another house and then we have a lot of these $50 houses they would be just all over the place and then it would just be a 50 to a few $2000 spots and then it will be even less $10,000 spots and this is all for distributors right this is all for distributed so you have like distributing houses you had like a whole tier system right that's brilliant absolutely I didn't know I didn't know exactly what you know what the how they called it at the time but I knew see what I did is I dealt with people the way I want to be dealt with I knew the problem that I had when I was coming up so I tried to cut out all their problems for him I didn't want them to have to deal with none of the headaches you know not worry about how to cook it how to get it at a safe price how to make sure that the place was safe I took care of that form when they came to me and they knew they was going to get that proper stuff they knew they weren't going to be robbed they knew how they were bare to read up again everything was was like cookie cutter form almost wow that's amazing so you're doing this for eight years you said from the beginning it was crazy but when when did you start getting legal problems and my problem starting around 86 how many years in was that six years six six years almost so what was it they started arrested you well they started asking where you're getting money from anyway task force man they started to go crazy first day they started to raid spots dead we didn't even sell drugs that you know they started raiding my girlfriend's houses and planting drugs on you know cuz I didn't keep drugs at my girlfriend's house cuz I stayed there you know but those were the easiest spots to figure out you know where that were connected to me you know where people came over because they would let their friends come over like my work spots you didn't come to my works by listen you sold drugs when they need for you coming over there don't even you know don't even acts where that's that right so they raided my girlfriend's houses and then they would take them to jail for drugs and stuff like that there so I'm like wow so then they started to get my guys you know they start to catch my guys driving down the street and they plant drugs on them and it just got really crazy until it got to a point where one night I'm coming from a basketball gym I'm not just your micro Clerk okay this it makes a big difference yeah okay there we go yeah so I'm riding down the street one day and uh man my guys and we said man look at all the homies over there playing dice so it was at my tire shop so we jump out go by holla at them you know see who went in the crap game and when we get ready to leave the whole crap game come with me you know I guess 10 11 o'clock at night so they all want to walk me out to the car make sure everything is good so I jump in the corn pearl off and I look in the rearview mirror and it's a car follow me with no lights on so we're gonna high-speed chase you know chase for a few minutes to the hood trying to lose them and then I look up cars all around it's coming pot lights popping on you know I'm saying like oh man setup so uh I wind up getting out the car gentle not the car leave the car rolling and jump out and get away well they shooting at me police Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam but this whizzing across my head and the whole nine yards you know I get away so once I get away the next morning my lawyer called me and said man you had uh you had two kilos of cocaine on you that night I said man I had no cocaine that night he said yeah they uh they said you had two keys of cocaine you shot at the police so my mom called me you know she's crying all the police been by here brave the house had everybody outside handcuffed and say they gonna kill you won't you turn yourself in so her my lawyer convinced me to turn myself in and we go in we do you know fight the case I want a beating it though because the dog was our planet and how did they prove the drug supply man it was it was hard you know saying I stayed in jail for a while no bail they had me on a million dollar bail 12:51 where all the property in everything had to be inspected and make sure wasn't drug proceeds and all that man it was crazy going through all that but uh while I was in jail the cops come down to my cell to interrogate me so they pulled me out to sell you take me to the back of the jail you know where they put people up and stuff and uh starting asking me a bunch of crazy questions about drugs and all this and about my lawyer you know your lawyer should have let you take the deal who know what he think you gonna fight this case you ain't gonna win we always get our man so doing this time that they interviewing me they recording everything and at the end of the interrogation they tell me you been I tell your lawyer what happened if we find out that you're told him we're gonna we're gonna take care of you so I don't need to tell my lawyer so we get to court the next time we go to court and uh they got the guy on the witness stand he's testifying I see man you know that guy came down and see me like two weeks ago and so he thinking that I need to tell my lawyer you never right so my lawyer springing on him like man you was at the county jail a couple weeks ago he was like yeah cuz you know he's signed in so he knew he had to say yeah he said you saw my client like yeah he said you knew he had a lawyer than you and he's like yeah I knew he had a lawyer now don't you record on all the conversations when when you interview uh suspects he said yeah I want that tape he said yeah I want that tape so they put brought the tape in the tape was all spiced up and cut up and erased and all kind of stuff really the judge was like man get this case out of here really but what they did is they took it to the feds and had the feds to indict me without the tape you know like that lost the tape you know they never told the feds about the tapes or the tape so the feds indict me for that case but then when they do I had hired a private investigator to invest accounts to investigate the couch can we show him I mean look what we got on them you guys I want to use them as witnesses hilarious what did you get on them oh man we had them beaten people planned drugs 150 people got released from prison behind those cops doing what they did but a lot of people don't realize is how deep corruption is and some police forces especially in Los Angeles a certain point in time especially like the rampart district like people don't even know the story behind that was a Crim gang there was no rampart was a fall-off from the freeway task force really yeah freeway task force was the beginning of that whole thing the freeway task force was the most elite task force in the country just to get you just to get me I feel fortunate what's crazy is you're out now does it feel weird to be coming out on the store how many guys get their own task force the very few it was like one of the million you get you the rapper puppet you know that you got a free way to ask for a rapper puppet you have the fucking charm life you stole six hundred million dollars with a coke yeah yeah and out on the street and now might be fun to get a judge Wow you might get a judge yeah what do you mean in this case you know this judge might I don't know which case this Rick Ross case yeah you you think you the judge corrupt annals only saying I don't know are you investigating this judge I am yeah yeah I think you should I mean I want to know how she came to her conclusions you know why why did you yeah those are ridiculous conclusion exactly so I want to get to the bottom of I'm gonna get to the bottom of it you know well if you found anything shape i we can't talk about it right it's your free maze a little bit a little bit you know he ain't no freemason no freemason the lady chief he's a judge yeah yeah but he's an idea they're supposedly supposed to be freezers yeah rapper Rick Ross must be afraid the fake he said that before but we call him what the fuck is his name again uh Billy Bob it's called fat bill so fat bill is supposed to be a freemason too I don't know he said it on a couple songs or something like that Wow okay but I know the Masons are not really happy with it oh really that's hilarity they contacted me they're not happy with that at all wow so you you get arrested so eventually how do you how do you wind up getting taken down you got through all this you got through this one case will they try to plant two kilos on you lumo multiplier Danilo Blandon he brain me now me down your supply of right down this was the Nicaraguan guy he brought me down he gave you up gave me up and this is delivered me oh and this is why the Oliver North shit all that was going down was this before that I think it was after that it was after that all he had got his part I need a pardon to anybody I didn't know Obama tell him I'm looking for it now I did my part I mean why should I get a library like Reagan ah hilarious and so true to write if you really find out if any people think that this is nonsense you know that the connection between the CIA and selling drugs has been pretty well documented go look up a case on a guy named Barry seal Barry seal was a guy out of Mena Arkansas who was by the way there's Bill Clinton's fucking stomping grounds yeah that's where they were dropping coke they were flying coke in from South America and they were dropping it off and Mena Arkansas and the story goes two kids see the drop they catch the kids and kill them and then they put the kids on the train tracks and say that the kids fell asleep on train tracks and go they were high and they fell asleep and they got run over by trains so the parents do an autopsy on the bodies and they find knife wounds Wow so they find out known that these kids were murdered they go into the story turns out Barry seals gets busted because it was his plane that was coming in at that time and then they find out about the coke and he gives up all the information they want up assassinating him when he was on his way to trial well man Gary Webb killed itself shot yourself in the head 20 twice with a shotgun so was it a shotgun he shot himself in the head twice well think so I am sorry reports but I think this would somebody said it was a shotgun Wow yeah you shoot yourself in the head twice it seems like you didn't do the job yeah you had a job to do in unit finishes that doesn't seem to make sense to me take me of it I've heard it's possible to shoot yourself in the head twice but you know that's also the dude who was the whistleblower for Enron shot himself in the head twice oh yeah yeah then not too suspicious right this gigantic multi billionaire scam goes down one motherfucker starts ratting people out why does if shooting himself in a car twice in the head wow really how many people have committed suicide by gunshot to the head twice I mean I've seen people get knocked out with like a little bit punch and you tell me you shoot it yourself in a hey you're awake after they had good willpower yeah yes make sure the job was done well I guess if you had any strength left if you shot yourself in the head and you realize you were still alive you at any strength left you would probably shoot yourself and be like what the fuck I'm gonna just bleed out here in the car man this Americans by anything yeah so you do you think Gary Webb was murdered I mean his book Dark Alliance essentially what happened is it started out a bunch of articles written for the San Jose Mercury News and it was later published as a book and the three-part series he investigated the Nicaraguan linked to the CIA back Contras who had allegedly said it's like he exposed the whole thing and brought the Reagan administration into light and exposed them for essentially being drug dealers absolutely and Gary was amazing man I mean you know he's the one who stopped the forfeiture laws you know that he said would take your property before you were found guilty of a drug crime and Gary made him stop that insane a at least you got to take this guy to trial find out he was seven drugs before you take his property that's before they would take your property sell it and then you get kicked out of prison and you never got convicted and maybe like oh well your car is gone well what's hilarious yeah what's hilarious is if you look at how the the Patriot Act's has been used you know how many times the Patriot Act has actually been used for terrorism it's a tiny tiny tiny fraction because the Patriot Act classifies drug selling as terrorism so the Patriot Act has been used for drug selling thousands of times and it's been used for terrorism like a small handful it's it's kind of cute it's kind of cute have they've figured out a circumvent the system absolutely I mean it's crazy the way I saw a thing on saying another night and they were talking about how California has built so many prisons and absolutely no colleges in the past ten years and Michael I mean this is what happened to bounce of prevention yeah you know we're going with pounds and tons of cure but no convention well the worst thing ever happened that could be possible they made private prisons they made it profitable for people to put people in jail which is fucking insane the fact mean that is that's some Orwellian shit that's some that's some shit that should have been taking place it is slavery it's like it is slavery it's 100 percent slavery especially when you have certain government organizations that Lobby to keep certain things illegal like drug selling like nonviolent crimes like nonviolent drug offenses when you're telling someone that they don't have control of their own consciousness and because you don't agree with you as to what they can and can't do you're going to lock them in a cage and profit from it I'm amazing it's a great business that's somebody fuckin amazing though that in 2012 with our all the access to information that we have today that that's still a legal thing I mean it's just another piece of perfect advice or perfect information rather than just shows you how corrupt the system is yeah it's it's it's it's incredible it's incredible when you really stop and think about how many prisoners there are there's a good that we got people like you to bring this stuff to light I mean I don't see why more more people don't stand up you know but I guess people saw what happened to Gary any like yeah yeah right me me go out there and put my job on the line in my family I just being on expose shit that's already been exposed that's on my coming like third fourth fifth six I'm not the number one guy breaking the news so you make sure yeah shit's already clear it's already on the internet by the time I hear about it I'm like a third hand reporter somebody finds it on the internet they tweet me I find out about it but I actually found out about you through kevin boost documentary the the great white hope american drug war yeah Kevin's a good guy Kevin uh you know kept an eye on me when I was in prison you know wrote me I could call Kevin he interviewed you from prison as well he did he did when I met with Kevin Kevin made my life a little easier while I was in prison you know shout out to Kevin booth Kevin produced my first DVD finish comedy DVD 1999 do you know I sent a book I read the book that uh he his buddy wrote uh Bill Hicks mhm yeah yeah Kevin's a good guide oh yeah he he became who he is because of his friendship with Bill Hicks you know he used to follow Bill Hicks around and record them and Bill Hicks as far as stand-up comedians are concerned like one of the top and greatest comedians of all time for sure you know right up there with a lot of people like Richard Pryor right even though he didn't live very long died of pancreatic cancer when he's only in his young 30s yeah you know but um so he creates this this documentary the American drug war and that's that's how I heard about you and and that's how I heard about cuz I'd already I had already heard about Barry seals and Barry seal and his connection with the CIA and selling drugs but I didn't I didn't know of any one person like you who could be directly connected to the dude that was connected to Nicaragua that was connected to Oliver North and the whole chain of events absolutely absolutely I think when uh when des when Brandon testified against me he talked about his boss going on fishing ship with a George Bush Senior Wow when the kid went up Barry Simms murdered he had George Bush's phone over in his pocket mmm he read as deep as it gets might have been a tracking device in that phone yeah I know what you at meanwhile and meanwhile no one goes to jail no one on that side goes to jail yeah nothing no one goes to jail watch it day it's amazing they make the laws but how the fuck did they let you out means that work yeah the only you you went in for 20 years I had the life sentence man and how did you get out early learning how to read and write studies at all and finally what loophole what was the loophole well what they did is they charged me under the three strike law and what they were saying is that since I had got convicted in all these different states that those added up to three strikes but what they didn't see in the law is that in order to get struck out you have to go to prison get out then commit another crime go to prison get out and then commit the third one in that's three strikes so they can't get you on three felonies before you're ever convicted there are three strikes right it's not three strikes if same things and what I use is a guy standing out when I used to stand out on the street I just make hundreds of sales a day right down at one block so I said now if somebody wanted to they could have gave me 100 convictions right so sort of different people every time right so I didn't believe that the law meant that every sale you may was a separate conviction I believe that they meant just like I just explained right right right because if so then everybody who ever sold cocaine would have three strikes and it makes sense because the idea is supposed to be theoretically that jails supposed to be able to really rehabilitate you exactly so if you are unreadable attainable if you've gone through two separate times and you're still out doing the same shit all right well this dude's a career criminal this is his third offense done that make sense and that's how the law was rolled up even though I don't believe you should play baseball with people lives right because the person could not be changed at one time and then be changed tomorrow and then his circumstances changed and he may be in a different position right you know before you can start passing judge judgment on people you have to live in their shoes right and you know that's why people ask me now how do I feel about drug dealers and I got nothing to gets them right and they do what they feel like they got to do or what they know they got to do so before we pass judgments we have to get all the facts and live in that person's shoes to see if we would do the same thing Athenian and you're a perfect example of that absolutely now you gear away for you went away for 20 years you find this loophole how deep into your sentence had you had already figured out how to read how long I started reading immediately right away yeah yeah and I take classes there and put all I know I taught my men my celly taught me how to read he made me some cue cards with my ABCs on him and her cool I went from from nose to uh reading my indictment to read the newspapers to to reading law books I mean you know for the first time when I found out is that I had never went to read before my life that was a real problem I never really wanted to read right I mean I didn't see any reason why Jack and Jill went up the hill and why I should know you MCA didn't happen right they wasn't chasing no money I was chasing money right right right it was it wasn't interesting to you it wasn't interesting to me but then once you realize well there's a lot of information that I don't have access to I got a came an advocate reader I read over 300 books before on that prison really yeah Wow you've read more books than I have in my lifetime yeah so you're in prison you're you're you learn how to read at what point in time did you start devising a plan to try to like figure out a way to get out of there immediately I was trying to get out you know I knew that the guys that were going home was the guy that was going to a library learn how to become lawyers you know they knew how to fight the system and then they had like guys that all he did all day was sit down and study the law you know they would sit at the table while other people were playing cards and chess and dominoes they would be studying the law so I got I got in with those guys that's got to be kind of a crazy feeling man everybody's just hoping you can crack this fucking system that's got you locked away it's tough with it whatever head starts to hurt David you get you got like migraine headaches and you're sitting in this concrete building I'm gonna try to draw a picture for you you're sitting this concrete building it's 28 stories high nothing but concrete and steel the windows are about three inches wide open and about six feet long escape it looks almost impossible but you know you think about that too like if I had a long rope I could scale the side of the building so it's like a desperation you know and you say man it got to be one loophole in these books because you know that if you can show them in the book where they made a mistake or what a book says that they should have did this when they did that then you know you got action so you're getting headaches just from thinking and reading too much yeah that's all you want to do you just want to stand on books you know I got a life sentence you know when you've got a life sentence it's like this is forever you know this is all you're gonna see for the rest of your life you know so I didn't think that was fitting for me it's amazing that they convicted you for life on that three strikes law it seems like you should be able to go after them for abusing the law which should be criminal well you can't you can't go at the federal prosecutor he's immune that's amazing from prosecution because he's not working as an individual Ethan has been proven he's corrupt well maybe if you can prove he's corrupt but not because he income unjustly the year incompetent in your case you know if he does something to you you know you could charge you with a thousand keys even though you only had one you know and if you got a thousand keys you know that gives you a life sentence if you got one you know you gave probation but if it's powder that's it that's the thing people don't know about I got a good point not crap because crack was in the ghetto and powder was all these you know other people these people that had money we're using the the powder crack is way more illegal yeah wasn't coming hundred to one wow that's incredible that is is that racist very racism it has to be right and I think I mean and even though they just changed it 18:01 I think that was still why is it I wonder one and that's what I said because they already proved you know I sit down on the couch with the guy who invented the law really yeah it's gonna be in the documentary six-six-six documentary after you're out you sat down with yeah I've been doing that since I've been out I've been doing a documentary since I've been out in and and one of the things that I got mad about even with Obama and his administration is that they didn't make it one on one and then even after they made it 18:01 they left it for guys have been in 20 years 25 years they didn't make it retroactive meaning that they don't get out they don't get no benefit from the front 18:01 this guy's right now they if they had the 18 and one they walk out of prison today Wow so I'm saying if it's wrong today and you did it 20 years ago was wrong in right but they said oh well they're they lost their uh because you know Clinton signed a bill where your 2255 you got one year after you're convicted to come up with newly discovered evidence and the law is crazy man like right now 7 inches you go to prison unjustly and you do all your appeals and everything one year you got one year to prove yourself innocent now after that one year if you don't find it and in a day after that one you find this newly discovered with evidence you can't even submit it to the court oh that's got to be maddening it's maddening they got guys in the air that found newly discovered evidence that they can't even submit it for anybody to hear it so when you went to jail for this and when you're finally in prison was this the first time you had ever been in prison other than the one time you got arrested and he stayed in there for a while no no that was my second time when I got the life sentence I've been in yellow twice so you had two strikes you had one strike at one strike on like how long did you go away for the first time five and a half years Wow so you're in the second time I was entrapped I didn't even go into that part with you I was in trapped because I wasn't selling drugs I was building a Youth Center because what I did is I figured out what kids in the ghetto need to get them out of gangs and drugs I know what they need so what I did is I bought a need I bought a theater they need some some some instructions they need somebody to come and walk them through it somebody they can go and talk to when they need to talk to him you know not talk to him once they already been corrupted and their heads are already in the game they don't want to hit you in you know I already got my mind made up I know what I'm doing I'm all man but before they get like that they need somebody a place that they can go in they could talk to Joe Rogan or Rick Ross or Magic Johnson or Oprah Winfrey or some of these other people who could teach them how to make money other ways you know because in the ghetto you know the first business you see in a ghetto you know the first business is what the drug man he's gonna be the first businessman that you see in South Central sentence is going to be the drug man and especially a black man as a business owner because we don't we don't nothing in South Central so you that's when you got you so you said you got set up this is the last time yeah yeah when I got the life sentence this guy called me I'm not selling drugs you want selling drugs are on my heart just I hadn't sold drugs in six years seven years but how did you stop I just quit did you quit after you got arrest the first time in the five years not quit a year and a half before I went to prison I was I'm doing this I got I got eight nine hundred thousand dollars cash got property all over the place all I got to do now is make this property and stuff work for me and you know I got enough money to hold me off for a while I'm through it so I walked away from the game so I'm confused on your timeline here because when you were 20 years old that's when you started and then when you were 28 you got arrested right but you did five years in jail right where's the five years I did the five years in 89 I went to prison how old were you then 28 like 28 28 and a half you go to jail for five years and then you get out for I got out I got out for six months for six months and then they give you the life sentence right whoa god damn so the life sentence is a total setup total setup tore out my total entrapment I was not selling drugs danilo called me in a method call me today I got a prison whoa he was like man I need to see you I was like man I'm kickin it with my mom you know my mom came and seen me and and stuff like that so I'm like I'm kickin it with my mom I'm cool a hot hatch in a couple days so when I finally gonna holler at him he's telling me oh man I got it to this price I got it at that price I was like as a good price I know this is recorded too so you know that didn't help you know they was like oh you were interested Wow so uh just went on for six months that he quoted me you know what I mean dropping the price driving a motherfucker and then a one day he caught me and I was riding with one of my little homies Chico Brown you know I said man that still just told me whooping chickens like man I could sell all that then that's how I got started so I wind up making introduction to the two of them Chico handing the money and Cody's come from everywhere so you never even got to sell no I never sold it so this guy where is he now Danilo he's in Nicaragua just chillin he supposed to been a documentary to really you y'all better check that documentary out it's funny dogs awesome the now this Danilo really can we know how to come they planted drugs whoa it's your proof that he planted the drugs I know he plans the drugs right but it is he he went to jail no I don't think he's gone many plans he drove but he went to jail for it he went to jail for planting those drugs for corruption you know beating people planting drugs he was doing on on police it was a habit search he was doing it well me he made money man yeah well that's where the rampart comes in I mean for people don't know most most police officers at this point time to leave that Suge Knight hired cops to kill biggie smalls and that they also he probably also had Tupac killed and that he did it all under this under this rampart division this rampart division was working for him and there's a huge Rolling Stone article about it it's fascinating fascinating shit that the cops were so dirty that the cops were working with gang members they're working with murderers working with criminals and making money clearly profiting well you know comps men it's just like everybody else you know they lie cheat and all other things that the normal person go through in life so I don't put nothing past him especially when you start putting all that money on the table you know I remember my first young guy who got arrested by him and they stole his money he was like 16 years old you know he called me he's like great man the cops just raided my house was like yeah you are he's like yeah I'm cool I was like what you have he's not gonna have like $40,000 I said what happened he said man he asked me who money was and I told me it wasn't mine they told me to go Wow so when he got out when I got with him you know we called the lawyer in total are you a man it was $40 at that house but with no drugs so he called me sent me with no money at that house wow that's super common right yeah yeah that happened all the time there's no one policing the police there's no one governing the government stuff you know that's the real issue they got to begin they got the guns yeah well not only that they can change the laws I mean we see what the fuck is going on now with this country it was like every week they come up with some new even more restrictive even more or well in law that gets through that allow them to tap your phones with no wire with no warrants rather you know we're listening in on your your phone calls tap your fucking GPS systems they can follow everywhere you go and they can do all this shit without warrants now yeah I mean and they do it supposedly under the guise of terrorism but it's really under the guise of making it easier for them to prosecute you for whatever the fuck they want to because there's a goddamn business and locking people up in cages exactly exactly so that's what they into so you find your loophole and then you chase after it you're in jail right and then once once you find this loop remember that day when I read it in the book and it was like me it just like popped out at me boom go to jail commit a crime and get released I shot to the phone to call my lawyer I said man I found it Wow so what happens then where was discouraging what he said after he read it he didn't see it the same way I did yeah you're a better lawyer than your fucking lawyer I'm not Harvard that's why I should get an honorary degree or something yeah so so I just told him to are put on the books you know then the judge went through her thing oh no mr. Ross it's not the way you said it is and I was like Ann she must can't read if she can't read that she can't read so then the prosecutor went through his whole thing but then I went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals you know they agree with me totally you know say that uh if they did it the way they were saying do it they would lock up everybody would be career criminals on their first arrest so yeah literally everybody would be in life here on your life Here I am of Wyoming so nice sort of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals they agree with you they side with you you released immediately no I had nine more years to do Jesus Christ why not lawyer that's just where it was you know that's how much time I had left okay so you had $20 they cut me down no no I had a life but they locked me down to 20 so the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals cut you down to 20 mm-hmm okay so at least you knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel that right right so then we I was happy with that you were happy with that yeah the penitentiary cuz I was up in Lompoc penitentiary you know USP Lompoc hell what is that place like oh man that's a dungeon you know everybody in there got 40 years of better you know they mad at you up def you got 20 you know they got to get you out of there with 20 years you know some might happen to you really man yeah those kinds is freedom you're the years is you're almost free yeah you got it man you gotta walk on eggshells around here if you have 20 years you got between two years you need you better go away me and how they talk to me they were like mad at you or they be mad at you did mad at you if you only got 20 years yeah but you got 30 years they might be mad god damn that's hilarious yeah hilarious you can get hurt you can get hurt they're just because you got 20 years how did you stay out of danger well like I said when I got my time cut I only had to stay there like three more months and I was out of there so it was it was easy for me and you know I'm a well like God to some that even in jail yeah yeah they like me how dangerous was the prison that you were in initially the first prison before they moved out I mean I saw guys get hidden here with Iron Mike wingers fired what might ringers am operation wring the mop out rights this great big old thing might weigh about 15 20 pounds yeah you know guys sitting in his chair and the guy walks up behind him and just smashes his skull with it I mean brutal brutal brutal brutal site I seen a guy get beat with a baseball bat aluminum baseball bat until his head was like mush they had to helicopter him out on the helicopter I think he had brain damage though he didn't you know was a vegetable I've seen guys get stabbed you know while I'm taking a shower you know you hear this loud noise like just kicked bumping up against the wall boom boom boom really violently you know and you know this is somebody's body you know like why would somebody be hitting the wall his heart you know and uh so I wrapped my tile up and I look my head out the shower when I see this guy and this guy stabbed him and so to get off tonight he's just throwing this back and hitting everything up against the wall trying to get away from the knife so it's ready by then I mean prison is really violent you know you have to be careful especially in the USPS you know in the USPS but no one was a dangerous - but not as dangerous as USP cuz these guys don't have nothing what is a USP US Penitentiary a US Penitentiary what is the difference well safe instance the FCI you can't have more than 20 years and be at FCI if you have more than 20 FCI stands for a Federal Correctional Institution that's like a medium okay so if you have more than 20 years you're going to go to a USP now if you go to a FCI and you got 20 years but you keep getting into trouble fights and you know something maybe you stabbed somebody then they're gonna send you to a u.s. peep in the heli okay you go up here these guys can handle stabbings so there they'll boost you up then they got what they call the low is for the guys we got like five years six years then you go to a low so they kind of keep it separated like that by your violence by how much you get in trouble things like that so the USP is the most dangerous that's the the most absolutely have some murderers life sentences and then they had guys from all over the country say from you in Washington DC and you've been getting in trouble in Washington DC then they shipped you down to California to keep you out of trouble you know some of those guys from DC are really really violent and what they do is they take all the baddest guys from all over the country and they put them in u.s. s peace so you may have a thing where guys are fighting over territory like the TV you know like the DC guys or the Philadelphia guys might say man we want to watch this program tonight the Philadelphia 76ers of planes so we want to watch Philadelphia 76er tonight because you're always watching the Lakers so that could cause a fight you know it's kind of like territorial you know the way it works did you get in any violent interactively' not absolutely not I stayed in law library really they don't come in a lot Iberian fight so how did you that's how you avoided everything most of the time the only time I really would put myself in a in harm's way as when when football season you know I play flag football with the guys I play basketball with them but I always had a mentality to defuse anything that ever happened I wouldn't fight you know if somebody filed me hard on the basketball court it was my fault because I put myself on the basketball court if I filed somebody hard on the basketball court it was my fault because I filed anymore so I would always apologize to guys when I filed them hard but that's just the type of person I am you know when I play basketball I don't mean to hurt anybody but sometimes I do you know I filed a lot but uh you know I got along well you know people respected me and I show the most respect baby why did you have to align yourself with any groups in prison I didn't know I didn't even though I am adopted by most groups you know they adopt me most groups you know most of the groups in jail adopt me you know I mean everybody you know the Philadelphia guys that the Crips the Bloods the DC's I mean I'm cool I'm just cool without all of them you know the only one property is not is is a what's the disarray Neos and amber there's a party the only two groups that but it's this or anything else Mexicans yeah and then the Aryan brothers officers kick your che do yeah yeah other than that I got it on and even they got home you know they would speak to me you know hey Rick what's happening but you know we don't hang out but they don't hang out with blacks now the day you got out of jail man what the fuck was that like the day you get out of 20 years and knowing that you got out you know on your hair by the hair you know it was luck cuz you know it was guys when I was in prison it was guys who had the same issue I had it didn't get out Wow it argued it almost the same way you know matter of fact we're trying to get the guy who was the first guy to get a life sentence for selling crack we're trying to get his interviewing his issue was was almost identical to mine it's a little different though but close and he's in for life he's in for life and he was only like 20 years old 19 years and it was the same situation they used a three-strike rule and there's a three-strike rule but he had he didn't have three convictions his conviction is a little different right he did have convictions his was he he went to jail when he was 18 years old he got out and the same day he got out he went right back on the block and start selling dope again and he got arrested that day so he wasn't convicted it wasn't convicted of the first one when he caught the second one but they said it don't matter if he was convicted you had been in jail so you should have learned your lesson and you went back out and you did it again uh there's got to be a lot of that it was mad at me when I won really yeah and it supposed me my man too he was mad man how you win I had to say miss you I said no you was a little different see I'd never got out on mine see on mine they took me from from from LA they took me to Texas they took me to Ohio took me the st. Louis all before I ever got a released I never got a released now when you got out what's the first shit you did you already know man a long time oh my god me saw me just old girlfriends yeah no no new girl new girl yeah new girl did you know this girl make like the girls like contact do you like while you're in prison yeah yeah I got a lot of betters because you were famous I was famous American gangster magazines and they knew you were coming out too as is magazine yeah they knew I was coming home they they started to publicize and I had got a date why weren't you the first one of the first guys so so like a social marketing wise yeah yeah I'm the first prisoner to start a social network freeway enterprise calm y'all check it out too long right now I'm ranked like 100,000 in the u.s. sometimes I go as low as 70,000 I'm trying to break down to like 30,000 in the US it's called freeway enterprises calm if we were Enterprise calm and what is involved in this social network well what I do is I give people outlet for their music for the videos you know like a lot of the sites not a charge and put their videos up and I don't didn't put their pictures up they can meet friends and share music and share pictures and just different things uh you know that they do on social networks so I offer those services form do you have any inside scoop on who killed biggie man somebody else asked me that I said the Rolling Stone article we did of it they said the rampart cops did it okay I don't have a clue you know I was at I was at USP lompoc one big he got killed I mean I was I was disappointed that he came back to California I thought that was a little crazy you know with what had happened to Park you know I knew that it wasn't safe for him to be out here in California because guys in California are very vengeful and when I heard that he was in California I was like what was he thinking about it's kind of crazy that musicians started killing each other you know isn't it amazing yeah I mean that it never existed we were just talking about this when we were in Atlanta this weekend that they were they were the first musicians and artists basically they would start killing each other Wow Wow has Tupac contacted you at all nah not asking the Tupac contact him yet no he hasn't Tupac you mean the new hologram China that people say Tupac's not dead nobody says that's not an idiot a lot of people did like what's-his-face just said it the other day the big music executive I'll tell you one second one you know there's a photo of him on the autopsy table it's real simple back in the days before they had Photoshop to Fox dead yeah okay yeah there's no doubt about it they killed that dude so how many people were a part of your freeway Enterprise calm social media I think I got to right around 16 to 20 thousand members right now well that's pretty cool well I'll guarantee you have more today I hope so I need them I need them now signup help you boy out sign up and also follow him on Twitter it's real Freeway Ricky on Twitter and and check that out now you have 40,000 followers on Twitter that's beautiful yeah you message me when you only had like eight I remember you must be I get more followers man I can't help you you know you're trying man I'm learning all the social stuff all the social media but I know they pay so much attention to well your boy in the background what do you what are you asking me what's that discard your what'd you say his car's parked right there oh that's fine it's fine oh don't worry about it man they don't this is they don't do Pasadena dude nobody's ever put out more music after they're dead than Tupac right yeah hologram yes hologram was creepy and see that shit from Coachella yeah I heard about it I didn't see it but I heard about it he looked like Tupac had been lifting weights is that right yeah they had a mall mmm a doubt he was yoked he looked like George st. Pierre it was ridiculous it seriously had a six-pack it was it was way more muscular than the regular Tupac was weird it was like if I could just been doing kettlebells and CrossFit and shit you know these record labels getting away with poop I mean you know they don't care who wins the war you know they got both uncovered biggie Empire now record labels nowadays they're fucked there's really they have to make a percentage of the artists that are out there performing live right I mean how do they make money now yeah yeah they do the 360 deals what does that mean when they get a percentage of everything you do you know if you do a commercial on TV they get a piece of it if you do a concert they get a piece of it if you get a tennis shoe endorsement they want a piece of they didn't used to do that no they didn't they used to just be strictly music but uh and what do they always get a piece of the live performance now they do but they didn't always know no really so this is all post mp3 world right right used to be the performance you should be all hardnesses money what is the benefit of having a music cup now it seems like with the internet it would almost be a hindrance to be in marketing market marketing donnas because you know people believe what they see in here but once you get to a point like a jay-z somebody's already in the contract so he can't get out oh but what I'm saying is if he started his own shit and started helping people promote themselves like he starts promo people you could enable people to become famous on their own you think jay-z wants to help people why not I mean I don't know I mean I think that then it sounds logical but if someone rude explained to him how much better his own life would be if he helped other people's lives and it makes you actually feel better yeah you probably try it but it's hard to sink that into people's heads everybody's so fucking competitive yeah everybody wants to just get all the money in Haga for themselves and they don't understand that someone else's success does not equal failure for you it's not like success that was yours and you didn't get it this guy got it's not like there's only a certain amount of gold out there and like you you're telling people where the golds at and again you're like damn I could have been my fucking gold now it means someone else's success has nothing to do with you that's a whole new human being yeah it's crazy but most people don't want to help no why
