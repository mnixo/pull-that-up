four three two one yeah and we're live all right so to set this up when Gary was on last Gary Taubes Stephan how do I say your last name Stephan DNA DNA yeah DNA it's like DNA like DNA but with a G right got it okay when you were on last Stephan had some opposition to some of the things that you were saying we talked about getting him on and you on together we finally pulled it off took there was a lot of wrangling there's a lot of back-and-forth and cat wrangling but we got it we're here give me your position on this is all folks listening this is all about obesity and the the mechanism for obesity is that fair to say yeah yeah so essentially the main points that we want to talk about today I'll try to keep this up fist from your face okay sure just that you move around um what causes obesity and what causes insulin resistance which is behind a lot of our chronic diseases that are common in society and please give us your background yeah so I have a BS and biochemistry PhD in neuroscience after getting my PhD in neuroscience I went on to study the neuroscience of obesity at the University of Washington and particularly the brain circuits that regulate body fatness hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about those today and then I went on to become a science consultant science communicator and write a book called the hungry brain that is my attempt to explain for a non specialist audience what what causes obesity and yeah so that's my background now what is your disagreement with Gary's position yeah so how about how about I just can I start to explain please do what I believe causes obesity I'm gonna be long-winded here is that it's okay go right ahead all right we have ours okay cool so first a little bit of housekeeping I'm going to be citing a lot evidence today and so I was one of these bring this up to your focus sure just moving around sure you want to sit back how's that day perfect okay I'm gonna be exciting a lot of evidence today and I want people to be able to follow along at home and so I put many of the references that I'm gonna be citing on that so it doesn't cover your face okay there we go all right I put a lot of the references that I'm gonna be citing on my website Stephon Guillen a.com or if you don't feel like spelling my name you can go to whole health sore so our G and I have a numbered list of topics there and I'm going to be calling out numbers just scroll down to the number that I referred to and the references are all there the second thing I want to say that I want to be really clear about today is that I'm not here to be the anti low carb guy okay um I think low carb diets are a valid tool for controlling body fatness and controlling blood sugar I'm not here to talk anybody out of being on a low carb diet what I am here to try to talk people out of is some of the mythology that has accumulated around the low carb diet okay so I want to get started with an analogy to help people understand why the brain is important in obesity so imagine you're an alien coming down from outer space and you want to understand what's going on on earth and you notice that on the highway some cars are traveling faster than others some cars go faster some cars go slower and you want to figure out why and so you go and you start studying the tires of the cars because obviously the amount of force that is exerted by the tire onto the asphalt is the thing that determines the speed of the car we know this this is just physics and so you study the tires and you study the tires and you study them and you never figure out why some cars go faster than others now why is that the reason is that you're studying the wrong part of the system if you want to understand the why some cars go faster than others you have to understand the part of the system that regulates speed and that is the person behind the wheel and so in this analogy the tires are fat cells and the person behind the wheel is the brain there has been tons of research on fat cell biology on what factors put fat in fat cells what take it out been tons and tons of research on that and it's intuitively obvious that we should be studying that to understand obesity right but in fact all of that research has yielded very little insight into why some people are fatter than others that's because it's the wrong part of the system study fat cells do not regulate the size of fat cells any more than the tires on a car regulate the speed of the car the thing that regulates the size of fat cells is the brain so let's talk about first I'll give you a little framework for thinking about this the brain evolved over about 600 million years to promote the survival and reproduction of our ancestors and over the course of that time we evolved all these different brain circuits that have specialized functions they generate our hunger and our cravings and our fullness feelings that generate our eating behavior what and how much we eat and they actively regulate the amount of fat on our bodies and that's one of the things I want to talk about and all of these circuits evolved and these are non conscious by the way so you don't decide you want to be hungry you don't decide that you want to have a craving these are things that bubble up from non conscious parts of your brain that you don't control so these circuits are calibrated to an environment of our ancestors not the environment we're living in right now so these circuits all evolved to function optimally in the environment of our ancestors promote the survival and reproduction of our ancestors so what happens when you put these brain circuits in the modern environment where you have abundant calorie dense tasty foods rich in carbohydrate and fat is these same brain circuits push us to over-consume and they push our bodies to accumulate and hold on to fat and then what you see as a result is the three hallmarks of obesity first of all the obvious you see elevated body fat mass second of all you see elevated calorie intake people with obesity consume more calories and people who do not have obesity after correcting for and sex and physical activity level and third you see that people with obesity defend their higher level of body fatness against changes and so there's actually a regulatory change that happens it's not conscious defense you know they're not trying to remain obese it's these body fat regulatory circuits and this is where Gary gets it right is that people with obesity are not just lean people who eat more calories there's actually a change in the regulatory activity that regulates body fat in the body and we can get back to how that happens but I'll just leave it there for now so up until this point I've basically just been telling a plausible story right I mean I haven't actually sighted any evidence yet to support that my story is correct and so let's get into that let's talk about what some of the evidence is that supports this idea that I've just laid out so I want to start with the genetics of obesity I think this offers some weight for one second as long as it's very breech the question I don't I still don't quite understand what the model is okay if you don't understand the model how about I lay out how about I finished laying it out and then you can ask a question because I may answer your question over the course of continuing so let me just finish okay so now the genetics of obesity offers us a lot of insight into the biological mechanisms that drive differences in body fatness in the general population so you get these studies like the the most interesting studies are the genome-wide Association studies they get hundreds of thousands of people together and they sequence are they they measure all these markers and their genomes and they figure out what parts of the genome makes some people fatter than others so if you have version a in this particular location you end up a little fatter than if you have version B and when you look at all the places where this is happening you can see the genes where it's happening in and that tells you if you look at what those genes are doing that tells you what the mechanisms are that underlie everyday differences in body fatness in general population and so to kind of warm ourselves up let's start top by talking about height genes so height has a strong genetic component so does body fatness and researchers has figured out a lot of the genes that underlie differences in height between people and when you look at what those genes do they tend to be involved in the growth and development of the skeleton and the connective tissue which is what you would expect right because growth of the skeleton determines your height so genes that determine diabetes risk type 2 diabetes are all about insulin sensitivity all about insulin secretion and the function of the insulin-secreting pancreas which is what you expect because diabetes is a disease that is all about insulin so these studies are really good at getting at the underlying biological mechanisms that are driving these phenomena so what do these studies have to say about obesity if Gary's model is correct we should see a bunch of genes popping up related to fat cells and insulin if my model is correct we should see a bunch of genes popping up related to the brain and in fact that's exactly what we see the genetics of obesity are overwhelmingly related to differences in brain activity between individuals and okay so that's one piece of evidence another piece of evidence there are five fda-approved weight-loss drugs four of those acting the brain one of them reduces dietary fat absorption in the digestive tract there are no effective fat loss drugs that I'm aware of the target insulin or fat cells third piece of evidence if you look at some people get really unlucky in life and they end up with these horrible genetic mutations that you know knock out some biological pathways some of these people end up with extreme obesity people and also animals we see this in mice and rats just occasionally you get unlucky and you get really really fat and researchers have been cataloguing what are these mutations when we find people who are genetically really obese what are these mutations that are making them fat what is the biological mechanism that's getting screwed up that's making them fat and what they've found is that all of these mutations that they've identified to date a number of them are occurring in the leptin signaling pathway and this is the leptin is the primary fat regulating hormone in the body Gary avoids this never talks about this in his writing but leptin is the primary fat regulating hormone in the body and these mutations either knock out leptin they knock out leptin receptors or they knock out the left and response pathway in the brain and so that's the third piece of evidence ok so now we haven't really gotten around to talking about what it is exactly about the bad interaction that happens between our ancient brains and the modern food environment that causes us to become fat we've established that the brain is central to obesity but we haven't really established what it is exactly about that interaction why does our modern food why does our modern environment promote obesity right so basically there are three different ways that I'm gonna look at this from but first I want to say that the probably the best way to answer this question is to start with the question what is the most fattening diet in the world what is the diet that is more fattening than any others and the answer to that is it's human junk food in a variety of non-human species and humans it's human junk food that is more fattening than any others and I'm gonna skip over some of the research here that demonstrates this by the way I haven't been calling out numbers here okay let me call out some numbers reference number two on my website is those genetic studies reference number one is the obesity drugs reference number six is those spontaneously occurring genetic mutations and now I'm talking about reference number 52 so I'm gonna I'm gonna gloss over some of the individual research because I'm being long-winded here but essentially you find is that this stuff is really fattening in animals many different species that's super fattening in humans calorie dense when you put create an environment with abundant easy calorie dense tasty foods rich in carbs and fat you see this dramatic over consumption and fat gain across many species including humans and what you find in the research is that the sugar and the carbohydrate cannot explain that they're part of the effect yes to explain part of it but you cannot replicate that effect by only feeding sugar and carbohydrate you can't replicate it in animals you can't replicate it in humans when you say you can't replicate it you mean you can't replicate obesity what do you mean yeah that's right you cannot you cannot cause the same degree of fat gain the same extent of fat gain the same extent of overconsumption using only sugar and carbohydrate that you can cause with a variety of calorie dense palatable human foods you can't fully replicate it with sugar and carbs you cannot fully replicate it with fat alone either if you put those when we can we can get deeper in this if you want but I'm confused so you're saying that the the diet that causes the most obesity is what we think right this human junk food diet rich in sugar simple carbs bullshit bullshit diet right what do you you're saying that you can't replicate that with just you cannot are fully replicated boolean so what I mean is that if you just feed if you just increase sugar intake right in animals or in humans you do get weight gain but it is modest compared to what you get when you put people around a variety of calorie dense palatable foods rich in carbohydrate in fat similarly if you that's very confusing how's that because I'm not sure exactly what you're saying you're saying you if you give people this calorie rich sugar diet of junk food you will make them gain weight but not as much way as what so what I'm saying is that if you if you give people or animals the the actual human junk food with all the carbs and fat and everything they gain a lot more weight and a lot faster than if you just give them a diet that's high in sugar and high in refined carbohydrate and what that shows is that the sugar and they're fine carbohydrate cannot fully explain the effect can't actually explain why those foods are fattening see this one no I don't do it okay because you're saying if you give people the diet of American junk food you you'd get not as much of an effect if you give them just the sugar in the carbohydrate right we're saying yeah so but what are you giving them when you're giving them the diet of junk food you can well for example in animals no it's different because if you think about human junk foods generally those foods contain fat and carbohydrate and salt and all kinds of other things so it's more it's more than just it's a lot Soekarno yes so just and okay sugar so I'll get in more detail so the ways that you can do this you can add sugar just sugar table sugar to the feed of animals that's one way to do it or you can add it to their drinking water sometimes it's a little bit fattening sometimes it's not it's not that fattening and animals in humans you can ask them to drink sugar sweetened beverages that are just sugar and you can see what happens and people will gain weight or you can tell them to stop drinking sugar sweetened beverages and you can see what happens okay people will gain weight they will lose weight suggesting that that is part of the explanation but it's a much smaller effect than you see with this full pallet of these foods that contain carbs and fat and all this other stuff as I'm saying car well obviously there's more calories right if there's carbs and fat and all these other correct if you think that calories matter then we agree oh well the short matters right Gary doesn't think it matters you don't think it matters well I think it's the wrong way to think about it what do you disagree if anything with what he said so far well so far what he said hasn't been particularly revelatory um the I think we have to step back for a second because you know while the low-carb community might have a better understanding of where we disagree I think the greater community and that Jo reaches might not so fundamentally with Stefan saying and with the research community saying and the conventional thinking in this field is that the brain and correct me any point they get this wrong but the brain regulates does the fundamental job of controlling how fat we are yes and the way it does it is by controlling or Mis controlling our intake and our expenditure and the difference ends up in fat tissue is that fair to say for the most primarily intake but yeah yeah so Stefan has a brain centric view of the universe and the community at large does as well so if we go outside and we walk down you know Ventura Boulevard and we see some of the weighs 400 pounds they've clearly taken in more calories and they should have over the course of their life and it's been stored in their fat tissue and Stefan says I think would say that the problem is in their brains ability to regulate intake to expenditure is that correct yeah okay and let me I have to fix my headphones so how are we gonna do this I'm getting feedback when I talk you're getting feedback yeah it's just weird could be the hold on months up yeah for those who don't know I'm hearing impaired as they say kindly Mike kids would say deaf as a post no matter so I took off my hearing aids that's a little better okay so what I've been arguing so I come along my background I'm a journalist I'm an investigative journalist with a science background okay that's what I do and I'm curious and I've gotten a lot of you know and I my first two books were studying what's called pathological science which is about people got the wrong results in science because a lot I'm scientists do so by I'm very sensitive to this and as I was doing the research for my first book which took five years what I noticed in when you take a historical perspective is that the research community studying obesity was very focused on the brain they just assumed that fat people are gluttons and I'm going to use some socially unacceptable language because in part that's how they thought about it in fact when you read the obesity literature from the 40s and 50s it's shocking the way these people talked about people with obesity and the assumption was that they're gluttons or they're neurotic or they're anxious or they're just you know they're but it was all brain center mm-hmm and when they got to the nineteen sixties the field was being run by psychologists and psychiatrists who were trying to get people with obesity to eat less and my favorite example is one team that was trying to get they got the wives to stop having sex with the husband's if they didn't lose weight every week and then would motivate them I think even you point out that sex is a greater motivator in your book than tasty foods it didn't say it was greater but I said it was on par bar so and I'm gonna just read you uh I won't worry do that the so there was this while the obesity research community is focusing on the brain there were people studying fat metabolism endocrinologists a study hormones and hormones related disorders saying that the old you know fat storage and fat mobilization the burning of fat in the human body is controlled by this very diverse set of hormones and enzymes and the nervous system is involved in well and our body does a very careful job of decide basically orchestrating how we use feels after we eat and the implication was and I think Stephan kind of stepped into this with the very first thing you said so the assumption was obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation so today when you read the literature the articles often say obesity is a sort of energy imbalance you take in more calories spend there were still the best scientists in the field the best physician scientists with a look obesity the sort of excess fat accumulation let's look at what regulates fat accumulation the human body some people are programmed or dysregulated to store more fat and if they store more fat they're going to their behavior is going to respond they'll be hungry or they'll eat more they'll be gluttons all these things so it was a switching the the causality instead of the brain determining energy balance and that determining fat accumulation the idea was sort of let's see what regulates fat accumulation if that's dysregulated if I have a if I give birth to a daughter who weighs a hundred pounds at age four I'm not going to worry about how much he eats and exercises I'm gonna worry about what's going on with fat accumulation in this young girl that her body is just as if you give a you know if you have a child who's six foot eight when he's six years old you're not gonna worry about how much he eats and exercises you're gonna worry that he's over secreting growth hormone so the idea basically what I've done my role in this is to say look in this vitally important pair in the 1960's and 1970's when obesity researchers came to understand fat metabolism researchers came to understand the regulation of fat cells the obesity people were convinced that the problem is in the brain and those obesity people eventually grew into the world that Stefan got his PhD in this neurobiological world where you study what's happening in the brain and you ignore what's happening in the fat cells and fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation and then sort and when you look at that you find a whole world of places in which people can pre be predetermined you know be driven to be fat mmm-hmm so for example when I was in high school senior in high school I even weighed 195 pounds and I played football and my brother two years older weight 195 pounds his senior year and played football my brother never got more than a hundred 95 pounds and I went up to 240 we both ate as much as humanly possible you know as you could imagine that's what high school athletes do my brother was always lean I was always chubby my brother stayed lean and became an endurance athlete I became a football player and I lifted weights I put on muscle easily and I fat and easily he didn't the conventional wisdom would be the reason I went to 240 and he never got to 195 was that my brain was different than his my argument is our bodies were fundamentally different so if I see somebody walking down the street always 300 pounds I don't worry about I don't think about what the problem is with her brain regulating intake and expenditure I think about what's why is her body driving her to be 300 pounds so that I think kind of the fundamental difference and is it is it the brain that can't do the job or is it the body that can't do the job and the brain is responding to what's happening in the body yeah is this a reductionist perspective because I mean isn't it a whole list I mean holistically you're looking at the entire Machine of the human body the idea that the brain is somehow another separate from the body is saying it's separate the question is is a brain driving what's happening in the body or is it responding to it yeah so and you know the brain of course does respond a lot to what's happening in the body and we can talk about that and how that works but you know I think it's we can tell stories but the things the thing that differentiates a story that's true from a story that is not true is evidence and so you know you talk about the difference between your brother and you this is where that genetics evidence comes back in that I was talking about your brother and you only share half of your genes we know that genetics has a strong impact on who has a greater susceptibility to body fatness than not than others and we also know what the genes do that underlie those differences and they are primary I'm not done Gary let me finish I just want those genes something no no not right now I'm in the middle of saying something those jeans are primarily related to differences in brain function that is what the genetics say and so that suggests that the reason why you had a greater propensity than your brother to become fat probably has to do with differences in genetics that relate to brain function that is what the research says when you talking about to 17 year olds that way exactly the same amount like how do we know how much they consumed in calories I mean we don't have any studies we don't know any I mean I could guarantee you we both hate as much as humanly possible naturally my mother who never got over 195 and I apologize for bringing you up on the air I know you don't like that used to say that he never gets stuffed he just gets bored of eating after a couple of hours okay okay but I maybe even though like maybe if you looked at it scientifically you ate more than him or maybe you ate more Shawn oh I made more carbs well so that's a difference so the those are the two hypothesis one hypothesis is my body and this is what Stefan is Cypress I want to just the thing I wanted to read how much I'll ask you the question how much of the the variation in human obesity - those genes explain so if you look at the genetics of I didn't ask how much when you said that's talking yeah you gotta look at please Gary um so if you look at the genetics of obesity what you find is that from twin studies and family studies that measure the overall contribution of genetics about 75% of the differences in body fatness between individuals is due to genetic differences between those individuals so you know 1995 America if you just take a cross-section of people and you measure how much is genes how much is environment about 75% is genetic now we have only identified a small proportion of the specific genes that underlie the propensity to obesity and so if you look at the percentage that we have specifically identified it's very small and that's what I refer to in my book how much it's like right now I think it's up to about 10% it was 3% when your book was populated 7% absolutely yeah the latest yeah actually let me cite the so well daddy there now just a second I'm gonna cite the study just a second monocyte the study this study is under reference number two so you can you can go check that out it's about 10% and these genetic studies are advancing very quickly and that's why in the three years since I wrote that we have explained a lot more than we did at the time that I wrote that and so we have a portion of these genes identified and what we're seeing is that most of that portion that we have identified relates to brain activity and so that tells us that primarily the differences between individuals that determine differences in body fatness is about differences in brain activity no one should be shocked about this the brain generates all of our eating behavior it generates all of our physical activity behavior and it actually regulates body fatness no one should be surprised by this I am and I was and how he expressed well again did you disagree with and well virtually everything but um let's begin with track back now the um okay so drugs that explain obesity 10% with the argument that I was making and the argument I continue to make imagine if you know take Stefan's car and see Stefan he says Stefan say Stefan right it's okay I'm not saying it but I mean in polish just people don't get confused the if you take Stefan's car analogy and somewhere in the 1970s I I've used the car analogy for this too but they I don't think it's as appropriable more way to think that somewhere in the 1970s the aliens didn't notice that there were humans driving the car so now they're trying to solve the problem without the humans involved why see some cars drive faster than others and they come up with all kinds of hypotheses and some of them can explain it even when they interpret the hypotheses one of the common problems that science is called intellectual phase-locked so what I've been arguing is in effect the obesity research community left out of its research 1960s era and the chronology the hormonal metabolic regulation of fatty acid metabolism oxidation burning and it sucks when they did it pretty much everything they've done since has been interpreted incorrectly just like the aliens would interpret the car problem if they never know this see humans so and leptin is a good example so leptin is discovered in 1993 and when leptin is discovered obesity becomes sort of a legitimate field of science until then it's a bunch of actually mostly psychologists studying and and now it becomes a sub-discipline of molecular biology and all the molecular biologists jump into the field and they assume that what leptin does is control the brain and it signals how much fat is available it does some kind of satiety or fuel deficiency hormone and as such they study the brain and they study the action of leptin in the brain now in 2002 Jeff Friedman who gets credit for discovering love then perhaps incorrectly publishes the paper in the journal science it saying perhaps as much as two-thirds or more of what leptin does is done in the periphery in the body and what leptin does is the hormone that sort of is is secreted in response to how much fat you've accumulated and then does it stimulate the brain to tell you to eat more or less depending on how much fat or it also works in liver cells which were the cells that we're studying and the assumption is it probably doesn't all cells to tell your cells to burn fat so it makes perfect sense if there's fat available in the fat cells now you've got a signal telling sort of influencing the other cells of the body to burn fat so now you've got a hormone that could work in the periphery and the you know below their neck or it could work above the neck but you've got a community that's almost exclusively studying in the head they don't know there are human drivers down here so that's what they do so even in this world that I I don't I think I know the genome paper Stephane is probably referenced on a number of them but yeah Maru is it I I don't remember these so they had two papers because what you cited in the article you co-authored with reliable so I have two papers one is genes associated with obesity and one is genes associated with body type so with body type they're all below the neck they're all you know fat metabolism basically and musk you know the genes and aspects of your body that you would expect to be controlled like when you build up muscle and you have to take in excess energy to do it it makes you hungry I don't think your brain is regulating how much muscle you're building other than your drive to go to the gym basically your body is responding to the stress on the muscle all the things you do in the weightlifting it's all below the neck so the argument here is again simple when these people looked at body type it was insulin regulated genes for the most part growth hormone all these things when they looked at excess body fat they decided they were in the head but the question is when they looked they're programmed to think that excess body fat is caused by overeating so they look in the brain did they do the same kind and I was going to call the researcher involved I never got around to doing it saying if body type body shape is determined by these genes and doesn't it make sense that X has variations of body shape we're going to be determined by the same genes and did you do the same kind of searches I don't actually know how they determine where the genes work it's the same kind of searches they just came up with different sets of genes so they didn't start with any assumptions they were just finding though the questionnaire where the genes work so there's a common phenomenon all this like with leptin a gene that everybody thinks about working the hypothesis seems to work and every night can I respond to that okay I can cuz you say this in your head you say this in your go-ahead I'm prepared to respond whenever you're done okay in your book you say that genes work yeah the body is very basically it puts different mechanisms to work as many places they can and they're these homeostatic feedback loops you know something happens your whole body has to respond so a gene that might work primarily on one cell is scattered all over the body because every cell and it'll do different jobs on different cells but if you think that the problems in the brain that's where you look so you get this kind of intellectual phase-lock where that's what we do that's what we study and neurobiologist studies the brain daniel kahneman i Stefan likes the site Daniel Kahneman as well had this concept what you see is all he's a Nobel laureate cognitive psychologists what you see is all there is okay and basically if you're studying the brain that's what you look at if you're studying the guttin until we all get trapped into that on some extent and what I'm saying is even in these studies so Stefan and Stefan wrote a book about the hungry brain that is supposed to be about obesity but in fact you never mention anything about the metabolic regulation of fat accumulation it's just not there and I would argue it has to be there even if it's wrong if it's not there the absence of it like you can't talk about leptin without talking about what it might be doing in the body you can talk you know so there's a and it's put me in a very odd position so Stefan is kind of the defender of the Orthodox and I'm the one who comes along and says look you guys just you missed it you screwed up you had psychologists and psychiatrists running the field when the endocrinologist sobbed and then you discovered leptin and it became a molecular biology problem and you're now divorced from the very simplest observations about obesity you know so we can do huge genome-wide Association studies they sound remarkable but if I were to ask a simple question like why is it I get fat here yeah the love-handle thing it's in the back with me I know it's not in the front but it's here and not here I don't see what the brain has to yeah okay so as you mentioned there have been different genetic studies that have looked at body fat distribution versus total body fatness so total body fatness is what we're talking about when we're talking about obesity body fat distribution is what we're talking about when we're talking about the fat being on your hips versus on your wrists now what we see is different sets of genes that come up so body fat distribution we actually see insulin related genes so people that have a central body fat distribution so body fat around their waist tend to have these insulin related genes that are driving that but when you look at total body fatness the thing that causes obesity what you see is that those genes are dominated by the brain and the really cool thing out the point I want to make about the genetics research temperature is that it seems might be dominated by the brain if say look come on Gary it is unbiased that's the really cool thing about it is that they're just this is whatever genes are popping up these studies do not care about what you believe about what causes obesity this is just whatever genes are popping up so it's unbiased and that's what they're saying and I'm not done here Gary now I want to talk about you mentioned Gary that maybe leptin is having important actions not just in the brain but in the body first of all I'm glad I'm flattered that you read my book and I'm glad that you acknowledge the existence of leptin now this is good but now you say that researchers focus on leptin actions in the brain because we're phase-locked and we can't get out of our you know we're blinders of thinking about in terms of the brain and that that's why we focus on left in action in the brain the real reason we focus on left in action in the brain is because it has been demonstrated that its effect on body fatness are via the brain there are actual experiments demonstrating this and I'll explain how these experiments work this is all in the scientific literature so if you knock out the leptin receptor only in the brain or only in the hypothalamus you get obesity so that is what tells us that actually the brain is the key site of action and particularly the spell train it tells you Gary Gary Gary please let him talk you let you talk yeah and that's it so I mean you get the same obesity if you knock leptin out of the brain and particularly out of the hypothalamus that you get if you knock it out of the whole body so that shows that the brain is the site of action that is causing this to happen and this is no surprise we have these mechanisms worked out we know specific groups of neurons that are receiving the left and that are controlling our appetite that are controlling our metabolic rate we have many of these neural populations worked out in mice we understand these systems so well we can control specific popular tiny populations of neurons very precisely cause them to eat a ton to stop eating to gain fat to lose fat like the animals or marionettes I mean that's the level of understanding we have right now of how these systems work so I mean all of this evidence is converging on the same thing that the brain is central and that that cell metabolism I'm just not seeing the evidence for that I mean Gary if you want to cite specific evidence demonstrating that that is an actual cause of differences in body fatness between individuals and the general population I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy to sit here and listen to you cite the evidence that demonstrates that can cause her leptin is produced where yeah leptin is produced yeah let's talk about leptin a little bit it's produced in fat cells and it's produced in proportion to the size of fat tissue so the amount of body fat you have the more fat you have the more leptin you have in the circulation and basically what this is it's what's called a negative feedback loop which is a really simple engineering term that works like a thermostat so with your thermostat you if you set your thermostat to 70 if it starts getting a little bit of hotter your AC turns on to bring it back down this starts getting lower ac comes on or the heat comes on to bring it up that's called the negative feedback system it maintains the stability of the temperature of your house we have many negative feedback loops in the human body to regulate body temperature to regulate blood pressure to regulate all sorts of things one of the negative feedback loops we have regulates body fatness and the hormone so your thermostat measures temperature by using a thermostat sorry a thermometer your brain measures body fatness using this hormone leptin that's in the circulation and then particularly when your body fat level drops your leptin levels drop and your brain hears that and it kicks in a starvation response basically and this is the main reason why weight loss is so difficult because your brain is like no I don't want to be losing fat and it makes you hungrier it increases your yes is that a certain level of body fat as this so here's is just when you're losing body fat in general like even if you a large person that's overweight rekd when you're losing body fat in general your body exacerbate your hunger and this is this is the thing that's really important to understand about obesity is that people with obesity have a higher setpoint so it's like turning your thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your thermostats are regulating around 80 people with obesity they're not regulating around 170 anymore they're regulating around 250 and so when you cause a lean person to lose weight you see the same thing as when you cause a person with obesity to lose weight you see this reaction in their brain circuits that regulate body fatness that drives them to increase their cravings and their hunger so metabolic rate drops so it would be an evolutionary mechanism to force you to seek food correct and not just to force you to seek food that's the main thing but it also slows your metabolic rate does everything it can to get more energy in your body and have less leaving and it keeps doing that until the fat comes back tonight pause here yeah so when you're eating a sugary diet a high high calorie diet you will produce more fat your body will get fatter right umm it depends on how many calories you're okay if you're overeating yeah I'm consuming a lot of sugar a lot of carbohydrates your body will get fatter your body will produce more leptin correct so it comes from the diet yeah indirectly definite can I pause please so the leptin is produced not just in response to the size of the fat cell but in response actually glucose mediated uptake into the fat cell which is mediated in part by insulin so you come back to insulin even with the left and you raise blood sugar and that's the carbs you eat the carbs you raise Fletcher you raise insulin you raise fat storage the glucose and then you get more leptin again one of the things you have to understand about this is everything that says has two interpretations depending on which paradigm you're looking at and these are fundamentally different paradigms so in Stefan's world and again correct me if I'm wrong though leptin a signalling fuel availability in fat cells the way I would think of it and in my very small world leptin is responding to fuel availability in the rest of the cells so it's basically a molecule that can tell other cells that there's fat available and you could burn that fat for fuel and then you don't have to go eat or it can tell that there isn't fuel available and if depending on how much left and there is the cells and then that will respond by a signal to eat or not to dis inhibit eating behavior everything we're talking about with Stefan and I first sort of fell out I don't know eight years ago at ancestral health symposium when I acted improperly inappropriately but one of the problems I to the way I think you should think about this you have a hypothesis and this is the fundamental thing is it obesity caused by overeating because we know if you're getting fatter you're storing more calories in your expend that's just the you know it's like if a room is getting more crowded more people are entering them leaving that is the simplest but it doesn't tell you why the rooms getting crowded it doesn't tell you why you're getting fatter and again what I've been arguing is the why you're getting fatter part has been left out and people decided that overeating was somehow an explanation and then they went to the brain to look at why people might over so what I one of the questions I asked to find eight years ago and it keeps coming up is if we're gonna blame obesity on the modern food environment epidemics of obesity you know simple question to ask is can we find epidemics of obesity without this modern food environment I mean that's the sort of science 101 right and it turns out that the world is following the first one I found in the literature was in 1902 in a population of the Pima Native American tribe the Pima living in Arizona and observers saying these people are poor they're malnourished they're suffering through famines they've been suffering through a famine for 40 years in famines it's hard to overeat during a famine and yet the women of the tribe who do virtually all the work they were treated as pack animals in effect were obese so now we can disassociate obesity from the modern food environment and we could disassociate it from this ultra-processed foods we eat and start to ask the question what is it about can we find what might have driven obesity in that population despite the existence of famine so it's from very simple observation once we get into these kind of studies say this in human genome studies say that I actually rarely do that in my books because you can find studies that will say anything and you'll see in the studies people misinterpreting them what was the cause of the population of women to be obese well so one thing that happened during the faint beginning in the 1860s the Pima were put on the reserve while they moved on to Reza they were reservation eyes whatever the verb form would be and they began eating western foods and back then it was sugar flour and lard for the most part and sugary beverages probably so that's a reasonable hypothesis and you could find the same thing in the Sioux Native American Sioux population living on a reservation in 1928 where you had Oh both obese men and women living with malnourished stunted children who clear when getting enough dye but they were on a reservation they were getting Western foods so ultimately you know the question you asked in science determines the answer you get so the question I was asking is we have this observation that any population that transitions to Western diet or Western diet and lifestyle gets obese and diabetic they develop what's called metabolic syndrome which is insulin resistance and all these issues and we know that's true all over the world from the Inuit to the Pima to South Pacific Islanders to Africans to Europeans so the genetics aren't that important the question is what's triggering it in the environment and again Stefan would say well there's too much food available and it's too palatable and we can't say no and I have a lot of problems with that we can say no part because if we're lean it means they can't say no and they being the people with obesity and I don't believe that's true and then or is it some specific item or some so spin this these foods that travel with Western populations and so the exists the ability and today if you look up do a burden of obesity and malnutrition I have a Dropbox folder I could share with you that's probably 50 studies all over the world you see the same observation incredibly poor populations malnourished the children are stunted which means their protein deficient and their calorie deficient and often the mothers or the aunts or obese the obesity tends to run in the females would suggest it has a female sex hormone related a fact that I don't believe works in the brain because we're dealing with populations that could not have over eaten if they could have over eaten why are the kids starving that's sort of the question and you know this was the first thing that I think we fought about back then and it's still if you can find populations with obesity epidemics but without the modern food system without snack wells and without Lay's potato jims and if you know that they're going through a famine or you know that the kids at least aren't getting a food how do you explain obesity and the mothers without assuming that the mothers are overeat let's pause right there Stefan is there a population of people that are obese that are not eating a Western diet that are not eating sugary foods that are obese and that are not eating sugary foods probably not because generally once you have an industrialized food system that's going to include sugar but there are populations that eat a lot of sugar and are not obese and we should talk about some of these excellent let's talk about back to the yeah sure let's talk about the Pima first now Gary has told a story he's told his version of the Pima story let me tell the story the version of the story that appears in the scientific literature now the Pima originally they were agriculturalists they were eating traditionally a very high carbohydrate diet based on unrefined carbohydrates originally it was corn beans and squash primarily they were hunter-gatherers and agricultural they were primarily gary okay they were primarily eating agricultural foods they were also collecting some wild foods that's correct they were fishing and eating mesquite pods primarily agricultural and data are very clear on that Gary so yes they are look we have data I can't say things like that nothing because we're going to disagree let's move on you think they mostly fish that's incorrect okay according to the data that's I remember you saying that in your book something to that effect that's and agree but you've got my book anyway let's go on we don't better I'm gonna move on here now the Pima traditionally were agriculturalists and what happened basically is you had all these farmers moving into their area settlers of European descent and they diverted the water from their River the Gila or Gila River if you open up Gila and so they were no longer able to grow there drops their agricultural crops that they were primarily dependent on and therefore the government started providing them with foods to eat and these were calorie dense refined foods they were like Gary said flour lard and sugar and then they became very obese when out there was a population of Pima right across the border from them in Mexico also very similar culturally and all that that maintained their traditional high carbohydrate lifestyle an agricultural lifestyle and there have been studies comparing those two populations and the ones across the border with their traditional lifestyle are a lot leaner and healthier not surprisingly than the ones eating lard flour and sugar okay but Gary you seem to believe that people can gain weight you kept referring to famines and things you seem to believe that people can gain weight even if they are eating very few calories and you refer to this many times in your writing and you know these are very casual observations that you're making kind of these casual correlations and storytelling but if you actually look at the data on this what you see is that if you just measure calorie intake and people who have obesity it is 20 to 35 percent higher than people who are lean after correcting for height physical activity level and that I've got references right we're getting a little bit in seconds here let me give you an agrarian umber seven what can I pause you guys right here so these people they have essentially the same lineage one group lives in Mexico they they're not eating these sugary foods and this Western diet the ones that live in America are the ones that live in America are becoming obese the ones that live in Mexico or not is that correct correct yeah and so now if you have someone with obesity like I've said the most accurate measures that we have suggests that they habitually consume and expend more calories and now Gary's model says that that is downstream of the fattening effect it's not causing the fattening effect it is a result of the effect whereas my model says that that is actually required for the fattening effect to occur it is upstream so now what happened though what happens there what happens if you reduce their calorie intake by that same amount twenty to thirty five percent it doesn't matter if you do it by restricting carbs or fat these experiments have been done they lose weight when you restrict their calorie intake down to that this is the argument what you're saying that you keep consuming low amounts of calories but high amounts of sugar does it doesn't make sense you can get obese that way so you're saying it's a calorie yeah correct and that's reference number nine and ten to support what I just said and I want to talk about another one that right wait can we out on stage its but I the reason I was using the dual burden example is because we have to explain how those women were eating all those calories usually women again it's just often they was interrupting these studies were done by diabetes researchers that were studying diabetes in these populations and the men had high levels of diabetes and the women had high levels of obesity to give you an example where that measurement was done um in Trinidad in the nineteen sixties and again all I'm doing this is the role I played as I asked the question can you find populations that don't have a lot of food okay you could say that the obese expend a lot of energy and they eat a lot of calories the question is can they get obese without a lot of food and so can we find populations like us can you find a population that gets obese without sugar which was exactly the question to ask so in Trinidad in the 1960s as a malnutrition crisis the US government sends a team of researchers down to study this and the researchers come back and say yeah there's malnutrition there stunting there's deficiency diseases and two-thirds of the adult women are obese and this is a medical problem and the next year an MIT nutritionist goes down to do exactly what Stefan asks for and to actually measure the diets and obese women and lean women and to study it and this is a population whether it's it's unlike them this is a very poor Trinidad and population and reports that they I think it was 1800 calories a day what the obese woman reading was actually a little somewhat the lien people seem to be eating and that it was lower than what the Food and Agriculture Organization considered for a healthy diet so again what my role in this is to point out when you have populations like that I don't see how the overeating hypothesis tells me the brain is in control of how much they eat tells me anything about why the women were obese especially when their kids are starving this is the paradox of this doom burden and obese mother with a starving child if the obese mother has to eat superfluous calories to get fat why isn't you given those calories to her kids because you need him she clearly doesn't mean she's got fuel so what's going on there if you posit a hypothesis as I did which says that the obesity is triggered by the macro nutrient content of the diet then you can explain I mean there are plenty of animal models a famous quote I use in my books from Sean my year it was like the same leading Harvard nutritionist who studied an obese train of animals in the 50s he said my animals will get fat even when half starved they will make fat out of their food even when half starved these are generally animals with mutations in the leptin it doesn't whatever by the way whatever and the question is if Mike I can make fat out of my food at levels of the caloric levels that for instance a lean person can't then I'm going to get fat eating the same amount and that fat accumulation is going to be you know means I'm taking more calories and I expend but the point is I'm from some metabolic hormonal reason I'm taking the fuel I eat and turning it into fat and storing it in the fat tissue what is your responsibility yeah so my response is that if you want the best answers you have to use the best methods to answer it to answer the questions okay do you want a question answered properly you have to use accurate methods to answer that question now as you know Gary it's very difficult to measure food intake in free living individuals particularly you're traveling to a country you've never been to before it's very difficult to get accurate measures so just because some guy went to Trinidad and claimed a woman actually okay fine just because some woman went to Trinidad and claimed that people were eating 1800 calories and becoming obese does not mean that that's what actually happened now no no no no Gary I'm responding now we have studies where researchers used accurate measures to measure calorie intake in people who had obesity many of these people were saying we're only eating 1200 calories a day when they actually measured their calorie intake what they found was that they were consistently eating more calories than lean people so this this phenomenon that Gary describes is something that is only observed when inferior methods are used measure calories weight defent the reason I'm using these populations like I said I'm just giving you an observation obese mother with a starving child the dual burden of malnutrition obesity this isn't one observation it's not one nutritionist the existence of the starving children strongly suggests that there's not a lot of food available and we have to explain obesity in the model you know I would like you to respond okay fine I will respond to that now look I haven't looked at these studies in particular I brought them up eight years ago we got in the fight about eight years ago it ruined our you know it's like art we used to be biting on it so now look there are many reasons why a child could be malnourished in a non-industrial situation and this is I do a lot of work related to this what you see in non industrial situations you see a lot of infectious disease you see a lot of malnutrition so people not getting enough essential minerals and vitamins not getting enough protein and you see a lot of children who are just barely hanging on because of this collection of really bad stuff that's happening in their lives and set-asides things yeah yeah parasites malaria I don't know if there's malaria in Trinidad or not but I mean all diarrhea pneumonia these are the things that we all had before we had modern great sanitation and in a country like the United States 30% of kids didn't even make it past childhood and so there's a lot of things that could have caused that Gary it's not necessarily because you know it's not necessarily the reason that you attribute it to now I'm not attributing it to a reason I'm just ask okay well great well I I don't have the explanation but I'm throwing out possibilities that are alternative to the one that you're implying it's quite possible okay so now I so again when you use accurate measures of calorie intake you find that these people with magical metabolisms who have obesity and don't eat very much seem to not exist anymore and furthermore I want to I want to get to another type of study that's really going to differentiate between this metabolic effect driven by insulin and the effect of calories so we have a lot of studies that compared diets in which calories were the same but carbohydrate and fat intake differed and the ones that I really want to focus on right now that I think are key here are the studies where they increased calorie intake so they fed people they they one study in particular and see I'm gonna give you a number here see if I can give you a number here sorry while you look at that um can we bring up another issue because what we're talking about ultimately is why people get fat okay I don't I don't want to divert here I'm in the middle of something so um now if we want to understand why people get fat we can look at studies that overfed people on fat or carbohydrates exclusively so this one study the first one that I want to talk about first they figured out people's baseline calorie intake figure out how many calories they needed just to maintain and then they increase that by 50% by exclusively giving them fat or exclusively giving them carbohydrate okay I thought it was so this is Horton okay um yeah so number 16 number 16 so now if Gary's hypothesis is correct these people should have gained body fat on the carbohydrate overfeeding but not the fat overfeeding because that increases your insulin has these effects on your fat cells etc okay now these were very rigorous studies I want to emphasize that and I pause here did they monitor the the actual calories they got correct yes they were they were they had a baseline they use prisoners and they per month state prison no that's incorrect different study so they had a baseline and did they require them to maintain the same diet and then add additional fat or additional carbohydrates yes and then they just bump it up with fat way way up with carbohydrate Horten there wasn't Sims it was Ethan Sims what's the money that was which study did you do that was not prisoners what was the he didn't have a metabolic you know what let me just finish describing this study not Gary that's an irrelevant detail okay it what's relevant is that you just didn't implied that I don't know we're talking a parry alright you know what I don't actually know maybe it was in prisoners thank you all right you're welcome now but it was not the Sims overfeeding study that was done in prisoners that's what I know okay okay so and what's a reference yeah it's on my website you can go to my website stefan Guillen a calm and it's reference number sixteen and they're both there okay so this was what's called a metabolic Ward study where these people were in a research facility where the researchers could monitor and control every morsel of food so there was no cheating no inaccuracy and they were measuring changes in body fatness using a gold standard method called underwater weighing okay and so what they found was that at the end of a two-week period of over feeding the carb and the fat groups gained the exact same amount of body fat exact same amount of body fat there was another second study that did the same thing and found the same result independent lab group very similar experiment three week long instead of two weeks they found the exact same thing same amount of fat gain different insulin responses different amounts of carbohydrates that exact same amount of fat gain so this demonstrates that insulin is not and carbs are not what controls what gets fat into fat tissue calorie intake is what controls that so let me explain again remember I talked about everything the paradigm you work and determines the question you ask and this experiment is a classic example because they assume that people get fat by overfeeding so then they say if we over feed them we're just doing what happens naturally everything about the experiment is based on the assumption that they're supposed to be testing which is can people get fat by overfeeding and so that from the very conception of the experiment they've built in the paradigm that we want to test the hypothesis on top of it if it's a typical Simmons experiment I actually wasn't familiar with this one Oh was a it wasn't Simms was a James O and JC Peter James Hill was funded for the from about 1998 to about 2008 by Procter & Gamble because he was in olestra shil I hate to say that Jim I apologize but I think it's a fair assessment and then when he stopped being funded by Procter & Gamble he was funded by the sugar industries and JC Peters was the head of the Procter & Gamble olestra olestra which is now something that no one needs yeah Lester was a fat substitute and the problem was he got like run out like that but the whole idea of olestra was to replace fat in the diet so every study Helen Peters did implicated dietary fat as a cause of obesity I don't think we could ever use I hate to say and I mean typically I I don't think funding influences results but I wouldn't use in James Hill study to make that point that because you think it's a bio study that was in everything hell everything Helen Peters did can anyone knows I mean I talked about this in good calories bad calories when they reported their results actually I did a FOIA on James Hill cuz he works for the University of Colorado so you could actually and I got all his documents back and forth between him and a lesser I'd be happy to share them with you if you'd like there Rabelais timing him and Procter & Gamble but he basically held Procter and Gamble for ransom he would get a $500,000 unrestricted gift and then he would do a study and then he would ask and it would conclude that fat is bad and carbs are good and therefore olestra is a viable product then he would ask for Procter and Gamble for more money before he then published study so it's a particularly egregious example of someone who's I suspect it was just his belief system he believed dietary fat was bad fat causes obesity olestra is a good thing because you eat that instead of fat you don't absorb it and in every study he did confirm that the point that we keep getting away from that I haven't had an opportunity to and Stefan knows as well as I do if you're gaining say four pounds a year of fat let's say between 20 and 40 you've put on 40 extra pounds so now you're obese or nice lean healthy young guy in 20 like many of us wore and by the time you're 40 you've got 40 pounds of excess fat that's the equivalent of putting in about the 10 calories as head storing about 10 calories a day into your fat tissue that you don't burn a metabolize so you eat say 2700 calories a day half carbs you know 35% fat 15% protein and 10 calories that they get trapped in your fat tissue less than a bites worth of food less than a sips worth of beer so the question are actually trying to ask is or answer and this is again just my approach is a curious journalists do with a science background this how do we explain those 10 calories because when we talk about those obese women with starving children all those obese woman were doing was storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending on how quickly they became obese and those populations that tends to happen quickly in their 20s so we're asking this question how do we if you've got a situation where we have to end up with 10 calories stuck in the fat cells every day that's a 20 34 a billion fat cells so it's divided up very small and is the brain somehow regulating that or again is there dis regulation in the body involving pick your hormones pick your enzymes when knowing that somehow traps fat in the fat cells or prevents the fat from being used for fuel when it's released from the fat cells and so if you think about it that way like you let yourself go to seed today Joe Rogan decides I'm done I'm gonna do nothing but drink beer and you might start drinking five beers a day and over the course of 10 years you get 20 pounds and it's all here that 20 pounds over the course of 10 years it's still only about 20 calories you might have added 800 calories of beer to your diet and stored 20 calories as fat how does that happen and why does it go here and not elsewhere and as Stefan said this is insulin dependent fat tissue so those are that's when we're talking about this like this question could somebody get fat during a famine or can they stay fat during a famine all they have to do is hold on to ten calories a day extra if they're only eating 1210 gets stuck in their fat cells 1190 is excreted or expended it's not that hard to imagine and there's nothing in the laws of physics that says it so what could be dysregulated about their fat cells even during a relative famine not a complete famine but a relative famine that might be and again animal experiments of which there are probably hundreds by now different animal models you can disassociate obesity from hype from eating too much in the animal can I pause you for a second so essentially you're saying that even if someone is taking in a a good amount of calories a smart amount of calories 2,000 calories a day if you're taking in these calories in the form of sugar your body is going to take a certain percentage of them even if you're getting enough food and stored as fat whereas if you were taking in too protein and vegetables and things along those lines your body would not do that well so this is a gets to the mechanism yes and and the evidence question but you're saying that right so you're saying that if two people are on the same diet one of us on two thousand calories of chicken and fish and vegetables and the other one is on two thousand calories of milkshakes and you know sugary drinks and pasta and bullshit that that person is going to gain a certain amount of calories and just put them to fat right regardless that's yeah that's I've seen a city this being a science that hypothesis can be tested yes and there's Stefan thinks it's been tested I think it's they've done a bad job of testing it and we will both tend to reject the studies that we don't like when we define don't like by whether or not they got the answer we think it's your perspective that this is not the case your perspective is that like as you were saying in this study with a closely monitored these people's diets and they added an additional fat and an additional carbohydrates that they both gained the same additional amount of work that's right I mean if this is correct you have to see different levels of fat gain I mean Gary short-term studies yeah it was short term wasn't two in three weeks that's very short yeah it is very short term but still bonus yeah he says that insulin is the thing that gets fat in fat cells and that I mean you would see some kind of difference that insulin made any difference it should have seen some kind of effect right some kind of difference in fact games well actually um I don't want to start taking out charts but this gets into insulin dynamics that was worked out so over a hey I promised I wasn't gonna say oh boy boy on the show but it's my thanks to my Brooklyn born mother it's my program then um and they the same is true a lot of these overfeeding experiments do the same thing so when they talk about overfeeding they they they literally over feed so they kind do reasonable way of figuring out which reading is Stefan said they measure they calculated how much energy they needed to stay in energy and balance and again right there that's a problem because one of the hypotheses says that the energy balance is dependent on the macro nutrient content of the food so you're going to get a different different level depending on what the macronutrient content is and then a different level of what what's necessary for energy balance so the classic example is a study that's my not-for-profit funded that's been very controversial where they got their subjects this is David Ludwig and Cara Ebeling and they're their colleagues at Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital and they did this study in Framingham and they they basically got subjects to lose ten or twelve percent of their body weight and then they randomized them to three different diets of three different macronutrient compositions and they basically calculated their energy expenditure on the three different diets which is kind of exactly what we're talking about because if you want to be an energy balance you know you feed people exactly what they're expending and in that study which was published a year ago and they saw different levels of energy expenditure depending on the carbohydrate content of the diet so the higher level of carbohydrates this is trying to keep them at energy balance the the higher the carbohydrate the lower the energy expenditure the lower the carbohydrate the higher the energy expenditure so again it's just whether or not they did the study right who knows science is a compilation of a lot of studies and we're trying to you know address exactly this point but merely building that into the experiment we know what their energy expenditure should be and then the point is when you increase and par again part of the trick of doing science is to say look we have competing hypotheses multiple hypotheses and it's vitally important that you always keep the multiple hypotheses in mind when you're interpreting this study so one hypothesis says it's how much they eat and another hypothesis says it's what they eat and that what they eat is is moderated primarily through insulin and when you do these experiments like the experiment that that Stephen is talking about Stefan um I'm completely confused if you over feed them you start out with a 50% carb diet now you overfeed them if there's a threshold effect on insulin which it turns out there is then you're just moving them and when you look at insulin dynamics when insulin is below a very low point that fat cells will mobilize fat and the lean tissue will burn it for fuel above that point you get pretty much flat so if you start people who are eating 1,500 calories for carbs and you add them bump them up to 2500 calories from carbs you're still in the plateau beside of the insulin you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any difference mm-hmm the only way you expect to see a difference and this way it helps to really interrogate both hypotheses so that you know when you're doing the experiment whether or not you're actually testing something you one hypothesis you want to set up the experiments that the hypothesis predicts the two hypotheses predicts something entirely different this experiment with arguably the two hypotheses predict the same thing you'll get fat gained because insulin is elevated regardless and when insulin is elevated you're gonna get fat gain the question comes back to of this again always if I'd want to keep this in mind we want to what could possibly cause a 10 or 20 calorie access that causes fat stored I have a friend that was four to four hundred pounds when he was 18 it was a tall kid about six foot five he was a say 200 pounds overweight 200 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred excess calories over 18 years stored in your fat cells that's you know even if you assume that you have to consume 300 calories to have 100 excess stored in your fat cells that's you know one to coca-cola's a day that he was drinking or 1/2 a quarter pound or a day that he was eating that his lean friends weren't and the question would be why can't he just stop doing that again Stefan would say cuz his brain won't let him and I would say because his insulin is elevated doesn't matter whether he stops it or not the underlying mechanism okay alright so now again it's easy to tell stories it's not easy to tell stories that are supported by scientific evidence now I want to bring people's attention to reference number eleven on my site there have been 29 studies now that have measured differences in energy expenditure metabolically a panel study meta-analysis correct there have been 29 studies to date that have measured calorie expenditure metabolic rate on diets differing in carbohydrate and fat content and when you put all those studies together when you are at least the first 28 together and you look at what the overall literature says it makes almost no difference to metabolic rate whether people are eating carbohydrate or fat and in fact this very small difference that it does make actually favors high carbohydrate diets so you get a slightly higher metabolic rate when the diet is predominantly carbohydrate now this study that gary cited is the one study out of these 29 that has reported a larger effect than any others of carbohydrate restriction on energy expenditure so this study reported an effect bigger than any of these other 28 and while difference we want Gary please thank you and and interestingly if you actually look at the data and these data have been realized by a researcher named Kevin Hall and if you look at the data you find that some of the participants some of the data that represents some of these participants are literally physically impossible they break the first law of thermodynamics this is the conservation of energy Gary knows about this he has a physics background and they literally don't add up and when you start subtracting the clearly erroneous data from the pool of subjects this big effect size starts to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink until after you've gotten rid of all of it this study does no long no longer reports a higher energy expenditure on a very low carbohydrate diet and it's consistent with the previous 28 studies that were done so that's my perspective on that but I want to go back to this way there's no known about there you saw her a long time and I'm gonna talk for as long as I want now I want to I want to talk about human energy metabolism and this idea of the ten extra calories a day Gary I I really continue to get the feeling that you do not understand human energetics because that's not how it works but now I'm just saying ten calories stored in the fat tissue chain can automatic 10 calories say anything about and what you have to eat I'm not done okay no but you're insulting Gary you got to stop doing that dude you're acting like you think I'm an idiot all right are you done now are you done can we be clear that we're talking about you done now can I just finish this no you can shout Gary's fine you can respond write down notes on what you want to respond to and after he's done you can yeah but we're gonna get on this thing that's not the point yeah thank you okay now what you see there's basically two things you need to pay attention to here in terms of energetics one is the imbalance between intake and expenditure and that is very small so it only takes a little bit of extra calories to cause somebody to start gaining fat however as they gain fat their bodies get bigger they're gaining fat and lean mass people with obesity have more fat more lean mass and their calorie needs go up and up and up and up the larger their bodies get and so even though the imbalance between energy and taking expenditure is small their calorie needs end up being quite a bit higher can I pause for a sec yeah so you're saying that someone just gaining calories eating additional calories their body gains lean mass as well that's as fast as the brain regulate the I didn't say it regular so fascinating but how does the three muscle muscle through gaining muscle to some of its muscles some of its okay as they're carrying around this extra weight and so the extra calories and then on top of that carrying around the extra weight forces their body to grow larger presumably I'm actually not sure what the mechanism is but it doesn't have nothing to do with the brain that's a coincidence I don't know what it causes it that's what I'm saying Gary okay now so so but the point is by the time the person has obesity they are consuming twenty to thirty five percent more calories than they were when they were lean so that's not just a one or two cokes a day that is allowing them to remain obese they are consuming twenty to thirty five percent more calories that is what the most accurate studies are saying and so it's not just ten extra calories or maybe just one or two cokes we're talking about a substantial amount of extra calories and it's not a generalization because we don't know I mean what's the ratio of how much fat people get how much weight people are gaining everybody gains a different amount of weight like you're saying they're eating twenty to thirty percent more calories like who is like how many people get fat they get 20 pounds overweight people get fat they get a hundred pounds overweight they mean yeah that's right yeah and that's why I give a range because what you see is that people who are overweight so they're in the overweight range and just have some extra fat they eat about ten percent extra calories people who have a little bit of obesity eat about twenty percent extra calories people who have who are very have very very great obesity eat more like 35 percent so it tracks with the amount I'm sorry is it possible what he was saying that if you do consume 10 extra calories over long periods of time that will accumulate no it's not extra calories you're accumulating than 10 hours that said like Kent a dime is going it is saying so how much do you have to deposit is credit on right it is correct that if every day you eat 10 calories more than what you need then yes or your body so your body stores yeah we'll say that that's coring 10 percent 10 10 extra calories over top of what you need but the thing is that as you get bigger what you need goes up and up and up because you're carrying around more correct and so it's ten percent in ten extra Cal it's re not percent it's ten extra calories on top of the elevated amount that you're already eating so you end up with these big differences in calories to take so that's how that's how it really works but I want to talk about some interesting observations because Gary you like to talk about you know what's going on in different dietary trends and different cultures and I find that pretty interesting too I want to talk about the fact that sugar intake in the United States has been declining for the last 20 years so it peaked in 1999 and it is currently depending on which source of evidence you believe 15 to 23 percent lower than it was in 1999 this has been corroborated by a number of different sources of evidence this number 17 on my blog and of course we know that obesity has increased diabetes has increased substantially over the last 20 years in the percentage of the population or our members percentage yeah and in UK sugar intake has been declining for 50 years I don't believe that okay well you can argue with the data there number 17 on my blog there about 22 percent lower and this is what we see across a number of different industrialized countries you see a stagnation or decline in sugar intake in recent decades as obesity rates are continuing to increase and of course that 50-year period that covers the decline in the UK covers the entire UK obesity and diabetes epidemics but there's another one I want to talk about that and I respond to that yeah we should probably Stefan actually I'll let you respond for me because we had this debate with the Cato foundation to you know my art counter argument you want to give it yeah sure absolutely I mean are you sure you want to let me give it though I might correct it okay all right so your counter-argument is that the amount of sugar that we consumed 20 years ago or even maybe 50 years ago maybe continuing to fatten us today and it's about the sugar that we used to eat 20 or 50 years ago and not necessarily about the sugar we eat today well it's not exactly right okay I guess so the argument I made was because he brought this up and we've had to do a written debate on the Cato Foundation website and it's interesting if you think about use tobacco as an example so tobacco smoking per capita smoking in America peaked in 1965 right after the Surgeon General's report and it took 30 years before lung cancer rates turned over okay and I think we both agree that cigarettes were a major cause of lung cancer smoking so what you basically have is a system in which if there are any there's the assumption that Stephan is making when he quotes this kind of data is that the relationship between sugar and obesity is linear so as sugar goes up obesity and diabetes goes up and if sugar turns over they don't so here's the thought experiment they used in Cato which is 1965 were smoking per capita about 20 cigarettes a day as it starts to come down imagine we only cut that to 17 cigarettes or 16 cigarettes a 20% reduction in smoking would you expect to see a reduction in the lung cancer rates again this is the point I made about what you would expect to see rather than you think simplistic metaphors so the question is would you like Joe we go from 20 to 16 do you expect to see the lung cancer rates turn over no no and in sugar we see them drop no you might the derivative might drop you might expect it to slow a tiny bit still use it there's a but weird comparison because one of them is poison the other one's food right well but in this case the food the question is how toxic is the food so in sugar we have a variety and sugar what happened is the equivalent of going from 20 cigarettes to 16 beginning in 1999 and Stefan is saying I would expect to see an immediate change in obese and in fact if you actually look at the Ray the the rate of increase the prevalence appeared to plateau around six or seven years later who knows whether that's relevant but to get a small decrease in sugar 24 even if it's 20 percent that's 20 to 16 cigarettes and I'm saying the other factor that I talked about my book and Stefan knows this is you very clearly have maternal transmission of the propensity to obesity and diabetes so there's a generational effect this is and this is studies that were done in the same on the same Pima the same Native American tribe or each generation if gets more and more susceptible to whatever it is in the diet that's triggering and obesity and diabetes so that's been happening in the United States and around the world you've got a generational effect that could last far longer or might even keep going indefinitely even if the sugar levels drop so you have the sugar quit kicking off the obesity epidemic and yeah and stephon's about to say this is a story and it is a story but it's clearly the case that mothers who are obese during pregnancy or diabetic or just stationary diabetic they become diabetic during pregnancy or they have metabolic syndrome they're just insulin resistant or they gain a lot of weight and pregnancy will give birth to children who are at higher risk of becoming an obese and diabetic when they get older and in younger ages and those children will pass it on so again we have you know I would be nice I would love it if sugar consumption came down and with it obesity and diabetes plummeted but it's not in any way a refutation of this hypothesis which I just want to state what it is because people get confused about and we never got to it there's sugar hypothesis is a little different than what we've been talking about and it's pretty simple we have obesity and diabetes epidemics worldwide as we talk to it doesn't matter the genetics of the population you add something about a Western diet to those populations Western diet and lifestyle you get these explosions epidemics of obesity and diabetes and what I'm hypothesize in this book is that sugar is something that has to be added maybe it's sugary beverages for all I know maybe or it could be you know a more complex hypothesis a single possible one is you add sugar to any populations diet insufficient whether it's Southeast Asians living on rice or the Inuit living on reindeer and whatever or the Native Americans of the Great Plains or you know Caucasians living in the Upper East Side Manhattan add enough sugar and eventually through the metabolic effects of the sugar and the generational effects you will get explosions of obesity and diabetes and metabolic Stephanie want to respond to that sure I mean Gary you called it man it's always possible to tell a story to salvage your hypothesis but that doesn't necessarily make the story correct I mean I can come up with a story that cosmic rays cause obesity by hitting my fat cells and making them fat you can't disprove that nobody here can disprove that but there's no an experiment to protect you father we don't have the data right now you don't have data supporting your hypothesis no we do you just dismiss no no no no well can I get back to the Novotel stammers let's let him respond them on the Kevan Hall later yeah so what do you think about what he's saying about sugar and increased rates of diabetes and that this is the cause yeah I mean so let me put it this way we don't have any evidence supporting what he just said so that is a story that is not supported by evidence now does it does that mean that it's definitely incorrect no I cannot say that that's definitely incorrect same way I can't say it's definitely incorrect that cosmic rays cause obesity but you know I'm gonna I'm gonna use a Christopher Hitchens quote here that which is asserted without evidence does not require evidence to refute and that's the way I feel about this particular story but you know there are cultures that consume large amounts of sugar and do not develop obesity we've talked about yeah we're going to talk about it again right now so this is reference number 21 on my blog I'm going to talk about three different cultures one of which we have not talked about Gary the first one is the hodza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania this is a really interesting non industrial culture they as part of their hunter-gatherer diet eat a lot of honey honey is a very common food among hunter-gatherers living similarly to how our ancestors used to live and if you measure their year-round honey intake it's about 15% of their calories so this is a major calorie source for them that's about as much sugar as as the average American eats and they eat fruit sugar on top of this they eat a lot of fruit on top of that and so they're eating quite a bit of sugar and the hodza men have about 12% body fat women have about 18 so they correspond pretty closely to our Western ideals but isn't that high 400 gatherers no not really I mean that's higher than me hanging around bland ask you this how have you had your body fatness measured well had it measured a bunch of ways electricity I've had this machine where you hold on to these things you stand on this platform okay so in physician's office of okay so with calipers the most okay so all the methods that you measure that you mentioned are not gold standard methods so the gold standard methods are underwater weighing and the underwater weighing these people on this island actually I'm not sure I'm not sure how that they bring that equipment to this island correct but okay look um I can tell you that you can look up photos I don't remember how they how they measured their body fat but you can look I am 12% as measured by DEXA so I'll just tell you that okay so you can get a sense of what 12% is by DEXA which is a gold standard method so you can look at photos of these people they're very fit they're lean they're not like ripped you know they're not Arnold Schwarzenegger in peak form but they are no I understand that but that seems to correlate with a higher consumption of sugar that they seem to have a higher percentage of body fat than the average hunter-gatherer now look at a lot of that average hunter-gatherers like a friend does a lot of work with the pygmies in the Congo and they're very lean okay so these backs and that's the second culture I was gonna cite that you know kind of honey do that yeah them if they're the same ones some abuti pygmies of the congo they eat up to eighty percent of their calories can come from honey during the rainy season so they also eat a lot of honey and Arlene not just leave the year correct yeah for them it's part of the year the hodza eat it more consistently and the hodza have low levels of body fat their cardiovascular risk markers are excellent they don't have diabetes same for but this is absolutely not like a controlled study in the consumption not I absolutely agree with you and that's exactly the point I'm trying to make is that when you have a culture that is eating a lot of sugar but everything else is in place they're doing everything else right the sugar is not enough to make them fat it's not single-handedly enough I'm not saying it doesn't contribute I think sugar does contribute just to be very clear I think sugar does contribute to obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular disease but it's not single-handedly responsible as gary has argued so the third culture is pretty interesting the Kuna of Panama and the reason they're interesting is that they actually aren't eating honey they're actually eating white sugar so they're a culture that they live primarily a non industrial lifestyle they're farmers and hunter-gatherers and they but they do a little bit of trade and one of the things they trade for is sugar and they eat sugar sweetened foods as well so like doughnuts and pastries and they drink soda and kool-aid what what is their lifestyle in terms of like what do they have a natural lifestyle they are hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers so they're you know living a physically active natural lifestyle so this is the problem in comparison with any westernized civilization that you you you burn off so many more cowards like 100 cent agree with you and I think that is exactly the point I'm trying to make is that it's more complicated than just sugar and more complicated than just sugar but with a normal lifestyle it may not be this is you know I think the consumption is the thing about burning of the calories is also the the glucose demands the glycogen demands on the muscle your your not just existing like the web one of the problems with Western lifestyle is that many people are just existing there sitting in a chair they're walking to a desk they're sitting in their car they're not doing anything to burn any of this shit off so even if you have like if you get a baseline of a minimal amount of calories that you require for the day I think what Gary's getting at is that if you if you have this lifestyle the lifestyle that many of us have and then with that lifestyle consume sugar that you're going to get fat I don't think you can compare that to athletes and in that respect I don't think you can compare that to hunter-gatherers because you're requiring there's a much more significant load on your body you like when I did this sober October fitness challenge with my friends during October and we I was working out four hours a day and I was fucking eating everything that moved I was drinking soda I never drink soda yeah I was eating cookies I didn't gain any weight other than muscle I didn't get any fat at all yeah and I was eating a terrible fucking daya but I was going crazy when you're trying to stay alive and you're running around plowing and growing foods and hunting and gathering and fishing you're burning off insane amounts of calories just the hiking that's required the amount of exercise it's required it's off the charts in comparison to standard Western lifestyle we are on the same wavelength here I mean I completely agree with you that it is more complicated than just sugar yeah and but if you read what Gary is written and please correct me if I'm wrong here Gary argues that sugar is the primary cause of obesity and that physical activity does not matter calorie intake does not matter do you think that physical activity doesn't matter and I think it's a no I don't think it makes a lot of difference for fat when we're talking about the cause of P City I don't believe obese people get obese because they're sitting but let me tell put it this way so if you take someone who's an elite athlete and they start consuming a lot of sugar but they they ramp up their exercise accordingly like say if someone does what I did during the sober October they're working out three four hours a day every day do you don't think that they have higher sugar demands and that their body would just burn that off no absolutely I think that if there's a real benefit to exercise it's burning off the carbohydrates you consume then and you need less insulin to do it can I respond to the Kuna get back to them for a second okay I mean one of the the issues I have was Stefan as he writes off my stories is stories which they are all science begins as stories on hypotheses and then what you do is go look for the evidence and then he quotes studies and refers to it as evidence as though this is somehow by calling it evidence that may and then we had this discussion a year and a half ago and you didn't disagree with me at the time and it had no influence I'm just going to read from the email I wrote emails it's gotten to that point in the conversation because it's I'm not only going to read from the email if I have time I'm going to read from your book read the Kuna the study you cited is interesting okay so this was a study that professed to measure sugar intake of this population on an island Lagaan D and compared to the population in Veracruz where they they had emigrated and I say but they're added sugar intake on ala Gandhi according to figure one is 25 teaspoons per week plus the equivalent of 24 ounces of sodas at 78 grams if it's Coke 32 ounces of kool-aid that's 96 grams said I'm leaving out the cup of a sugar cane because I don't know what that is meant but or how they assess it one way the other it's not processed sugar so it's roughly 274 grams of sugar per week or about 32 pounds per year now that alone is very low intake and we don't know how it changed over the years so we have no idea if it's increasing recently or been low for years so you just use the Kuhn as an example of a population he's a lot of sugar and stated it dogmatically but a lot of sugar is 32 pounds a year and then I said wait hold on and I thought you did that's what I heard if we believe this study the Kuna and Veracruz are consuming roughly the same amount but I'm not sure I believe this study when it comes to the Veracruz population do you really think these urbanized Kune are consuming only 3/8 ounce sodas per week so the implication was this population of Caribbean Islanders immigrates to Veracruz they move into the city and they consume more sugar back where they used to live because they trade for it then when they get into the city so five glasses of kool-aid no candy no icecream nothing I'd like to know more about the urban Kuna before I accept such an analysis is valid on top of this as they say the analysis is done mostly of women because quote the women were available to study because they were at home during the day unquote so what were the men consuming and what were the children consuming when they weren't at home and was there something magical about this freak food frequency questionnaire and these researchers that they captured it accurately so this is what science is you have studies you have evidence and the question always is you've got competing hypothesis does evidence really speak to the hypothesis and I'm one of my issues with Steven it's what provoked are our initial discord is that he's constantly citing studies that don't actually either they only speak to one hypothesis like the overfeeding study or they're poorly constructed and poorly done so even this hosta example with the honey is something we discussed an email very kindly and we went back and forth and I said I don't actually think it's a refutation because the hypothesis I'm defending here the case against sugar is you add sugar to any populations native diet and you get epidemics of obesity and diabetes so here's a population that's been eating honey for maybe thousands of years in fact when they emigrated to this area they may have added honey to their diet and had obesity and diabetes then and Steven point Zelman bulk obesity and diabetes in a hunter gathers population is a death sentence for the child and for the mother who gives birth so you're going to very quickly weed out anyone so again it just comes back to this question of does this this is it a refutation the hypothesis that I found a hunter-gatherer population that eats a lot of honey and is in fat and the answer is I don't think so Stephen thinks it does you could flip a coin all of this can be settled with experiments one of the experiments we did at new city so one of the the metabolic problems that goes along with obesity and diabetes is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's endemic it used to be 20 years ago if you had alcoholic fatty if you had fatty liver disease the doctor would and you told the doctor you didn't smoke that would assume you were lying now it's so common and so common in children and particularly common in Hispanic children that it's clear it's not caused by alcohol and the question is what causes it because if you could create a fatty liver with a macronutrient you could probably create insulin resistance as well and then this whole slew of disorders including obesity and diabetes so my not-for-profit funded a pilot study where we just took 40 kids by the researchers at UC San Diego and Emory University in Atlanta took 40 kids who had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and we randomized them into two groups in one group we gave them the entire family all the food they needed so they could over eat to their heart's extent but no added sugars in their diet no sugary beverages and this study was published in JAMA four months ago and it's just it get rid of the sugar in the diet the fatty liver disease resolves you know it was pretty simple I could they tells you nothing about mechanism the kids lost a little bit of weight maybe it was a weight loss the conventional wisdom would be they just ate less which I wouldn't be at all surprised because they probably didn't like the food as much without sugar in it but these are the kinds of ways you could test these hypotheses and problems I have with like the meta-analysis getting back to Kevin and Hall there's two ways you could do science you could say let's look at all the junk that was done for 30 40 50 years let's find everything we can that even vaguely speaks to the experiment and ignore any quality of the study so if it may be asked it asks this question like we want to know what happens when people do this but in doing this we switch their you know fat intake around fat and carbon take around and then we can throw all that garbage into a meta-analysis and the one thing I'm pretty confident is they did a poor job because of one study I looked up the one with the biggest effect they mistook kilojoules for kilocalories so they reported that 400 kilocalorie decrease in energy expenditure on the low-fat diet when was a 400 kilojoules which is what's that factor you know these numbers twenty point one years yeah several of the other studies where Jim Hill studies we've talked about Jim how the biggest studies were Jim Hill and the way we approach it the not-for-profits say you've got to understand what the question is and you've got to design an experiment to get the right answer so when Stephan dismiss this Harvard three names form now what's that fence to follow dr. gaya nickname Stefan it's really easy dude I just don't good names um my name is Joe hi Gary dad I know hi Joe the Stefan ultimately rejected this study it's about a twelve million dollar study that was done at Harvard based on Kevin hall so these are two names it's about three people out there who are convinced that everything people like me are saying is wrong or not everything but most of it and they keep coming up over and over again and they were so Kevan Hall claims that he has refuted the carbohydrate insulin model in his studies so when a study comes out supporting it he works to find out why that study's wrong we all did the same thing I did the same thing right here with the kunais study explaining why I don't find a meaningful but anyway that's the thing if the goal was to do the right study because ultimately you got to remember what's on the line here we have obesity and diabetes epidemics I mean tragic shit is going on out there I mean people you know these are ruining lives there are overwhelming the health care system and that the argument I made is that for the past 50 years basically people have thought a lot like Stefan is thinking now dr. GNA and that there appears to be another story that could be true and what we have to do is find out if it is true because people are dying out there stuff ok the first thing I want to say is that this alternative explanation that Gary is talking about has already been investigated intensively including studies that were funded by his own organization new C two out of the three studies that have been published on that were clear reputations of hypotheses and ended here no no I know you've got a very is that the study Baraka Gary Gary I representing them according to your beliefs is not representing them correctly okay now I've noticed a remarkable correlation between studies undermining your beliefs and you thinking those studies are garbage and we should talk about Jim Hill and his studies a little bit because you know to me just saying this guy has a conflict of interest and then insinuating that that makes the study bad if you can't actually find a problem with the study itself these were very rigorous studies if you cannot point out I say cific the problem with the study it was designed with an assumption based on the assumption of a suppose it wasn't designed how Gary wanted it to be designed if you cannot find a problem with that study then you can't just dismiss it by making these insinuations that the person had a conflict of interests okay I know into the problem okay that's great Gary now I think that the drive all right you're gonna be able to respond in a moment now the Kuna I think we should really get back to this issue this non-industrial culture because the primary basis for Gary's book the case against sugar the primary observation that underlies gares belief on this is this observational correlational thing that cultures when sugar into these cultures they become fat and that is the common thread and in obesity and so what I'm doing is I'm pointing out a culture where sugar came in and it did not make them fat and that's one of three cultures I haven't even looked that hard okay these are just three cultures that I came across is probably a bunch more that are eating high levels of sugar but they're a tender look southern to our homies and I think pontius and again Joe explanation is right on point there's a lot of other things going on in these cultures and it's more complicated than just sugar that's exactly my point now I want to talk about the Cuban economic crisis this is reference number 22 from 1989 through 1995 the Cuban economy collapsed and the price of food went way up the price of gasoline went way up and so people started focusing on these really cheap foods Cuba was a major sugar producer at the time I don't know if they still are and so the intake of sugar went way up intake of refined carbohydrate went way up the diet became 77% carbohydrate primarily white rice and sugar 28% sugar of their total calorie intake so that's like double what Americans eat now their calorie intake went down and because of the lack of gasoline people got really physically active because they had to walk everywhere so now again if this is this is a situation where we can test Gary's hypothesis if gary is right and calories don't matter only refined carbohydrate and sugar matter obesity should have gone through the roof in this population over that period of time what you actually see is that the prevalence of obesity declined by half so there was a 50% decline it went from 14 percent to 7 percent over the period of this increase in sugar intake increase in refined carbohydrate intake and you might think well these people are just starving like crazy and that's why obesity rate went down well we actually have evidence on the rate of underweight as well and so we can check on that the rate of underweight increase only slightly went from 8% to 10% and so we know these people weren't just totally starving and what happened then was as the diet rebounded as the economy rebounded in the diet rebounded and their diet shifted away from these refined carbohydrates and sugar and back to the normal diet that was higher in fats and lower in carbohydrate lower in sugar the obesity rate went right back up as soon as they went back to their normal diet and so I find this because they were they were not walking as much yeah I was the exercise and also just their diet became richer again I mean if you're eating a diet that's a very poor diet eating like white rice and sugar I mean it it's not like if that's most of what if you're sitting there and on your plate is a white rice and sugar you're not going to be eating a ton of that and getting fat as opposed to eating a richer diet with more varied foods and so this is a case where you have an entire country testing Gary's hypothesis and finding that basically the opposite of what his hypothesis predicts Gary let's go with the when he was refuting the studies and you want this is a level of discourse I didn't really want to get into because that's a study that I'm gonna have to read he's right I'm gonna read it to try and figure out what the problem is I remember looking at that study and thinking there wasn't the kind of data you're citing maybe there's multiple studies put together but the one study I looked at the kind of data you're citing wasn't in there that this is again a preferences or on my website so have at it no I will but will be off the air by then on the beginning of his when he started talking there was referencing some studies and you had a problem with that well it did this whole it's a game people playing again it's why basically in my book I try not to get into he said she said studies because you never know how well they did I think we both agree that there's a reproducibility crisis in science and some huge proportion of the studies are just wrong whether they're experiments or observations people sometimes aren't very good at what they do and so anyone in either business you have to Steven likes to say I have no evidence nothin damn it but simultaneously people accuse me of writing a 600 page book with 150 pages of references that was too long to read so there's clearly evidence for this observation and this hypothesis my issue with Stefan is that he speaks as though he knows with this authority and so again I would like to just read a little bit from YouTube all because as I was prepping for this before you do that though he was referencing the human situation I don't know what the reality is before that when when he first started talking he was referencing things that you were stating that he was saying what were you saying that uh the you know the organization that supports him actually refugio that was yes no no the the new C studies yeah we're talking about the new situations the first two of which and we can get we can get into detail on this on how those refuted Gary's beliefs and I would say Gary is about the only person who thinks they did not refuse his beliefs the scientific community is pretty unanimous you can respond but but could you please say what was what would the study statement let me do it before he so the first study is a pilot study that depends what you look at to depend whether or not it refuted your belief so there again you have to understand this world there are researchers who believe one thing Kevin hall at NIH tends to believe that obesity is an energy balance problem and you people get fat because they eat too much I hope I'm doing Kevin justice and then there's David Ludwig and his colleagues at Harvard who tend to believe what I believe and we funded them both to do studies and Kevin hall study if you believe what Kevin were if you believe Kevin interpreted it correctly was not supportive of this model that carbohydrates are ultimately driving insulin and insulin is driving up that accumulation and then the David Ludwig study reported the opposite and david has criticized Kevin study and Kevin has criticized David's study and this is the nature of science this is what you do in science he do an experiment people critique it ideally you do another one kevin has decided well kevin is doing another one I think he's asking the wrong questions but I just saw the other day that he's doing another experiment today the the middle study was a free living diet study we're done by Christopher Gardner at Stanford University and the idea was original idea was 600 people randomized to either a very low carbohydrate diet or a very low-fat diet and then we funded it in part because we hoped that Christopher would be able to get people to almost a ketogenic diet on the low-carb side and Dean Ornish who promotes a low-fat diet always complained in the low-fat diet wasn't that enough so hopefully they'd be able to separate out these two at the end of the trial they got pretty lousy adherence low-carb was about 25 to 28 percent carb which is by no means a low main ingredient at our live pretty typical in free living studies and the low-fat was about equal what they did which it's funny we realize this on one side but not the other um they told the low-carb group not to eat sugars and refined grains which are by my hypothesis the most fattening carbohydrates and they also told the low fat group to not eat refined sugars and refined grains so they basically removed the most fattening parts of the diet from both arms of the study it's funny we knew that we're going to do with the low-carb group because you have to and my colleagues actually knew they were gonna do with a low fat group I didn't know that when I found out I was stunned because now you're testing two diets neither one of them have sugar or white bread so now you see similar weight loss with relatively poor compliance why would they do that that doesn't make any sense with the well their argument and wheat we talked to Chris for a lot of his argument he was afraid there are two things on he wanted to die to be healthy so a healthy in 2015 has become a diet that doesn't have sugar and white bread in it so he wasn't going to promote sugar and white bread to one diet or another um I take so long as the period of time with her studying these people they were on a there's host B on the diet for you okay that make sense them yeah so that's the question is again would you expect to see a difference I can send you an email I wrote to my new C colleagues in 2015 I could read it when I found out about this low-fat thing saying this is insane he's removed the they're both groups are carbohydrate restricted well so you could think of it as a low fat carbohydrate restricted diet and a high fat carbohydrate restricted dye and then he kind of got the same answer which could be for any reason whatsoever there's a paper I don't know if I can well I'm not gonna talk about it's bad enough talking about ambiguous studies that have been published without getting into unpublished research but so people see this the New York Times for instance did two stories on it one of them said it's not about calories it's about the quality the sugar and their fine grain because both groups restricted sugar and refined grains and lost weight the other and that was written by a reporter who tends to believe what we believe and the other article said it's all about the calories because both groups ended up on average eating 500 calories each at the end up from a scientific perspective being a poorly done study even though we funded it I'm not it's just it didn't answer the question you said 500 calories each five average straight their calorie and that's actually self-reported so it's not a so it's not particularly meaningful so again these are I don't like using it's complicated study because it's low in sugar well it's also free living yeah so both sides are low in sugar both sides are not eating processed they were two full differences in total carbohydrate intake okay so even though they were both not eating as much refined carbohydrate there were still two fold differences or greater over the period of that study in total carbohydrate intake if you believe the whole frequency questionnaires that you just said we don't know whether we you could be talking about vegetables you could be talking about fruits well these are healthy carbohydrates that they had primarily in this study can we now and we agree that that study can be interpreted from virtually any way you want it's better I don't agree with that now now what we will agree on I'll agree with you on this is that refined carbohydrates and sugar are the most fattening type of carbohydrate that we can agree on oh my god we came to an agreement no but the question is why is it because people eat so here's the thing if you if you believe Gary's hypothesis now any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels some do it more than others refined carbohydrates do it more any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels relative to fat okay and so if that is true and these groups and that matters for fat loss these groups had two full differences in carbohydrate intake even though it was predominantly healthy carbs you would have seen something you shouldn't have seen the exact same amount of weight loss in these two groups right right but they're not high in sugar resident your argument as always no that's the other part of the argument which is take away the sugar and that was the problem with one of the problems with the energy yeah the argument I make in and it's Stefan's completely right I'm defending my hypothesis okay I see a study that he does the same thing he did it here we all do it you see a study that disagrees with you you find the reason why didn't I believe it in every study ever done has plenty of reasons not to do and not to believe it that's why independent replication is something you always wanted get another group to do the study ideally a third group people come in they criticize the study then you do it again yes and again and again and so you know what I was trying when we even when we started the nutrition science initiative the choice that was a non-profit the choice of the word initiative was to get nutrition researchers to an effect stop using these garbage poorly designed studies to come to conclusions because they liked or disliked the interpretation but try to get them to think the way harder scientists would in developing studies that ask precisely the right question and then so even the pilot study that was interpreted is not supporting this hypothesis and again you could argue that for an hour and nobody's gonna care that study was not randomized so none randomized study you can't infer causality it's that's why it was a pilot study one of the many reasons it was a pilot study the people who think this carbohydrate model so when we talk about the carbohydrate insulin model means carbohydrates are fattening that's the basis of bread pasta potato and and sugar maybe the the thing that's necessary to add to the diet to make all these carbs fattening because sugar as we talked about this a year and a half ago the fructose molecule is metabolized in the liver it's linked to fat accumulation the liver which is linked to insulin like the way you're squeezing your stomach fat what we're talking about them I got a workout dude the board you know for these experiments be done right there they have to be tested right if you can't use Forks poorly designed experiments it poorly you know and every experiment ever done and so what we've tried to do is keep working towards better experiments there's now a new version of the Ludwig experiment being done that the Arnold Foundation loren john arnold funded to the tune of i think 13 million dollars and whatever that study finds Kevin Hall will probably find the reason look in it and find a reason to question and ideally they would be working together so that you've come up with the criticisms before you've spent 13 million dollars but this is how science works my job was to tell a good story as Stephan would say and I believe people who read the books can judge whether it's a good you know am i convincing in arguing that you add sugar they counter evidence to everything there wasn't counter evidence and wouldn't require a journalist to come along in 20 whatever it is 19 look to make these all right let me ask you this because this is something that you've admitted to something you said rather why are sugary carbohydrates the most fattening well if this hype offices is correct I think you would say that they they've trigger our food war there they are yeah wait wait let me just finish it I would say the counter-argument is that they create a hormonal milieu in the body that that over responds to insulin and insulin what we haven't said is if you look in a textbook for fat metabolism and fatiha you know what causes fat storage insulin is the hormone that primarily regulates fat storage in your fat cells so the idea is you raise insulin and the sugar because of this half of it being fructose and that mostly being metabolized in the small intestine and the liver seems may indeed cause insulin resistance and if it does you over respondent's and so one is a peripheral explanation not that people don't love it and they don't want to you know over consume it whatever that means and the other is a central explanation yeah so I mean sugar is a factor that makes us want to eat foods right I mean this is one of the many food properties I would love to talk about this more that caused dopamine release in the brain and dopamine is a chemical that sets our motivational levels to do certain behaviors so the reason we become addicted to drugs is that they go in the brain and they stimulate dopamine release and that reinforces drug seeking behaviors where but this is just causing you to consume more correct but you're saying that the actual amount let's if you have the same amount of carbohydrates that are sugary carbohydrates yes is the same amount that our vegetable carbohydrates the sugary carbohydrates are going to be more fattening no no I didn't say it was independently of calories it's entirely dependent on calories yeah correct and we have randomized controlled trials demonstrating this so if you look at the randomized there by the way we're not we're not operating in an evidence vacuum there's tons of randomized control trials let's do this yeah random these randomized controlled csr they short-term it depends well it depends on how you define short-term they're not last long years and years and years isn't the issue though long term chronic effects like that seems to be possibly but let me put it this way you know if you believe that insulin is the cause the effect of insulin on fat cells happens almost immediately so insulin I'm not aware of any mechanism of insulin on fat cells that takes more than a few hours to occur and so if you believe that insulin causes obesity this should be happening immediately you shouldn't have to wait months and months for this to occur oh no that doesn't make any sense at all no it does make sense to you well cuz again he's he's kind of making this up as he goes along so the idea is well explain why it doesn't make sense without consulting him that's possible has he not been insulting me ever my just biased I realized that I it's everything but necessarily saying he's insulting your stories not you personally but what what what do you what why doesn't it make sense to you okay so the idea is when your insulin was elevated you're storing fat right ah it depends on what you mean by that that's not see you do a little bit of bait-and-switch here no no no that's an until just answer the question if it's a clarify well it depends what do you mean by store I mean your fat cells are accumulating fat when insulin is el-amin's do you mean accumulate like like what next a fat like it inhibits yeah that's incorrect it stimulates lipoprotein lipase and inhibits hormone sense we should size this because that's in there it's in the textbook no yeah we'll talk about what's in the textbook don't worry Gary they Jesus okay so you don't believe in one but just give me your position and I'll let him refute it it's here but just say it just I will just show it okay cuz again you're gonna say it's not in here so I have the same textbook and then we'll let Joe here suppression of fat mobilization by insulin and there's another graph that is a stimulation of fat mobilization congratulations to all of you people that are listening to this there are nowhere in the weird scientific let me just say this is gonna take a long time so we agree on the molecular mechanisms okay we agree on the molecular mechanisms the impact of insulin on enzymes and fat cells what we disagree about is the implications of that and yeah and I think that's what we should talk about that's true because nowhere in that textbook does it say that insulin regulates the total size of body fat so absolutely that is someone talking mo have added on absolute that mechanism would you like to know conversation I have with the author no and not right now actually so the now the let me tell you about the card we talk for three hours can you stop interrupting me please okay now let me explain so insulin essentially does have effects on enzymes that cause fat cells to take up more fat and to release less fat so that's the part that you're right about that's what that textbook talks about right now that does not mean that does not imply that insulin causes fat storage as in the accumulation of fat from day to day and let me explain why that is so insulin is basically a traffic cop that allows your body to burn the fuel that you just consumed so when you eat a diet that's high in carbohydrate and low in fat your insulin goes up your body restricts the fat from going out of fat cells it turns that down not off but down it causes less fat to come out of your fat cells and then your body's burning carbs that's what you just ate right now if you eat a diet that's high in fat and lower in carbohydrate you secrete less insulin those effects don't occur on your fat cells and that allows your body to burn the fat that you just ate but at the end of the day the amount of fat that you have in your body is the amount that you ate minus the amount that you burned that's what determines the amount this is just arithmetic right amount that you ate minus the amount that you burned and if you eat a low fat diet you're not eating much and you're not burning much you're in the same place as if you're eating a diet where you're eating a lot of fat and burning a lot of fat and the way we know that's true is because varying the amount of carbohydrate and fat in the diet makes no difference to body fatness in randomized controlled trials okay so I know that what I just said is correct No so the first of all it's one randomized control trial it's Kevin hall again no meta-analysis we twenty randomized controlled about the meta-analysis we decided that I think you know that what's wrong with men and now a crappy study ever done he doesn't like who did it basin no no no I don't care who does it I don't like men analyses I don't like the concept of them I think it's one of the problems with modern nutritional and medical sciences you do crappy studies generate garbage and then you sift through the garbage and say I can find a truth in here and the answer is do better studies answers always do better studies you can't do your meta analyses they exist for everything the issue is just is as simple and remember we're talking about the ten calories a day so when you said the difference between the fat burned and the fat store the fat consumed and the fat expended has to be ten calories a day that's that's what we're talking about ten calories in the fat tissue okay so if it is true that if I consume 1,500 calories a day and I somehow metabolize or excrete 1490 and I guarantee that no such study was ever so carefully done you say that this is the energy balance Consortium study the Kevin hall study that we've talked about one of the things there are two things that have when you put people on a ketogenic diet among other things you generate ketones and you lose ketones in the breath and in the urine and one of the things you have to do in these energy balance experiments is measure calories loss through fecal material who knows maybe you jack up the fat consumption maybe they lose more fat calories when they shit it out or maybe the five valerie's matter I think when you're measuring the fat balance what you're talking about you have to measure the amount of fat in and out and so I'm giving you an example and response here question was because you give me an example in that study they didn't do either of those measurements they modelled one and the other one they couldn't get the the assay to work after a year or two years and gave up on it and so you just don't know but getting back to this question we're talking about somebody's throwing ten calories of fat in their fat cells let's never get away from that or 20 calories and so the question is always is this mechanism capable of explaining the 20 calories or is the what in my name looking in that book well it's essentially what he was saying and in some inhibits fat mobilization from well I could read it if you wanted to read it you know I mean I mean Gary and I both agree with what's in that textbook you can read it if you want it restrains fat mobilization through two mechanisms suppression of light lipolysis right yeah lipolysis mechanisms are described in the text and the stimulation of the re estera fication of fatty acids within the a data pile I stepped aside at depe sites at diploid FSL fat cells note that the same process of esterification will also be simultaneously incorporated fatty acids from circulating try glycerol triglycerides yeah triacylglycerol try asshole Chris try acyl grosser all right released by lipoprotein lipos plan pays Lin pay that's enough Joe we get lipase yeah l IPAs e into stored try acyl glycerol yeah so let me just explain this briefly the argument I've been making and others is that insulin inhibits fat loss like if you're a fat cell and you see insulin you hold on to your fat right kind of that simple Stephan's absolutely right this book which is we're talking about is it metabolic regulation human perspective it's written by Keith frame who's retired Oxford professor is a wonderful man and he was the world's leading authority on Baalak regulation how your body controls its use of fuel and orchestrate storage and oxidation and in this book Keith frein talks about how insulin determines fat accumulation and fat cells and not accumulation that whatever fat storage fat storage fat trying to make fatty acid trafficking in and out of fat cells okay thank you so the first time I ever interviewed Keith was for a piece I was doing for the journal science on insulin resistance and we spent about an hour in the phone and he explained to me for 20 minutes all the ways insulin traps determines fatty acid trafficking across the fat cell membrane and you raise insulin you accumulate more fat on the short term and then we got to obesity and they said whoa B cities you know caused by odd people eating too much and I said Keith when we were talking about why fat cells get fat it was all insulin mediated and when we were talking about people get fat it was this eating too much thing okay and you switched mechanisms on me so my assumption is the same reason people get fat as the same reason their fat cells get fat and you've got a whole lot of you've got this disorder metabolic syndrome we're talking about which includes not just problems with your blood lipids but it includes getting fat at your waistline increasing and it's an insulin resistance related disorder which means your insulin is elevated and again this is where we end up with two hypotheses about why insulin is elevated but if the friends and sugar can elevate insulin you end up with metabolic syndrome you're in fat storage mode that's the terminology of diet book doctors so now you're storing fat and you only have to do 10 calories a day 20 calories a day you're gonna get obese and it's insulin median insulins responding to the carbohydrate content of the diet primarily and that's it and when I said this to Keith you know you've got one mechanism for why fat cells get fat in a different mechanism for why humans get fat and I'd like to talk about this overeating concept he said you know I never thought of that I mean the guy had been in the field 40 years and Neela maybe 50 and then I had a long conversation with him I was back in Oxford when I did that insane Allen arrogant debate I stopped off at Oxford on the way to Manchester and we had a long conversation with Keith and I said look what I want you to do is just come up with a hypothesis of obesity from the fat cells perspective right shed your brain centric energy balanced centric thing and ask yourself what does the fat cells see and if nothing else asks a student to do it as an experiment I mean that would be a great thought experiment for kid what's gonna make a fat cell fat and then our assumption is gonna be that's what's gonna make a human fat and Keith said I hate it literally said to me he was retiring and he was going off to garden um I kind of envy them but he said no I just can't i can't put energy balance aside you're telling me to not think in terms of intake and expenditure and i can't do it and i mean wonderful man he literally and this is again when i've been arguing is all these people are so including Stefan who was you know learned in this world they're so locked into this thinking that obesity is this energy imbalance and they can't get away from it so everything they do everything they interpret and when Stefan says there's study after study and there's 20 randomized control studies and it's so I'm gonna shovel the evidence on top of you and I'm saying look I guarantee if we go through those 20 studies they'll be just like the Jim Hill study they assumed energy balance was the cause and then they wanted to see what caused energy imbalance and they started with the wrong hypothesis they're trapped in a paradigm we've all seen this can I respond to this he's okay so Gary I pre-ordered your book I have a copy of your book right here good calories bad calories i pre-ordered this in 2008 because I was so excited to read this book yes and what he mailed me I tore through it and I was so persuaded when I initially read this ten years ago that I ate a low carbohydrate diet for six months because I thought I was I thought the carbs were gonna make me fat and give me diabetes so I was fully immersed and convinced by your perspective when I yeah and you and you sign this book you see I have your signature we had a very nice dinner together and the thing that caused me to go away from that perspective was when I actually started investigating the evidence on my own underlying these ideas I started doing my own research I didn't take your word for it I started doing my own research in the lab as well and actually doing real scientific studies but what to our study found that it did not line up with what you were saying in your book and what I ended up realizing about good calories bad calories is essentially your arguments primarily rely on historical narratives and speculation and there's very little of actually saying what is the most pertinent scientific evidence to answer this question and what does that evidence have to say it's mostly historical narratives and honestly you know I'm gonna try to say this in a non insulting way but I will simply say that others who have looked at the same historical evidence have come to different conclusions than you have and that includes me in the places where I've looked at the historical evidence and so I think that you know this idea that I am like locked in some paradigm and can't see what you're talking about I was there Gary I am post so let me okay so let me let me let me just say B's in track because here we're gonna wrap this up soon so we've really got near three hours almost um remember when you drove up here from San Diego this morning and I was listening to Stefan on a different podcast and you were talking about how you are eating behavior differed on low carb diets versus the higher carb diet you eat now and you talked about your resistance it was easier to fast on the low carb diet correct okay and you didn't really have an explanation for it I don't have a very well anyway go ahead yeah so again the argument I've been making is this there's two ways to look at everything so one way is the low-carb diet somehow because of I don't food reward issues affects your urge to eat Kart and low carb foods and because of that you don't hunger for them as much and when you're on a higher carb diet I think the way you phrase done and so the podcast was your body sort of tells you it's Meal Time so it's conditioned to me even better so the alternative hypothesis here the other way to think about is on the low-carb diet it's insulin levels are staying lower when they're saying lower he's mobilizing fat and he's oxidizing that fat and as you said on the podcast and even a you know the 135 pound marathoner has enough fat in his body to run for a week so the reason you're able to skip meals is because insulin is low fuel my wife is calling she's probably telling me I'm getting shrill there's a different way to look at everything that's the point I'm trying to with every study I mean can you tell me evidence that can you give me actual evidence that the lower level of insulin is the cause of not needing to eat those meals no okay I'm giving you a hypotenuse angle like we're talking about fasting right if you're fasting for a certain prolonged period of time your body's going to go into a ketogenic state we all agree Yeah right and that's that's the reason why it's easier to fast once you're in ketogenic states your body starts burning off fat and this is a widely reported nots living on fat it's metabolically flexp donut because so yeah it's the idea that it's living on your fat is evidence that you're getting thinner on that low-carb diet is its fat balance it's the amount you're eating minus the amount you're burn no but it's a question as it's Asif the amount you're trapping and that's what you keep leaving out so if you have no that has been tested don't know if you did is what I'm saying it has not been tested that's what I'm saying that's why we found that new see that's why we spend thirty million dollars that's why David Ludwick is doing another 13 million dollars study it has not been tested when you when you feed people whether it's over feeding or under feeding and you're causing weight loss or weight maintenance the carb to fat ratio of the diet makes almost notify me give you another remaining Studies on it the famous feeding study from the 60s which I thought when you said Horton I thought you meant Edie Horton not TJ Horton so ed Horton and Ethan Sims that did a prisoner study they literally they they wanted to get the over feed again they're using their thinking in terms of eating too much they wanted to get first get college kids to gain 25% of excess body weight this was in the 60s and they couldn't get the college kids to do it which suggests that college kids were different in the 60s than they are today so they used prisoners in the Vermont state prison and they overfed them and you discuss this in your book they could get these prisoners to eat 10,000 calories a day of excess carbohydrates and excess calories it was calories not carbohydrate might have been calories they couldn't get him to add more than a thousand calories of fat okay and they talked about this sim studies were crazy because I published in 15 different journals so they interpreted this study if you looked at pounds gained per calorie added they gained more per calorie of fat than they did per calorie of carbs but if you looked at how much they could eat they couldn't add that much fat and they could add like eight thousand seven thousand extra calories of carbon is actually a line on one of the papers when they say they would eat 10,000 calories and then go to bed hungry craving more carbs so then the question becomes again is it because the carbs are doing something in the brain to increase food reward or is that the carbs are doing something in the body so that their body is figured out a way it can orchestrate deal with this massive influx of carbs versus fat but there's always two ways to look at it and every time Stefan says there's masses of evidence my job as a journalist was to go through and say does this refute that hypothesis and if it doesn't we have to hold on to it cuz remember we have an obesity and diabetes epidemic and the kind of advice where we tell people to sleep better and eat less or avoid foods that they love don't em Pete and ice cream and it's implies that the reason they get fat even though overeating a hypothesis and ice cream what do you think no I think we would both say don't eat peas don't ask questions like that thank you um the is something wrong out there tragically wrong we know if nothing else I think you would agree with this so the whole low-carb movement as you said it on this podcast was that you know what I've done if nothing else is I've convinced people they could eat low carb diets without killing themselves that's a good thing yeah and I'm implying that with the I assume with the sugar book even if I'm wrong that getting people to eat less sugar is a good thing mm-hmm so ultimately these are good things that I've done my own tirely Gary not entirely because you're telling people that only carbohydrate matters I'm not tell me how hard you have argued at length in calorie intake and dietary fat intake and physical activity do not influence body fatness and are not with your ex marry the wrong way I'm doing that no if you're going to look look at the model that we published that you contributed to and we signed off it doesn't say anything about it says that physical activity dietary fat intake and calorie intake are not important I refuse to ability and somebody who's on a Scott that way because they were sedentary okay okay you're right pardis requires but what I'm saying is that there is harm in what you're saying because yes we all agree that these carbohydrates are fattening but you're saying that these other important things are irrelevant and that's the difference more than what you're saying no no no what I'm saying about calories is it's the wrong way to think about so wait you think they do matter I'm saying calories of the run don't put words and okay calories matters hours are a way to measure the quantity of food you're eating it could use grams you could use anything else okay the question is is it the right way to think about it can you solve an obesity problem let me give you an example before we go let me just read you though excess calorie intake and physical inactivity in Andheri to this process and not themselves determinants of body yeah no I think that is what you said is fine in our can I read you something debate no it's okay that's I'm not putting words I just want to read yeah but that's different than what you just try okay sure it is they're just okay let me read you something they just never seemed to be enough food to say if she ate Carl's growing body after school he would eat a footlong sub before his mother's home cook dinners even after having a hefty lunch of homemade chicken rice and vegetables and his favorite snacks granola bars and buncher crunch okay a lot of calories okay one person we are talking about one week yeah how is this gonna I just want to know okay so one anecdotal one of my problems with the whole overeating hypothesis is it's tautological you don't know if someone's overeating unless they're fat right incorrect well this fellow I just regular intake and you can know we would eat a footlong sub before his mother some group dinners even after having after lunch of homemade chicken rice and vegetable yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah again that's one story - my point is it's like you cannot tell if someone's fat I you have no idea how many calories I consume right I could probably get a pretty decent estimate actually based on published formulas okay so and then how would you know whether I was overeating remember we're talking about ten calories a day no it's stored in the fat tissue well that depends on whether you mean how you define that but I I could look at your body composition and I could tell you whether you were overeating relative to a lean person yes because i have excess body fat correct yes so without knowing if i have excess body fat you cannot tell whether i'm overeating which is the cause of the excess body fat right let's strike you a circular there's nothing circular about it look if you take somebody and you increase their calorie intake carbs are fat either way they gain body fat there's nothing circular I'm not saying that calories in confident that the fellow and if you take someone who is currently has obesity and you reduce their calorie intake carbs or fat doesn't make any difference they lose body fat that so there's nothing circular about this calorie but you know it does make no no I just the I I don't understand how you could possibly think that was circular it's so simple on that right but let me go through it one more time listen you're not going through anything one more time we're getting anything done here there was a lot of fun it was that much fun it was it's interesting I mean there's that I I don't know who to believe quite honestly I think you both make some excellent points and I think there's definitely some real legitimate concern that you have about his position and I think that your position has some merit as well the position about insulin and about carbohydrates and sugar this is a really long conversation and I think we could probably do this for another six days forget about hours I think if I would recommend people I think people have to really kind of figure this out for themselves I would recommend Stefan please recommend your book what is your book again yeah book is called the hungry very hungry brain and it's available everywhere Amazon all that yes and uh Gary yeah it's good calories bad calories or why we get fat or the case against sugar I think we've just begun this debate I know it's been going on yeah we've got a lot of evidence here that I didn't have time to cite unfortunate yeah well it was a long one but thank you gentlemen thank you all right thank you Joe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
