is it a battle between the human retarded monkey chimpanzee behavior of take-take-take that theory I believe was formulated before they realize how many monkeys chimpanzees eat on chimps attack people that go for your balls it's one of the number one things I do they try to eat your genitalia isn't it weird now that we know so much about chimpanzees like some of that kid that student in Africa just got a fucking testicle ripped off I like to picture that chimp clamping down on my scrotum with his teeth that gets me through the last four or five reps I saw this picture of a chimp carrying fruit and I looked and like holy fuck there's that fucking gorilla that they were the chimpanzee they've recently discovered in the Congo just muscled gigantic you know how fucking crazy it must have been the first time they discovered a gorilla you know they're walking - what else is here John welders ants the size of your hand Fred give me the machete what's hack through some what the fuck is that like the regular chimpanzees fuck each other up they kill each other but bonobos really they mostly solve their issues through sex they you know how do you saw you through bond you okay you can't hold a chimp bitch and check those bitches are freaks brutal talk about chimps every week might help life like this is probably the most but you know I mean when's the last time you drove white chimps me yeah all the time you do okay okay gentlemen black helicopters have been spotted I don't know you know this he's like a wave better athlete than you but it doesn't mean that we put in that is it does it mean doesn't mean that he'll automatically and you've earned a thousand calories is there some sort of I talked to Pat McAfee one time he said it's about explosivity it's about rape and murder my head's filled with it stopping rapists and stopping murderers and killing child molesters that's what I think about so Mickey Mantle Jean yes I'm trying to break Bert's will that's what I'm really trying to do talks all this Mickey Mantle gene shit I'm like motherfucker I'm crazy until two days ago everything seemed to be going good but I started peeing and he started coming out dark today I had to go to something in my kids school and I had to go up three flights of stairs I got to the top I was out of breath and my legs were shaking and I was like okay I might have fucked something okay for this I are as you feel present to you Joe Rogan this belt sign you are the champion of sober October you re huge shocker you're in better shape than the three of us but it ultimately is about TRT is that tight enough or not I think that Mickey Mantle gene thank you he didn't say anything on to I want to say this to the Sandy Koufax gene I want to say yeah Mickey Mantle gene do see Hasan mythologies thing what you play that back do you see how mythologies thing [Music] you guys see i'ma stop summer hush you'd get anxiety like check the app see where everybody scores that shit you know fuck you know you need to know you can do that you were competing against Bert Kreischer Ari Shaffir and Tom Segura so let's take it easy no like my competition post the last Katarina this oh there's some mud rats out there that have no genes almost I feel like like mud rat humans yeah just people that are just smoking their own dicks out there no real light like you know what I'm saying like I've met some people who yeah they're breathing but that's it really I hate to live with these rich people for a while the dad used to masturbate at night and I would sneak out there in the kitchen this back when the family had like a family computer you know it was in one part of the house right and he's over there just in the glow of that screen row and that's back when the monitors were big you know and he's just over there just fucking looking for the devil and he ended up getting divorced it was I think a lot of it was because of that was she annoying first and he started beating off or was he had it and she beat the devil I think he had a bit of it in him the worst is if you're jerking off with a hat on bro you're going to hell Dora the best be one of those Chinese has broke as if you squat down low enough to the ground you could almost hide under it you're the most confusing would be like one of them Daniel Boone raccoons tail oh do when I was growing up we couldn't even get point we had to get this dude Nick on Friday would draw us a picture of some pussy you know for the weekend four dollars to this dude Nick four dollars four drawings bro you'd pay eight dude him we'd come back on Monday and people would have like these fucking busted ass looking all sketches rain on them he was like oh they're so got rain on it no where's our white people that wish they were blocked it's a totally different yeah yeah we had the first one at our school growing up and they put him in learning disabled classes however do that yeah you guys are the first one ever I doubt it we have one of the first 60 or 70 this was probably 1992 but he was always dribbling an invisible basketball no and they put him in class with the mentally handicapped kids he was against whites that was the thing fuck all these white people yeah and when he was white they're like this's and I get it and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up I'm partying you know I'm living high on the hog two vests on maybe right and I thought I thought I heard something outside right which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going right so I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway lock myself out with the blender going coked-up out of my brain I have to go to my landlord the blender shorts out and smoke happens the fire along starts going off in the building right as I'm at his door knocking right so now he's pissed and he's like what's going on and I didn't know what to say I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party dude it was fucking into January uh-huh two and a half years ago so he comes back to my apartment I talked to your buddy Eddie Bravo and that guy is a real he's out there he's like a.j he's like a deaf like a deaf Jack Russell almost you know a deaf Jack Russell yeah because once he gets going you can't Oh Jack Russell terrier yeah you ever been around one of those dogs you open the car and then next thing you know they're like oh yeah they're like sick yeah well how's he deaf because you can't get him back like once he goes you can't you can't get him back in the car like you're sitting there honking the horn you can't that guys out there with their other cool dogs isn't Jack Russell that's the coolest one that's just fucking insane that's insane that's bribery that's about you saying that it's worth $200,000 if she sucked every dick in the room it wouldn't be worth $200,000 right there's no way who's gonna pay $1,000 for a Hillary Clinton bro job other than for the story I think she can get a lot of money for blowjobs you think so did I think fucking dick all right guys to just be fuckin going down dude busting having bukkake you know animate you do oh you do a bukkake before I give this I feel this feels like a disrespectful turn we're taking with yeah I'm sorry you don't think they put her in there for a reason you know cuz she don't give a fuck I think they they want controversy they want people to get used to fucked up decisions what are used to it that's yeah yeah I think they want that because if they ever needed to pull something out like something was like dude this motherfucker has to win you know people is like oh it is Vegas there's a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton's father Hugh Rodham I'm assuming he's not alive anymore no it was a huge Jewish mob boss who is responsible for a opium going into Chicago I don't know if that's real but it makes sense to me I mean no one right so no one has ever been is that him right there oh he doesn't look like you fits in does he how many one has ever been that guy I bet he went home with Amy when they first oh my god there was nothing like that before that that's the people say that that was all staged Bieber's are vacant I'll send you a link you know I sent to that one email that one guy was telling me that there he worked for a team of scientists and they're working for a pesticide company and they're told to they go we're gonna do some studies here and we want it to look like this it seems like there's basically in a nutshell like three kinds of science there's there's the science or science it's like to pretend science but for sure it's not real it's false science pseudoscience and then there's the scientific facts like for sure site like it's a scientific fact that I can get on the internet with my iPhone I don't need to read of study about it and say oh I like actually can I know it my friends know it and then there's a science that you you you have to take the scientists word for because there's no way that you can verify that if you have to take you have to have faith in science that's like a religion what are you talking about like what makes any kind of any kind of science whether it's medical science if you out you avid you have a choice to believe in science that you can't verify yourself you could believe it you but you'll have to believe it sati experts in the field verify it all the people that we all the science that we know that so have been has been corrupted just the big ones sugar science a tobacco science marijuana science vaccine science we know for sure I'll just those four that there's been a lot of corruption and so it's hard to trust so when someone comes out especially the government and goes yeah our scientists scientists say that it's safe and effective you gotta be like damn I don't know about that I'm not gonna just take your fucking word for it you know I mean you guys are criminals you're John Gotti and you guys are saying you guys are saying that this is safe and effective I don't know about that you know maybe it is I hope it is but I don't know if you watch the videos of old nuclear test site with soldiers running towards the blast you ever seen those yeah fucking insane looks like it looks like I don't know just like all that old footage looks like it doesn't look authentic it looks like they faked all that shit what about I you know there's a conspiracy theory that that nuclear bombs actually don't exist that they never actually figured it out but they realized that the the threat of nuclear bombs is good enough Eddie you can see the bomb how do you know was just a regular powerful bomb like how do you know how do you know by watching a bomb go off nuclear if you love the nuclear test I don't know what a nuclear bomb looks like when it blows up I don't know I don't know how do you know if that's a that is the craziest amount of power you could ever imagine I get so you get fine one you understand it could be a nuclear bomb I'm saying all I'm saying I get how King you know for sure look at that what you said before the podcast was so funny about the apocalypse that homeless people are going to be psyched are waiting for the end of the world is not gonna change might get better we'll see you get crown dudes and favelas if you live in a favela you don't have to worry about them in the world because it's already the end of the world for you know hey sorry about the nucleus or sorry oh those bombs are real and we're live with Joey Coco Diaz and one of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet Yoel Romero so yo well you got a good grasp of English pretty good Joey's gonna help fill in the blanks and we'll be able to have some good communication here and techno no Dominic said that he was young and this club he was in was in the second division you know II cuando una lucha beside on that a glue glue or not he possibly made a TV show so he started training the fucking fighters and the club won and they got up to Division one college trying to train him wrestling yeah and don't say cuando Miyama but I stopped earlier ok when they call them for his MMA 5 you said fuck I look now they're nearly there 18 years heavyweight yeah the new heavyweight 18 year old heavyweight ok Begum ok a random seein pounds Erin for circle time hundred pounds on the bench press well let that get some interest Kiera Ben Daniels into it but these trainers that they have a fucking top notch there's a ton of Santeria in LA well I don't deal with it at all because it's all the same thing like everything else now I it's a bunch of white people who didn't grow up and in there and there's a hot black guy and they want to really just suck this dick and tell them about spirits I saw a video today I saw videos I own my shame on them it's all good for you it's like those white chicks that sucked at him dude dick when they go to hot yoga know that guy that's sacrum Bikram big dumb as a pig he got us a bunch of white chicks with hummus flavor in their mouth from sucking that trick wrong dick he he gets to me inside you suck that fucking dead dick that smells like hummus chips but it's who was supposed to be in a way as a comedian we're supposed to be the social column of society in a way in some way so now you want to take that away from me you want to take the way I can't say I grew up on the word retarded I grew up on the word faggot I grew up on the word I grew up on a lot of words that people don't accept today and I'm very sorry that you don't accept them but it's too late for me to change my game right now yeah I'll try my hardest I tried my hardest I'm still gonna say tranny from time to time I know it offends I'm here to tell you how I see it you wanna hear how I see it this is how I see if I offend you I offend you that's my mind comp yeah our paper that we wrote Mein Kampf was about yeah we had two two of them.the did Montcalm one of them we just more or less replaced White's would replace Jews with white men I mean so with that one what we did was we took the whole document online and we just searched the word Jew and we just started picking sentences and paragraphs so what was it that at the end it was something like if we don't combat whiteness it's gonna be the funeral wreath for mankind this is why I've been telling people clean up your room it's like well your room is actually Network - it's not that easy to clean up your room you know because maybe part of it is is that like everything around you is full of potential everything maybe more potential than you could ever possibly utilize and so maybe all you have is this little rat hole of a room in some rundown place in the world it's like fix it up there's more there than you think they devalue what they have right in front of them like another another client I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at night and so we did the arithmetic it's like well I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes a night trying to get him to go to bed seven days a week 45 minutes a day let's call that five hours 20 hours a week 240 hours in a year it's 6:00 you're spending a month and a half of work weeks fighting with your four-year-old son think you're gonna like him you don't like anyone you spend a month and a half a year fighting with it's a bad idea fix it your life isn't margaritas on a beach and in Jamaica your life is how your wife greets you at the door when you come home every day you get those mundane things right those things you do every day you've concentrated on them and you make them pristine it's like you got 80% of your life put together well you have you crazy tweets for sure I don't think they're crazy you just don't get them all right we have the breaking news ABC News ABC I should say just releasing a statement what is ABC saying ABC is just issued a stunning statement wolf that says the show has been canceled ABC canceling the hit revival after Barre tweeted this about former President Obama's advisor Valerie Jarrett she tweeted that Valerie Jarrett who is black was the daughter of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes we were at home in Salt Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11 a.m. I just woke up and Trey I had this thought in my head oh my god this can make so much sense and then I tweeted it and I went right back to sleep and when I woke up at 7 this shit hit the fan you know yeah but I was like I'm going to expound on this later there was one of those kind of things right you just want to get it down and I you know always slept with my computer and tweet when I wake up like you know when you're old you have to go to the bathroom a lot always tweet and fall back to sleep see and I and then on the ambien tweets my daughter I used to always when I took my ambien I called my daughter and she or she called me she go mom you're starting to do the ambien tweets get off get off the Twitter you know but so I just called my daughter then every night when I when I during the ambien and I'd go you know what here comes a big fish chic recorded it here comes a big fish right through my window oh oh he's getting stuck in the mirror and should that's what she goes mom turn it all off and go Susan Rice is a man with big swinging eight balls wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about who was that other woman Susan Rice yes yeah well you said she has giant swinging eight balls yeah that she's a man Wow Johnny let me explain that now because this is the regional istic regionalism I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah when we got married and aren't we heard our moms do it - it's always where's your ape they go what your ape doing this Sunday and he's like oh he's watching football all good let's go out to lunch you know it's all of the men were all Apes that's how it is in a breeder culture like Salt Lake City breeder called yeah so it's like where's your ape and there's like man your ape has a big fucking swing and eight balls I give him that you know it's a regional istic thing and my point is that this little only two things over the course of thousands don't make my point I said Susan Rice let's say that she has she it has incredible audacity that's what I meant and she does and you know I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to but they weren't right I'm right I wrote it bitch so I know what I meant so you don't forget to tell me what I meant here's my impression of milk just clicking the fucking babe he was he just kept clicking the pen and I didn't want to say anything I say TNF one of the commanders of the immune system it kind of says hey let's let's cause a bunch of inflammation and make you miserable and so the these and another molecule similar similar to it decreased by 50 and that decrease persisted but it's uh I don't have that stuff now and I don't know if I can attribute that to the cells but I got a bunch of cells like twice and that went away now I talk about that for a minute does that sort of look a little harder at it and it's a mystery to me why it isn't the case but you know hey if there are places where one can go and get some help yeah it sounds like the old spruiker on the corner good for moles holes and pimples on survive it's like a transmute oh you don't have one of these no I don't yes you do I definitely do you do now I definitely don't you don't have this even that's me yes well no I guess I'm fucked again sorted so much coke

claimed that I adopted her that her I adopted my girlfriend have you read that one I did read that I forgot about it so this kind of stuff I was like you adopted her so you could take her on tour with

tonight so I give it to you I still give it to you if you do that to me that'd make me feel much better than if I would like read them up yeah like a filled tears running down my face my chest was wet with tears because I knew I couldn't do on my own it was impossible for me cuz I tried and tried and tried and ended up back in the pub back drinking I almost accepted that that was gonna be my fate an alcoholic so I was on my knees in this bedroom after praying for about 10 minutes I got up and I felt the weight of the wall was lifted off my shoulders and for the first time in years I knew it was gonna make a comeback and I called my wife I said Paris parishes are bought she fought was drunk coming home from the pub I said Monday morning I start to regain mission to try and get the heavyweight championship of the world back she said yeah yeah yeah because before this every time I'd offer beer I'd come back and I'm gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world again because it was it was the alcohol talking but even when I speak to her now she says that night you told me that she said you're a difference in your voice something happened next day I phoned up Ben Davison and I said I don't want to go back down the old route with the same trainer same promote two same anything that's and everything's got to change cause it's gonna be a new Tyson Fury that is so amazing man so Arthur lost 140 pounds more importantly lots of knee braces back brace in Cannes last the knee vert no more need braces no more knee braces how did he do that let me finish my visor good I'll play again yeah knee braces and canes not just to walk but run but this is what the program is really about at one year he's five six took a picture of a six foot two son that's insane standing on his back why he's doing a push-up in one year one year that's great man if you didn't see him for a year hey man let's go have lunch haven't seen you a long time like I found the crack and I followed the crack and the crack got bigger and also I see fucking glow like green glow crawl-crawl-crawl find it try to get up my tags are too big I can't fucking get out of the little hole I can't get out of the hole I'm fucking peak be big big fucking hitting screaming freaking out calm down can't like calm down cabbie this is the way calm the fuck down reel it in reel it in we're here we made it grab control follow the Crocs more opens up out boom there's the cave fucking I'm out made it you're coming home you weren't talking about wow those it and I text my girl love you baby and today was fucking scary moment but daddy's coming home so you felt calm while it was flipping oh yeah always well I've seen cars flip right I've seen it for years right so I know it's possible so I get in there and I got turned around at a race in 1998 I was racing at Daytona and I got turned around and the car so I'm flipping for the first time in my life and this cars like over 3,000 3,000 pounds so it's it's but it flies up in the air like it's paper man it's the craziest thing in the world it's so weightless you know the cars flipping you're you're pushed into the seat so you feel grant you feel weight of yourself in the seat that never changes you never kind of come up out of the sea like that you know and so it's like somebody rolled a prop wall of grass up against the side of the car and then against the roof and then against that side and in this you know it kept doing that and I'm like it's just the weirdest feeling and you feel completely safe you know you feel like you know nothing's gonna harm me and in doing so he was telling this story about being in this this forensic laboratory as and as an autopsy was taking place and this autopsy table was adjacent to this this huge indoor window that separated the autopsy suite from this lunch room and then the lunch room were the rest of the forensic staff they're all eating their lunches they all had tuna sandwiches and and cans of coke and barbecued potato chips and they were watching through the window as this absolutely perfect twelve-year-old boy was being autopsy and just hours before this kid like two hours before this kid had been riding his bicycle he'd fallen over he'd hit his head on the curb and now two hours later he was dead and dead without almost a scratch on him just this perfect naked dead twelve-year-old boy on the autopsy table and as he the technicians eating their lunch watching it through a window the day watch as the as the pathologist in sizes around the top of the kids face at the top of the forehead the hairline and then peels the face down like peeling an orange peels the entire face off of the skull of this little boy and leaves the face around the neck like a mask like a rubber mask and this exposes this liver coloured dark red musculature of the child's underlying face and this one guy watching it with a mouthful of tuna sandwich he points this out and he says see that that there that's the color of red that I want to paint our rec room holy shit okay so what I did when I got the phone I said let me do this with it okay lip it around yes and I reminded myself why do in in the military cadets why do they twirl their gun of what possible value is this in combat why do they do these things with their gun and then I realized you're not supposed to drop your gun ever mmm ever so if you twirl the gun and you don't drop it it means stuff can happen to you in combat and it is always attached to your body so I said so when I got my phone I said let me just do this okay let me just do this if I pick up the phone and [Music] so when you do that then you never drop your phone so it's not that I'm a risk taker it's that I've changed my risk to make it so low that it is essentially won't happen and you get AppleCare know going thrill my route do you purple without getting me into doing that's right you do I saw you did you one of those people who thinks you're one of those people you're not okay okay you don't you're wrong you purple there's no God okay Riz I never was a bond guy it's too heavy man I got shit to do man I can't oh that just peeled down or the dab thing that I got friends in Colorado California now the first time I ever did wet shit I just pulled it like it was a big ol bong rip and I got very special oh you know I need you instantly no you just did something you shouldn't have oh no and lay off fuck man so I sat down after a couple minutes I just started getting really cold and clammy I was like yep I'm gonna puke so when I was like I fucked this guy so I puked right in his sink I was like dude I gotta go home I feel like dog shit now and I'm pretty sure I'm dying so we live in this apartment I was like he went out the door and turned the corner to go down the hallway to my and it was full-on vertigo like the hall every time I took a step the hall we got twice as long this is fucked up my wife was out of the country I work at the time I was like I remember I was sitting down in the hallway just like trying to get my shit together man because I thought I was having a fucking heart attack it was just like Pat like sweating and I remember this voice saying get up you stupid junkie fuck before somebody comes out here and sees you you know sitting in the hallway like a dumbass and I managed to like pop out of it as soon as I got back to my place and sat down on the couch everything was fine but it was just so initial and the rush I was like I don't nobody needs to be that stone I wanted to tell your story about mine because he write down yeah Tony artis another guy will call him Chuck but he's with the government now so they always used to go around and and and wanna fight bounces and all this shit I used to work at all the underground hip-hop clubs in New York and I take Brian another dude from school and Tony and Brian is in the middle of the fucking dance floor doing the funky fucking white boy nerd dance and all these fucking and the floor just opens up kill look at this motherfucking white boy like oh my go I gotta go but listen man I know what y'all motherfuckers do don't start no shit wake up the next day I get a fucking phone call yo there was these three fucking karate experts in the club last night and they beat all my fucking bouncers you know this guy he's all on the juice rips off his shirt like fucking Tony throws a kick fuckin dislocates the guy's fuckin kneecap Bryan's like Popeye fucking bryophyte then all of a sudden I'm fucking whacking these dudes and us we're fighting these guys and then this fucking gigantic motherfucker like lifts me up and carries me out the fucking door and throws me across this car Bryan says and I look and it's this fucking crazy white dude with a fucking scar when he points that pine it goes don't even think about it and like Bryan was like yo you know it was he's he's he's a character like I said I was at his first comedy show ever and could be between who the fuck knows what's gonna happen with him you know and yeah I hope they're they're lenient on them and I'm not just so we can get a rematch I mean I love watching a fight first night and and I can I can stretch myself to understand his reaction yeah I can stretch myself to I can't stretch myself to understand the order guys reactions like I said for Habib I didn't think it was you know it was it's just it's almost it's such a foolish thing to do because you think today they already won yeah I know that Dylan was talking shit he was angry but oh yeah she didn't say anything because I heard a few people saying that no I was standing beside Dylan I didn't see what he did but I could hear so he didn't say anything when I watched the back I seen he kind of beckoned them on yeah you know just stupid and the fight stuff put it I didn't think it justified that level of response and maybe there was something else in the lead-up you know Dylan is a bit of a troll online he said there was probably a bit of it build up a voter stuff but um yeah like I said it wasn't that big a deal to me what I be did say is that a joint always said a cigar yes no okay it's marijuana instead of tobacco okay so it's like posh plot tobacco pot never had that yeah I think I tried one once probably can't because stockholders right I mean it's legal right it's wholly legal okay how does it work do people get upset at you if you do certain things a backhoe and marijuana in there that's all it is millionaire Tesla head Elon Musk she ought to Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the subject of a new controversy Elon Musk is seen taken in a joint during a podcast interview with Joe Rogan it's just the latest bizarre incident for the high-profile CEO of Tesla and SpaceX on the same day the podcast was published Tesla's chief accounting officer announced his resignation he did not cite the incident Tesla's stock also took a hit plunging more than 6% is he inhaling yeah no I'm not sure Musk under fire after taking a hit of marijuana mixed with tobacco that has already become a gift one of those moving images on Twitter what about the pot I do not smoke pot as anyone who watched that podcast Cattell I have no idea out of my wife might be a higher thinking life well he might as well be right if he was an alien and he looked exactly like that I'll be honest when he grabbed a joint in the way kind of looked at it I was kind of like it seemed kind of like a guy who was kind of like oh I'm not familiar with this practice but or maybe he's so smart that he thought it would be funny if he pretended he didn't know what a joint was could be a lot of words right but when he said that Tesla was going private funding secure at 4:20 which is 20 million dollars for that joke that joke cost him 20 million dollars the SEC got mad and they find him you know what it's also manipulating your stock prices a little bit well that was one of the things and your shareholders into a panic was concerned that they were going to contact us and see if we arranged that pot smoking part like if that was something that been arranged in advance because it crashed the stock that was I was like Joe Rogan Jesus we didn't do that did we you know what I mean no one says I'm gonna bake cookies and they're an idiot fuck these people bake them cookies and they're gonna like no it's I mean it's a food is a fascinating thing to me yeah his uh I mean I guess this is a good time to bring it up as any you know obviously Anthony Bourdain took his life yeah last week and he was a friend of mine and it was real that was real hard Friday was real hard I woke up and I got a text from my friend Maynard from tool uh-huh Maine and said so much for the Kenan vs Bourdain celebrity jujitsu match you know and and he's like fuck and I was like oh no what does that mean yeah and so that I googled it and I saw it was like oh shit man I can't fuck Wyatt yeah just what why had to hung himself like what like you would curse - I mean you go you go to the jungles of Brazil I mean you go deep man that's uh that's gonna be a weird fucking way to live um you know I'm just like having this late in life childhood of getting to go to all the places that I dreamed about and read about you know I you know I loved I grew up reading books about pirates and explorers and so of course given the opportunity that's pretty much what I'm doing on the show wow what a crazy change of life at 44 years of age how much did you travel before then almost nothing I mean I'd been to France a couple of summers as a kid I'd been to the Caribbean that was about it I mean I was always sure of anything at age 44 standing in the kitchen it was that I'd never see you know Saigon or or Hong Kong much less you know I probably had no expectation I'd ever see wrong so I'm just again I'm just kind of living that out and and as long as me and the crew as long as we're having as much fun as we are at least finding ways to make like more and more fucked-up television as long as we can do that
