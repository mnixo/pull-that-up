hello freak bitches you know it's a process where we're all part of this process we you and I have both seen each other evolved we just don't really realize it as much because we evolved together alright if we went back in time 10 years ago to when we met and then like when we meet we do is yeah it was about 10 years ago a little over that I think really yeah I might even like 2001 or something yeah what's it like even before that dudes yeah I knew you were not well Joe I beg you I bet you don't remember this I remember the first time Matt you really yes I was this was when I was a Corey's assistant at the Comedy Store and we I was sitting next to you um and you were I think you would this was right around you just started smoking weed or you'd be cut you were more you were kind of a marijuana starting become a marijuana advocate at this time but it wasn't this is what's called my annoying phase no but it was really funny yeah it was an annoying thing it was really funny because I was one man no I was sitting next to you and I at the time I'd been I gone I went through this being a marijuana advocate phase like you know a few of you years before but I'm are sitting I see her talking about weed and as a joke cuz I didn't know you that what you didn't know me and is a dumb joke I was like man we should be illegal and you shot me this fucking look man you were you are Elijah making ecstasy thought out you put some fake drugs put a mop on his head he's all Gary open him on you see no I said it should be illegal and you seemed so pissed and then Corey like was like just shut up shut up don't say anything because we didn't know each other and I could have seemed like a real asshole the time but then I wouldn't I don't remember that at all I know I think you might just be a little paranoid I think you tuned me out I probably uh I don't think I got like like like got angry with get angry I pride to seem like a pro going oh dare you yeah I was making whoa one of two things either you were trying to make a joke which would be not funny and I would be bored with it or I'd be like what an asshole spoke I think it was before it was the former then after that we started talking on the phone and we start having conversations like this on their own we've been Duncan and I used to have these fucking 45-minute phone calls yeah I call him up cuz Duncan was the dude who like you'd say hey I can work Tuesday through Thursday this week okay cool and then we know they'd get together and create a schedule you'd call Duncan would get your veil so me and Duncan just start talking on the phone I don't know what started up we'd have these crazy-ass 45 bit fucking while he's working at the Comedy Store and every now and be like oh hold on a second dude sorry you put me on hold I have to answer some other phone call and so yeah see what I like in your bed with your little swatch phone balls baked as fuck Duncan was Hilah job every goddamn day worked there right there's all kinds of yeah it sucks man people the brain is an organ and it malfunctions and and sometimes you go nuts and that's and you get stigmatized for it which really sucks because if you like because that just adds to the problem like if you you know I you see somebody in a cast and you're like oh what happened your arm and they'll tell you oh you know whatever I fell down but you you talked to someone who's been like hospitalized for a few weeks and they tell ya I to go to the hospital I had a nervous breakdown I went crazy shit my pants threw my dog through a window yeah you're like you know you you'll want you want to be compassionate but there's some part of you that's like oh now this is a crazy person it's like it's just that something happened the operating system temporarily crashed and quite often I think that could be a very good thing I think that having your your personality or your ego or crash can often mean that you were trying to be somebody that you aren't and some people invest so much energy so much energy in defining yeah they just want to be something you know there were a kid their mother was telling them you should be like this and then they try to be like this and they hold up this thing they're always working to hold up this giant tail feather and it kick their arms start shaking and that they can't hold it up and that's that's when they have like anger outbursts or suddenly like their friends are like you you turned into someone that I've never met I don't even know who that is it's like no that is you met them you met underneath the tail feather the seething sea of anger and disappointment and sadness they met you met that thing that they're they're trying to avoid by looking up at this man they're holding up to the world but that fucking seething sea of disappointment anger and horror and sadness that's where it's at man you got to go into that thing there are some people the only way they can go into that is by having a full-scale nervous breakdown because then they can have permission to dive into that into that awful vortex of darkness because underneath that vortex of darkness is paradise underneath that that's love and happiness and joy and connection and tranquility and all that stuff and everyone thinks that the way to get to that point is by avoiding this awful black forest that surrounds the Garden of Eden which is inside everybody it's inside everybody it's there it's there and it doesn't matter you know you can work out and that will definitely give you a temporarily temporary good feeling but until you address the internal structures that you haven't acknowledged you're always going to go back to that place where you find yourself morose and depressed and angry and you don't know why you always go back to that place until you sit with the sadness inside of you you have to do that what you're describing is coming out of the closet and it you know yeah for a lot of people that is what it is man it's coming out of the closet and there's a lot of closet clothes there's not just the gay closet right there's all kinds of closet there's the artist closet some people are fucking accountants they're wearing suits and their ties on tight and they're fucking like organized and discipline but inside they're probably painters they probably want it fucking paint they want to paint dayglo mountains down at the beach that's what they really are but their daddy or their mommy wanted them to be a good little businessman so they became this thing that's the opposite of what they are this is the verse in the bhagavad-gita God forgive me because I've quoted it way too many times but it's it's better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest King it's better to be a happy guy brushing fucking Leafs up the street than it is to be some zillionaire who inside is dying or numb or miserable mostly num-nums the work most people are just not as long as these people can quantify on paper I still have a X million dollar home my car still costs X thousand dollars this suit is an X I am still ahead I am NOT going to abandon all these things as long as they don't see through the bullshit the game they think they're winning that's it fry yeah yeah it's almost like you have to fall to to really that's what you got to appreciate those moments when it all falls apart on you because that means you've got an opportunity to try it again this let's take a fresh perspective this is the cool thing that at this retreat I went to this guy jack Kornfield side which I really loved what a great name by the way yeah with a k' not a see jack Kornfield mortal kombat kay jack Kornfield but he uh he's really cool man but he was okay cool with a kid yeah he's yeah like the cigarettes and corny no this guy was awesome and he was one of the things he talked about is in some religious tradition how they like hold the Scriptures rabbi like had his students hold the scriptures over their heart and when they were memorizing them and they would say why do we do this and he said so that when your heart breaks they'll fall in and it's a beautiful idea which is that heartbreak is actually your ego cracking and the moment that cracks you're in the experience of truth and when you're in the experience of truth that's when you can really become who you are but but to get to who you are it's like when you know a bone heals the wrong way like that's what a lot of people's entire personality is it's like a bone that grew the wrong way and that needs a fucking take a snap a crack you know it's wheat you get that through Slava yeah you need that that initial fucking thing and it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts it hurts but we're paying avoiding creatures so we think that so we're always running away from this pain but the problem is as we're running away from pain we're still exactly in pain it's basically like being on fire and running away from water you're just running away from the water because you for some I don't know that's a stupid analogy actually for now you have some great up into that yeah you had a lot of great points well it's true you know there's the monster in the dark and the faster you run the more likely you are to run into something that's actually gonna hurt you as opposed to turning around and saying oh fuck there is no monster no monster you know but you're never gonna know that until you stop and turn around ya know and in some cases people don't have the discipline or the the assistance or the the balls to stop and turn around so they have to trip over something and then there's like oh yeah that's that or this classic story of someone hiding a secret and going completely out of control because of the pressure of hiding that like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the secretly gay guy who's preaching against gay people Oh Ted Haggard yeah yeah in Colorado yeah that guy was snorting meth off his gay lovers yeah yeah yeah whoo Jenna going so far the other way he's just so off the rails being himself he's beat himself he was a guy who likes to snort meth off of cocks let's do a little math and it likes to well does suck a few cocks but I would say he wasn't being himself what I would say is that his his behavior was so extreme because he was seeking balance between that and the other bullshit in his life whereas if he weren't living that he'd be right in the middle right yeah well to get to get to the middle you know the way to get to the middle weirdly is whatever the behavior is that you're doing that you're so horrified about and terrified of sometimes that the really weird ideas this is like something that I like that Rhonda says which is like don't if you don't feel like meditating don't meditate don't force it don't impose this on yourself keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing keep doing it society is going to tell you don't be like this stop being like this you have to change that's what your parents always say the idea is like no sink into what you are right now just be that thing stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect and that's a hard truth to grasp I will take I would take 5,000 Casey Anthony's over one Nancy Grace any day of the week Nancy Grace is a fucking foul necrophile I think she is so much more disgusting than some stripper his kid got into her ecstasy or whatever happened it's like whoo whoo like yeah a dumb girls kid she left the kid in the backseat of the car fell in the kiddie pool because she's negligent or whatever it's like sad and terrible but Nancy Grace is get like clearly getting off on the whole situation I hate those those tabloid death hags like grace I there's some other woman I saw to is like on the view and she was like we just got the verdict the Casey Anthony verdict I'm gonna need your help Oh God it was just disgusting you're weeping because this one mother got off the hook meanwhile every year in Afghanistan and Iraq the UN is dropping bombs on neighborhoods kids are getting blown to smithereens kids are getting transformed into hamburger meat on a daily basis in the Middle East because of our fucked up drones that keep accidentally bombing weddings and neighborhoods and these death mert these death hags are freaking out over one dead child I mean it's sad it's very sad that cake Caylee Anthony died I mean I think that's terribly sad but when you hear Nancy Grace being like Kylie Anthony's bleached bones were found but cable repair operator and all those on her neck was one fabric one bit of her t-shirt it's like there's a growth there's a disgusting there's something perverse behind it thank you sorry about that dude you don't have to I'm a big fan of bashing Nancy Grace what happened hey there's something gross about when I whenever I see someone who's angry and they're fat like that I'm like maybe you need to go on a diet you won't be so fucking angry let's get down with the bout I see someone with this big Jol's in this big you know I'm like exercise eat right take some yoga classes you'll approach this all totally different somewhere the devil is dancing tonight the top moms off the hook Tiger Woods that's another one she went after she went after Tiger Woods for like you guys need stop watching so much slides brilliant yeah I think him and Nancy Grace are gonna burn and a specific part of whatever hell they're maybe a special baby that gets eaten by Florida Florida will turn into a mouth and eat that baby I don't open up this swamps will open up you'll see teeth come out of the ground snatch up the child man I would love to dead babies it would be Florida you know it'd be so fun this is a weird thought that I've had wait a minute you yeah I know get out but if you Nancy Grace is a full-grown thing is disgusting and foul right but if you could shrink Nancy Grace down and have like a pocket Nancy Grace that lived a little aquarium it's a little judgmental death kind that you had in an aquarium that was just always a little show do the right thing Tiger Woods yeah told those girls that he loved them we'll go to the next caller is it a dead baby in Florida it is the semen stains on the mattress can we zoom in on was semen stains let's get Dog the Bounty Hunter I'm here to dirty Javier nails scratching and click on talkin semen then Simon Damon style that's her mantra when she walks she chants semen Stein you know Nancy Grace holds the world record for the longest squirt ever by a female vagina yeah what squirt like 18 feet yeah I think that that squirt happened did not squirt heaven when she saw JonBenet Ramsey's death picture and I've gotten more than one email from really dumb people I think that because I am playing at the Masonic Auditorium it just proves that I am a New World Order shill you're in yet reptile dude you follow the Lightbringer lord lucifer i am a part of the masonic what do they call themselves brother her leg they're a fraternity fraternity a part of the the Masonic fraternity and I'm in with the New World Order because I'm playing at the Nob Hill Masonic auditory you know what a Mason told me once he said that what it's all about is that math or geometry is the first language of the universe it's like the first language of God and so like they're super into sacred geometry like that's a big thing and like the whole thing's based on building the Temple of Solomon which is where you house the Ark of the Covenant you know it's all symbolic of course but the new Temple of Solomon that they're trying to build according to the conspiracy theorists is society like this is it like society is the new Temple of Solomon and part of that was getting the United States Revolution to happen because they helped fund that and also fucking DC the street layout of DC is all Masonic symbols and that goddamn obelisks popping up out of the middle of fucking DC that weird thing and it's all over our fucking money so yeah Joe we are worried about you terribly there is something going on behind the scenes right I mean it's clear if you look at the design of Washington DC and folks you should really should look this up online because it's not something that it's irrefutable yeah grid the grid the way they've lined up the streets the way they put the buildings and everything I mean it literally is Masonic symbol it is and it's all of our fucking money - yeah yeah what's up with that fucking all-seeing eye on top of the petition eye on top of pyramid that makes sense the United States in its long love affair with Egypt think how the Egyptians helped form our Constitution yeah right no one thinks about that shit that's what's so fun about the occult you know because the word a call itself means hidden but it's like hidden in plain view because this shit's in front everybody like all the people who deny conspiracy theories and stuff in their wallet or fucking rectangles covered in Egyptian occult symbology that they don't even think about yeah and for folks who don't know the what the symbols are in in Washington DC the way it's set up is one of them is a Lucifer uptight upside down pentagram sure I mean so the horns stick up in the air I mean there's that's that's there I mean they did design this they really did design the streets like this and the other one is like that Masonic symbol that looks like a measuring device yeah yeah that that means a lot but yeah that's why that's why they like that because they're trying what they're trying to do is to sort of articulate the the primary the the the very first way that the universe form which is through geometry or through like a cascade of like specific physical laws that are based on math it's super fucking cool man I mean guys would Mason's are well that's what a Mason told me at a wedding I don't know he's drunk - I don't know yeah I met a drunk Mason at a Oaks show at the Laugh Factory in Houston he's showing me his Mason IDs and shit and I'm like what the fuck is being a Mason what do you what do you guys do is I call man it's just secret society you know hung out together yeah he got together we had to do rituals where you come out of a fucking coffin I know that happens okay but how much power do you really think they have wheel try to use is there really anything to what they're doing or is like being a Mason just fun I got an Elk's Lodge however there's bunches there's many different levels of the thing and I imagine that a lot of Mason's are probably in politics and when you're when you're in a fraternity and you're in politics you're probably going to pay deference to other people in your fraternity when it comes to working together to make laws happen or whatever you're up to so I a lot of people say it's a waning population that the Masons are kind of like dying out because fewer young people are signing up because they don't recruit so to become a Mason you have to ask a Mason so you have to go to the Masonic Lodge and be like I want to become a freemason and then they do like background checks on you should we become Mason yes let's do it I think it'd be a blast what do you think is good about being a Mason I think ceremony is people are going nuts right now in front of computer these fucking shells he's fucking New World Order shields where's the alex jones hotline number i need to call him right joe rogan has publicly admitted on his show that he is amazing he has Duncan Trussell on who talks about how wonderful it is to be amazing and spreading propaganda and disinformation about Mason's being about geometry they're about control they're about taking your soul ladies and gentlemen not gonna stand for well man I don't know you know I know is I I think uh ceremony is as something that is missing from a lot of people's lives in our culture because it's so goddamn weird and I was like someone wants to get married yeah I guess yeah someone let's get man well that is that definitely that is definitely a ceremony but like you know there's a lot of other ceremonies - that aren't quite so uh based on like on stupid shit but I mean but they are like there's their psychedelic man and like I read this somewhere I don't remember you said it but it was an interesting point which is that a rock show is a ceremony in the sense that you're going to this to watch people on stage like doing like songs which are a kind of chant that everyone already knows and you're taking psychedelics to go enjoy this thick so it's like that you know that Jungian idea that like there's just certain basic things that tend to repeat through all different cultures the way it's repeated in our culture is more through I'm going to go see a rock show and dress in a certain way and take a psychedelic and trip out and have a kind of transcendent experience that comes through the music but it used to be like there's more formal versions of that idea which is like you take a psychedelic and then you do a series of like intonations or whatever the fuck it is depending on what religion or cult you're in and that creates a kind of transcendent connective experience which i think is fucking awesome and it's fun to just watch regardless of whether or not you believe in what that religion or ritual is trying to invoke it's just cool to watch that form of dance and movement happen that the horrible idea especially horrible to bring it up to anybody who's had poor fortune in this life yeah it's just somehow another connected with past lives you know you've ever heard someone say that like oh he must've been a real fuckhead in this past life yeah it's like wow like what a you really are you sure you sure could it just not be a roll of the dice and maybe part of your karma is recognizing that I think that yeah that's why I like the you know Buddha you know I like in like Buddha is said don't don't think about the afterlife so much I think even Christ said I am the God of the living not the God of the Dead the idea being ladies is that a voice yeah I am the god of the living it's a good I think real spiritual masters always tend to try to bring people back into the present moment because it's like yeah you know what the president moment is everything I know when shit goes wrong in my life I know why it went wrong I don't have to go back to when I was a friar in the 1800s and like fisted of fucking you know none I know that if shit's going wrong right now generally it's like cuz I'm fuckin up now it's good for and people can get lost people can start blaming their their karma or where they're at right now I pass lives and it puts them in this place of stupid hopelessness and they don't do the things they need to do right now to get to a better place praise Jesus praise the Lord cuz I guess man so many fucking say has nice so many simple things you could do man all you here's what you have to do this is my new theory identify the vampire in your life mmm find the vampire identify the parasite well it doesn't have to be that you have parasites in life it is possible that you could have gotten lucky and there's no parasite and you get off groovy sure no I'm not buying everyone's got one but if you got one if you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues you've got the fucking heavy heart and you can't feel happy and you feel bad it there may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid to take that's the vampire and you've got a fucking not even a person oh no I mean it's a situation a I see what you say yeah it's a vampire in your life yeah find a life sucking situation that you're afraid to kill and the reason I say vampires because vampires only go where they're invited and generally the situation that you're in you invited it in you invited this thing into your life and now it's sucking your life energy in your blood and your happiness away don't it's in a lot of times that you'll try to you'll try to convince yourself that this thing is not a vampire but in your heart you know you're a servant to a fucking bloodsucker your Renfield this thing is like sucking your life essence away sometimes it's doing it with a trade quite often they'll be a bad trade you'll be you know whatever the situation you're in the Olli little bit you'll feel like you're in this situation you know it's worth it it's kind of bad but it's really worth it this happens with jobs quite often you know or you're like well you know but it's good enough that's the vampire you got to take a fucking stake and drive it into its heart - how do you kill a vampire two ways direct action you don't kill a vampire by like making up with a vampire you don't kill a vampire by like having a sit-down talk with a vampire you're not going to be able to like you know make friends with the vampire there's two ways to kill a vampire one you fucking you know I put a stake in its heart the other one is light sunlight truth light that's it's the greatest metaphor of all time you shine the light of truth onto the situation fearlessly analyze it and then you'll destroy it you know because if you really allow yourself if you can act you gotta add the real problem with people is not recognising the enemy it's acting on that enemy yeah that's the real problem and that enemy being you know personal your personal demons your your personal jihad that's a personal issue you gotta fight the Beast mmm and it's been the end way you know what I mean it's like it everybody's beast is different chapter 2 of the bhagavad-gita Arjuna's dejection Arjuna is drawn between these two forces he does not want to fight he drops his bow and God says to him you've got rise to the fight fight you're a warrior this is what you're here for fight fight it's but it's better to die it's better to die in a righteous battle than go skulking off into the fucking woods and be a beggar it's better to fucking do what you do on your award you gotta fucking do it man it fucking sucks when when you're drunk and you want to throw up and you try to not make yourself throw up just throw up you'll feel better you'll feel better in the end when you're puking it's going to suck because you're helpless and you can't breathe go through it man fucking jab a fucking knife into the foot not literally of course but yeah you acting you got to make the big fucking decisions sometimes and it's scary if it wasn't scary it wouldn't be worth anything yeah for some people it's almost like they don't know how to start they know that there's action they need to take in their life but they're paralyzed trying to think about it trying to figure out how to start and they can never gather up the courage to get away it's like what so a lot of people stay in abusive relationships they don't they don't have the courage to leave exactly because it's scary and it seems like it you know there's so many things that people like ideas people will create they'll keep you trapped in whatever prison you're it's very similar to and not I mean what you're talking about in the UFC with these fucking fighters this is a visual representation of what anyone can do in their life but you when you're not good maybe not all of us are going to get obviously be world-class fighters they get in a ring in front of the entire planet and fucking knock someone out but you have in your life right now if you haven't already done this there's you have the chance to be heroic you have the ability right now to make a heroic act that could kill you that's the thing these actions it's not always guaranteed that because you do the right thing you're going to end up in a great place you might end up fucked you might end up you might end up temporarily in a homeless or you might end up temporarily jobless if there wasn't risk associated with it you would have already done it that's the point you know if there wasn't risk associated whether it wouldn't be worth anything you know if Mount fucking oh you know if the Himalayas were you know a little green grass covered hill and apart nobody take pictures of them at the top putting a flag into it it's a danger makes it heroic you know so sometimes you just have to fucking it's not like Tony Robbins take the leap kill the vampire in your life kill the vampire your life is a brilliant speech dude you're you're dead right any time you fucking kill that vampire if you survive flowers will rain from all hours you're bloom man yeah you can get better everybody can get better we get all of that and move forward but you gotta be positive fuck yeah don't be convinced that you have anything figured out
