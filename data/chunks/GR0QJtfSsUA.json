hello freak bitches like you black out and go to a head to a bar well the problem is the titles are actually way quicker than the song I mean I go here no here's honestly what happened so I went to my buddy Dave Cobb he's a producer there I actually met him through your buddy Sturgill actually I didn't really meet him but everyone a bunch of articles that said stirs will introduce me to him so I'm just going with what means very narrative yeah it helps but um so uh and I'd kind of been kicking around Nashville for like about 15 years or so and with no success at all I mean just bullshit and I've been had my ass kicked my dick in the dirt as they say and then um I was like fuck it this is gonna be my last record I was like I'm gonna whatever they call it dropped the mic put out a really fuckin dirty ass record so at record I was willing to make and not pull any punches I was gonna just pay for myself owning myself and I had a feeling this was gonna get me banned from Nashville and then I just leave cuz I'm fucking broke so we made this fucking dirty record and it's probably about as dirty and it's not wasn't even like I want to make the dirtiest country record it was just like what's happened now in Nashville because it's turned into such fucking bullshit is um what money's happen right well what's happened is country radio is no longer country music what is it it's and I didn't know this any more than you cuz I don't listen to that dog shit but I am actually heard the best explanation for it the other day Steve Earle who's a hero of mine he was on this Chris Shiflett podcast I don't know if you know he is he's a guitar player for Foo Fighters a good podcast country music she loves country oh wow and Steve Earle goes um you could say you could hear me is kind of talking around it he goes country today you know mainstream corporate country is he goes it's rap music for people and he pauses he's like it's rap music for people and he just you keep hearing and pause like is he gonna say he goes it's rap people for it's rap music for people who are scared of black people it's true it does it does effects it a lot our team we had this team called the Miley boys so that was my rectum ollie boys like they're all they're all on Molly all hanging out doing Molly and everything very positive squad lose by 30 it's cool yeah no we look like fucking clowns our

goddamn hilarious yo my boy Bernard designed this shit Molly Boyce yes oh my god man I don't uh she's been in a couple films I saw her in something in the news recently but not I don't know what happened man that's a weird world she peeked yeah that Peter 80s movie world is a weird world I'm surprised that people sell it and press pills haven't put her face on like a press pill yet mmm that would sell like wildfire anybody making pills in your bathtub I think the only thing that took me a while to get used to is so much MCT oil yeah be careful with that though I text you yesterday yeah I was running man took all the this a bunch of em CTL I swear to God I was like it's Venice I'm as well just shit my pants right yeah like no one's gonna give a fuck I will just shit everywhere yeah there's a tipping point with MCT oil where it just opens of all there's no deal there's no like there's no like third gear it's right first or fucking six Cameron where is it is it like two tablespoons trying figures like three tablespoons you're gone that should is the perfect storm for explosive day if you want clean out the pipes you don't need a colonic most but it's not have a class I gotta take a shit it's like it's coming you better fucking figure it out squeezing your butt up and you're dancing up your innards think game plan my mouth started watering oh there's that battle that you play it's very similar the battle when you try not to come you know the battle when you try not to come loose just squeeze it is it's very similar to that I don't want to shit my pants pow you have willpower cuz there's some weak people in the world they just shit their pants more than you can't be my friend if you just give up and shit you clamp our man yeah but then I've shit my pants before too it's like here's a deal it's okay to tap out just don't tap out like a bitch should I at least put up a fight alright if you lose the fight be actually in a position where you have to tap yeah just tap cuz you're sweating and it's just I have no other option yeah hey Kalin lighting said he shit his pants and then showed up with regular hips well that's what I just can't do he said that he couldn't make it to the show at the ice house because he shit his pants and I said what are you talking about because I shit my pants I can't come I said Brian these people came to see you they're here to see you and he goes what should I do I go go to a fucking bathroom at a gas station take your fucking pants off throw them the sink clean the shit out of your pants wring them out and they get over here with wet pants on in a story how old is he at this time oh I got here what should I do you got to show up man you got to show up like people don't want to smell shit on you so if you just get to the bathroom for five minutes you get to fix all that it's gonna take a little work and you're gonna wear wet pants but that's what you have to do better than beauty pay people paid think they're Bryan Callen fans yes I will fuck you up do do hanging out your pants tell some jokes so he shows up ten minutes later his pants are dry and I go what happened and he said I had a pair of pants might try it the works like a pair of fancier trunk I don't know what I didn't even want to ask what was really good get into it I hope you shit your pants as a grown man I mean it ain't a simple procedure there's some steps you gotta tell you that's the next next shirt so I had another pair of pants in my pants in the trunk have you ever had a pair of pants to your trunk that you didn't know about never get your pants to go what is the odds the pants are my trunk never I guess when I'm older I might I might have a baseball hat in there I need to see some stuff I do not know if it was alive but goddamn ice melts so normal I mean I would have just only County it's the best is that always you could do that there's only so much you can learn from people right you know at a certain point you have to understand that what makes them special is because it's them it comes out of them you can't learn that you can't really take it but what you can take is the feeling of they have their own identity and you've got to find that in yourself that's the thing that you want to ultimately get you know what I mean you want to be influenced by all these people but the main influence that I think you should learn from the Great's or that you have to find it in yourself you know you can't rely on it anybody else alright and I think to see it in someone else gives you that inspiration to try to find it in yourself so I used to search for it just constantly and beat the library getting up VHS you know videos and just watching rewinding watching and then I would drive 19 hours from Akron to Mississippi just to like maybe find a musician who I heard lived in some town you know what I mean just because I wanted to see it you know and and when I find when I found it his life changing man I mean I was like 17 and I went to Greenville Mississippi and I just started asking around for this musician name his name was T model Ford and he made some really cool teen model Ford yeah he was total badass he played a death metal guitar like really a PV yeah and it said with like the letters you put on a mailbox it's like said team on afford the tail dragger he had it spray-painted on his trailer that he pulled her out his Lincoln and I just going there I would never want to just like become that person right but whether they're from Mississippi or they're like a classical composer from Germany there's the thing that these all these guys have in common and it's like a sense of self you know what I mean anybody I've ever met has a real just a confidence that you know even though they may not be the best at certain things they can like bring out the best in themselves you know on that and that's like enough do you know what I mean [Music]
