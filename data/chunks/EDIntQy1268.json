hello freak bitches if that happens just slightly because a lot of people are in a cave in situation when it comes to their lives they're literally buried under a series of antiquated stale symbols that they're looking at the universe through and they feel trapped it's like their shoes are too tight yeah and if like a psychedelic or meditating - and I really mean that I'm not just saying that because that people because I'm I really think meditation has a very similar effect but any of these things they reset those symbol structures in your brain and if you just like if you're in a cave in and you get an extra inch compared to like being pressed against the wall that's a big fucking deal man oh right so it's slightly percentage difference change is like oh thank god I'm 13% less frightened than otherwise for my entire life have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk about changing paths and life is very really interesting analogy he talks about like you're going to cars going exactly saying or a boat right or two boats going exactly the same direction but one boat just takes a two degree turn just two degrees yeah as they go further down the one boat that took a two degree turn is going to go wider and wider away from the original path and that each decision that you make that's a good decision takes you closer like even though it's just like you're just steering your ship just dirt as you go out it's gonna be a much different path a much different end than if you just stayed on the original path that's incredibly way different and psychedelics makes you go right turn Claud yeah the currents try to bring you back though yes well and the currents kind of bring it back to where you were going so it's like gotta take him again well I've always said get off that car yeah that doing psychedelics is like pressing like the reset button for your brain like control remember that your your desktop reboots and there's only one folder on the desktop and that's that desktop says the folder says my old bullshit and you have two choices if you just like create a completely different desktop look at reality as a completely different or open up my old bullshit and fall back in these familiar patterns I'm very comforting right you know and you those moments after the psychedelic experience are so important to grab and hang on to because it gives you this opportunity to make this new way of thinking like a part of your habit yeah once you get in that habit whether it's fucking you know the 30 days or 60 days or 90 days like people say that once you like have a pattern ingrained in how you behave and think and do it just takes a consistent approach to that pattern and then it becomes like a like a part of you like that's what quit smoking like a fast 30 90 days and you'll be alright right jus say when you have if you go send the same feed three times you just keep sitting there that's your that's your do all-time seed yeah it's like when you take a psychedelic it's like if your life is a polluted city like what are those polluted like what's that destroy Detroit right yeah and it's like the psychedelic all of a sudden takes you in a helicopter outside the pollution and so now you're seeing oh god the air up here is so fresh it's so nice the thing is helicopters gonna land it's gonna put you back out into your city and that's where the job starts which is like shit man how can I clean this fucking thing up and then that's that's like the that's when you start doing things like exercising meditating or that's where you like create just a very simple intention in everything you do which is as much as possible I'm gonna try to alleviate the suffering of people around me as much as I can yeah you know now that might not be a lot it might just be call it does that too we get back from from this last UFC just a little bit of mushrooms was enough that I saw a homeless guy and he's like confirm I was like gonna open my wallet and I only had 20s I was like not fucking there you go yeah that's what it does in those little moments man it shows you that you get prison those moments present themselves to you all day fucking long but if you are stuck in selfishness oh yeah it's real simple little things but it's fun it's a very wonderful that kind of simple intention can really deep pollute your your subjective city that you've been sucking in shitty gas there was one time I saw it that I was that I was uh the only time I was like I ever got to somebody but it was Willy Hunter was on him and he was shitting on fine he was shitting on some like comic who would become like a vine star you know she was a shitty comma but she became like a and he was a cop I mean that's her fun there's six-second like fun videos now I hate him like what about a six-second YouTube video you watch that I don't whatever he was just big shitty or like try to talk about it he couldn't stop then we started with the mushrooms he was like I'm a bad person and never was like nah now you're fine and you kept doing it and then I was like Willy listen you're right that was you being a bad person yeah he's like I'm so sorry but it's like it's okay cuz here's a deal from now on you don't have to be that anymore yeah you can just let that go and let people talk he's like yeah yeah that's what it shows you like you can change but that thing you're talking about where you realize shit I'm a bad person that is there's that contra in the name and Buddhism there's an actual name for that and it's considered to be a very sweet moment where you need that moment it's fertilizer where you need that moment where you look at your life and you feel this very specific kind of sadness because you look at all the times you could have been kinder all the times you could have like called that person back all the times you could have made decisions that were pushing your boat in the direction of a better world and you didn't do it and you should feel sad about that but you shouldn't spend your whole life feeling sad about it you should just spend some time there and look at it and think okay well that's gone the past has been devoured by time there's only this moment now and so from this point forward as much as I can my decisions are going to be based on reducing the suffering of my species and that means I keep your trash you litter before doesn't mean you have to let her keep going server yeah
