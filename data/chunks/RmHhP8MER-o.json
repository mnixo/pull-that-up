the gyro can experience just that contrast between this world that you were so deeply entrenched in for two and two years and eight months mhm like that has got of changed the way you look at human life yeah because the gulf and wealth is so enormous I mean they can't imagine that the amount of money it takes to live in bel-air and the other way around I mean I think it's very difficult for someone in California to imagine how little you can get by on and how close to the earth some most people on the planet live yeah there's a statistic that I read once that I I repeat all the time cuz it still baffles me that if you make more than thirty four thousand dollars a year you're in the 1% of the world of the world yeah possibly yeah and that is probably magnified many fold in Ethiopia yeah in Ethiopia and Somalia I mean it's it's very you know in some ways although they want money all the time especially if they're criminals the money that we're used to sort of greasing our path through life around here it's just not available it's just not not part of the reality what do they do with money when they get it well it depends if if they're pirates they splash out on a fancy car or or cause you see fancy cars sure oh yeah no I was placed in fancy cars I mean only ya know so the Pirates had great cellphones expensive SUVs weapons that they had bought you know from abroad and maybe a weapons Bazaar in Mogadishu or something like that but that's not cheap either they bragged about how the the bullets cost like a dollar each you know and one of them might might have been wearing a band of 500 bullets and the cut is expensive so lots of things cost an enormous amount of money in Somalia but if you're you know if you're a very ordinary Somali Somali you you're getting by on you know less than a dollar a day so there's the ordinary Somalis who are not criminals or not pirates it and then and that's the majority the majority and then you have these pirates that are essentially running through the streets and mercedes-benz like six days they're like gangsters and that's that's actually how once Somali who had some connection to Germany described him to me yeah you know he he was wandering around in Gaul Kyle because it was his hometown and somewheres in ancestral town and he he had met some this was before I got captured it was like they were you know they had wrapped thumping from the SUV's did there really huh American rap who knows and then they caught us we will we went back again and they cut it again G in another car and we got separated again but this time we were held for a longer time and I remember my aunt when she saw is in Mexico she said haha they caught you guys again just jokingly Wow but the third time was like my dad and my mom came up with this crazy idea because we had brothers no we had cousins in San Ysidro California and our mom said you know why don't we just borrow their passports you know to cross and I don't remember this you know I just found out recently that what happened my brother told me my little young brother um we just emmonak a little girl like a full-on little girl because I thought we had like three passports and Wow two were boys one was girl and we took straws I guess and my mom and my aunt they forced my little brother to be a little girl girl they just am a little girl for two weeks just to play around you know they gave him a fake name I'm so-and-so and he was playing you know dancing no I know what you know dancing getting ready playing with little Barbie dolls and so he was preparing preparing bro DeNiro bro Wow getting ready for that row of his life Wow old was he he was 2 at least or 3 male young we we we talk about determinism versus freewill mm-hmm we talk about what are the what what's created what are the possibilities that is created as Sean Carroll and why why do you think the way you think and why are you gonna say the next thing you're gonna say and is it how much of it is biological how much of it is your life experience how much of it is information that's dancing in your head how much of is you interacting with me the last thing that I've said to you yeah so I had I was on the same Harris's podcast be a long conversation about this because he is very anti freewill and I think that it's I disagree with him but I don't care I think I belong I think to be honest there's easy it's boring really I think it's boring because here's what I think it's boring because there's two questions one question is how did the world work and the other question is what words should be attached to how the world works and the first one is interesting second one is kind of boring then when I agree on how the world works right but I am what philosophers call a compatibilist when it comes to free will which which is I don't think that I have some ways of thinking my way into overcoming the laws of physics right like I'm made of atoms made of particles that obey the laws of physics if I talk about myself as a large collection of atoms and particles obeying the laws of physics then clearly there's no free will there's just the solution to the equations and sometimes the wavefunction branches and there's now two of me but that's whatever it is there's no spark of consciousness that lets me overcome what the equation says gonna happen but guess what that's not a fruitful way to go through your life in terms from talking about human beings when you meet somebody for the first time and you say like you know what do you do who are you they don't give you a list of their atoms and say what every atom is doing and say let you let go ahead and solve furnitures equation to figure out what's gonna happen next right you tell a story you say like you're a person you know you grew up in a certain place you have a certain job stuff like that you dramatically condense the information about who you are into a few salient points and among those salient points are I am a person who thinks and makes decisions every person in the world no matter how anti freewill they are talks about people as if they make decisions and the reason they do is because that's how people are that's the best way to talk about people it's not like just a compromise like if if you don't know the atoms and molecules in somebody's body and you're not infinitely computationally powerful so you can predict the future then it's correct to talk about people as agents who make decisions we call that free will I call that free will most philosophers call it free will if you don't want to call it free will be my guest I don't really know and he would say squids this is how we learn to play what the fuck we play and nobody could touch the Bad Brains musically energy on stage nothing and I would see these dudes I'd be like what the fuck are you into and then the role models that like you said you know we need good role models yes there's you know there's so many fucked up people that these kids want to emulate today you know and I see it because I came up in New York I worked in all the underground hip-hop clubs I work for the Pope apart I used to deliver pot so all the rap stars I delivered pot my friend just dude Matt worked for Tristar he's like yo meet me at the Boston comedy club there's this black comedian there and he's gonna be fuckin huge and I was show up on my bike and you know who you know who the fuck it was their spell hey fuck you pal Dave fucking Chappelle and when he did half-baked did you notice that he put the weed delivery guy in all bike gear well fuck you think he got that phone I used to show up I never carried a bag I showed up with a $4,000 carbon frayberg carbon fiber frame and I had a black water bottle and all the weed bags was in the two water bottles so it just looked like I was a cyclist out on a motherfucking out on a ride when Dave Chappelle yeah and then Dave Dave Chappelle we didn't he blew up so fast Matt Haim was the guy's name he was the publicist at Tristar pitches and then I delivered to him in the Boston Comedy Club and within like months he was living in some palatial fucking spot on like 2nd Avenue and 15th in the and I might go had a fuck did you get from there to Haiti just you know there was one flight to where he was like in the center of the Octagon control and beaten are striking and like I forget who wasn't might've been the demon might've been somebody else but he uh he actually stopped and step back and put his back to the fence and say come on come on let's fight on the fence now and he like backed his self Oh Stefan bond that's right and that's we got caught with the spinning elbow was it uh no Stephan Bonnar tried to spinning back-kick him and he just slid out of the way and they went right back to the fence and went come on yeah that's what it was exactly fucked him up yeah I think he hit him with the need of the body and then dropped him and then and then beat the shit out of him yeah that was just he was just so calm and relaxed in there and Bonner was so stiff in the eye and I think that was it yeah I worked with Stefan for a bunch of fights I didn't work with I don't recall that was also fight where I think Bonner pissed hot I think he had an opportunity yeah I think you just like listen I got some injuries I'm just gonna juice it up dude pissed hot is better than shit hot because when he fought Sam hoger at the Thomas Mac Arena you fucking shit himself during the fight Sam Sam Hogue I was like bro it's like on top and they grabbed when he's like probably fucking stinking he's like yes I did the worst pot about as we come back Sayed you know the Thai cups they like the string up the crab the butt crack he's like coach get my cup and I was like bro you're on your own cut it off dude I'm good hilarious dude I got the corner I think for that fight with the great Colin crazy at the time several times dude when we when we went to the went to the Reebok uniforms and dudes were wearing white I was like no white shorts like stay away from white shorts Doc Brown I think you all dude you well Bert mérida initiative yeah I think he sharted one of his fights too one time michael Chiesa when he fought by neil darish right before the fight start he leans over to me goes dude I remember that before the walk dude they almost had to
