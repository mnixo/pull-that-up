the Joe Rogan experience oh I forgot to tell you this what so when I was I was having some pretty good thoughts on this asset watching some different bands The Killers by the way I fucking killed it mmm sob Charlie you see stuff in like when you're out there on psycho dogs a truth I call them universal truths where you just like yes that is real that is right 20% and it's hard to bring that ship back into this realm you know to understand it it's trying to get us kicked off YouTube a third car so it's hard when you come back to be like Oh solve the truth of something and then it's a and you can't express it and when people come back when they're around you they say something you're like what and they're like they realized I get frustrated they're not saying it right yeah and then it's slowly going away yeah so when I was there in that place sometimes I try to remember like when you get back say this to this person so that state told me to tell you that mm is one of the realest MCS I'm not gonna argue with it I don't know but it was like that could be a funny bit dude there's a funny bit in there like about how like some things are just in the moment they seem so profound fuck is wrong with me Eminem was one of the realest emcees well I would agree with that those he's very very real seems fairly real and Leary almost certainly played a role but I think it's slightly ironic that he's a journalist and didn't really go that deep into the role that journalists played in all of this which was humongous you know journalists are sculptors of public opinion and it became the standard way of reporting on any of these things to say that they're bad to sensationalize it and to not have any consideration for what that would do because any time a journalist writes him scare story they can really mess with drug policy in a serious way it might seem like nothing like oh there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn and they overdosed on some obscure synthetic cannabinoid amb foo bhinneka who cares about amb fuu bhinneka no big deal say that it turns people into zombies and if it gets thrown into schedule one who care is not a big deal well that's a very short-sighted way of thinking about all of this because that's exactly what happened with psychedelics and then we're not learning from the mistakes of the past that just because something it's fun to sensationalize and talk about how dangerous it is at this moment doesn't mean that 10 years from now we're gonna recognize it it has serious therapeutic potential and we made a big mistake outlawing it and I think a lot of that also comes from this sort of us versus them mentality that people have where it's cannabis is good synthetic cannabinoids are bad well synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be bad for cannabis to be good cannabis can be good without something else being bad to counterbalance it you don't need to hate something to justify your love of cannabis and this whole hatred of synthetic cannabinoids I think is totally misdirected because these are products of prohibition that most people wouldn't even want to use in the first place and when they do use them they don't know what they're taking they don't know what dose they're consuming and so of course they're having bad experiences that would happen with almost any drug caffeine included if people just consumed enormous unmeasured doses without having any idea of what they were getting into and so they're thrown into Schedule one well what happens if 30 years from now once the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is being really seriously explored we find out that that amb Phu bhinneka that everyone was saying turned homeless people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 turns out to activate a certain subtype of the cb1 receptor that's especially useful for Parkinson's disease or something like that then we're going to regret having done that so I think people have to be very careful anytime you say anything negative about a drug you have to be very very careful because the implications can be enormous I think that the best stance in all this is to not speak ill of drugs like a true drug enthusiast but also if you really think about the fact that we are in a world where people have to go to work to do a job that by the way man if there is a dude you need to get on this podcast and there's a book that you would love David Graeber wrote book called bullshit jobs this guy is a fucking genius man in this book bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena of how many many people are working in jobs that don't do anything for the world or the company they're working for and it's not like this judgemental thing where he's like yeah that's a bullshit job you're a bla bla bla he's one of the he's like an anthropologist so he's very precise but one of the qualifications for your job to be a bullshit job is you know that it's really kind of a worthless job it's not really doing anything and like the companies have gotten so fucking big that they they end up having like departments or people running departments or extra employees that don't really need to be there at all and they have to pretend to be to work that's what he writes about he writes it the if you really want to torture a person not only give them like the job of like you know pouring a glass of water and an empty glass and pouring it back but then add to it that they have to deceive their boss into thinking that they're like doing an important job or they lose their job so these not only are these like some corporations and companies scanning your piss to see if you're taking a substance that is allowing you to connect with home what you actually are they are also demanding that you spend many hours a day lying to them that you're doing work that you're not doing if you're fucking efficient you know and this is another thing Graber writes about forgive me David Graeber fun anyway I'd misconstrue this I read your writings stoned but the but the the the the other fuckin element to it that is absolutely atrocious and fucking horrible is that these substances are connecting us to home they don't want us to be in those states and they're asking us to fucking lie all day and you know what psychedelic means the atom ology of psychedelic no it means mind manifesting or soul manifesting right so a psychedelic connects us potentially with the truth what we are our identity right and these companies they're asking us to lie to be the opposite of our debt identities to wear weird a suitors are some kind of dress code and to sit in a desk where because you're efficient you get your job done in 45 minutes and for the next six hours you got to sit and type and pretend that you're working it was an ongoing maneuver of mine we'd have these hippie writers come in to take notes and I'd say yeah I play this Fender Stratocaster as I hold up my Gibson Birdland which was known for and they'd write down he played in Gibson Stratocaster and there's no such thing as it gives a Stratocaster so I was having fun with dirt bag anti journalists so now I'm invited to High Times Magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug so I go in and this guy is you know in his interviews typically so uh so tell me about this i Amboy Dukes what is it like a band I mean yeah it's like a band so it's almost exactly like a band so anyhow he started talking about when I'm with the mc5 and the Stooges and we would party and I go yeah man I was snorting something I don't know what it was man I just got higher than a kite and he goes wow you think I might have been crystal meth and I went yeah that's what they called it I never supported Christine I just made up just went nuts and I we went into the war thing and I go I don't know anything about war I'm I'm a guitar player but I went down for my draft physical and when I went into the booth to give my urine sample I made sure I eat Mexican food all week so instead of pissin in the urine cup I took a big dump in it was green and went all over the place the guy went wow really yeah really and so I made up this story for High Times Magazine you know the great magazine of int good information and and then it turned out that my drummer KJ night God blessing me to actually admitted this and and testified that that's what he did we thought it was the funniest thing in the world were teenagers and this guy went into the draft physical just an absolute near-death lump of shit to get out of the draft and we thought it was funnier in hell we weren't paying attention to important things in life and so the the Ted hating liberal press started quoting the High Times Magazine and quoting an ex-girlfriend who claimed that I adopted her that her I adopted my girlfriend have you read that one I did read that what I forgot about it so this kind of stuff I was like you adopted her so you could take her on tour with you know so I could fuck her that's what the story was but that's a absolutely not works that's not don't think it makes it easier to cut them once you adopt them I didn't adopt anybody right I never shit my pants since I was I think eight months old I've never been with an underage girl since I was underage I'm not a racist and what else they say oh and they same that the claim that I made Courtney Love blow me when she was 12 I think she claimed that I yeah I never met Courtney Love you can tell I don't have a rash you've got to be kidding me they just make this shit up because they know I'm so good at bringing my basic conservative agenda forward that they have to go full Saul Alinsky and lie and lie and lie and if you go to Wikipedia to find out about Ted Nugent they will repeat these lies their lies and every one of those things every one of those things if I had done and I go yeah it was awesome but I didn't do any of those things anyone can edit Wikipedia the boss very strange I think she might have edited it yes so I'm glad we got that so this thing is just persistent forever are the obviously it's stuck in your craw cuz you wanted to bring it up at the verge of taking my crotch just it's a fascinating example of the dishonesty and the anti journalism agenda driven anti-american anti Ted anti Second Amendment anti-freedom buffoonery they exist I think it makes for an interesting podcast exchange I think so it's not in my craw it's not even in my universe but I notice it it's hysterical [Applause]
