oh yes we're live Tomi buns let's do it do did you um did you go to the comedy store at all yesterday yesterday no I'm going tonight was heavy was it heavy is it heavy yeah I imagine it was heavy the day after Mitzi died that closed the comedy store down on Wednesday and yesterday was the first day was open it was heavy I imagine that's the first time it's been closed in a law like they never closed I can't remember the last time I was closed it was heavy you could just feel it in the air oh yeah yeah I felt it was everybody talking about it - it was bombing - really not on my show wasn't too bad when the Oh our man it was thick it's in the air yeah no that's real sadness oh yeah Paulie would never seen Paulie cry he was there yeah Paulie was crying in the on stage no he didn't go on stage he's not gonna go on stage for a while I wouldn't have gone on stage if I wasn't getting ready for the special I would have definitely taken the night off yeah if I could have you know if I wasn't earlier forty people weren't going to see it it just felt I didn't feel silly you know I mean right I like to feel silly back to the hill loose loose in a good mood happy everybody felt vulnerable everybody felt you know I mean out of all the people in the world that are not comedians she's into the number one most important figure in awe of comedy yeah that wasn't a comedian and then even when you say the ones that were comedians damn she's in the running for number one even with the the comedian's I know she shaped so many you know she built that whole that place and and and she she you know they call her godmother but it really was like that because she advised so many people and and actually here's the thing a lot of people have advice for you but it shakes yeah she was giving good advice to people I mean look how many people hire hold her in that regard yeah you know legendary people are like she's it man universally yeah yeah there's no one go Mitzi shoring shit no no it says unless she didn't pass you yeah I met her once and she was like no thanks what year was this two thousand six or seven oh yeah I remember well here's the thing when I met her she was um she was already like it was at the end of when she would be at the store she yeah she was not a hundred percent doing well no she was rough around when you would see or she would be shaking it would be very hard yeah I just you know when someone's gone you stop and think about those times when you were around them you just like I wish I took it in and realized more that she wasn't sure only gonna be there one day yeah did you guys have a good relationship yeah we did I mean up until the seven years that I wasn't there and even then it was never her fault I called her the day that whole men see a thing broke out and I called her up and told her everything I told her the guy's been stealing material and the whole deal and every comedian feels so uncomfortable working around them that they flashed a light whenever he's in the room so that no one does their material you just start working the crowd I go it's a fucking war zone there it's terrible and her exact words were well just stay away from what time you want to go up tonight knows that yeah and I I said and whenever you want to put me up she gave me a spot and then the Comedy Store called me an hour two hours later or whatever it was and said I was banned listen I go what the fuck are you talking about I just got off the phone with Mitzi she gave me a ten o'clock spot they're like well minutes he wasn't aware of everything that was happening I go the fuck she wasn't I told her I told her everything I go who's running store now are you you run in the store the fuck out of here I'm not working for you and you guys are gonna ban me because I out at a joke thief like this is you guys sell art you got a thief of art that's in your midst yeah you did you understand that what a big deal that is someone is making millions of dollars off stealing other people's ideas and you guys are just gonna let it go because he sells tickets the fuck out of here but my quarrel was never with her I was with the other guys if you guys speak after that it happened I never spoke to her again Wow Wow what said yeah well by the time I came back she was real rough yeah real rough you know she had other things to worry about of course yeah I just had what I had that one showcase there's my only direct experience with her when I met her in 1994 she gave me a lot of good advice she did mmm she she always gave me good spots like hard fucking spots always like after dice after Martin Lawrence after anybody who would crush I'd go on after him after Chris Rock after this guy after that guy anyway that would crush she if she liked you she would give you the the death spots really yes well but she realized that you have to you gotta eat shit man you got to develop you can't just have it's like there's an analogy with fighting like you can't just fight people that you could beat the shit out of you have to fight people that are gonna test you sure cuz otherwise you're going to develop like a unrealistic sense of your abilities and an unrealistic sense of other people's abilities and you have to you have to you have to feel what it's like I think is an up-and-coming comic like you start thinking you're pretty good and then you have to see someone who's really good and you go oh my god I'm terrible yeah and then you go on after them and that feeling of just total ineptitude or you just feel so shitty and clunky and awful you have to feel that to just it's that's the number one motive like bombing is one of the best things that can happen to a comedian that feeling of following someone great is basically it almost feels like shame shame shame shame like someone goes hey do you want to feel humiliated for ya like it's fucking shame man yeah I see it all the time - I watched it the other day at the improv I watched somebody bomb they went on after somebody crushed and they just which is choking like right away and you just go wolf you got a reexamine yeah but it's a gift it really is it helps you yeah those moments are gifts those moments of failure are gifts they just feel like shit at the time but you got to realize that that like every like leap that I've made in my act or my you know my careers median has come from a humiliation mm-hmm like you hid that humiliation they go fuck you come back strong in that that's with everything else to totally because yeah as long as you actually think about it and try to address it yeah you know because it is it's devastating mm-hmm it's it's only not helpful if you go well I'm just not gonna even put any thought into that experience at all some guys do do that of course they lock it out lock it out block everything out and they never go anywhere then they're still doing the same 15 yeah yeah yeah what's up defense mechanism you just get scared and you can sort of just autopilot your way through some half-assed bullshit yeah meanwhile you're about to go do you have a week man one week from today so I'm ready I'm doing it ready in a cycle around when you're doing it you know what you just did yours and then you know there's a couple other guys Joey's getting ready to do one everybody's kind of get Joey lined up for one she always got something cooking we're trying to figure out what's happened and either he's gonna do something with Netflix or I'm gonna direct it and then if if Netflix doesn't do anything with them I'm just gonna finance something and that's I'm enough just we're gonna take over the Ice House for three days it isn't fucking go bananas just let him go he's on fire right now yeah he lost a ton of weight do you see him no I haven't seen him in that so I'm like I don't know month ago or so last night I was like holy shit dude he's like I'm down thirty pounds so when you're holding shit you could tell he's it's Weight Watchers to my vitamins counting points yeah those eggs zero points for eggs son he only eats the yolk he cuts so you see him cut the egg white out you're like oh yeah egg white he's like throws it off the plate he's like yolks I'm like wait everybody eats the egg white he's like that's for pussies you know yeah that egg white thing is bullshit they realize mostly protein and well the whole idea was about it's just it's hard to shake off old ideas when it comes to nutrition and the old idea was that dietary cholesterol is bad for you but it's not right dietary cholesterol is actually good for you it sounds crazy to hear and also by the way I mean I know this sounds like a real simpleton thing to say but how do they get this shit wrong for so long you know good it's a good question it's like all we hear for years and years is this is there's a doctors are telling you to do this and then it feels like one day like all we got all that shit wrong you can eat someone like Chris crasher or dr. Rhonda Patrick or like Rob wolf like real nutrition experts yeah really understand the way nutrients like the way that your body absorbs them and what's what's necessary what's not necessary what they're finding out is that first of all there was you know about the whole thing where the sugar industry paid off scientists to say that saturated fat was the cause of heart disease no you didn't know about that oh my god I was in the New York Times it's crazy in 1950s sugar industry paid off scientists to take the blame away from sugar and put it on saturated fat I know the sugar lobby is insanity and that that's the only thing we haven't seen on the percentages of daily value is the percentage of that sugar you're supposed to have yeah in other words when you see I see like you know percentage program yeah yeah and then what percentage of and then sugar it'll be like 52 grams percentage not yes so yeah yeah um they fucked everybody up because they got everybody thinking that it was saturated fat that was a problem when it's really refined carbohydrates bread pasta your body converts that into sugar and then sugar itself so there was that there was you know that and then there's also there's a reality of refined carbohydrates mixed with saturated fat it's not a good combination when you mix the two of them together it is not good for you right especially for some people you know different people's body and bodies absorb it differently but when you're on a high fat low carb diet it's very important that you that's how you do it you can't cut that out you don't want to go high fat and refined carbohydrates and sugars as well it's not good for you and that that is there's like a there's a mechanism to it that dr. Rhonda Patrick explained but essentially it's just terrible for you yeah if I have I have high and if I go one week just not even go crazy but just like yeah I'll have bread with this and like that like in three days I'll wait eight pounds more that's crazy I can't do it it's crazy how the weight just piles on you yeah yeah it's bananas and speaking of weight Burt special is also coming out speaking away yeah it's coming out I think why does it have to do with weight I was just saying Burt's fat I was just I was just associating words dude that but I think it's because you're a hashtag hashtag burt is enormous yeah it's great I love that he's also shirtless in this one he took his shirt off and special to be able to see the background being different it's true he's so crazy but yeah that was coming out and Netflix this summer I think does he just always take his shirt off now I don't know I think on I think when it's a big like if he's doing his weekend it's a big show yes what is that I think he's doing spots he doesn't necessarily do what is this Jamie the pool what is wrong with your microphone yeah fix that sun-hee Oh oh my goodness he's swimming yeah okay watched him swim why are you showing us this Jamie just to fuck is wrong with you Jamie just follows everything Burt does he does yeah he's a disciple he's a machinist he's no that's they call them it fixed Mike bro you're you're an audio engineer fix your mic you might need a new mic yeah yeah I got some backup mics I can drive over yeah I mean your mom's house right down the street might demonstrate how about now try it nothing don't hear a goddamn nothing hey there's a little crackling no yeah I think it's this actually a fader yeah Oh mmm so we were talking before the show about you doing a whole new hour now yeah how long did it take you to concoct a whole new hour well I mean it's definitely still building you know right it's new it's new and I and I know I'm like I know it's 15 away from being something where I'm like wow this is a solid you know 70 minutes show which is what how I like to do it yeah so it's gonna be months still but it's I did an hour at the Tabernacle last week of it's all new and I did 10 that I didn't that I did before that I didn't put in my special that's mine too man that's you late nice I mean it was I've been working on it for I guess I since December no you know like around then December January for a so four months five months it was a blast that was one of the most it was so much fun because I had so much anxiety going into it oh yeah because it was the first big show of new I've been doing some Club weekends and you know clubs are just different that's different and you can get away with more you can get away with more and you're more exposed in a big room oh yeah so I was like I mean the night before I was like what if no this works like that that kind of feeling I was like what am i doing and you know I woke up early that morning and I was just like no it'll be all right now yeah it'll be fine now it's gonna be fucking terrible I was going I was going back and forth like that on that show but it ended up being just utter chaos I mean they were just they were all about it so it was really fun I mean I just it was it was so much more fun because I had that feeling of uncertainty right right yeah of course so that's one of the cool things about doing a special set like you exist you get so introspective you examine every bit and with a microscope you go over it with a fine-tooth comb for like weeks before you shoot yeah he starts second-guessing everything kind in that week of and that you know on the last one I did in Denver I did a show Wednesday in Brea Thursday I did Oakland and then Friday I came into Denver I did a midnight show at the works downtown whoa and then I and every show is different and you're like this is terrible yeah but then you know and then you have those two tapings and I think every this was I did my that was my third I think our one and you know I think almost all three the first taping is over and you're like this good that's fine yeah we could use it and then every time the second one is just loose yeah yeah that's once you get it in the can that's why I decided to do four that's smart yeah because I feel like you do four and then one of them's gonna be like a real show true yeah and the fun would have fun doubt what I found out those if I have for the first one turns out to be a real show because you're not as not as under as much pressure right you know all right yeah yeah because if you have two you have two barrels like you know you get the one done and then you how you feel like I got it now I could be loose for the second one but if you have four you feel like yeah let's see what happens with this one yeah and you could at least that's how San Francisco was when I did the film war it's a good spot I won yeah it's great spot but it's a high ceiling I'm really excited about the Wilbur Wilbur's kind of a high ceiling too but the Wilbur I like the Wilbur each place has a low ceiling that's three stacks of people and then like you have a high ceiling and there's a high ceiling among amongst the above the front people in the very front row but it's basically the three 300 seat comedy stacked on top of each other that's what it's like such a great room rocking amazing I think I'm looking at me am i next one will be a while from now but I've already started talking about with my guy about how I you know even though on the tour I'll do some big rooms ago I think I want to go to like a 1200 seater to actually shoot it yeah I think those those are in my experience as a recent that thousand to fifteen hundred seat venue is the most fun show yeah it's like where it's big enough where there's crazy energy but small enough you still kind of connect with the audience well sometimes those big shows though are crazy fun - like I did 6,000 seats in Dallas fuck yeah me and Tony and Ian we're pulling up and this is a big fucking traffic jam or like goddamn we're all these people going and then we realize holy shit they're going to the show coming to see me that's crazy it was very bizarre yeah that place was hyped up that was a lot of fun I did the Sony Theater last year and that was a three thousand cedar which means rano oh yeah that's great that was a great great like for like a pretty big size great energy did you ever do Massey Hall no I never didn't ask you all hmm some of these places you get to work at it's like they're like museums yeah well that what a burn Akal is yeah I mean that we were talking about okay imagine if the Baptist ministers that used to give sermons heard what I was saying on their stage a night like how upset they keep I mean they those guys that's that's what that was yeah it's a Baptist Church yeah I mean it doesn't have an organ behind us I still have the pipes they're still there yeah it's over 100 year old church it's a fucking amazing venue yeah it really is yeah we're super lucky we get to work these places I did the King's Theatre in Brooklyn last weekend how was that Oh amazing that's old right oldest fuck from the 1900s early 1900s and then it closed down from like 77 at 2005 and then in 2005 they started renovating it it's a long time to close a long time it was just sitting there and then they took forever to renovate it and then they reopened it in 2015 2010 they've restarted somewhere oh my god dude I'm telling you you walk around the place and it's just lavish how many seasons yet 3,000 oh my god yeah it's gorgeous man that's in Brooklyn and it's in proclaim Brooklyn like Brooklyn well gorgeous stunning like the inside of it is amazing not totally designed for comedy yeah you know what's normally there what kind of like I don't know bands probably really sure some comedy I think I think Chris Rock did it I think some people do comedy there but it's you know what I think they've only been doing shows there since 2015 so what is house yeah this is their calendar Jaime's boys how do you say their names yeah you're fucking thanks broken just faded it sounds better I did their shows on there I did their show a couple weeks ago I was amazing yeah those guys are hilarious really yeah there's so much fun they are a really good time and they have they have such good rapport like chemistry together they're a blast yeah they're a blast yeah yeah and that show is it's a fun show they do like you know they just do commentary on a bunch of bullshit whatever current events weird shit happening and then they just bring a guest on and they're very loose very funny guys man that's good here yeah need more good people yeah if you go to if you go to BK next time you do is that what he do it yeah okay yeah the Vice office is there in Brooklyn yeah vibe I haven't had much time to do anything man yeah well you're scrambling a little busy scrambling yeah no it's good it's good man speaking of current events is the president going to jail they're trying to figure this out is he going to jail huh it seems like seems like some serious shit is going down hmm it sure feels like it it's you know what it feels like it's really interesting it's like a it's like you're watching a show it's a really entertaining show yeah I mean I don't mind that house of cards is in production cuz this is a good show we're watching yeah I mean it's ramping up whatever whatever is going on it's like they're building towards an event and it seems like they have been planning this like they're systematically attacking different parts of his administration getting people to fold getting people to turn state's evidence yeah getting people to you know to plead guilty and they're slow which is like there's no way that the end result could be like and that's it we're done this is as far as we got it feels like there's definitely shoes gonna drop right I mean the crazy thing is they're gonna get him for campaign financing because of his attorney paying off stormy Daniels I think the the thing that I read I could be getting this wrong because that it's that payoff within a certain number of days of the election right that starts to break a finance law I guess because they said that that payment was with in a certain number of days of the election so what it means is that it's affecting the election potentially is what yet what the accusation could be isn't that interesting it's like you're paying someone to affect opinion mm-hmm and so that's like it's a campaign finance violations yeah it's also amazing that I don't know I mean I guess at the time somebody comes to you with that check and you're like sure but in retrospect think of how much leverage she would have had don't you go back then and and she gets to say you want me to keep this thing silent no problem but neither up that check well how about Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly paid one lady 32 million what did he do that squeezing an ass cheek right what did he do what did he do first of all how much money does he have yeah 32 million is like just pay it just pay it off write it off yeah as what is that a year sour they have a lot of fucking settlements baby Roger Ailes and and have you seen the bit I'm doing on Fox News no that's one of my favorite Bailey oh I love dude this would be in the new one yeah yeah yeah yeah no I look forward to seeing their so it's such a fascinating little place over there yeah and right now their what they're doing for the most part not every show but most the show other than Tucker Carlson I think is one of the few guys over there that is he seems he seems the most reasonable really yes if you think he's more reasonable than like Shepard Smith Wow I never watched that guy well that guy is I'm saying has a he's there but he seems to have like a little more back like unbiased balance I think if you were doing an ecstasy with Shepard Smith he tried to kiss you I hope so I've been losing weight yeah but the rest of it my point is the rest of this show seems like state-run propaganda here's and here's the thing he it's it's also when it's not a secret it's kind of fascinating right there's not a secret that he has real relationships with multiple on-air talent because president is like I'm friends with Jeanine Pirro I'm really good friends with Sean Hannity mhm I'm really good I watch yeah every day I watch a morning show called Fox & Friends and as they report things I tweet out like policy change based on this morning show and it's not secret like no just if you see the segment and then he's like like it was like this aired at 6:30 a.m. 6:30 - he's like we're gonna have to do something about this shit and they're like they just did a segment on it and then that also throws his aides and his staff curveballs because they'll be not expecting that he's going to bring this up right he sees it on TV and there and then they have to go like yeah of course we were gonna do that because yeah it's fucking nuts he watches a lot of cable TV they say he watches eight hours a day he doesn't like to go to the office early and that's one of my other favorite ones like there they had like John Kelly has been like you've got to get here earlier I said I said that for a while he was showing up at 11:00 and that they were trying to get him to come at 9:00 and then I think they settled on a han or something yeah 9:00 that's ridiculous yeah it's so interesting into a war having him as the president will be very beneficial yeah yeah because I think that we're gonna realize how fucking crazy it is to give one person so much power yeah based on a popularity contest it does kind of highlight the absurdity of not just of him of the presidency right completely absurd yeah we would never do it that way today if we had no government at all if we lived in some sort of bizarro universe where a government had never been established we decided enough is enough we can't live with Anarchy anymore we need to have some sort of a system of rules checks and balances and put it we'd never say all right let's have a popularity contest see one dude and let's let let get financed yeah by giant groups of people no that's it's all it's ridiculous right it's so fucked I know this and it seems like everybody you know agrees yeah that's fucked but never changes yeah I've been hearing for decade-plus about campaign finance reform stuff and then it's still you know powerful super PACs yeah you know collect them Oh we'll just find a loophole and then we get a money in that way I mean nothing changes well the just the amount of money and influence it's all tied in together to try to completely shake that off you'd have to get people to be 100% ethical they would have to say you know what this is just not the way to run the government it's not right for the people yeah they're not gonna do that well it's just too much influence it just shows you how sneaky and snaky the whole thing is but it's also really interesting too because we're gonna be forced with this guy because of all this fucking chaos we're gonna be forced to like reexamine how we do things oh yeah maybe it'll be a little change for the next president well I agree yeah I'm sorry the real worry would be that he would get through eight years then one of his sons would take over I guess it's not out of the realm of possibility oh not even a little I have this theory that I think he actually in a way will really relish and enjoy the midterms in November going Democrat because that totally feeds into his like just they're attacking yeah and like being able to be like course nothing gets done cuz he's fucking constant or in office now and I think that he would really actually almost enjoy because he loves combative things you know like a combative relationship I think he's actually going to if if it goes that way I think he will like really enjoy it I think so but I also think that he likes winning though he does like winning of course he likes winning and it's it's a it's like compulsive you can tell that when they'll you know that is Oprah are you gonna run she's like no he's like I hope she runs kick her fucking ass too he can't help himself you know he has that kind of competitive side to him ya know he definitely does well they say they don't want him to testify because they know they're gonna catch him lyin mm-hmm like you can't do it yeah all his lawyers have said like a hundred percent don't do that he was like I'll think about it which means that like he you know cuz he he says that a lot with uh you can tell when they have like those off-the-cuff yeah you know press when he lets the press in they'll ask him something we'll see what happens which is the totally like I might do it I might not but you know that everybody on his side is like please don't at this point they might not even be they might be like go ahead yeah I want to yeah go ahead tough guy yeah go talk it go talk who knows man I'll get another job how amazing would it be to watch that deposition or in you know interview do you remember when Bill Clinton was grilled about Monica Lewinsky the word is yeah yes amazing and just the term sexual relations not as what I understand it the way I understand the word that's not it yeah no I mean that was fascinating he's so shameless well not just that it's just it seems so strange yeah back then in the 1990s to be able to watch the president in video get grilled and clearly they wanted to release his videos to humiliate him of course you know but it was just bizarre it's like I've never never seen anything like this you've never seen a sitting president like getting grilled by people and especially about sex and the shift mode like a you know we knew him as this obviously you'd see him on the campaign trail or meeting people he's like this super charming right like personable guy yeah really good at being basically a celebrity you know really good at that and he's really you know I knows how to be a politician but in that deposition I mean he switched onto lawyer mode yeah and and like I'm not here to charm you motherfucker because he was spin on is what is is mean isn't it like I remember just I mean I'm a kid I think I was in high school watching that me like how does anyone struggle what is this and I didn't know he was like playing a game with them too you know oh yeah well they were playing lawyer games yeah total war games yeah Trump can't do that he's not smart enough to do that no he's not a lawyer so he's not yeah I wouldn't say he's not I don't think that Trump is not smart I think he's smart especially when you listen to interviews of him from the past like he's like there's some interviews from the past very articulate yeah and obviously been very successful in business but I don't think he's an interested in expanding his horizons mentally I don't think he's interested in reading no I don't think he I also think that he really 100% does the did run his business off of instinct yeah and and like gut in relationships and yeah loyalty and the stuff that he's promoting when they say like you can't do that here he's like turrican yeah you know my camera I'm the president fuck off that's people want it do you want to read this briefing no I don't like to be briefed I don't like to read yeah he doesn't like to read they say they put the word Trump in his briefings a bunch of times just so that he reads it was about me hmm that's what else about me it does feel like it's gonna star report this is what ya bled to star yeah all right this would be like Mueller's report that would be coming out maybe later this year something like that is that the equivalent I don't know yeah I guess if they get if they get to a rapture special council report yeah sure the Mueller thing is so strange cause technically can he fire Mueller well that's there was a big article about whether or not so the White House said that they believe that he does have the power to do that and you don't know if that's I mean that you would think that that means that they're sent he just wants to put that signal out there like I can do this but there was other legal minds that said that he couldn't do it that he would have to get right because sessions has recused himself from this the the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is it and yeah that he would have to get him to do it and then they they said that you know that he would would not do that unless I mean Rosen Singh said he wouldn't do it unless Mueller had done you know misconduct right so and that if the president tried to do that he would resign in which case they would have to get another person either a point to do it or whoever he's below him to do it so it's a it's a really it's a good episode it really is yeah I can't remember a time where I felt like there was nobody at the wheel more than I do now yeah it does feel like chaos okay like it's there's all people that are in positions you know there's a Secretary of State there's the chief of staff there's all these there's all these different people that are in positions but it feels like a like make-believe and you know what happens it because this happens everywhere we get lost in our experience of it because we live here yeah I'm really fascinated by how it looks outside of here oh yeah and I get it must really seem like an even crazier show oh it's God too and then Mike Pence is holding Bible study classes for the first time in a hundred years in the White House what yeah really and women aren't allowed to read what yes no no women read the Bible there this is for real and when the women are not teaching there's no women teaching these Bible study no it doesn't man he doesn't like dinner with that mama there no no women next to him at dinner Mike Pence must be an animal I'm just trying to keep it together and just backed up just shit Hagen yeah just gotta keep boy no dinner with women no women Mike Pence sponsors White House Bible study led by anti LGBTQ anti women extremists this is real ah this is what we got to be careful for folks we've got to be careful of this this guy could be president and that ain't no better this is this guy is fucking radical radical fundamentalist Christianity yeah boy who when you see that little bit bigger what does it say Bible study group led by Ralph drollinger an extremist who says LGBTQ people are illegitimate Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo Attorney General Jeff Sessions and education secretary Betsy Davos attended the weekly sessions in Washington while drollinger claims he doesn't tell members he's advised in the past how to vote he notes that he would in quotes put the blueprint on the engineers seat on the train why I don't know what's going on hmm people look to their faith as a source of guidance and inspiration and LGBTQ people and our family and friends are no different drill injures brand of faith however seeks to drive a wedge between the LG that LGBT first of all how did trans people get locked in with queer people or gay people isn't that a different thing it is I think they're just all marginalized Marg escapes yeah but they form do you know there's a - an A+ do you know no yes now it's a and a plus this is like oh this is an abbreviated list but we really want to be completely not inclusive you have to include asexual people as well they feel marginalized because they're not trans they're not gay they're not straight they just not sex wait why cute queue for queer queer but why is that different in gay and less because it's just some odd okay I don't know what is queer I don't know I thought that men write genetic a evil right now are screaming at us I know this is engendered assholes I know cisgender white white privilege assholes pretty wealthy - um I don't know what queue why that is different why what is queer what is the definite what it's just cuz we're used to be just gang gay right so Google what is the queue an LGBTQ and then let's get into a and a plus this is asexual and is a plus by the way a huge thanks I got a huge gift goodie bag can I say thanks to the roots of fight guys oh there's a great song on right no that's crazy see sure who a Chaba sure we didn't even plan those he's not playing this phrasing I came home to a bunch of free shit okay LGBT g/l or GLBT hmm what is initialism initialism I never said that word before that stands for lesbian gay bisexual transgender to recognize this inclusion a popular variant adds the cue for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity that makes you like I'm not sure it's a handy dick yeah yeah I might be guy it might be I might be I'm not sure at least that's an answer it's fence sitters yeah I'm here I'm there they should have f2 for fence it and my genders whatever yeah what is it move me a fluid gender fluid that's my favorite you're a girl one day a boy the next day I had somebody email me to they said at work they said you know you can pick your gender for emails for company emails so he like this person picked a gender he's like I think I'm gonna do this and I said what if your gender is changing I think you should send them an email every day so you'd be like today yeah yeah he's like I'm gonna try it see what happens what is it they can't say shit I guess they can't no you can't say shit all you have to do just keep a straight face yeah today identifies a woman Pete you literally can do whatever you want definitely yeah which I mean and then people argue that you should have the right to do that to change whatever you want I guess I mean it's not convenient for everyone but I guess you can yeah I guess you can it's not the worst thing in the world no but when when do we call nonsense hmm yeah I guess there would be a limit because if you'd switched it on the our people that get the fuck out of here yeah yeah well what if you decide that you like identify with things that aren't even real like elves does elf Kim it's a good point I think I would have you just decide that I'm an out but again if somebody came in your office Peschel II if they were a valuable employee right and they were like I'm an elf mm-hmm and they had a straight face right and and you're like you're a high producer company okay but if someone comes in your office and they're a woman mm-hmm and they say today I'm a man yeah today yes and I reserve the right to be a woman back again tomorrow okay yeah do you have penis no no just a man man today mmm okay they'll let they're letting you decide whether or not you're gonna accept nonsense that's true I mean here's the thing it's it's spreading though it is growing yeah and it's really a matter of how many people that don't do that accept that this is a new right reality well and then there's also the thing that we all know is that some people have an extreme desire to be special without doing any work whatsoever yeah they don't want to have to work to be special they just want to be special yeah so if they can just say there's a lot of on Instagram yeah a lot of yeah they could just say they're part of some marginalized group then instantaneously they get more respect and this is not taken away from the people that I think are legitimately trans I think there's definitely people that legitimate ly trained worse I think those people that are legitimately trans should be upset at these gender-fluid fucking weirdos bouncing back and forth all day there's a Radiolab about that where the guy decides during the conversation that he's a man and then he's a woman and I switched over now I'm Paul now I'm Nettie I just changed how do we not address that as 100% either you're fucking with me or you're mentally ill right yes you can't say mentally ill when it comes to gender that's the one area where mentally ill like if it's violence yeah okay if it's impulsive things like gambling or something along those lines all that stuff you could say you're mentally ill yeah you cannot say you're mentally ill when it comes to gender why because we're scared we're scared of being called out but if somebody is like I'm talking right now and they switch and they switch gender again they switch the third and they switch the fourth time in an hour conversation we're supposed to just be like that's exactly okay that fucking dude that we've been sending each other back and forth homeboys Instagram there's his name Kyle Kyle Dunnigan holy shit is he funny he's so funny he's there's a guy named Kyle Dunnigan he's on Instagram and he's doing that Face Swap

bite that was nuts when him and Biden were talking shit on Twitter about fighting yeah Biden oh sandy kick his ass Trump's like you'd go down quick yeah it was gonna be a time of your lifetime where the president the United States was saying kick someone's ass no I'd kick your ass easy easy and he doesn't even fight he doesn't even exercise at all he said he would run and he would have run into that parkland school yeah if out without a gun yeah I would have run of course I would have I would have taken the guy out it's nuts it's nice to say that if that was the only thing he had said in the last year people like that is fuckin great he's a fascinating guy yeah it's a fascinating study and watching someone like we we have this strange attraction to people that have like powerful confidence like that like we want to watch it play out that guy want to watch that guy just play out watch his confidence here go as well yeah watch them well a lot of people are really attracted really attracted instinctively intuitively to somebody with you know the balls to say anything oh yeah that's a really like appealing quality to a lot of people yeah we've never had one like this though right no well he was fun when he was on The Contender or whatever the fuck it was yeah The Apprentice yeah he was fun yeah when I'm like a stern always said that you know he's like I've had him I had him about his great guest yeah so always a great guest it's a funny but he cultivated that whole thing his whole life and then all sudden you become president you supposed to be a different thing yeah I am that's what I do bang hoes man you see Comey said that he asked my lot he asked Comey to check on the PP story yeah because Melania was like serious you made them piss on you I didn't I swear that's not true that is not sure I'm gonna get the FBI on the case on the piss tapes get him on the piss tapes that's how confident I am that's cold call me cool you look into that do I have your loyalty check in those piss tapes unreal man crazy man they're happy another thing gonna be fun to watch those piss Dave's he's fun for comedy though tell me what because he's he's like at the same time but you're seeing this massive political correctness backlash right people are angry at him mm-hmm and they they're like pushing really hard in the other direction so it's created this very volatile social environment you know the zeitgeist yeah very it's possible Trump was with hookers peeing on each other it's possible well but how did he say that in an interview right how did he say it though I want to hear like his actual words he says it's possible could it be like I don't know PR conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this they actually started talking about drafting a press release with us still sitting there and the reason that was so striking to me is that that's just not done that the intelligence community does intelligence the White House does PR and spin you also said you were struck by what they didn't ask very much no one to my recollection asked so what what's coming next from the Russians how might we stop it what's the future look like it was all might not come up what can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had Comey then asked to meet alone with Trump they might not be at the apartment to Russia including allegations of Trump's encounters with prostitutes in Moscow I'm about to meet with a person who doesn't know me it's just been elected president of the United States by all accounts and from my watching him during the campaign could be volatile and I'm about to talk to him about allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the Russians taped it and have leverage over him was there any choice there why if this was salacious and this particular part of the dossier unverified still unverified by the way yes so far when I got fired it was unverified did you tell him that the steal dossier had been financed by his political opponents no I didn't I don't even think I used the term steal doughsay I just talked about additional material but did he have a right to know that that had been financed by his political opponents that I don't know the answer to that it wasn't necessary for my goal was just you know okay for us to just stop a second ago we can't really play that the whole thing that's was yeah the minute we get in trouble I don't think so okay I don't know gonna come down on us no I mean - uh ABC News owns this interview so mm yeah okay cut it out then either way please take it from here there's some peepee some he said it's possible pause so people listening we just played it Jamie's gonna edit it out there so we don't get in trouble we don't get pulled off YouTube yeah it should be okay but but um just madness the whole thing is just so great I just I'm glued to my seat I can't I can't see where it's going I know I know it's why there's so much coming out every day that there's you know you realize that there's entire entertainment shows now just addressing the reality that our political spectrum there why doesn't he have to take a pee test you can take a peek Trump you have to take a pee test if you work at like UPS they had to check you yeah interesting I think he's on speed you do a hundred percent yes leader doesn't he not he has a lot of energy and there's some evidence from many different reporters the one reporter even named the pharmacy where he used to get his speed he was on diet pills that you're only supposed to take for a little while he took him for like six years and then there's another reporter we talked about recently that was saying that he's on one of the fens he's won one of those now which totally makes sense he's 70 what 71 yeah 71 yeah how does he have so much fucking energy yeah that guy has a shit ton of energy I mean when he was on the campaign trail he just would go go go yeah it was like three stops a fucking day ya know getting on plane laying somewhere do a rally go no problem yeah eating Kentucky Fried Chicken yeah wasn't healthy fried chicken I know I know yeah man I think he's on speed and it makes me want to get on speed mm-hmm makes me want to be more productive I mean that's there's so many people I know that are on adderall so many I've never tried it I never have either Jamie gave me some I'm scared just sit and read you watched that documentary yet no it just talks about how many people are on it it's crazy I watched so many all day every day well my stem cell doctor was telling me that when he was in medical school that the people that he was with like all the you know people who's going school with they were all taking adderall and he was like I would watch them finish papers and I just couldn't understand where they had the energy from and he's like dude we're on adderall like this is the way to go and he's just like holy shit he's like it makes you feel like you have to get on it because all these people are so so productive when they're on it I've heard comics talk about it too comics mhm really I wouldn't think I would think he'd be too ramped up I think when they said they had like a work to do no come on jobs and they're like I got to get this done and get that done yeah yeah the downsides got to be rough though I don't yeah I don't know anything about it really I mean I know that's popular I know people been taking it for but I mean like when you come off it I'm sure Jamie did you ever you did it right I did it twice I think but I think I also took two different versions of it cuz there's different kinds there's not just like was it two in a role and now you're taking adderall was it to work or like just record he had like art projects or something I was trying to get done like I really wanted to get it done I was also interested to see what it would be like cuz I've never taken it I've heard friends take it some some my friends really just take it to drink more most of it because we're not in college anymore in animals but uh yes so the one time I took it I had a day off and it kept me up the whole time which is what I thought would happen yeah but then the next day I was also I was just still up I tried to go to bed couldn't go to couldn't fall asleep with that it's out of your systems just a little bit to like five milligrams maybe ten of the slow-release cuz there's also fast release you can like pop the pill and take the salts directly in without having a time release so there's very different variation what about the day after that do you just crash super misfires no I just thought I was I was afraid to go to work so I was serving I thought I was gonna crash while I was serving people's tables and dropped food everywhere a day off so yeah right Ron hmm I remember Robert Schimmel yeah he accidentally took it once accidentally yeah he got the doughnut Bob Schimmel personality no it's not yeah he was like super mellow but uh he told me he accidentally took it and he called his doctor panicking cuz you know he had serious heart condition yeah and the doctor said you're gonna be fine just it's just gonna it's gonna last for about 12 hours and he goes man I got so much shit done he goes I just sat in front of my computer and organized my notes I got all my act together just makes you really productive apparently yeah but we're gonna you know it's gonna change the way people interact it's gonna change the way I mean if more and more people continue to do this gonna change the way people like feel about other people you're gonna be all jazzed up yeah you think he's on some version of that president yes yes I think if these if these reporters are correct pull up that story about the reporter that even listed the Duane Reade Pharmacy in New York where Trump was on the shit for six years and then they think that Trump is on something now they even specified the stuff that he's on hmm Hillary was on some she had - she's on either in new vigil or provigil they're both very similar but that's the stuff that they give to narcolepsy people with narcolepsy really wake yeah it's amazing it keeps you awake man if you have to drive you pop on them new vigils that's an interesting one because it doesn't give you the same sort of speediness I'm really bad at night driving I feel tired those lines they start to do it just to brace you will keep you calm yeah and if you if it's more if you're in a cold place you know the heat on the car oh that's well cold with heat driving by yourself on the road good especially with no lights in the road no nope you ever fall asleep and walking yourself up jazz lanes yes that's terrifying yeah it's not good in squares of shit um yeah that's because of shit I mean find anything Jamie I try now cuz it took it off the internet yeah the boys clean it up boys get Michael Cohen on the case got a big dick done Michael Cohen that guy hilarious all over man it's like where do they go from some characters man no it was real weird nothing was coming up on Google like it really was being taken off really I found it yeah hmm okay fun fact 1982 Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives abused them only supposed to take two for 25 days stayed on him for eight years really Wow White House admitted it to me saying only for a short time for diet when he was not overweight I countered with medical records they cut me off people miss reading drug was diethyl probe pian di e th y L P ro Pio and 75 milligrams a day prescription filled the Dwayne on 57th Street in Manhattan not that I know things crazy the doctor wrote the prescription dr. Joseph Greenberg diagnosed him with metabolic imbalance which we have never heard about again Greenberg was later publicly slammed as someone who would provide uppers to rich people in Manhattan metabolic imbalance if true could be an electrolyte insufficiencies anaerobic imbalances acid imbalances and Anna sort an assortment of related disorders that can have serious health consequences yet his other doctor dr. Harold Bornstein in Trump's doctor since 1980 and never mentioned the metabolic imbalance found by Greenberg so this guy just like Tommy you got a medical imbalance yeah metabolic metabolic imbalance what do I say here take these what are they that fucking great that's what they're how do I thank him for I don't know eight years but there was another one yeah there's that's the EM feta mean a drug of phenylalanine see this is mm Farah Mon and pepper mo it's a stimulant of the phenol fen phen earth isle philomene phenylalanine amphetamine so this is the shitty things on now ya think he's on something now I think look man I think this is a not so dirty little secret I don't think there's anything wrong with it we take coffee that's a stimulant sure these people just taking pills yeah I don't think he does right is new economic coffee guy no I don't think he drinks coffee I don't think he drinks booze at all no no so he's just - no uppers diet coke all right yeah like CDC's yeah those yeah yeah boy yeah he's definitely in the caffeine so he drinks the caffeine all day and he's taking these uppers and that's how he gets shit done for America that's how he brings call back yeah bringing sexy back too strange I mean those pills the thing about when you think about em feta means when you think about brash to say anything about people that are they're overly overly confident you know arrogant like yeah but this is exactly what you expect from totally super aggressive yeah it doesn't strike me as a crazy conspiracy no to say that that's happening it's fascinating but now that's my question like why don't the P test him yeah good guessing we found out he's off the charts yeah you get his charts back and what whoa just like cocaine out of control he's like yeah whatever I do an Eightball day oh hey Bob well here a little there you pussy what do you think Putin's doing trying to keep him the Wolves out of our door yeah do you see that video that was going around yesterday of the the dog that got killed by the two wolves oh no it's horrible German Shepherd oh don't show it please German Shepherd they dragged it out of the yard the ones killing it in the street on a security camera where what like what part of the I don't know somewhere in a community it's a neighborhood neighborhood though I mean it's like a paved Street I hear coyotes at night I see them during the day sometimes - running down the street one killed my chicken last week really two weeks ago two weeks ago another one got a chicken you found like you just gone and the other day they were on the roof of the chicken the henhouse plucking at the pony at the chicken wire trying to pull the chicken wire off oh yeah especially they do it for the roof they do it from the roof they're gonna fall in you know they've fallen they're gonna be stuck in the chicken coop just kill them all and yeah they'll just kill them all and then I'll kill them yeah but that's just fucked would you did you shoot him oh yeah yeah yeah wonder if my neighbors would tell the cops if there were you shoot him with gun that shotgun right in the fucking head chucking I don't know what I would use it'd be hard to shoot them with a bow because I'd have to get them to sit still right well I drew back and then they'd be running around the chicken coop so I'd be in there with them and the chicken coop no good like what would they do they attack me maybe maybe if they're feeling panic - that they felt trapped it certainly will be running around in circles yeah with it whether or not they decide to just leap at me and bite my face off maybe a rifle every the easiest probably that's loud as fuck super loud yeah you have a couple of those going off in the backyard people gonna call the cops oh yeah but then would you get in trouble for that I don't think you're supposed to shoot a gun in your yard Tom yes but what if you feel threatened well if you were if someone was breaking into your home and threatening your life and you shot them that would be one thing defense of life and property that's not this hmm this is like you have a varmint in your backyard I don't think you get in trouble for killing coyotes I think coyotes are thought of as like rats yeah who's crazy is that because we have a hierarchy when it comes to animals right yeah I mean we love we love dogs and cats but we don't really give a shit about mice you know oh no everywhere you go you buy my straps snap their necks electrocute them yeah yeah even glue traps those are the worst yeah might get stuck on the glue put one of those I tell you that like ten years ago I lived in Silver Lake I see rats crawling or hear rats just see rats all the time I went to this at this office I was working part time and they go the guys like oh just take these uh take these rat traps with you and the glue traps and they'll get stuck in it and it's perfect that's what you should do so I took it put some peanut butter on it like you said put it in the backyard and the next day they were flipped over and shit on it's like the rat step then it was like fuck this flipped it over and took a shit on it like fuck you man I was like I told him he's like ah that's pretty big rat then okay I caught a big one in my backyard I'm a garage rather and when I lived in Encino the the trap came down snapped his neck killed him I went out there he's a fat boy I was like whoo this is a big rat mm-hmm I'm like I'll get that in the morning I just left it out there I went back in the morning it was eating everything except the tail they ate him yeah that makes sense they can't lend each other yeah yeah you know tear each other up did you see that rats documentary on Netflix no whoa mm-hmm say it uh uh should I like rats to scare you yeah I don't need it in my head I don't need it Jimmy saw right it's fucking great and it just makes you realize the sheer volume of them in American cities everywhere oh yeah there's more rats in New York City than there are people they say they don't get through the you know or mice at least we'll get through a hole the size of a dime yeah like rats do right where I thought dad they're flexible and they're they just can shove their way in it they're not like us they're crazy they're crazy smart too the older rats they'll send younger rats to go check on baits and stuff like that like someone leaves behind rat bait that it's poison in it the old rats will sit back like man I don't think so on the young rats like what over here is that food you got you guys not going to eat you're not gonna eat and a guide mankind then that he'll eat and die and they'll go yep I thought so so because of that they've developed poison that takes like 10 11 hours to kick in mm-hmm so one rattle eat it is like how you feeling great I'm fine I'm fine and then the other rats will eat it too because like oh he's okay and then yeah so they're developing these slow-release poisons then you just have this rotting rat like you're not I'll stop there's no way you're gonna eradicate the problem like if someone said hey I've got a solution to completely eliminate all the rats from New York City like no you don't is there no solution there's no solution isn't it no unless you make little robot rats that eat rats all right all they do is eat rats that's what you'd have to let loose you'd have to let loose a scourge just a pack of robot rat eating rats that only eat rats and they can do what rats do yeah that's the one that had a botfly in its body that was like the size of a football what was in his body a botfly that larvae see that hole next to his neck that was there was a parasite in there that was that big that's low if you had a soccer ball growing out of your chest yeah and the rats dead and that thing is alive still really yeah that's in the doc yeah on me and they were finding all these crazy diseases that are just totally fatal just floating around inside the rats body and the rats like they're fine yeah but it would kill us how does that happened all this faul faul a little creepy our sofa I always just set like all these sewers on fire that's gonna work yeah it's like a little kid solution it just fucking pour gasoline in the sewage but there's certain problems that we just don't have an answer to that's the the problem of rats in cities they don't have an answer to yeah I mean you can mitigate it by controlling your trash or this or that there's a few things you could do to sort of keep them like at least at bay but they're gonna be hungry and they're gonna be searching around and people are always gonna leave garbage there's always gonna be food in New York in New York City right so much filth how many rats do you think are in Manhattan oh let's see how many people I think there's seven million this is about eight point six million p-8 point six million people I'd say 13 million rats Tom I'm gonna go with 24 this estimate says there are approximately thirty three point six million which is as many as five rats per person so many how do they guess that and there's different ones uptown in downtown there's a genetically rat genetically distinguishable groups how many other groups two to genetically distinguishable groups of uptown and downtown they have those uppity uptown rats Upper West Side rat that's hos fuckin Upper East Side yeah they're lounge in those are they're like cool Soho rats shit cuz genetically distinct uptown and downtown radical that is fuckin crazy there's so many of them too and when you see them there's like yeah it's such a like an instantaneous feeling of panic yeah and like moving quickly here I am terrified of them ones running around your house like Jesus man go to get my son he's over there I just want to run away I've had friends that were camping and one ran over their face while they were sleeping Oh carrying pizza you ever seen the one that kills a pigeon never see the rat killing the pigeon this rat killed a fucking pigeon and was killing it in front of all these people in New York City in a park look at this whoa yeah killing the pigeon the pigeons alive the rat got ahold of the pigeon and look how much stronger they are than pigeons he's just carrying that poor fucking pigeon around so he's taking a break now who when did fucking heart out they're carrying him and it's like he's really trying to do the choke hold on he's killing it I mean he's a predator like I never would have imagined I never thought that rats were predators yeah I thought of him is just being sort of scavengers but this is this just fucking pigeons alive dude he's eating this pigeon and he's killing it drag it in a way look at him oh yeah he's taking this luck wow look at he's trying to get away fuck you fuck you the pigeons all jacked pigeons trying to get away that's chasing them look at that house whoever's doing the camera ladders terrified it he got it that's wild man he's good yeah oh we dropped it oh where you go alive yeah man good name it's fighting look how he's riding it that's like he's got back control is the first time doing it you know he's probably killing he's like that one like I've been killing birds for a minute man he realized like you know what man fuck cheeseburgers you can get your own fresh meat fresh oh do you know that pigeons were actually brought in for food no that's what squab is when you go to a fancy restaurant and have squab pigeon that's pigeon yeah yeah I went to a restaurant the other day that had squab is it good no no I didn't eat it it's probably good but you have that steak instead yeah tried and true but squab is like pigeon they brought them in for food that's this not that's a non-native bird they're squab there you go little pigeon dish looks good fire critics are there enough funny though they have to call it squab yeah it's like nobody wants to eat it it wasn't pigeon yeah that wouldn't sell as well yeah people aren't even eating pigeons look at that you know is pigeon goddamn squab farm in Los Angeles back in the dizzay yeah all these things I think I believe they brought them in I want to say from Europe but I might just be guessing that but pigeons are non needed yeah la was once home to the largest pigeon fart goddamn that's crazy at least you know that's near isn't in your Dodger Stadium right yeah right yeah park was it Alisha Elysian Park yeah now why are they just sitting there at the painting but oh is it yeah yeah but why would they be sitting there good quick they must be ton of feed there right right and then how do they get them throw nuts over them at the other day know when I eat him yeah that was a food source they brought him over as a food source um where like just like I said I want to say Europe yeah oh great assholes you see that they had a 14-footer in someone's pool in Florida yeah big fucking cake yeah oh wow this little baby's playing with alligators the fuck is that I know it's 1906 people were just different than they were made out of wood yeah who are Hardy even babies have calluses yeah that is some shit that would not be done today just leave your kid by the Gator pool oh yeah cool normal we'll go have lunch that's not yeah it is yeah California alligator farm Los Angeles if they're well fed you don't really have to worry about them like rice they're well fed they're just tired just chilling all the time look at that guy though it doesn't mean like a real person no big it's fake it looks real fake I just think it's a shitty shitty photography and they probably added color to it later right so Tommy buttons yep tell me about the controversy surrounding your use of the r-word in your last special oh yeah it was quite that that was that was bizarre it was a lot man well it was also what I found interesting about it was people were lying about the bit and they were doing it in articles and they were doing it in email campaigns they were lying about the content of the bit yeah they were they were changing what you were saying in the bit and they had to be doing it on purpose they definitely didn't listen to the bit yeah and I think it took me a while to figure out what was what really was happening was that someone someone's agenda or idea of what they want to accomplish is to highlight a campaign to eradicate saying and then they had a channel to pursue by having a comedy bit that did it that they could be like right let's let's go after it like this yeah but it didn't they didn't go I mean you know basically what his funny thing is that like the that joke was something that I worked back where I I did that bit backwards in other words I had the end piece of the bit was out what I was doing by itself which was a story about I saw I witnessed a fight in Philly of a white guy and a black guy in the park and the white dude was you know screamin and bombs and it was it was nuts so I would tell that story and then I would I worked backwards into getting into the story cuz I always try to figure out like if something that funny happens or some I want to tell a story it's always better to figure out why are you telling the story rather than just to be like here's a story right so I told the the story of like the the fight in the park then I worked into like I figured out right before I have talked about racial slurs and how you know most racial slurs are not acceptable and then I figured out they were like unless they're like white racial slurs are totally acceptable like you call people mix and Krauts and frogs pollux Guinea wop Slyke this whole list of that and then I worked before that of just the way into saying that was like why should talk about words that you can't say that it kind of changed over time right so it was just like one of those jokes is like oh it's helping me get into the bit you know so I I started the bit by saying you can't say retarded anymore does that that's the first line of the of the entire bit yeah it ended up being like 8 or 10 minutes long and then people would say to me like to start when I started getting mail about it they're like you know you can't say retard and I go that's the line that I say like yeah that's the line in the joke but they didn't hear the bet I'll just heard that you were doing a bit about the word retarded once it blew up like once it got to a huge amount of like when it was an organized orchestrated campaign you're right there was people messaging me that would say heard you want to kill all children with Down's and everybody what and I where did you see that Facebook somewhere said someone said it it does the messages I started to get and how many people at the height of it signed this petition to get you like kicked off in Netflix over a hundred thousand yeah but here's the thing here's what I mean I I don't want to portray myself as a victim or anything right like I I did a bit I can handle people not liking it or liking it I mean a lot of people message me that they were into it and I just didn't share those because you don't want to be like right here's someone that said they like it you know and people and people even people with children and siblings and uh but now should message me you know I just didn't post those messages but I don't know I I'm not the victim in this whole thing at all i I learned I feel like I learned that when people are super upset about something you have to let them just be upset and and be outraged if they want to be outraged you know that's you're right it of course it's uncomfortable to me that you can't get out in front and be like hey you're you're misrepresenting it Brian because people like even in the campaign language it said like we want this bit taken out of the of the joke we want the trailer for the special removed and I was like why and then I realized that the trailer has a joke that they're confusing with the joke where I say retarded like they're they think the two are related what's the one on the trailer the one in the trailer is I say like some something's funny um disabilities are not funny but some are and it's a whole bit about obscure things like a foreign accent syndrome and oh it was hit on the head and then they start speed yeah French accent so that was the setup to that bit and they were but they were saying they were basically making it where that set up is about downs or something do I mean like that but they happen 40 minutes apart one has nothing to do with the other but by not watching it by just watching the trailer they're going ah see this is like how he's making fun of us right you well you shouldn't even have a point or you could say some disabilities are funny right you can't do that right yeah that's what that's what I was told it's it's what it is is its new power that people have to complain I mean if people always complained but they haven't had the instantaneous access to complaining right and then you can get and here's the thing I learned about kind of like mob mentality tool it was like kind of fascinating to why I mean I was in it so it's different once I could step back I realized that once you got sign a certain message out you know people would read the thing that says this guy hates people with Down syndrome I what and that's not a hard thing to get behind oh yeah so then people would just they would sign it and I would also get messages that said things like I didn't know evil like you existed in this world you know things like that and I'd be like what and you're Isis I mean like really crazy stuff man and I didn't engage nearly you know the amount of people that that would contact me but I did engage a few I did like go back and forth with one guy he was like he opened he's like you fucking cocksucking piece of shit I would stab you if I saw you on the street and I go what's this all about that was my like my opening thing to him and he was like I heard you you want to kill like everybody with Down syndrome and I'm like what are you talking about man and then we had a back-and-forth about about the bit I'm like you should go watch it you know just watch it and then get back to me and then he writes me that he's like yeah yeah yeah sorry the way I spoke earlier didn't seriously stab me yeah if you saw me would have killed me you'd be in jail forever they'd be like defendant please rise yeah why'd you stab my sister girl I didn't see the bits I didn't watch anyway good somebody told me was but it was saying terrible things about in and now in in there and people's defense we've got upset some people watched it and they're like I saw it and I think it's horrible and I think you know I'm like okay you know yeah but there's some people that if you just say the word say the word retarded like that's it it's all it's over you can't do that it's like so many other words yeah but it's gotten to the point where you don't even say the word nigger like just saying it it's like look holy shit what are you doing yeah we'll say the n-word instead of it right and you're not even calling summing it but it's just acknowledging it that that's a real word it's like a forbidden thing well part of that this you know campaign is to refer to it as the art word like yeah say it right you should never say it I mean we heard man yeah I mean you know people people were some people were very very upset about it and you know I I get why someone could be upset about it it's not like I go like I don't even understand how you could be upset I mean the natural thing I think if you're a comic is you you want to walk someone through the joke but what you realize later is like somebody who's it who's who's advocating to stop saying a word it doesn't care the details of the joke I mean the joke here's the other thing that sucks about reading people would read transcripts is like transcripts have no intent tone you know if you just read people's like I know we've talked about what you're closing on now which will probably close out your special if you just type that out and give us someone they'd be like you are oh like you're a horrible man but it's in it's a couple things it's like it's in the context of a comedy show yes where there's an unspoken agreement but I mean performer and audience it's the intent like what how did you intend this bit to go right tone I mean is it said satirically ironically get that bit what I'm doing in the bit is is basically lamenting but accepting that words are changing right like that's the tone of it yeah the tone of it is I'm going like can't stay retired anymore that fucking sucks but I'm also like alright you know I mean like you're saying okay yeah I'm going to it and I make an example like one thing that people got really upset about was like I said at the end of this bit of the retarded part I say like you got now you got to be like that your idea has an extra 21st chromosome if you ask me right and then the next part the very next line that they would cut out when people were sharing this thing as I golike not the same meaning that the example is a purposely bad example right the joke is that if you were to say 21st chromosome it's absurd doesn't work don't you know it wouldn't mix there it but people would attack me and go like you're telling people to start saying that I'm like no I'm sharing that it's a bad idea I saw someone getting mad at someone calling someone stupid because they were saying that's ablest do you know what ablest is ablest oh yeah because you have your of sound you're able yeah you're able to do it yeah yeah like if you are mocking someone who's diminished mentally oh you fucking idiot that's ablest yeah sure which is crazy yeah your able bodied their brain doesn't work so good yeah an ableist if you call them stupid I mean it's gonna get to the point where if you give up certain words I mean if we keep going like this I get to the point where we're just gonna have a very hard time communicating effectively I totally agree I mean there's I don't know there's there's and here's the thing that it is an endless cycle yeah I mean we just don't have that next unacceptable word right you know like everybody knows I think a lot of people know that as far as somebody who's doesn't have is developmentally disabled retarded was kind of the moat the latest term that was once acceptable it's clearly not now I mean that is kind of the point but before that you know moron was a medical term was it yeah mongoloid idiot was with these to call down syndrome children that was like hundred years ago on the birth certificate right but I'm saying you know people who are saying you know just to stop saying we took they're not wrong that you know but there is also another word down the pipeline right there's something else is coming yeah that's gonna be a medical word or term and then that'll be used to insult people but that's the way people use language like once we identify this is the word people use to label someone with a developmental disability people in the slang will grow from that yeah people will start using that well what's interesting to me is that when we're talking about words you're not going to change the way people think so words are supposed to convey intent yes supposed to be sounds that we all agree mean a certain thing and the more depth the more access to words you have the more you can sort of flavor your conversation so I understand what you're saying like if you're saying this guy I kind of get it but you feel like this fucking guy yeah I'm like well Tommy's really mad yeah you know I mean that and to take that out yeah it's like I don't know exists sometimes you take those things out when you're like on a television show or something like that but all television shows because of that all censored television shows only exists within a certain band yes a certain frequency they never get out of that like the Joey Diaz frequency is like it's up their roof yeah there's no fence ah through this this frequency that you get on like late-night talk shows or a sitcom this very narrow band that that there's no cunts in that band there's no you motherfucker this all those things are not in there which is what you're all of it I feel like whenever you're for me when I'm watching something like that part of my brains always like go find a motherfucker somewhere no it's like kind of one especially now when we're just we're so used to being free yeah especially us because a podcast and live live stand-up yeah you know and I was gonna bring this up like your show like your show that you do with your wife your mom's house if anybody just wanted to go cherry-pick things and write them down right some of the things you guys joke around about where you're clearly joking yeah but take it and write it down in quotes and then Tom said to his wife oh yeah and by the way one hundred thousand times worse than anything in life stain about ever said yeah it said on that podcast I mean it's not even comparable it's so much worse the content yeah it's like we don't go into the show of like let's be offensive but we play in a no-rules like have fun environment yeah you know it's like free-flowing just say whatever and that's the fun of the show yeah and it's also everybody knows you're joking yeah yeah the fan base is like a hundred percent on board with like this is on a you know uncensored just loose fun going for it going for jokes what I also found too is that during this whole controversy after special was released yeah you got bigger it's like people they by doing that campaign yeah and then people who did investigate the good actually these guys really fucking funny I mean I got I usually you know again I never publicized these things because its grossed you know to be like check out this compliment but I got so many messages from people who are like I saw this thing on the news because it was on a lot of local news that there's a controversial Netflix right thing out these people would message me I saw it's this thing so I decided to check you out new fan just bought tickets to see you at blah blah blah so I started to get a bunch messages like this oh for sure because you're gonna get 30% of the people that aren't even gonna read it they're just gonna call you piece of shit yeah but the other people are gonna go what is going on over here and the next thing you know they're gonna investigate anything I go what they're doing this guy dirty yeah yeah and then BOOM yeah I got a lot of I got a lot of support that I never liked I said I never made light of the fact that people are being supportive but people were being very supportive well it just seems like there there's different there's different rules now for stand-up and you got to really cover your ass but in your case you did cover your ass and they disingenuously left that part out like they deceptively left that out when they were writing down what you had said they didn't put it in the context that's true and and then you know part of you goes man like is I'm not trying to paint myself as a martyr or you know I mean are and like people who are going down this path of you know they have family or friends with disabilities it's like I'm not gonna my whole thing was never to attack them branch so I'm not gonna try to make it a battle that I have to win core like so once once I saw like kind of what I thought clearly was happening I was like you know just let people vent their frustration about if it's about me or about what I said just let it happen yeah and you know because I don't I don't hold it against them that they're that they had that they're upset about this issue right you know and even though like you're saying your instinct is is once to go like hold on why don't you put it clearly wrote I said after a moment of it I realized it like that kind of wasn't the point for me in that in that time I was like just let people yeah cuz I also figured out that if people yeah a lot of people were gonna read it say something and go like this guy's fuckin worst and it kind of feels good sometimes to be like you want to know who a bad guy is this guy yeah and you know even though you want to be like hey I'm not that bad of a guy if someone wants to just go there you just kind of have to let it go and then let the people who were enjoying it or who were investigating it and finding like oh it's a little different than it's being presented yeah it was like there's so many outlets that are looking for outrageous stories yeah more than ever and recreational outrage recreational outrage peddlers are like in an all-time high and there's so many people out there that are working the journalists the writers they working for these websites and they got to produce content man I got to tell you the one of the most amazing like discoveries of that process is not the people who got upset at me and would start whatever emailing stinkypants saying things it was the reporters who would do these news pieces and also not familiar with what they were reporting they don't care what doesn't that kind of make I mean doesn't that kind of stand out to you like you're gonna you're gonna do a piece on television mm-hmm that you were to I don't know how many people and you're not familiar you could tell that they had not even watched the clip yeah and they're doing it wasn't like a just an anchor reading copy it was the person doing the piece about it had no idea what they were talking about yeah they're lazy super lazy there's a lot of bad shit out there just just people just barely just phoning it in yeah barely paying attention to what they're doing and then pretending the they're on the moral high ground yeah hmm you gotta like but I think it's kind of a challenge too cuz it forces me to like really cover all my bases and in these bits yeah like I did that with the my Bruce Jenner bit from last year like I was trying to figure out a way to make fun of this I'm like what is the best way to make fun of it well the parallel to my own life that I've never been more of a bitch I've never been happier but I live with all girls and I'm gonna never been more of a bitch I just given everything around me all the time to her and that I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner that I've never been more of a bitch in my life but I'm not going out like in that that is entirely people like oh he's always been a man that's you know really a woman a woman trapped in a man's body and like maybe yeah maybe or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough you fucking become one yeah maybe did you get a lot of share that you had to get some right no no I skated through that skated through that one well because I first of all I caught it right when people were annoyed Yeah right when people like okay enough of this like I rode the timing was really good like when it came out it's like people like enough the fucking articles and pretending she's beautiful and she's amazing and brick stop yeah stop what about the fact she killed somebody what about the feds no one's - Kyle does Kyle does a whole bit yeah fine Kyle's bit it's it's him at the wheel yeah it's uh it's Caitlin at the wheel yeah and he recognizes ah Bruce Bruce dude though maybe Caitlin gets off free fuck me when you killed that lady with this car now Kalin's got a clean record baby I'm a much better driver than Bruce I'll have you now so don't be afraid to hit the street there you go there you go tied everything together lower one with taut woods Trump who's that with Trump in the corner with a girl who's that it might be stormy right hold on player me why are you calling me here because I can't stop thinking about our night together horny nobody belong yeah you like 9/11 my ass oh my god ground zero still a mess by the way don't call here again wait I was going to tell you something what to make it quick you have gonorrhea syphilis and super ade that face that he chose to is a perfect face for Trump oh my god no there's no oh my god yeah oh well kudos to Netflix for the way they handled it because they just step back yeah just let it that let it let the fucking ear age wash over let the fire go out I kind of took I took cues from that after a minute because at first I was like I should fucking talk to people then I kind of was like uh just wait for someone to kill a hooker I just someone's gonna do something that's gonna take over in the news now I got ten minutes out of it does that work did you yeah oh that's well there you go I feel like you have to address something like that oh yeah why wouldn't you - yep ELLs got a bunch of shit at his new special about some shit that he got in trouble with in his old special I'm hoping it yeah goes goes this way it's I mean you know the audit here's the thing when I do a show now the audience is so aware of that stuff Oh that it's like it would be disingenuous for me to not mention it you know yeah that becomes a thing right the more you stand up you're doing the poor people know what you're doing and then when something goes sideways that becomes a bit yeah of course you like feeding off yourself yeah yeah yeah that's true I mean I I just say Louisiana and it's like that's right the Louisiana thing put the state that was another thing people get mad at you for real pissed off a whole state a whole state people were saying that they were saving up bail money what I've never even heard I know it's like when I saw that yeah they're like I would see comments like we got to start saving our bail money cuz we're gonna go fuck up Tom Segura yeah and then we can bail out like you saving up for that it's one of the most white-trash fucking amazing shitty things I've ever heard so a savings account for bail what did you do about security after that I had to take some they like I was it was recommended to me by a whole bunch of industry people to take security precautions in Louisiana that's it why so that like crazy in Louisiana nine months in advance no no yeah it's sold out we added yeah it's gonna be all dudes in the audience going like this yeah I'm like you said you spent money to attack that'd be hilarious if they're like we paid you to fucking just certain states yeah I've been shitting on Connecticut for years of you had low back you're shitting on Connecticut gets to meet people come up to me and they're like I'm talking like in a coffee shop someone's like why does Joe a Connecticut I don't really hate Connecticut one of my best friends was in Connecticut shout-out to Tommy jr. I don't really hate Connecticut I'm talking shit you gotta understand yeah and by the way if you get like real sensitive about your state you might be a fucking idiot yeah just stop it's a patch of dirt there's no real state there's lines arbitrarily drawn the sand you just drive in New York LA across this line now you're in Massachusetts does that make any sense to you well no and the other thing is you know what helps you see that clearly you've had this I know I had this for sure is moving when you move a bunch of times in your life you're like oh yeah like what why would you be married in love to that patch of land with like you never move they feel like a certain tie to that place and and they don't they're more sensitive yes like I've lived in Ohio Minnesota Wisconsin DC Maryland Florida Massachusetts and California yeah and anytime I've mentioned any one of those places somebody somewhere has been like that place fucking sucks I'm like okay sure go ahead and they're like your birthplace X fine I don't care man it's just a place that I was squeezed out of someone's vagina I don't care yeah you moved around a lot you get it yeah it's like I've why would you be so like people take it like you're insulting their family you know that it is my family no it's not do you know where they were from nuttiest about it Texas Maine oh really to call the Maineiacs really yep I was doing gigs up in Maine and I was shitting on Maine and this guy was this old guy literally got up and he was blood in his eyes coming towards the stage screaming at me yeah I had this whole bit about how if you get pulled over that I got a speeding ticket when I was driving because it's like there's this long stretch from Portland to Bangor it's like an hour drive where there's nothing on the road yeah I go I got a speeding ticket cuz I just you know you can't help yourself I go but you gotta feel like the cops from Maine you should be able to trick them and I had this whole bit about tricking the cop that's really fucking stupid cop you throw a potato out the window yeah with the potato go that's a pretty good one mm-hmm nice and round and the guy the guy drives off in this while I'm in the middle of doing this guy jumps up and he's screaming just screaming at me fuck you fucking Maine is the best bucket state you're a piece of shit he's really really mad at me and I couldn't believe it I was like you're really mad that someone's making fun of Maine he's got to be a mad but I always say someone's gotta be mad about something else right healthier that's their their turf yeah they're defending their turf there's neighborhood right yeah that's their spot yeah they they call the maniacs yeah I get really really really angry it's funny people but people audiences will like if you like you people are nuts if you're like you're crazy people they're like that's cool right like that well the certain places there are like Texas Texas yeah I have a bit that I opened with in Texas all the time this one spot in Texas it's like it's it defines Texas yeah it's people like but you ever see no you know what a Bucky's is mm-hmm no yes hole bit about buck is that like a gas station kind of it's like a gas station yeah if you created a gas station while you were in the middle of a cocaine binge yeah and someone said dude I want you to make me the ultimate gas station it's true it's fucking crazy place but it's so light and when you bring it up to Texans they get all excited I get excited yes it's like yeah this is something that defined that's a Bucky's look at that the size of that place I don't even make sense no that's 100 pumps easy yeah fuck you're getting a hundred people pulling over for gas that's great I mean they're just all prepped for the end of the world there are stretches there's how dumb I am of i-10 in Texas that you will hit maybe like 75 miles without gas and you tempt fate you know if you're driving that's not good no and twice I've been like I'll get at the next one and almost been just fumes you know like I thought you did it in a Tesla oh really I doubt he died out and I was out driving with a Tesla move good luck some farmer pulls over and sees you your shitty electric scooter doesn't want him work anymore I read that Elon Musk is sleeping on the floor of the Tesla factory they said he's sleeping on the floor of the Tesla factory and while they're trying to get production ready mmm and that Tesla's finally gonna leave this Elon Musk is stressed son of a bitch Elon Musk is stressed says he's sleeping on the Tesla factory floor and has no time to go home and shower Wow the guy's an animal he really is has there ever been a guy who does more shit Benjamin Franklin no but asshole with a kite McKee fuck that guy wooden teeth now what he's done think of his he's in the middle making this boring company that bores holes under the ground and they kill of the high-speed train on high-speed train yeah he's in the middle of the Hyperloop yeah he's in the middle of a SpaceX he's in the middle of Tesla production they got approved for the satellites to go in the space for the internet do about that yeah we'll hear about that yeah yeah yeah he's gonna provide worldwide Internet right that's the idea dude yeah it's us how does one house one guy able to do so much it's that matter now well the crazy thing I was saying the other day he's so smart did people just let him drill under the ground in LA like yeah go ahead go ahead man nobody else like who the fuck would let anybody just drill on the ground who do you where do you what office do you walk into with that presentation you know it's like people it's like a six-month thing to build a fence in LA yeah he's like nice gonna go down a bunch like way far and then make trains like they would never listen to him if he was like a regular person no or even a regular genius like yeah you almost have to be like Elon Musk he's like are it's like a guy and like you tips yeah he's like our guy you know Elon Musk planned for high speed car tunnel gets initial approvals from LA I would like to see the documentary about the presentation I'd like to see what happens when the earthquake hits and that thing fills up with water rushing towards you and you're on that scooter goddamn 2.7 mile proof-of-concept long Sepulveda dam high-speed underground alternative means of transit for personal vehicles and/or single rider use according to urbanize which reported on the approval man I mean what what what motivates a guy like that to do so many different things that's what's so confusing it's it's not it's a it really is that real curia he's an engineer at heart and it's that I think it's the curiosity and of a the challenge and accomplishing something that hasn't been done before and I want to make it possible I feel like that has to be the real drive it can't be the money and the the stardom of it I feel like he really gets off on how can I find a solution to this thing yeah well they're all technologically based things everything he's doing is like Tesla the Tesla those home units the tiles the the solar tiles that he's putting on people's roofs but and also it all ties into like better for Humanity yeah yeah I was amazing yeah he's a he's an incredible aqui that we got a guy like that I mean he's essentially like our version of a Tesla yeah you know a Nikola Tesla you know like a guy who just keeps coming up with new crazier shit too it's amazing there's only one of those guys though that's crazy of course the other ones like you would think they'd be a bunch of those kind of guys no no he's yeah yeah what if he wasn't born you know what I mean like the when when you have a guy who's that much of an outlier it's just so it's so strange because you're forced consider like how is it kind of could it be at a nation of 320 million people that one individual be such an outlier yeah but even I would even though outside of that there's not even someone like really like him somewhere else those really like no it's like seven billion people yeah yeah who is who is the one person that you think of when it comes to technological innovation and in producing crazy new inventions and we usually him to the public of jobs like that right yeah yeah yeah sorry he didn't do it the way that this guy no he was just within my company you know there's new shit you're gonna want yeah that was really him it's crazy see so much so many people talking shit about Apple lately about their laptops hmm people are just tired of them they're tired of the lack of innovation it's just all the same thing all the Mac books look the same yeah buy a Windows laptop you buy infinite variety bunch of different types and styles and macbook gear 13 inch or 15 inch yeah so and their last MacBook Pro was considered kind of a dud I think and I know that sucks home pod didn't sell well they thought it was gonna be a big thing well that's the thing where it's like you only have so much momentum that's five jobs and then the new guy Tim Cook has to take over and he's got to figure out a way to keep that thing rolling yeah and it's just he's not the same guy it seems like way healthier right right he's not I mean healthier not just physically but mentally he's not he's gonna not obsess man yeah you know yeah yeah cuz the jobs obsessed you need to be obsessed to be that guy yeah I mean it's probably one of the things that made him sick what was your take on you probably ready talk about so sorry if you did but with that whole Connor in New York thing pretty fucking crazy there's a whole story behind it and the story behind it is that artem low bhav who is one of connor stablemates had an issue with khabib nurmagomedov because he said something in an interview that could be pulls out of fights then the Connors the real real fighter and then keebz a coward so could be found him and kind of smacked him a little said you call me a coward motherfucker like that kind of shit and there's a video of him saying it to him talking to him in Russian and Connor saw that video and flew from Ireland with a bunch of fucking gangsters all the way to New York to crazy yeah there might have been some substances involved not good though no I mean he might he literally might wind up wind up in jail it's entirely possible that New York is gonna prosecute him I mean that was like a salt he threw a dolly at a car people had their eyes cut their face cut glass shatter yeah and luckily it wasn't I mean I want to say it's any better that men get cut but imagine if he did it to Rose namajunas she's this beautiful little 24 year old girl who's a world champion what if she got cut by the glass what if he ruined her career yeah like what if she never got to fight again with the glass cut her eye and we lost Rose and that would have been the day of or day before a fight today before a fight she she thought about pulling out of the fight she was so distraught by the whole event that she'd really gone out yeah because she was on that bus yeah yeah you know definitely not gonna get him I guess I don't know it but then in a way it does I know those people who were talking about how this is all coordinated planned like seems on your right press thing yeah I mean you can definitely see how how it could be it's not it doesn't but I mean yeah it's not it's just not but it's not gonna is it gonna lower his draw probably not no it's gonna he's gonna be even bigger than ever as I'm saying so when he actually does fight khabib if those two do fight if what's saying let's say they solve everything civilly meaning Connor pays everybody off paced chiesa off pays Rhea Borg off pays up emotional duress to anyone who sues him that was on the bus paste some sort of a fine to the state of New York that's pretty significant gives up a few million dollars for sure right hook then they put the fight together o gonna be giant maybe that would be the rule economy Tigers comeback fight is already being mooted as what does that mean as the biggest record breaker in UFC history I've never seen that word mooted mm-hm have you ever seen it I think I mean touted it but the biggest record breaker in UFC history yeah I will be if he fights khabib experts are predicting he'll be back in the Octagon within a year okay that's a year from now that's not like a much of a stretch that's a crazy prediction yes six to twelve months so I just saw in maybe eighty one thousand seat stadium in Moscow that's what they gonna do attention I mean it's not signed obviously but that's what this article you know where we're gonna be right here watching it right here watching that shit on that TV it's gonna be awesome we're gonna be in American on American soil drinking Budweiser drinking American beer maybe some Sam Adams something American I'm not going to Russia not going come to me and Russia cut here cut - you mean the UFC they sit down to get me excited about it okay how many hours is the fight shit it's a long flight yeah you know it just seems like do a show there nope no I really wanna stay here yeah yeah I don't I don't the the beat up that you get from international travel yeah it's not worth it and quite honestly I like doing fight companions as much or more than I like actually being at the fight really oh yeah it's the most fun ever when me and Brendan and Eddie and Brian get together and just talk shit and get high yeah and start drinking wine and just getting silly sometimes we barely comment on the fights it's just like being silly yeah have a good time yeah Eddie of there's some new conspiracy theory about whatever and and he will go off 1 hear that new dinosaurs not being real there's always something I mean he just never gives up he loves them the fucking Gila and then every now and then there's something that comes out that sort of confirms it yeah like did you see that Sinclair Broadcasting Network yes compilation yes which shows all the different anchors saying the exact same thing and you realize oh they were given a script yeah all across the country all these local news places were giving a script to try to chastise fake news and say we have to be careful about fake news yeah yeah it's fascinating it's weird mm-hmm and they're growing they're growing Sinclair is growing a lot yeah and they there's you know studies show to that like I guess one of that biggest opinion formers still that people kind of write off because it's not as sexy and big is local news you know local news is huge at forming opinions but I believe it yeah I believe it it's it's so fascinating to me and then this Facebook thing is fascinating to me too because they were you know we were talking about Facebook yesterday that what we were watching this you know when he was being grilled yeah as like a burger yeah one of the things they were talking about upcoming elections international and he's talking about how Facebook is really you know we have to concentrate on all these upcoming elections and make sure there's no bad actors that are yeah like what like Facebook is involved in shaping the world it's incredible yeah you see I saw an article about how they said that these senators that grilled him missed so many things basically because they're old they're just like they didn't ask so many questions because they don't understand how even Facebook works there's a funny video that I put up Jamie see if you find it oh it's on Twitter of some of the more hilarious things that came out of that interaction mm-hmm and one of them was the guy asks Zuckerberg would you tell us the hotel you're staying at he's like no like would you be willing to tell us and show us all the messages all the messages that you've sent he's like no like this back up back it up last night vert Iser or campaign who who asked for it mr. Zuckerberg would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night no if you've messaged anybody this week would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged senator no I would probably not choose to do that publicly here I think that maybe what this is all about here's what everybody's been trying to tell you they you know I say this gently your User Agreement sucks I'm gonna suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it and tell your $1200 an hour log there's no disrespect they're good but but tell them you want it written in English and non Swahili so the average American can understand that would be a start quite a story there's no competition that's what's really weird yeah like as far as like there's Twitter yeah that is just it's it's cool that we have these three different ones to which is really fascinating you got Twitter which is just some text like I saw this article check it out and then people retweet it I like that aspect yeah and then you know you could state your opinion on things you'd clarify things but then there's instagrams just photos hey this is my time in Peru look at the beautiful buildings they own that one that's not a competitor right yeah but I mean the three different things and then there's Facebook which is like a lot of arguments in discussion deep discussion politics that's like the big one when it comes to like deep political discussions it's I wonder what it's coming next because these we typically people transmission cycles you know I know you're right but I feel like I don't know they have it they have a pretty strong grip I mean you know snapchat is is really popular but as soon as snapchat looked like it was about to just really explode and meaning that it would be the kind of premiere you know a visual one Instagram was like we're gonna add that that same aspect to yeah Instagram Instagram stories just squash that yeah it's just Instagram it's a better platform but it's it's just really interesting to see like what we choose to put our time and our energy and where it's going and when is the first virtual reality or augmented reality social network going to it's gotta be around the learner yeah they must be like scrambling to be the first to come up with it cuz if you can like if you tried there was a thing called views there still is a thing called views I got on it I'd told the bunch people to get on it I haven't even opened it in fucking month he put a couple V you se I put a couple pictures up and then I was like yeah I gave up I'm gonna signed up for it but yeah I can't do another one right now yeah yeah I'm here o ver oh well see ya I forgot it's fucking name nobody's on that goddamn thing but he's also confusing look no one could comment on my pictures and less like accepted them and then I looked I got 35,000 people to accept I'm not doing that oh you got your one by one I don't know it seemed like it yeah I put them in groups oh come fuck all the way off fuck off with that get all the way fuck out of here with that am I gonna do that how am I gonna do that with 35,000 people it might even be more than that now I'm sure many I have no tell me how many I have I haven't been there and forever I don't even know the name of it calling it views yeah yeah so far Google views it's hard to figure out how to look to what you do a favorite one do a favourite platformer I like Instagram yeah did too it seems to be the the most uh let's see it's the most flexible you can put text up you can put an image of text you can put a video up it's great you know I think it's the most flexible your fucking Instagram makes me hungry yeah do you cook I do not got some milk I just got some new sausages it's very easy easy to cook Eccles elk sausage I have some oh yeah well thanks em for you Tommy yes fuck yeah I'm here yes I do oh okay thanks um Reiser oh yeah Oh daughter its dachshund is a good year a good year for the Rogen meat collecting firm yeah yeah I got two elk this year so that's like 800 pounds of meat I've already given away a couple hundred pounds really yeah I give away for everybody that's awesome I love it I feel like I'm a provider yeah you are like give it to people and then they send me pictures of food they cooked oh my god you're the village elder man you're fucking Duncan sent me a picture of these meatballs and he made with the elk with the ground alcohols like oh my god I look so good that was crazy Duncan obviously very good son last night yeah last night he's here yeah he's back to muddy no he's back move back he's great man he's such a good dude he is a sweetheart we did Brooklyn together meet him and Inari oh really I didn't join that show yeah it was fun round and then we went to Peter Lugar's I saw the page oh fuck yeah you know they put those I think it's a second part of it they have like a process there that they put in at 1200 degree degree broiler mmm so you know that's why it pops I mean that's this shit's that's by the way I think obviously Peter Luger does it right to me it's one of the only I'm not somebody that complains at restaurants yeah that crack like I'm on yeah I was can yeah those are beautiful you don't get that over plated by Eretz I don't I like fucking meat piping hot yeah I can't do lukewarm you know it's like out I'll tell them team eggs hotter and they're like you want hot sauce I'm like no no and you put it back on the fire so that it's hot when I eat it that's the only way you like it I like meat Lyla it's particularly steak like temperature-wise very high I don't like it cooked through right but I liked it like on a hot plate or just like off the grill in my mouth that's interesting because some people think that you should let it rest I know letting it rest before you I mean you know taking letting meat rest before you grill it and no no letting it rest after you grill it mmm supposed to let it rest for 10 minutes now fuck that no yeah there's all sorts of weird rules what you're supposed to do and not supposed to do with meat I watched the whole steak documentary it was such 1 I think it might be called steak here's like it was well they just followed like all over the world different people who either are chefs or raise cattle and and you know theories on how to make that this might be it here station yeah this is it I watch this is it good it was the production wise is a little but people do shit different ways yeah I mean but it's entertaining and you know seeing how they make it different in different parts of the world was cool you could go down a rabbit hole when it comes to food preparation oh yeah you know like Anthony Bourdain show no reservations yeah got me into it and now his new show parts unknown is fuckin amazing for that yeah just traveling everywhere and eating exotic food everywhere it's great I love Bourdain you know he's all skinny now have you seen him yeah he looks cut the carbs out did he cut out the booze cut out the car here's that naturally thin frame to whenever was really like a big big guy now it does Jiu Jitsu everyday he's shredded is he it's got a six-pack full on six-pack used to have a pot belly good for you aunt yeah that's nice man pimpon pimpon he used to like used to have like a pot belly just eating right he told me that he got on statins which are those cholesterol blockers you know mm-hmm he got on those instead of not instead of changing his diet just like fuck it I'm just gonna get on these statins I'm just gonna keep II I mean his whole show was just I mean I'd like to frame to do an episode just on diarrhea and where he's had it and what the worst one was because I'm sure he's got some epic stories I almost shit my pants last night at the improv really yep I came so close same in my car I'm on my way to the improv I was coming over the hill and I was on Laurel and I was like oh my god I'm several miles away and I'm not gonna make it really and I was gonna try to get into the McDonald's on Sunset and take a shit there and I was like if I just get it into that McDonald but then I'm like I'm gonna have to buy something cuz this is a lot of homeless people in that area yeah you can't just use that bathroom you have to be a customer my kind of the time though I couldn't keep it together and it was just sweating willpower alone that I didn't shit myself it was an internal wrestling did you park in front or did you park right in front and I ran into the bathroom and I got to the toilet got my pants down put my butt down and my I shit so hard I lifted like yeah it's like one of those jet things where the dudes in the ocean and the water the Jets like got them up in the air a jet pack it's like drag racing when the fucking hits the gas funny cars yeah yeah whoo I barely made it I missed my spot where you scared someone was gonna be on the toilet yes yes my spot yeah Nikki Glaser I take my spot what did before him nothing unusual yes it didn't make any sense I don't know what it was I don't know what got me but something got me and it got it was like yeah cuz like on the way on the way over the hill I was like oh no I'm not gonna make it and I was you start thinking the different places you could pull over to shit yeah maybe I just jump in this guy's bushes like maybe I was trying to think of places where I could shit that's how bad that Caden yeah on Laurel sores I was thinking of pulling over on a side street and just shitting in someone's bushes it's just the clean of it because yes yeah yeah I'm thinking now cuz I know now I know this is a possibility I didn't shit myself but I came close close I need an extra pair of underwear I'm pants in my car at all times yeah it's a small package pair of pants underwear maybe why not after all the paper - maybe socks yeah maybe it goes goes low yeah where was Kalyn going when he said he shit himself I didn't he didn't he said he did and then he showed up but I'm like what happened oh I changed my pants like what you just changed your changes their pants you just changed your pants you just pulled it where'd you change your pants where where'd you go with your shitty pants you go to a gas station what the fuck are you talking about Kalyn yeah I know yeah he was supposed to be doing the spot of the ice house that guy I can't make it I shit my pants like your people waiting for you here get over here 20 minutes later is there no shit fresh pants son of a bitch I hate shitting at clubs you got to do what you got to do though of course I know I'm saying I mean I've done it yeah hey Shay I'm playing su and I fucking sometimes we do that damnit yeah planes are the worst when you go in there after someone shit ooh and all that smear is over this the log smear it's over the inside of that bowl that's a very ineffective way of containing odor and cleaning the poo I've seen it I've walked into a plain bathroom like get oh my god and you lift up the seat and it's stuck like to the side I felt like a chunk oh Lord yes and then you hit flush and you see the water go over it like not moving it at all you gotta pee on it and knock yes and sometimes you don't even have enough strength for that I've caught I told the flight attendants I'm like someone really dropped a crazy shit in there and they gave me spray like from their personnel I go spray that in there and spray it myself it's not gonna shake it loose off the side now it's a clinger yeah yeah it's intense intense man yeah why is why's your body have to smell so awful wouldn't you know what purpose is that serve I guess to let you know that that is not something you want to put in your body you don't want to eat that you know because otherwise like I told you about my dog when he was a puppy he would eat his shit he want to eat his shit so bad that as he was shitting he would be turning around trying to bite it out of his asshole oh my god really this little golden retriever yeah Wow when he was a little baby he would do that it was hilarious and disgusting at the same time but he'd be like shitting and they'd go oh what do we got here and then apparently they give they is such a common thing with dogs there's something to give them you know to keep yeah yeah to make their shit tame you're like oh that it's not terrible enough on its own the shit isn't and they're like now this will really make it bad oh okay yeah some people spray something on the shit oh I'm like well let's just clean it up you lazy bitch guys clean it hang up the log no no I'll just gonna spray something let's spray some hot sauce teach old fellow awesome yeah you know I watched this thing on spies and they used to they used to leave notes like this is back in Cold War days in dead animals and think that would be one way to pass on information ah but those animals would get eaten by other animals because it's dead right so then they stay figured out that not no wild animal basically likes Tabasco so they would douse dead animals with Tabasco and have a note Wow tucked into it never get eaten they would smell that and be like fuck that isn't that crazy yes you do like mmm this might be doable now yeah Wells in New Orleans they have hot chicken mm-hmm you know how they like fried chicken dipped in hot sauce yeah I think it Nashville has a Nashville in New Orleans natural has managed right yeah Nashville hot chicken is I confused it yeah I confuse it's natural it's fucking amazed amazed abit I think downtown yeah what is it hot was that one of those ones you have to wait in line all day yeah yeah but that's the Nashville one too which makes me I'm like fuck this they only make like a certain amount of day yeah so they don't like they're not cooking it all day they make one batch and that's how much you get Hatchin then that kind of demand for your food like I made this and they're like we'll wait outside in the Sun please can I have some you're like I'm out and I'm like I'm leaving for the day I'll see Franklin's and Alden Franklin's barbecue famous for that they the people will pay people to wait in line for them and here I mean I've driven by it I mean for years what's it called on La Brea Pink's yeah you see that line sometimes you're like that's just a regular hot dog too mad once you eat it yeah of course I'm a fucking moron and in Philly almost all the good cheesesteak places have a crazy line well there's something about booze and then food that's cooked out in the open you like let that smell fly around the night air yeah yeah yeah the last time I drank of substance I think it was in Columbus and they have carts Street carts guys making you know euros and hotdogs and like you have it little booze in you and you tear it down you're like that was good round two let's do it and then it's like ten minutes after you eat your second thing when you're drinking you're like this is a bad idea I should have just stuck to the one we were in Columbus once and we went to a bar after we did the comedy show and there was a guy in front of the bar that was selling venison sausage sandwiches with peppers and onions and holy shit was it good felt like the first time I'd ever eaten a venison sausage hmm but this guy killed the deer himself and was selling venison sausages had a cart and a cart yeah that's cool fucking amazing damn and all kinds of crazy sauces that he was putting on them that guy's an artist today I think about that that's an artist just I hope one day I walk out there is there yes yeah yes the venison sausage guy I got some elk Gossage for you Tommy but I can't wait no let's wrap this up because I got to get out of here I got to drive all the way to fucking Irvine tonight do it I was gonna ask you if Tom could tell you about the curse of little B he knows all about it yeah thank you no more little B Lil B he really did curse Kevin Durant right he did Carson and it worked Kevin was no no part of that Wow I mean nothin apologize no but Kevin switched teams because of the curse who knows he said he was never gonna win a championship ever again or ever really I think that's what Lil B said and then he took the curse off I believe yeah I think you're right these Kris multiple people but he didn't curse hardened because because uh I didn't credit it with men I believe his what movement it was like you know cooking like I got to eat whatever stirring food up I'm eating right now like when you're when you're killing it right and like that was a little B's move so nobody lifted it looks like you lift it C lifts cursing James Harden yeah it's cursed multiple people on Twitter it's a thing you don't want that's when what happened I took that texted you and I was like see the thing was when when a guy like that says he's cursing you like that's what voodoo is all about it gets in your head that's right mind fucks you what is he dress like yeah did he really dress like that yes he dressed like a chick with a like an old lady's hat and a dress on he's definitely a wide variety of outfits fascinating yeah fascinating wants do a podcast oh you should

other thing yeah the other way around you know keep your socks on if you're hot funky feet yeah that's right don't want to see that shit he is a serious character though yeah man he's an interesting guy interesting guy he's probably the first guy to come with the public curse like who who else yeah who's publicly curse people no no and it's worked that's what's crazy it's just it's bold just to have that in your arsenal I'm saying of of insults or beef like to be the first like if somebody was somebody said like Joe just dude was talking shit about you and you're like that's fine I just curse that motherfucker like that in and of itself is just terrifying yeah especially if it works it's confident move man I want to say that the bass God's curse is gone from Kevin Durant okay Thunder
