the girag an experience we were talking a little bit earlier how much of your life revolves around on it you know how much here but life revolves around the pleasure that food booze oh yeah you know we talk nice before the podcast season started about making the choice yeah between booze and was owed like if you could eat whatever the fuck you want it and be healthy and live till you're fucking 90 and all that shit or but you couldn't drink this or you could drink but you can't eat shit Yeti cardboard and fucking grape leaves ok well I'm going to wear gray please give cardboard and fucking grab I truly believe that living without good food and living without I mean if you're gonna survive your you know if you're living in the walking dead and you gotta shoot deer and shit that's all well and good but we're talking about in this day and age I'm talking you have a choice if ya like a choice between I can eat my favorite shit or I can drink booze and and and have the added sort of crank that that gives right everything you're like well what I was going to say was that the idea of you know subsistence living is although frightening that food is delicious eating deer over a campfire that's a really yummy tasting food if you're saying like shitty food like cardboard tasting bland food that's a big sorry enjoyment of the day in my opinion a meal with my family i think is one of my favorite things in life and that sounds like sounds uh turd like utter horseshit so nosy ball doesn't but the real idea is like sitting down with your kids and having a laugh and having a meal I I think that that whole process is is very important and nutrition is very important but for me the taste is very important as well I think it's important to eat things that are delicious it's like a it's a part of like a pleasurable aspect of life and so if I had to choose honestly between drinking booze and eating delicious food I would go with delicious food I think delicious food is more important because I've experienced the booze but I understand the lessons right the lessons of the dropping of the inhibition and the good aspects of alcohol which are often overlooked by people who just can't handle alcohol yeah you know like we were talking before the podcast started about not there's a certain level of trust that you have or someone as well you drunk with you yeah like you know that guy's demons they're all they're all right there they also take as a five or six Jack and cokes you know telling a story about Tijuana you're like holy shit cottage whoa what did you tell your mom well I climbed into my you know I mean it's like you get to know a person like and you realize that there's no benefit in hiding all that shit from people you love anyway there's a benefit in telling them and the sort of camaraderie that ensues from those drunken conversations of complete and total honesty where where the alcohol does a purpose instead of inhibiting you and making you make shitty decisions the alcohol releases you from this this idea that anything makes any sense whatsoever and you start telling the truth or you start expressing yourself or you start looking at things for more relaxed perspective even temporarily with that thought gets planted in your mind and then you just have more of a sense of friendliness the next day like you know oftentimes it's it's little encounters it's steer us and I remember this any Anthony Robbins quote who believe it or not I've listened a lot of his books on tape and read his books and he's got a lot of interesting ways of looking at things that I really think are enabling but one of the things that he said is that sometimes if two people are going along very same path like think of yourself as like two boats if one boat just turns one degree to the right like over the course of the boats motion through life just that one decision can lead it so far away from the original path that it was on and that often times it's a good time that leads you you know and it might cost you a day or two of being hungover it might but there might be that phone call we call each other on a Wednesday like I had a fucking great time do tell but doesn't even have to be I'm not even talking about like a crazy fucking Busey fucking you know crazy time because the reason why i asked a question is because whatever I meet people I like in I respect you know I like to ask them questions because I believe that's how you learn and so I have this distance problem because I'll tell you what I grew up poor I grew up there poor i left home at a very young age and and a lot of what i learned I learned you know initially through books you know so I read books and and then I that's why I have this sort of intense curiosity about the world because I all fuck i'd like to go there and see that for myself so anyway speaking of general so I I go to the Ukraine you know I'm not you know I'm just a regular fucking dude from butt fuck nowhere and I go there and I have this dinner and and and and they bring out these potato pancakes with sour cream and caviar and vodka and all this shit and I'm I'd say you know i think is the first time i carry on i'm eating it I'm like this is fucking awesome you love caviar right off the bat yeah first time ever had it now granted I does a few vodkas in but you know I'm drinking the bark and eating the caviar and it's Russia and it's crazy we were out in the middle of fucking no it's not Russia the Ukraine we're on the middle of fucking nowhere and it's some crazy Cossack shits going down and it's that I'm like fuck this is like living in a book and it's crazy and I I literally had one of the best nights when I was like living in a in a book from the 1800s so I one of the best times y then you know so for the longest time I'm like I fucking caviar is my favorite fucking food and this is a great thing work then I was shooting in Iran so I'm going to Iran where the best caviar comes from now and I'm in my hotel room in my story in my hotel in the Iran the only hotel foreigners can stand they sell caviar and Bobby so I'm sitting there in the lobby and I go fuck yeah I love caviar that's my favorite shit now man so I go and I by the caviar right in the store it's like the best gay so I don't know I bought like ten thousand dollars of caviar a hundred bucks or some shit so I get it and I go upstate but they'd have no booze right because as I ran so I have like orange Fanta and some chips in this caviar and I'm like this is just fucking salty fucking fish a place like shit but fuck it is it only tastes good when you're drunk well I think this is the whole question that I have is that like when you have a big fucking fat old steak with a good but you know glass of red wine how much of it is the fucking red wine and how much of it is the steak when you have your linguine with clams with a nice fucking crisp fucking white one how much of it is I checked out why whatever how much is the fucking is the is the talk and then the thing around like you said do you meal with your family how much of that is with the family and with the thing and then so when I was sitting up there and in this fucking shitty fucking hotel room in Randy's bit shit yeah you know carrier with Fanta I'm like actually I probably just enjoyed the fucking evening right you know I enjoyed the people and the craziness and the fucking vodka of caviar and the fact that I hadn't had it before and everything went fucking apeshit and all that stuff not a giant ape shit they it was it was a very fucking transformative evening right and then when I just had the straight-up caviar like man five years that's so funny what a contrast yeah so so when I was asking you the question cuz we were talking about food and you were saying like you know if you have a bad back you shouldn't eat the pasta when you don't fuck I love fucking Boston know what I was saying is that this chiropractor that i was talking to over the weekend she was explaining to me the influence of certain wheat and gluten yeah and how it inflamed tissue and that you can get a substantial anti inflammatory response by just cutting weed out of your diet yeah i agree with you that there's a pleasure to eating that I think is like super important pleasure to eating in a pleasure to drink I mean I like could I smoke weed and and not drink cuz I would talk to that problem no we're know that mean for me we'd is like that's the one that really made a big difference like I think alcohol has played a good part in a lot of positive aspects of my life as far as like joyful evenings and having fun with friends and Nina telling them that you love them and you know and and you know even whatever romantic altercations you know how it boys no girls bro cut the shit Brian but as far as like what what transform me is a human being no marijuana is more important yeah yeah merit marijuana was to me like there was like almost like a missing piece to my sort of conceptual puzzle of like how i interfaced with the with nature and with the world I was like why am I so goddamn agro right you know and then all sudden I find weed I was like boom I know yeah i know a lot for me actually booze was my Savior because I was hanging out with a lot of dudes who are doing some serious sea restaurant bad drug and my whole thing was I don't want to be 60 years old and not so I always have this my idyllic sort of retirement which I'm trying to get to sooner rather than later now is just like just sort of forgotten like little cove you know a little cold that'd be your neighbor yeah and I'm you to be on my fam solar I'm sitting there on this go I'm gonna send you this I'm gonna send you this this article of this couple of your kids three and one-half dude I got a four and a fucking to have a party why I'm gonna tell i am gonna send you the old you boys or girls girls okay we got big lesbian super i gotta send you this article it's a fantastic article but a dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma and fauna cancer like the worst cancer you can ever and and he's a Greek dude he grew up in America but like you know came here when his three-year sumption so he goes back to Greece to this little island in the middle of nowhere and he has to walk up this hill every day he goes to talk to his buddies drinking the wine he's eating the food from the firm wherever and all of a sudden like five years but he was given like you know six months to live whatever not even six weeks to live and and they said well you know what the fuck happened you didn't die and he goes you know i came here and i forgot to die because you know he's sitting there and and there's no stress and he's walking up the hill every day and he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the you know the fish from the bay in the fucking whatever and i sit down i say you know now looking at this shit so my idyllic retirement basically I'm stealing this guy who killed cancer by living this euphoric life of i live on this little Cove and I'm drinking my wine and I'm sitting out there and I'm just blissing out on reality now that's why i didn't get hooked to heroin that's why i didn't get hooked the fucking crack that's why i didn't get hooked all the shit to my boys got hooked too because i always thought to myself if I fucking get hooked to this shit I'm gonna have to a die or be fucking quit it and if I quit it guess what I'm never going to be able to sit on that fucking cove with my glass of fucking wine sitting out there I'm being dis blissful old Buddha dude right but when I was a kid honey I I thought I was gonna die so I don't give a fuck i do anything cuz i'm gonna die who the fuck cares what did you think you were gonna die cuz i was gonna die mean you know everybody i grew up with you know when I was a kid died because we were bad guys doing bad shit people died almost done how bad were you guys like what did you guys think anybody I mean everybody who does like blow farts on people no Brian so it's like you know look you do some gang shit you do Oh gang shit but you're doing Canadian gang usually exactly how about that's like telling fart somehow bad for you beat but nope you know look people get it people get into junk doesn't matter if it's by the way this is a surprising thing while they get into everything but you know generally the the end result is it well now could be met but it heroin and the thing is is even in shitty sort of nice Canada people end up on junk or they're doing they start doing more and more serious crimes and and this is one of the reasons why my my Cove was was my dream was because you know you have guys who are dying of heroin overdoses or guys are going to prison for life or worse getting killed and and you know these are 17 18 19 year-old kids and you're sitting there saying that's the biggest tragedy is you never fucking live your you the teenager you think you fucking lived you're right you haven't lived shit you haven't done shit you haven't seen shit and one of the reasons why i say i'm gonna go out and i'm going to see shit and i'm going to do all this shit whatever is because I didn't fucking by but at a certain point you sit there and you say look you know and I know how hard life is we know fucking what good things or can be right and can be and also we realize there's a lot of people who didn't make it you know there's a lot of people who just for one out one reason or other they don't get to where you are so what I'm trying to say is you know you want to get two more of a of an understanding and this is when i go back to like I don't give a fuck what people think about me I don't give a fuck about well shit because when you see it you sit there and say on this hand this motherfucker got shot or the sprite right to heroin this guy got into this now to go back to the synthetic long-winded uh-huh but if you go back to it what do I want to do I want to sit in the cove with my family your family and chill hanging out have a drink enjoy myself I don't know how much food and although I'm a fat bastard I don't know how much food is going to play into that but I definitely want to be sitting there with that glass of wine looking out of that Cove and just going I fucking made it I mean and that's why I don't get that's why I don't judge anybody because I'll tell you what everyone's trying to get through the day to get to their goddamn Cove you
