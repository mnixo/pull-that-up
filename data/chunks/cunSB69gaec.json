boom we're live that's it just like that so thank you for doing this welcome what's going on total pleasure nothing happy to be in LA are you I am always New York's good right now though right it's good it's like Jewish it's like an addictive relationship but most of us would rather be in California New York is yeah yeah yeah it's um your psychiatrist yeah um I would think that there is ample work in New York just the environment that New York provides people stacked on top of each other like that beep beep Hong Kong fuck you all that like I would assume all that stress leads to a lot of people with uh absolutely like you're a fisherman you want to live near a river right right and it's fetishized in New York to to have a psychiatrist it's sort of almost expected that you do so not only is there like ample supply and demand but then it's you know it's a thing wrong yeah yeah what what's that about can you explain that I think it's like you know Woody Allen level right like sort of embracing your shadow and and there's something refreshing about it because we don't pretend to be okay I mean we're deeply not okay in New York chronically well it's someone okay it like in general anywhere is there a spot like oh yeah Seattle they've got it nailed I mean there's this term actually in the medical literature believe it or not called paleo deficit disorder and it just refers to like how far have you strayed from the path in your lifestyle like basic stuff green space movement you know sleep and I would imagine that if you have more of those components intact you're probably a bit more okay than if you're living you know right in you know midtown Manhattan like Seattle in the summer to me is a really good place because it's so green and it's so pretty and the oceans right there so you're getting some good air and then you're getting Sun because it's the summer so you don't have that seasonal depression thing that goes on I mean I imagine they're doing better you're Deborah you never I've heard it's like crazy beautiful yeah it's awesome it's awesome but those winners they get to you after the 30th day irregular come on this is stupid like how much water do you need I'm like a big big winter complainer and I have been my whole life so I complained 10 months of the year of what it's like to live in the Northeast but recently I've been playing around with the idea that there's actually something cool about like a you know sort of cyclical living it's almost just like if you embrace it then there's something just like everything did and miserable for a period of time and then it blooms and you get to experience like this rebirth and then it you know flourishes and then it dies again that there's another perspective on that actually being I don't know like if you work with it it's sort of like a woman who's on birth control has no idea that there's any point to you know a cycle of energy over the course of the month Ryan she sort of thinks is that that's annoying but there's a way you can wrap your mind around it where you mean okay so like if you're on birth control you have no menstrual cycle right right so you're just like you're like a man you're like a flatline the whole month but there's actually something really empowering if you understand how to work with your energy shifts cuz naturally like a woman's natural meant I know this is really what you want to be talking about I don't I mean it's alien to me so I do want to hear like I figured this out I'm 39 I was on birth control for 12 years so I never knew what it was what it meant to have like a menstrual cycle until very recently because I had two kids breastfeeding so a couple decades into my life I'm just figuring this out but you have like totally different kinds of energy over the course of the month and you have to know how to work with that so there is a kind of energy that you want to go out and socialize or you want to stay in and work or you want to sleep more or less and if you don't know how to ride that then you could be sort of taken off-guard by it but if you know how to work with it it's so much more powerful than just having this like artificial hijacking of your endocrine system that's interesting so there's like some sort of analogy to be drawn between the cycles of nature and the cycles of your body month tomorrow yeah huh I would have never considered that I never even thought about it but I have thought about birth control before how crazy it is that you give a woman a hormone that convinces her body that she's perpetually pregnant and that a giant percentage of women are on it for convenience or even from other medical issues like skin issues right exactly yeah I mean when I I've always been a feminist right so even when I was younger and very much asleep I identified as a feminist and I was one of those people who thought that birth control was like a female entitlement like how dare you not make this free and widely available but as I began to research more about it and more about how it's in many ways like the ultimate you know not to sound too inflammatory but the ultimate tool for oppression of you know the modern woman now I find it incredible that we you know that we're still taking it because it seems like a good idea right who wants to deal with your annoying menstrual cycle who wants to get pregnant who wants to have endometriosis or polycystic ovary you know who wants to have acne or like hair growing in weird places but it's the magic pill illusion mmm there's no free lunch there's never going to be something that just fixes it for you and you just waltz off into the sunset there's always a cost and the cost is so much more that's like ranging from literally death all the way to just like subtle alterations in your personality and like the fear moans you secrete you know and there there was just a million woman study in Scandinavia that showed about the vast increase in antidepressant prescribing for teenagers who are prescribed birth control so it's the beginning of sort of is a gateway drug sometimes for psych meds too I heard I had a friend who one of his good friends his daughter died from some complications with taking birth control pills and smoking cigarettes yes pulmonary embolism problem that is smoking cigarettes apparently along with the birth control pills are extremely dangerous but so many do it of course and you don't even have to have that additional risk factor you know cuz birth control whether it's the pill or something called the NuvaRing by itself has that you know I'm contacted often by parents of girls who have died from pulmonary embolism who've now be like activists in this realm it's because of birth control pills yeah yeah no it's like a known mechanism and it's a known risk factor like I think that's not being suppressed or hidden it's just that we are sort of entrained to dismiss the risks as we attach to the promise so we sort of like collude and ignoring that potential you know that's so interesting because most people when they think about the birth control pill they think about it as something that liberated women because they can control whether or not they got pregnant and they were allowed for the first time to have careers and do whatever they wanted to because they didn't have to worry about being trapped that's right right so story but that's the biological free lunch thing right there's isn't there also a lot of issues Chris Ryan was on here dr. Chris Ryan the author of sex at dawn he was on here and he was talking about how women can like if you smell the clothes of other men you can literally tell the men that you are attracted to you would be biologically compatible with those men and that when they did these same studies on women who were on the birth control pill they couldn't smell the difference that's right it's called the t-shirt study yeah how does that work could you explain that well essentially the the premise of pharmaceutical medicine is that you can just pull like one little thread of the spider web and leave the rest of it intact everything else is gonna be fine we're only working on this one area so with birth control for example the idea is we're just you know taking over the management of your sex hormones but the rest of your body is going to be totally unaffected and of course as we learn more about how all of these systems are totally and inextricably interconnected we have a better understanding of how you know when you interfere with sex hormones you also potentially have other effects including raising things called binding globulin including inflammatory response you're depleting a number of nutrients and we're having you know it's possible that we we haven't even begun to look through the keyhole of the effects on brain and you know sort of neuro peptides and these arenas where we don't have any idea what firm onal secretion is about like we just have to defer to the probability that our bodies are more complex than weave right like begun to understand so your biology is meant to guide you it's meant to empower you and it's meant to you know create a sense of vitality if you can inhabit your body and be in a truce with it that's part of the problem with the mindset of birth control is I'm just gonna you know take this over I'm going to manage this and so who knows maybe even it's a top down like mindset thing that begins to sort of divorce you from your sensibilities we don't really know is the point that's good that's going to be a common answer I think yeah I have to give you is that we we don't really know but it does make sense that you're you know the subtle nature of your biology that involves you know sort of guiding your human interactions and particularly sex related interactions is going to be derailed I mean low libido is one of the most common disclosed side effects of birth control so you're you're taking it so that you can have unprotected sex we don't feel like having sex ultimately anyways so it's not even really that well thought out I think by most of us it's very bizarre but what other alternatives are there I mean if you're a woman and you want to have control of whether or not you get pregnant there's not a whole lot of options other than weird ones like IUDs which seem real weird yeah I mean there's some of my patients use what's called a copper IUD you know it's funny cuz I had one put in and two and out it costs like $700 and two and a half weeks later I had it taken out because I just felt weird about having like a pharmaceutical metal and my if my body was felt like a tracking device I feel it and there no no yeah and you're freaking out it's just like psychologically felt weird but um I use something called a daisy which is like this highly calibrated thermometer or any track you're you know because you have six fertile days a month this isn't you know like some major sacrifice you have to make in order to learn how your cycle works and then you get the benefits of being in your hormonal milieu you know like it's not it's not that complicated hey but it worked there's a learning curve you know require is like learning how to be a woman and also sharing the onus because you know with all of these side effects we've been talking about you know there was like a male birth control study that was just terminated because of how many side effects like the men didn't want to deal with you know so there's such a socio-cultural double standard around this but if we're talking about six days a month like how do we collaborate and try and figure something out you know that doesn't involve a risk of death perhaps so this Daisy thing just monitors your temperature and tells you exactly what's going on yeah I mean it's a little more sophisticated than that it actually has the efficacy like above 99% efficacy if you listen to it that's part of the you know right room for human error but it basically just tells you like have sex now if you want to conceive or if you don't then don't rights a little like a little lights green red or yellow how many women are on birth control if you had a guess nationwide you know I would that's a good question I don't know the stat of hand upwards of like 10 million I would say that's a staggering number of people taking some sort of a substance that alters the very nature of who they are exactly yeah I mean my interest in it really came from looking at the psychiatric side effects because I'm very interested in medications that have potential you know gateway effects around psychiatric meds that we aren't informing women of before you know they start the prescription so you know whether it's like acid blocking medications you know or antibiotics you know birth control vaccines these things have known psychobiological effects if you don't know that then you'll never connect the dots and then you end up in the polypharmacy realm where you're taking multiple meds right without ever knowing where the Dominos like started to fall yeah I remember there was a commercial they used to have and although they still air it but it was for a psychiatric medication that you take who's an antidepressant when you were depressed from antidepressants do you know I'm talking about I think you're probably talking about it vilify yes yeah it's exactly the number one prescription in America recently terrifying it's a new psychotic yeah will you read the side effects it's like whoa slow down like what is this like psychotic thoughts and death and yeah bleeding and right and if what you were taking that had similar side effects isn't working then you can just layer this on it's very common practice it's very rare I would say actually for people to be on just one psychiatric met it's almost real industry standard to be taking upwards of I would say you know two three sometimes even five many of the patients I work with come to me on a cocktail of like five minutes Jesus Christ yeah well you're chasing something for like years right cuz you're never really gonna feel yourself the way you want to and that's what I found is really what we want you know like we just want to feel comfortable in her own skin we just want to feel ourselves like in fact we don't want to you know be her or him or be rich or beautiful we just want to feel cool being who we are and you're never going to I don't want to say never it's very unlikely you'd feel that way while on a medication that has consciousness altering effects and a slew of side effects and so you're going to be chasing that with other with the promise of other meds you know a stimulant because your pixels making you tired and then you need a benzodiazepine because you can't sleep and you know then you're sort of depressed again and so you have another antidepressant layered on and then there's a fad you know sort of you know bipolar to medication that you could try out like lamictal or abilify and so this is sort of the culturally sanctioned approach to mental health today yeah so how does a doctor know like say if you they put you on some zoloft or something like that and not to pick on Zoloft but then they say well it's it's not really totally doing it for you well we're thinking about stacking abilify in with the zoloft and I think that just might be the ticket to your happiness right right right yeah well it's it's important to remember right like particularly in psychiatry there's no objective testing measures not like you have a broken arm like hey I see you have a broken arm we're gonna put your arm in a cast with a broken arm you can get an x-ray right improve they have a broken arm right in psychiatry there's no blood test there's no EEG there's no you know scan of any kind it's a conversation sometimes as short as 10 minutes like say if I came in your office and I'm a little different okay but just say if you're a regular psychiatrist yeah and I'm like man I don't know Kelly I'm I'm a fucking mess I can't keep it together what do I do what do I take could you just start someone off on like a low dose of something and see if it helps and they come back in a couple of weeks like how does it work yeah it's like it it's like an art form I mean you have your personal favorite medications that you feel comfortable prescribing so you're more likely to prescribe them but then also and this is also you know in the literature itself if a patient comes in asking for a particular medication then you 49% I think it was like of prescriptions that are written are written because of specific patient requests so like Jesus where people get actual exactly they're getting these ideas from the fact that we are one of three countries in the world that allows for direct to consumer where the other ones North Korea and Russia no it's the other one rising it's bread Brazil and New Zealand oh wow that is surprising it's weird right it confuses the hell out of me when I watch those commercials and those like beautiful piano music playing and there's cartoon flowers or smiling everybody what what are they selling me yeah I mean oh it works ask your doctor multi billions are put as those commercials yeah for good reason so there's no real like there's not like a blood test or something to give you they say I think this is going to be the ticket for you nope yeah no it's very impressionistic and that's sort of the issue I mean the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSM is sort of the dictionary so to speak in psychiatry and like in the 50s it was like 150 pages and now it's 886 pages and it's grown in volume largely because of the consensus decisions of a bunch of older white men sitting around a table goddamn white man was definitely seen the pain you know almost all of them have industry ties and this is out there this isn't like conspiracy yeah no my wife's mom was a nurse and she was always telling me that they would get taken out on these really nice dinners by these pharmaceutical companies they take it to a real nice restaurant buy steak and champagne you know and everybody could have a drink and you know they would be so willing to be like very complimentary of this medication rule I know a girl took this and it really helped her a lot and you don't get snotty effect you like I was in that you know generation to where I got taken out to 5-star restaurants in Manhattan all the girls buy you stuff it feels really good because you're making like 20 grand a year working your ass off and so when someone takes you to a fancy restaurant with your friends yeah but you could convince yourself that it's not actually going to you know that you're an intellectual and you're going to make your own decisions but all of the data suggests otherwise that you are unduly influenced by that kind of courtship yeah here and it's it's true so we have this like you know sort of collusion on the part of the doctor and the patients to support industry interests over any any sort of another ed of a scientific or evidence-based process for really diagnosing someone well especially when we're talking about something that is so subjective where it's not like a broken arm right well like Joe you've got a broken arm like I know what to do we're gonna set your arm and get you a cast it's like so you're feeling down hey man right you know like do they even ask you like does this does a normal psyche I guess like someone who's really good would but it is your diet and your sleep patterns is that a consideration before they prescribe medication no in fact most sort of turncoat doctors like me will tell you that we have one hour of nutrition education in all of our medical school and residency training one are you a turncoat are you like considered like a rat are you a bad person in the industry I'm not welcome in that really halls anymore no I like about my faculty positions yeah why can this just a lever being honest about this stuff um because I guess the kind of science that I bring to the table which is not my own I don't have any original ideas but I am really good I think at curating information and collecting it and synthesizing and presenting it right so what I have to shine a light on is very inconvenient science for industry interests but also for conventional practice because you know I don't prescribe medication anymore under any circumstances ever but I do have an entire practice you know devoted to taking people off of medication so I have sort of my thing and it's a lot based on lifestyle change as you mentioned right mm-hmm if you don't have your methodology as an alternative to prescribing and you're going to acknowledge what a lot of the science says that condemns the pharmaceutical approach what are you gonna do instead you just invested two hundred thousand dollars of debt blood sweat and tears indentured servitude for like a decade of your training just gonna give that up you know so it's a lot to expect the average psychiatrist to acknowledge you know anything beyond what's called like consensus medicine it's called that because it doesn't even have a connection to the evidence it's not evidence-based it's just they all agree on it and they're just going to keep doing it you know so this consensus medicine like in psychiatry there's kind of like this understanding that you don't criticize the the system that everybody is operating under you just work within that system yeah why would you bother you know cuz just gonna get you in feel comfortable for you and get you in trouble and it's so crazy there's no incentive you know like I read more science than probably all my conventional colleagues put together because I have a lot of incentive to do so because I'm practicing outside of the you know the gold standard so to speak so when you're in the fold why would you bother reading science who cares you just do what you were taught to do don't question it you know so it's you know the reason that lifestyle is not presented as a relevant factor in conventional medicine is because it flies in the face of the whole model right like the model is still a gene based model it's still you were born with it you know it's like coddling the victim there's nothing you can do about it so you know you better just be a good boy and take your medication it's the only thing you can do because diet doesn't matter you know whether you're you know huffing fumes through your window doesn't matter whether you're eating six cans of tuna a day and mercury poisoning yourself doesn't none of that matters really maybe it's like of minor interest but the real problem is your inborn genetic chemical imbalance right so if that is the premise and it's not just in psychiatry it's in all of medicine is gene based determinism freeze Pharma to offer the only solution and it actually validates people on some level as the victim right so like a lot of people want to feel weirdly you know like their own victimization it feels comfortable even though there's science that supports that having a healthy nutrient-dense diet allows your body to produce the all the healthy hormones and chemicals and neurotransmitters and all the and then along with exercise which also increases it is there having never studies also the show that exercise regular aerobic exercise in particular it does as much to treat depression as SSRIs more yeah actually because the efficacy of most antidepressants is pretty embarrassing like you know to be frank because if you really dig into the literature it's not what you think it is in terms of really being a viable treatment option so many of these natural alternatives like far out pace I mean things even like herbs like tumeric or acupuncture yoga you know exercise and that's just a single intervention so there's nothing miraculous about my approach it's basically just putting all those things together at once for like a synergistic effect so you can send your body and minds like a signal of safety right and it works right so if you're just doing one of those things in isolation and even one of those things is more effective then you know it's really it really comes down to the mindset because if you want it in a pill it's going to be challenging for you to get results through effort or something behavioral so the mindset piece has become a real focus for me as being maybe the most important determinant of what's going to be ineffective the mindset piece meaning I mean what you believe like about health and if you want to you know believe that you're broken and that you know chemicals are necessary to manage your scary body and I've talked to a lot of smart people who believe that I have a friend she's a scientist she's very smart and she's on antidepressants and if you talk to her she will argue to the death these are critical for her life and that she needs them and she has some sort of a brain in balance and it's no different than having you know some other organ in your body doesn't function properly you need medication for that we've been told that I was told that and I believe that for sure you know the analogy is often well it's like insulin to a diabetic it's the same thing and the more you you know challenge that you're stigmatizing mental illness yes how dare you you know I've been exactly approached yeah I've been accused of shaming yeah women which is of course the last you know all I care about is is empowering women around their health literally I wake up every single day and devote my life to that purpose like the last thing I have any intention of doing is shaming anyone who's made this decision well it's just whenever something makes someone uncomfortable with their choices they immediately want to turn someone else into an aggressor or someone who's victimizing them but this this woman that I'm friends with it's unfortunate because I feel like if she exercised at least she would know she doesn't exercise so if you don't exercise do you don't really know if that would help right you know but I hate to be that guy because I already am you know like that proselytizing you got to work out god that's fucking annoying that's like the CrossFit person or the proselytizing vegan or whatever a new cult member I know they just you just want it and it doesn't work because you're never gonna convince them why people to hate you it's true and it's like the you know you bring a horse to water thing ya know you can't can't make it happen course but there is more readiness now then I think ever before like people are ready and once they have the information it's sort of like you know like and then they just transform well these conversations are happening now more and more with people where they're starting to look at like what what is it in my life that's causing me stress what is it in my life that is depleting my sleep patterns or my health have I ever gotten my blood test done and find out where my nutrient levels are yeah yes and you know and everybody's nutrient means they're very different biologically people like people are going to respond differently to drugs people are gonna respond differently to food it's just we come from different parts of world and some people need different stuff and this is being called like n of one medicine and being like meaning the number of people in a study so like the phrases and of one medicine because we're beginning to understand exactly what you're saying which is that it's you this is your thing this is your journey this is very specific to you right so like you know your depression let's say could be because you have a b12 deficiency it could be because you have low thyroid function it could be because you're taking birth control it could be because you know your dog died it could be because you have a shitty job that you hate it could be because your marriage has to go and it could be because you're ready for some psycho spiritual emergence you know and you are the only one who really knows and who really can figure it out but we on the conventional side of things seek to depersonalized it so it's it's not you it has nothing to do with you it's just a chemical process that's unfolding and you need this one-size-fits-all intervention it's very disingenuous but it's also super common isn't that weird that that everyone numbing there's the access to the data is there for everybody it's there for psychiatrists as well like they would know the efficiency or the effectiveness rather of exercise right but that's what I'm saying it's really coming down to like almost religious level belief systems like I do you believe right which I used to PS either you believe that we're sort of machines right like as Alan Watts would say we're like flush robots on a dead rock floating in the middle of nowhere everything is purposeless and random and it's just bad luck and bad genes and you know it's like the other shoe could fall at any moment and life is just the hustle and you're just trying to survive and you got to avail yourself of real medicine which is pharmaceutical medicine it's the only legit option and you just got to do it and you know what you want some credit for even having the courage to actually take the steps to take your meds right so that's one mindset and then the other which is I believe growing is that we have no idea what we're doing scientifically and we're just looking through the keyhole and science is a process it's not like a destination where the science is settled my favorite phrase so you know the body itself has this you know chiropractors call it vitalism like has this innate wisdom and it doesn't make mistakes like it doesn't mess up every single thing your body is doing is in wise response to a perceived you know stimulus right except diseases of course right like cancer no leukemia no it would include without exception really without in explain what I mean by that but but right so so if I have an ache or a pain or I my hair's falling out or I have a tumor growing out of the side of my body my first response it's possible could be curiosity like it could be what is this about you know where am i off right because in like indigenous cultures for example illness is not like something that your body is doing it's the you know sort of manifestation of things out of balance with you and your soul you know with you and the relationships in your life with you and nature and maybe the collective itself so it's this expression it's this physical manifestation of something much deeper that has roots and until you understand what those roots are for you you won't resolve it right Billick serious error is like birth defects and things along those lines that's not like a wise response to anything right it's an error it's a good question you know the the sort of like congenital question like if you're just like born without my leg I mean you could take it to the extent where you say okay so what drove the birth defect whether it was some sort of you know okay so let's back up a second because epigenetics right is the word du jour for beyond or above actually technically genes right so there's the genes are interesting but perhaps as insignificant as like 1% of what makes us sick right or well we never study what makes as well it's like a total black box but epigenetics is like how does the environment impact our genes right so you could argue that a lot of congenital you know sort of malformations and things like that because this was an area of study for me when I was prescribing to pregnant women which believe it or not was my specialty prescribing the psychiatric meds to pregnant women that it is a response to that exposure and it's the body's method of adapting to an exposure is it an adaptation or is it just an error like if someone's born without a leg what kind of adaptation is that it seems like there's some sort of a genetic error no it depends how you want to look at it I mean to me there are no errors because the body is responding to a perceive stimulus now if you throw a lot of toxicity you know in the way of your body there may be a limit to which it can or will accommodate right because like something confusing for me was at one point I was reflecting on the fact that you know we've had all of these environmental exposures for like about a hundred hundred fifty years like since the Industrial Revolution right so we like live totally different lives now with all these toxic exposures that we sit all day and we don't sleep and we have Monsanto and all the rest pretty much for like the past 100 years or so we can adapt like my body is adapting within the hours that were you know hanging out so why would it not have adapted over the past 100 years and like a paleo argument is like like we've evolved the same way for ninety five percent of our evolution and now we just haven't taken enough time to evolve to catch up with today's modern influences right but I actually think we're not meant to accommodate this and we will self extinguish like if we don't course correct which I have faith we will do but we're not meant to adapt to this kind of you mean like you look alive drop it yeah exactly so that you remember all this will be the end of people if we don't course correct I think we will and I couldn't eat yourself happening pretty much like I think even though we could biologically adapt I think we won't because there is like a cosmic intelligence that is holding us accountable to a certain level of respect for this human organism a certain level of respect for the privilege of being alive you know and the way we're living today just like trashing ourselves and trashing this planet is in is a violation so I don't know is like a subtle point but I think the point is we're not going to adapt so don't wait for it you know and we're just gonna get sicker and sicker and sicker and die and perhaps that is the most intelligent damn someone's voice of doom and gloom no I said it's gonna get better remember right yeah it seems like the sacrifice for productivity the daily sacrifice for productivity that comes at the expense of health and happiness is the norm you know it's like that that's what a lot of people deal with they deal with having bills like as you were pointing about pointing out about exorbitant medical bills that means so many people that are in the medical industry start their practice or start practicing being a doctor of professional doctor with quarter-million dollar debt right which is crazy it's so much money it's it's so crazy yes so what a terrible idea like what's almost mandatory for any civilization well you need health care for sure you need to be able to take care of people I got an idea let's take those people that you need to make these critical decisions to save your life and let's fuck them over let's saddle those people up with crazy debt and leave them trapped in a world of stress I got an even better idea when they're going through the residency let's not let them sleep exactly right keeping caffeinated sugar at work and give them pills give them jicama and feta means you know give them adderall you need a since Ally are you tired Sally I got a little pick-me-up it's called adderall sweetie it's not your fault you've got ADHD DST UV exactly urs but that's how it's like a hazing it's a hazing process no I don't like the military right you know that you remain loyal I mean that's obviously one perspective on it but this what I'm saying right like I was $200,000 in debt it took a lot for me to just like jump ship and say okay whatever I you know invested that and I'm just gonna walk away from it most people you know are not in a position to do that and perhaps that's part of the design I don't know well I don't even if it's not design it's a very efficient efficient survival mechanism for the industry you know it just seems like one of the worst ways for someone to start a career in taking care of people is to be all fucked up themselves but they need to be broken down in that way to stay in line no it's kind of basic you know sort of hierarchical systems work this way is it a conspiracy or is it people just taking advantage of this need and being greedy and and just charging exorbitant amounts of money and having the whole thing subsidized by the government so they could be expensive and then the whole thing is crazy and also here's the big one that a lot of people maybe if you're a kid you're not aware of this your student loans haunt you till you're dead you cannot get out of those fuckers like you can get out you could you could buy Ferrari you could be stupid and buy a Ferrari and go goddammit I can't afford this car man you go bankrupt and they will allow you to go bankrupt that's that that can happen you can have a business make terrible decisions lose all your money go bankrupt and literally be absolved of your debt accept your student loans that shit is in your DNA tethered they keep you you have to pay that you have to it's crazy it's so nuts how much money it is when you find out what the student loan industry is in this country and how much money children go oh you're a fucking child when you're 18 years old right so you make some ridiculous decision to go to some school and you get some grant or you get some sort of scholarship and then the rest of it you're gonna get loans or whatever the hell your situation is and then you get out of 4 years and then you go and do your masters you go and do some graduate work ah you're fucked you're fucked you're so broke and then if you get out what are the odds you even get a job in your field you know you have to scramble to try to make some money and then you have this never-ending the pool of debt that you have to suck a little bit out of every month it's like living for the Oasis on the horizon but that's what we do in this country you know we just are constantly waiting for it to feel okay constantly waiting till we get there we're not getting there I think free education I mean if it would be possible if it is possible to do it without ruining the educational system if it's not already ruined if it is possible to do that it would be like one of the best things we could ever do for young people just keep them from being saddled down with some bullshit that you have to keep with you for the rest of your life so you like are handicapped out the gate yeah it's crazy and it also it inhibits any risk-taking you're gonna have exactly any chance like to jump ship and try something new like maybe you're doing something but all the while you have this idea god I think this is really what I'm supposed to be doing I'm always thinking about it I got to take a chance but I have this fucking debt and the only way to really pay this debt off is if I enter into this same that's it well that's a really important point because if you sort of look across dimensions culturally they're all geared towards supporting a certain kind of mindset and mentality which is productivity oriented which is you know capitalism and consumer supportive in terms of that you know sort of financial apparatus and so the things and elements you know like Graham Hancock has talked about this you know the elements that are convenient to that paradigm including psychiatric meds and even alcohol on some level like these more sort of suppressive consciousness suppressive tools are sanctioned right the things that would encourage risk-taking encourage creative expression encourage you know sort of consciousness expansion are you know demonized or you know rendered illegal because they're inconvenient to the paradigm I guess but honestly I think there it's a victim of circumstance more than anything when I I don't I'm not necessarily I believe that when the psychedelic Act of 1970 was put into play it was clearly put into play because they were trying to arrest people that were in the civil rights movement in the anti-war movement that's been proven it's been proven that there was a collusion and that what they were trying to do was make it so that they could go after these people in the civil rights movement go after these people that were in the anti-war movement they would catch them for drugs and arrest them and they would cripple these movements and this is all like documented real clear by the Nixon administration the reason why they passed that sweeping psychedelics Act of 1970 which covered a lot of stuff that's not even psychoactive they didn't even know what they're doing and they missed some of the big ones they missed like five methoxy DMT which some of the most potent psychedelic drugs known to man just a few years ago used to be able to buy that shit online from chemical companies they would give you like a jug of it they could get a whole city high from the month and you could go buy it with a credit card not that I know of anybody did it exist I certainly didn't and I definitely still still don't have any of it but if I did it's not even illegal that's what's crazy it's like they they made stuff that was like a normal part of human use for thousands and thousands years they made it highly illegal and they did it at a time where they were trying to break down these people that were trying to change society right so that was 1970 but along the way I think what's really happened is it became a matter of financial risk like marijuana is a big one like financial risk of the pharmaceutical drug companies if they found out that there's so many different things that marijuana could help whether it is people's appetite or certain arthritic conditions or you can go down the list kids with epilepsy it's a huge factor on children with autism especially edible marijuana all these different things all these different things that it treats if that was made legal and people started turning to that and exercise in a holistic approach it would cost the pharmaceutical companies literally billions of dollars a year so I think that's the big conspiracy I think it's a it's not really a paradigm consciousness sort of a thing as much as it's a financial thing I don't think that'll be totally related I don't think the people that are suppressing it or even aware of the attacks agree no I would just course no like master you know puppet string puller it's it's like this organism that's just moved only in one direction you know yes money Tori yeah the same reason why also involved in trying to keep these drugs illegal you have prison guard unions because they want to keep their money coming in you have police unions I mean there's a lot of that where you find lobbying by these unlikely groups you know like I don't understand what and then you go oh they just want to make more money like they're more than willing to lock people up they're more than willing to demonize helpful things that grow naturally now virtually no negative effects in terms of like your health things like marijuana totally I mean that's that's why I you know when I speak about this because I used to be really in like warrior mode on this huh how so like what do you mean by warrior because I just thought okay like I've you know once I woke up whatever was almost 10 years ago do you ever use hash tag woke I ever write that no no okay should i no no it's just it's a joke with the kids today hash tag woke or hash tag woke AF I'm old I'm old - okay F that's good world is fucked yeah thanks I got that I'm a quick Betty thing so when you came a where when I became aware I was pissed what was it was it a gradual process no no no I am I would I got like sick I guess I wasn't very dramatic but my big sob story is that I was diagnosed with my first health condition which is an autoimmune disorder after my first pregnancy Hashimoto's Oh have that oh really yes oh it's just like my dad and my brother do my mom has it all so we're just like not as common in men but probably because nobody's looking for it hmm um yeah so I was diagnosed with that and I just had this like intuitive sense that I wasn't going to go to a conventional doctor even though I had never ever you know done anything but dismiss alternative medicine like I was hardcore into the pharmaceutical model very into science from that perspective right and so I but I knew that all they had to offer was synthroid and I had enough patients that never felt well on it and so it's weird stuff I can't that stuff for a while and then I switched to armor thyroid yeah yeah and that's one reason why I got pissed at dr. drew when dr. drew was giving that that when he was talking about Hillary Clinton and all of her health issues and he was going over her prescription he was mocking the fact that she was on armor thyroid he was saying that that's old that's an old way of treating like he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about yeah he's absolutely wrong cuz I went through a bunch of different stuff and then when I took armor thyroid all of the symptoms went away gone and that's what the data shows that people feel subjectively better on t3 container yeah we'll explain what that is it comes from pig thyroid yeah yeah we suggested it's a glandular and he's not wrong because it is an old-fashioned medicine it's wrong that it's ineffective though he was talking about how outdated and that's right at all people feel better on it yeah so I took that for something similar called nature thyroid for a while but I went to a naturopath because which is so funny that I did that you know at that time that sounds like a hippie did you go to Wow I just was in a dirty place with like macrame and stuff I know it was a lot now it's really good burns to have any certain very friendly oh she's friendly yeah did you smell like patchouli or incense yes oh she did have something hmm that was good that's that's it felt right even though really troubling wrong at the time no I did and she I put an intermission in the space of like a year and my antibodies were like in the high 2000s my TSH was like 20 and what did you do to put in remission so the same things I do with my patients so I initially just changed my diet so initially I just very simply at her recommendation and I'm Italian I grab Italian my mom's from Italy and I ate cheese and bread of some variety like five times a day literally for my whole life right so the two things of course she asked me to take out were gluten and dairy damn it so it was a very amazing transition but I my early win was that I started like pooping everyday and hadn't ever done that in my whole life graduation thank you thank you these things that's big matter and so I was like wow she must be on to something and then later I layered in other stuff were you eating a lot of vegetables at the time no I think it was more about what I took out then at that point then like what I put in but when I saw the change on paper I was like this is not even supposed to be possible literally not even we're not even taught that this is possible let alone that it has anything you know that pudding autoimmune conditions into remission has anything to do with diet right and so I was really indignant and I've always been a science nut I've always spent Saturday you know like a good four hours every Saturday on PubMed of course I'm looking at different stuff over time but I went to PubMed and I was like what else didn't I learn and I was like on an obsessive rampage for like a good couple years and that's when I just turned over every stone like everything every sacred cow whether all these meds we were talking about like you know statins or acid blockers or antibiotics then I got onto psych meds and then I started to look at the science supporting a very different kind of perspective on you know this interconnected model and the gut microbiome and you know sort of the impact of belief on our you know biology that we can sort of like reprogram our Hardware you know and with our software which is like we're the only species that can really do that that we can literally change through meditation yeah exactly and that's the way your brain interacts with your body examine a change show that you literally change your body so what did you do to do that like what methods so I was very reluctant to meditate I was an atheist my whole like a belligerent you know sort of like Dawkins level atheist my whole life because I was a science worshipper and I was like well you know spirituality and religion is for like weak people who like need to believe in some fairy tale to make them feel better about typical New Yorker New York liberal comin atcha New York liberal scientist exactly well it's scientism it literally is the the Church of science and so you know when I had this crisis of faith so to speak like I I was lost for a long time because science had sort of you know or what I believed had sort of failed me in some ways and then I didn't have I don't know what the readiness to start meditating or find out what you know people were talking about when it came to spirituality although I followed the literature so like I read the literature on meditation and epigenetic expression for years and years and years and I used to tell my patients to do it but you can do it but I didn't do it huh what held you back because I liked feeling stressed out huh yeah wait so honest when you don't do something you're not doing it because you like actually being sick you like how you're feeling you're invested in it is it that you like or that you're addicted familiar in it it's comfortable yeah and the unknown for some of my patients the meditation piece is the last part because they know it's going to be the game changer and and they're not ready for everything to just be totally reconfigured they're not ready for that level of transformation now what they say - about sometimes people that are addicted to cigarettes that you're almost addicted to the idea that you're doing something bad to yourself you're addicted to that rush of not being naughty yeah oh oh so good totally oh so good it confirms yeah yeah I'm like so drop the hook - because you like fucking I'm alive who gives a shit this is all bullshit about the future fuck the future nihilist yeah total no right like so many fucking smart people smoke cigarettes and it's so confusing it's like you're making a deal to slowly pay to poison yourself you're like throwing a little bit of money in the pot every month guarantee you yeah guaranteeing that 20 years down the line 30 years down line however long it takes you're gonna have some some bolt is gonna come off the machinery and hey Mike you got a tumor in your lungs he's not good we're gonna have to cut one of these things out of your chest you can get by on one lung buddy this is what we got to do though I gotta you gotta start eating papayas like what nothing why I'm even alive you know we all do stuff like that I mean it's not always true but we recognize right yeah we do because we you know we're invested in reflecting a felt wrongness you know I would call it felt wrong like we feel deep inside something is wrong wrong with us wrong with society right something's missing and then we don't want to pretend that everything is okay so we self-medicate you know rather with you know drugs or cigarettes or you know workaholism or you know sex addiction or we're all sort of in this place not wanting to acknowledge that there's a reason you know like one of my favorite quotes is this like Krishnamurti quote that it's no measure of health to be well adapted to a profoundly sick Society right so right we're really low I Love New York it's the best I love the traffic I love the like oh you're a sick person man is wrong with you totally love it Hong Kong yeah that's a weird I one of my very very best friends is just a dick to to York yeah and it's not even loves it he's been there forever he's like an impulsive relation loves the city totally but he loves the energy he likes to all the cars in traffic I don't you know I don't know what it is but he's healthy like fairly like physically he's got a few issues but like mentally it's very healthy that's unusual yeah like just one thing sorted out it's a smart guy it's problematic he just loves the I don't know what it is Hong Kong you know that's the thing though like if you if you think about what the messaging is from the top down we were talking about right mm-hm like the messaging is keep it together punch the clock on Monday like you know sort it out right and you're supposed to be like fine be fine Yeah right but many of us don't feel fine not like range yeah huge range of not finest that's what I'm saying when I say like I felt wrongness and that's actually healthy you know to sense that and a lot of artists I would say are the Canaries in the coal mine so to speak like they're the ones who feel you know the the collective wound you know if you want to call it that more than we do they're sensitive in ways well I don't want to put you in my category mr. more of an artisan I am I'm not an artist so I sort of can think of yourself as an artist no no no no no it's interesting actually because most of my patients are real or they become after I get them off meds yeah whoa wait a minute yeah so they weren't artists you get them off meds and all sudden they start like composing music or something or making paintings or exactly they find some repressed expression something like that you know but if you also look at you know like I just read an article recently that tied in Chris Cornell I mean yeah that one hurts I know oh I know and bothered me I know and it's it's not an isolated I mean listen I don't know the details I don't know what happened but I I saw his wife foligno yeah let's just say what his wife believes I believe she believes he took too many of his antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications but wasn't there like some rumor about him having a relapse was there a rumor rumor that there was like cha track marks French track marks even find anything on that how the hell would anybody know that that seems like some shit that people just start making up and listen and I could be accused of doing the same thing even commenting but his wife who is married to him was the one that said that she believed like when she talked to him on the phone that he had taken too much of his anti-anxiety medication and it be one thing to just be like oh she's like a grieving widow if there wasn't like a very indicted body of evidence that unequivocally like literally two new studies just came out this week that unequivocally implicate benzodiazepines in homicide and suicide right so you are a very important finished study you know demonstrated that benzodiazepines are led to like a 223 percent increase risk of committing homicide Jesus Christ they along with antidepressants and actually other psychotropics including stimulants you know all of these medications have been linked to an increase in suicide as well so when I hear about a school shooting or I hear about the Germanwings you know played terminal wings that guy Lou big like who who took down the plane the Germanwings plane he just like suicided with a whole plane of people and crashed the plane like when I hear about these mass murderer like menace to society kind of situations my first thought is what segments were they on and you know my training basically conditioned me to say oh well they're mentally ill so obviously they're taking psych meds that's like saying umbrellas cause the rain right it's that's not how it works causation correlation exactly yeah but actually there's a massive suppressed body of literature that implicates these medications all of them and we know why we think right so we think that it has to do with the way you metabolize some people metabolize these medication so that you might be born with a genetic variant in your liver that makes it so that you by design metabolize medications differently than someone else right so you can enter into a state of what's called Auto intoxication more easily than someone else even sometimes in a couple of doses and you develop what's called akathisia induced impulsivity impulsivity which is like akathisia is like this feeling like you just want to crawl into your skin but you seem really chill oh wow really creepy like horror movie level so no one around you knows you're about to fucking boil over and explode I had I spoke in July in London I did this leg workshop and this guy contacted me named David Carmichael and he's like I'd love to meet you followed your work and I want to sort of tell you about my story I had known about this paper of which he was one of eleven ten or eleven subjects by these authors Lussier and Crotty was from 2011 older paper where they took all these people who had committed like heinous acts right like you know murdered their therapists or killed their child or themselves jumped in front of a train or whatever and they were prescribed antidepressants for totally run-of-the-mill stress right so like work stress or a dog dying not because they had like severe mental illness and were suicidal right these people were not suicidal they were not homicidal they were normal citizens and they went on to do this crazy thing and what they found was when they analyzed each of these you know victims perpetrators how everyone to look at it they found they all had these liver variants that I'm talking about so that they were basically poisoned by medication but before they were poisoned they were put into this altered state where they did impulsive lis violent things so this guy basically gets on this stage where I was speaking and he talks about how he was prescribed paxil because he worked I think as an accountant and he was prescribed it for work-related stress like it was just like taking on too much stress at work right and he remembers feeling like his mind like slip away like he began you entered this realm of like psychosis essentially and he started to you know develop all of these paranoid beliefs but he looked and people told him like oh you're getting better I'm so glad you're feeling better long story short he strangled his 11 year old son Oh dead and that's before after you met him after this was actually years ago and so he was not met him and he was telling you about all this and then after that he killed his kid no he killed his son before we met years ago okay but he wanted you know to share you know with the the audience of doctors I was speaking to like listen so they exonerated him based on this medication which is rare actually believe it or not because a lot of times these people are jailed so it's like you know punishing the punishing the victim so to speak but that's sort of the issue that it's an important issue right because your friend right okay so let's say some people this is in line with their consciousness to not have any curiosity about why they're having symptoms not want to see what they can do in terms of optimizing their lifestyle it's just like not their deal right so they want to take a medication and they want to suppress their symptoms and just like hope it works out that's fine I don't care what people do this should be a free country right you do what you want to do and practice the medicine that makes sense to you but this sort of like chink in the armor is perhaps this issue which is that we don't really have a good way of identifying you know it's Russian roulette we'd have a good way of identifying if you're going to be David Carmichael right so and it's you know it's one thing to kill yourself impulsively but like you know the school shootings for example have without an exception been committed by people who are kids who are recently medicated so see there are meds or coming off psych meds right it's all changes a hundred percent yes if not 100 is it is really crazy that that's denied and when you bring that up by the way people call you a gun rights apologist well you're you're distorting the issue you're turning it to a psych meds issue when it's a gun issue if these people don't have guns they can't commit these crimes like that to me is a very bizarre way of looking at like one we are the science which is why would they but it's it's what you were talking about before where psychiatrists aren't talking about this this is this is such a taboo subject that by the time it gets to the average educated and informed person who for the most part is probably liberal and you know you're we because we're talking about people that want to get rid of guns what that's what they're seeing is only the gun they're not seeing the mindset behind the ability to do something like that was very relevant context yeah this liver issue that you're talking about is this testable and it is actually so and nobody tests for it oh just like literally apart from functional medicine doctors perhaps but for the most part they're not going to be the ones starting patients on psychiatric meds most psych meds are started by primary care doctors after ten minutes and there's a scientific consensus that this issue exists that this with this liver issue that if you take these medications it can turn you into this or take you to the psychotic stage yes yes and you would be surprised how much scientific acknowledgement there is of some sort it's called akathisia induced impulsivity akathisia is the experience the symptom neurologic symptoms that's induced by the impaired it's thought to be impaired metabolism on the liver level of these medications so this is not like a theory it's not a theory it's right yeah but there's a lot of stuff like that like there's you know in the literature there's something called antidepressant tachyphylaxis which is the acknowledgment in the scientific literature that like a good 30 percent of the time they just stop having an effect like stop working yeah that's the thing that people that I know that have taken them have said the doctor will tell you hey this is gonna work for a little while and then it's not gonna work anymore just hope you don't like my friends one means well my friend who got on them and actually I have two friends that got a great benefit from getting on SSRIs they had a great benefit and they both eventually got off of them cool they got on them and then their life improved they improved the just the overall existence that they experienced like they improved their job they improved their just their state their status in life relationship stuff all these different things improved and then they slowly wean themselves off and now they don't need them anymore but both of my friends that were on them say that it was a great benefit of them to get on them so that's a rare story I would say it's a pretty rare story now you could argue that I have a skewed exposure to the population because I only see the people who've been on ten twenty years and want to desperately get off and can you know but I am again this public health issue aside which is that you know these medications could be inducing impulsive violence at random and like perhaps we should at least be talking about this as a society right right that issue aside I am you know a crusader for informed consent I believe that you just should know all the options and all of the available science and then you make your own damn decision right with your freewill you do what's right for you what matches your level of consciousness right because the problem is that most people are not taken off of meds and they are maintained for long term even though all of the long term science suggests that people do worse long term on all categories of psychiatric meds than if they were never medicated and this includes crying she's psychotics for schizophrenia all of them all of them and the person who exposed this and really you know sort of blew the whistle on this issue his book changed my life and made me put down my prescription pad is a robert whittaker who's an investigative journalist and he wrote a book called anatomy of an epidemic and I've read it you know when it came out and I was ready to read it because and receive it because I just had this health experience of my own right so I read it and basically what he says is okay so we have escalating rates of treatment right like more and more people you know 16% of the American population is on these meds right a lot of your friends my friends and with more treatment shouldn't we have less disability right like shouldn't people be more functional and less sick and what we find is that the reverse is true you know that we have more disability with more medicating so his book goes through all of these studies I never heard about one of them in my Ivy League training all of these studies that are not industry funded right because we know that the pharmaceutical industry is four times more likely to publish something when it's positive than when it's not and they can publish whatever they want and not publish whatever they don't want right so they are in charge of their own policing which is the fox guarding the henhouse kind of a situation so these were all non industry funded studies and the story they tell is quite different than what you might imagine and it's it's like almost shocking right that you have schizophrenia right obviously you need to take meds right right well but what if like doing something is not as good as doing nothing according to the published literature right so doing nothing is better according to the published literature than doing something then doing medication so taking medication for cite some sort of a psychotic disorder what what are the odds that it's going to work so when we're looking at the data that suggests that it's effective to take an antipsychotic there without exception short term studies so six to eight weeks but people are taking these medications for months to years and they lose their efficient see overtime were their effectiveness at sedating effects usually up for us not the same as SSRIs in terms of no no share the story is similar because if we look at out outcomes in the long term like like do you have a job you know do you have a friend network like are you a functional member of society if we look at those parameters in the long term people do worse and that's his argument you know is that that's why we have more and more of the population literally getting checks from the government because they cannot function in society even though they're medicated to the hilt you know like they're fully treated so to speak and he makes this argument for benzodiazepines for stimulants and if you look into the literature you understand that all that's happening is you're forcing an adaptation on the part of the body this is a chemical it is not fixing anything and just like alcohol okay like some people love alcohols for some people it's very relaxing right some people hate it and it's terrible and it makes them sick so just like any other chemical substance with unpredictably psychoactive effects it may be adaptive for a given period of time but we know through the alcohol analogy that there's no free lunch rate so even if it's adaptive in the short-term your body adapts habituates you become potentially dependent although that's a more complex conversation you know what drives that dependency but the long term is known to us like the long term picture of like chronic use of alcohol for let's say social anxiety doesn't look pretty if you want to just stop drinking 15 years down the line after you've been drinking every day right so but we've been told to think of psych meds differently and what I'm trying to say is we shouldn't be right because they are just chemicals having chemical effects that your body is adapting to so obviously that chemical effect is not going to endure bi8 like it's not going to last and then there's going to be a cost so one of the major pieces of informed consent I would like to see foregrounded for people is it may be nearly physically impossible for you to come off of this medication after several years of use are you cool with that right like are you really physically impossible and all you have to do is Google like antidepressant withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal right because we're keeping people on these meds long term because of course we're not fixing the root cause of the problem right it's like if you have glass in your foot we're not taking the glass out we're just like putting a bandaid on it giving you a Tylenol and being like okay get out of here you know so we're not fixing the problem so to speak so we're masking it and there's going to be you know sort of it's going to it's like a whack-a-mole like is this is going to keep manifesting in other ways so people are kept on these meds long term and then coming off them is I've come to the conclusion that they're more habit-forming than any chemicals on the planet crack oxycontin nothing they they do not hold a candle to how hard it can be to come off of segments Jesus all you need to do is ask someone so your friends are very rare examples because there are millions of people on the internet right now trying to help each other like survive the process of coming physically survive let alone you know psycho spiritually survive the process of coming off of meds so that's what I focus on you know in my day to day practice now no are there certain meds that are more difficult to come off than others I would say yes although I've seen exceptions to that too you know I would say that there are certain antidepressants that are notoriously challenging you know meds like paxil or effexor but then prozac which is supposed to be like have this long half-life and be easy to come off of you know I have patients who develop what looks like AIDS like they get so sick in such complicated ways that no one believes them and then they think that they're you know well you must have MS or you must have you know mono or you must have you know some new diagnosis and in the literature since 2014 has told us no this is a withdrawal is is a complicated protracted withdrawal that is worse than any other meds out there and so if you knew that you might be like alright well what are my other options do I have other options and you know since I put down my prescription I have many years now of experience of treating all men of bipolar disorder suicidality psychosis without medication and let me tell you like the outcomes that I get today I couldn't have fantasized about when I was prescribing I didn't even know that this is possible so if you know that these outcomes are possible then maybe you would consider a lifestyle approach but you have to know it's possible so that was a best-case scenario when you were prescribing and what did it ever feel like like what I mean did it ever get to the point where you were wondering like none of these people are really getting better they're they're improving in certain ways where they're not getting better I getting them totally better what was your goal management it's a management like sense so the idea is you have an issue this issues never going away let's just throw a wet blanket on the sucker yeah see if we could hold down the fire exactly and you know what I have a lot of compassion I've many my friends are conventional psychiatrists so I have compassion for people who are in the trenches practicing conventional approaches because I thought I was doing good you know when I was prescribing I thought I was doing good things for these these friends how do they feel about what you're doing now they sort of like tolerate me I don't know that's it well it's funny because because I have this I don't know what you want to call it like scientific advantage meaning like I know more of the literature I've read more of it I have Cecily devoted my life to this subject they know sort of not to fuck with me on some level like so I have respect but they also it's like my thing that I do over here right they look Kelly we have a business my business giving pills crazy people like my leave me alone yeah exactly I share an office one of my best friends you know you really rents from my office you know please it also does everywhere and I mean he's very he's more conscious about it than actually he works in forensics which means that he works to sort of identify where people in the legal system are being medicated necessarily or unnecessarily gone yeah there's all sorts of weird specializations within the guild of psychiatry it's like a many tentacled and so when you say management like did you ever take someone from being like a real mess and bring them off the ledge and then their life improved um yes that is that's the good summary of what I do today so I see the sickest people that no one can help because they've gotten to the end of the road so they've done electroconvulsive therapy they're on six medications they've been hospitalized even in state facilities they're you know at the end of their rope because they're not well and even conventional psychiatry has nothing left to offer them so I you know people think like oh I treat the worried well like some Upper East Side you know woman who's having an affair and she stressed out or whatever they called the worried well the worried well yeah but it's not you know it's not true like my patients are very sick and you know I have an online version of what I do in the office and the outcomes they're even quieter than the ones in my office so you can even do this totally on your own it's not like some voodoo I'm working on Madison Avenue in New York but like for example okay so one of my so I've started to video interview these people as social proof and like it's all on my website and you can see what they have to say about it because why would you believe me because it sounds crazy what I'm saying so what do you do them like say I come to you and I say hey I've got real problems press all Tommy problem super bummed out can't keep it together 99 problems so this I'll tell you what a woman Ally okay so she'll give a real name no she says she's on my website in a video yeah she said she is an intrepid woman she's incredible doesn't beloved um I've never said that about a person they're intrepid but she is I believe you that's the point I'm ultimately gonna make is that this process of moving through the fire of your mental illness which I I don't believe in mental illness but moving to the fire I don't what do you believe I believe that we are by design as humans you know that we feel things intensely and some people have experiences you know like in other cultural settings some of the early experiences is what we would lay schizophrenic you know there is an elder that is assigned to you to Shepherd you through your psycho spiritual emergence you know we just don't have a cultural context for anything other than full and total complacency full and total adaptation to this sick society right so regardless of environmental influences and whatever genetic problems you might have people can have something really wrong with their mind right I don't ever think it's really wrong when it gets really wrong is under the influence of psych meds always so there are very few exceptions if someone's experiencing psychotic breaks and they don't get put on psych medication did does it go away I mean that's what the long-term data I was describing for you it does it does so we have turned what might have been a single episode experience that when properly supported were totally completely resolves and you get back to life which is what used to happen even in the early 1900s you know when we documented the natural history so to speak of these illnesses we would see that they would go away on their own within a year you know eighty percent of the time so when they would come up out of nowhere they would go away out of nowhere as well right oh and we've turned that many people you're talking about offices sorry to interrupt you like what how big is the study like how many people or many many and this is where Whitaker is like you know my knight in shining armor Robert Whitaker because he's cataloged all of this data it's there's a robust amount of data and importantly it wasn't paid for by the industry so that's an important bias to control for right so if someone comes to you and they're psychotic so so that's I'm going to tell you about Ali right and her video is on my website this is all you know fully with her consent that I share it and she came to me end of her rope she came with her husband from Kansas to my office and she was actively you know in an episode what are her episodes okay her episodes are three days before her period four years she would develop psychotic symptoms become totally paranoid and delusional to the extent that at one point she was digging a hole in her face trying to get it like a thread she thought was in there she committed to commit suicide multiple times she had been on at least seven different psychiatric medications in and out of hospitals like a laundry list of diagnoses like this literally including bipolar disorder with psychotic features premenstrual dysphoric disorder you know all manner of dating back from like eating disorders in her earlier history she'd been through the wringer okay so she was like a professional psych patient and I was the last stop before an inpatient facility basically like institutionalization okay I told her this is how it's going to go so I have like a very heavy hand up front and I could be a hard-ass for sure but it's in service of passing the baton to these women because I don't have long-term patients like there's an intense window and then they they're done with me right once they're through the birth canal so to speak right so what I asked her to do is follow a very strict diet no cheating none like zero bullshit okay so what's the diet okay so the template for the diet that I recommend is based not only on like my personal experience but also on my work with my mentor dr. Nicholas Gonzales who was the most badass figure in modern medicine he passed suddenly in 2015 but he for 27 years treated terminal cancer you know metastatic like no hope cancer literally neurodegenerative illnesses Lyme disease you know diabetes all with a 100% holistic approach that was based on three pillars a personalized diet so like one of ten diets um coffee enemas oh do you know what that is heard of it you heard it alright cuz it's like in the zeitgeist like people are hearing about why coffee enemas why is taking coffee up your butt yeah I know it's it's only necessary because we live in like a pretty toxic world at this point but what happens is the caffeine okay so you're sticking this little tube like 12 inches actually I know and it seems totally crazy weird but you do it all yourself you don't go somewhere to do it it's not like that and you're hitting this like it's called a flexure your this point right here where your intestines come across and then down okay and right there is a nerve bundle that reflexes to your it's called a parasympathetic nerve bundle it reflexes to your liver and it basically helps your liver to dump toxicants like it's it's a it's like a super charging of your livers ability to detox you including coffee in there because the caffeine stimulates that nerve bundle it's basically like jacking up your liver because we don't know how to detox better than our own body does your liver is charged with that responsibility so if you can help your liver do it it's going to be best and and this is most relevant in cancer like radical cancer treatments because when you the tumors are breaking down you need to flush that waste or you'll die like literally it's called tumor lysis syndrome so you know some early pioneers discover that coffee enemas are critical like literally life-or-death critical for helping you flush those wastes so I learned about them from the master and since using them in my practice completely changed my practice so like a med taper that would take two to three years now takes me like six months with a given patient and Ali so Ali started doing coffee enemas twice a day so but the dietary template is is a little bit I wouldn't say it's like totally people think healthy rate and they think like vegan or they think vegetarian or they think you know tons of green juice or whatever and I noticed early on that as long as my patients say a fair amount of red meat they got better and I used to be like an ethical vegetarian when I was eating like cheese doodles and Pepsi basically and so it was very confusing to me that you know red meat could be a healthy part of anyone's lifestyle or you know anything I could ever wrap my mind around recommending but over the past 10 years and now with the understanding of Nick's metric you know where there are some people who do require red meat to balance their nervous system essentially you know is this actual requirement or is this is can this be mitigated through like a very smart and conscious vegetarian diet like if you're really careful about your nutrients and making sure you get the essential fatty acids making sure you get the essential amino acids and a really balanced profile of vegetable protein it's a great question ultimately my goal in this month is to clear the slate run all the stuff that's like yanking on your brain and your immune system and driving inflammation so that you can begin to sense what you need have you ever had anybody that attempted to do so like hemp protein or pea protein or vegetable based protein at this point I'm going for gold right so I'm interested in like massive transformation for people not just like oh I guess I feel a little better so I won't even see a new patient if they're not willing to at least try for the month to eat red meat really mm-hmm but is this all anecdotal so it's all just like what you've experienced for working with patients but if you ever experience a single patient that tried to do it correctly through vegetable protein no not try it I wouldn't because I you know I'm saying like but I do have this online program where there are people who get well on and they stick to a vegetarian diet so it's apparently possible well that's tearing at least she can get eggs you know right in his model there were no vegan diets and it's based on the work of Weston Price you know he is Weston Price for the name yeah he's like a dentist in the 1900s who like went around the world with his wife and studied all of these different people who like indigenous people all over like Eskimos like Himalayan you know folks Mexican folks and South American and studied the healthy indigenous populations that were not eating industrialized food right and what he found was they all ate different stuff so there isn't like a diet right right so how do you know what is your version right so like an Eskimo doesn't eat coconuts and like a Maasai warrior doesn't eat whale blubber so like how do you know what's your version the truth is only you know but like our signals are so distorted and suppressed so we can't figure it out right but you'll begin to like clear the like lower the white noise enough if you have this month-long experience of detox so I asked I asked for daily meditation three minutes I told you I'm a kundalini zealot so I asked for people to do to me not before the podcast yeah yeah and didn't hear me please okay yeah so so I I came to Kundalini Yoga basically out of sheer desperation at a very difficult time my life after my largely after my mentor died and they totally changed my like rewired my nervous system literally literally we're now nothing stresses me out but if you have someone I mean I'm I'm obviously not a vegan but if you have someone that comes to you that does not want to eat meat but wants to try this out and wants to try this out with I mean it's really just the science of nutrition I mean you can eat a vegan diet and be healthy if as long as you do it right can't you well so his model is that there are different kinds of people and different kinds of people and I can explain a little more require require for for their health certain dietary complements and what are called the parasympathetic dominance right which is more like the Eskimos require red meat to be healthy you will not only never be fully healthy but then you're at risk for developing the the illnesses that parasympathetic dominance develop like Leukemia Lymphoma hypothyroidism you know chemical sensitivity chronic fatigue depression right so many many many many many former vegetarians converted from vegetarianism because they felt depressed right so while that's true on the other side of the spectrum are the sympathetic dominance who don't need to eat red meat and who do really well on like a full force like plants grains you know even a high carb diet and they feel well and it's when they eat too much red meat particularly industrial red meat that they develop solid tumors like you know breast cancer or pancreatic cancer colon cancer as is a very common you know so essentially when you're dealing with particularly indigenous populations and people that have a very strong gene pool that comes from one very strong area in the world like Eskimos or like people that live in the Pacific Northwest or something like that not Pacific Northwest be known men like the Alaskan people like there's people that live on like nunya vac and all these different islands that have eaten seal for hundreds of hundreds of years and have very little access to vegetables right and meanwhile they're healthy super low instances of cancer so it's just because their bodies have adapted and evolved for those requirements with the environment right exactly that's exactly what your body like say if you came from Vietnam you would have a very different nutritional requirement than that person right and you will never be fully vital or healthy on the wrong version of the diet now it's all science or is this an anecdotal guesswork when it comes to nutrition based science there ain't none right there's just none because the idea of nutrition research is like taking one nutrient out of the context of the person out of the context of their life out of the context of their cultural you know surroundings that's how we truly treat it like a pharmaceutical we look at single nutrient out of you know a whole complement of information so we just don't I tried learning about nutrition that way and I drove myself crazy because I was like what the hell do I tell my patients eat I can't find any science to support this and that's why I looked for outcomes so Nick Gonzalez's outcomes are unprecedented in medical history literally like 34 year terminal pancreatic cancer survivor' do you know how long you have to live when you're diagnosed with pancreatic cancer yeah not really long months I know there's been a lot of a few years on it but he's actually taking meds and uh that's a very short yeah yeah I know it's amazing they still eat sugar this fucker crazy dude he's doing his playing gummi bears and shit um do you know Rob wolf - no Rob Lowe first yeah not personally I know his work Rob's a really interesting guy and one of the things that he does that's kind of fascinating is on his Instagram he and his wife will do these tests they'll they'll do carbohydrate absorption test and ketosis and they'll both eat the same things but he'll test her and then test him and the results vary widely yes like his his reaction is like he just jokes around about how poor his genetics are and how about how robust his wife's genetics are apparently like nothing can knock her out of ketosis she can eat like crazy amounts of food and then like a couple hours later she's like back on baseline that force his buyers all right like his body just goes off the tracks yeah he's because I got so his studies though and it's little tests although you know they're very small it's just him and his wife they're really fascinating to see how two people who are in the exact same household same environment you know one's male ones female but also just different genetic and backgrounds and how wildly they vary it's really so what do you do with that right like that's right how do you know who you are and of one medicine right so the truth is that you have an intuitive compass right especially with food you are gonna want to eat the diet that is going to make you well Oh candy an ice cream that's gross because its intuitive dude that's a people thing but the truth is if you actually like take this break and detox so to speak from all those addictive foods and you have this shift in your body you're not going to want it you know that's where you're wrong this tiramisu after you have like a nice dinner and you see that on the menu you like come on roll it out let's do this get that cream with oh my god go on the top of it tell me guys so good it's gross we said never liked it oh very happy like nine years ago and now those ladies touch it mmm what about chocolate ice cream is that okay yeah nothing doesn't do anything for you well you like some sort of an Android yeah no I'm eight years into this stuff so that's it starts to like decondition and then if you like really really feel like something like that then you're like what's up like what am I like you know what I mean I need some ice cream that's the fuck is up shit is good she ever had like an ice cream sundae whipped cream come on I grew up in New Jersey okay I was born winter Friendly's like on the regular and got the happy ending can't believe it was called that I know how do you Sunday I know and the fries and the grilled cheese I used to eat sounds good and through my training when I was at I trained at Bellevue in New York and at the gift store they used to know me so they'd have Twizzlers and dark chocolate Milky Way waiting for me every day every day so I was dealers like an addict you know by any definition and you can resolve that you know and then then you figure out like what actually you're meant to eat because nickel we said you you will eat the food that you're meant to eat you'll want it but you have to sort of get your brain out of the way so if you have you know all of these nutrition gurus in your head telling you like red meats going to kill you and give you a heart attack then you're going to not want it but if you can that's why I demand the openness as a criteria you know to to participate with me anyway in clinical setting because then like I can't tell you how many of my patients were former vegans and now they're totally thriving okay so let me finish telling you about Ally which I'm sorry okay so that's basically what she did right she was off all meds except for as as needed klonopin when she met me so she had already done what does klonopin do it's like ativan like the one we were talking about with Chris Cornell it's an anti-anxiety medicine like xanax or valium if you've heard of those yes it's one of the most challenging to get off of in the long term and that why wouldn't it be long term like that's the confusing part like why would you just voluntarily stop taking something that makes you feel chilled out when you're feeling anxious right but what if your anxiety is because you have unstable blood sugar and you're having this like fight-or-flight explosion every hour and a half if you're not resolving that then it's like putting a band-aid on a piece of glass in your foot it's like okay but why don't you just fix it and then you won't need it so you make them to eat a certain amount of red meat do you limit their portions to no there's no calorie counting there's no portion anything because you are initiating yourself into the process of determining what's best for you so the whole point of this month this like military month that I impose on people is that it's like an initiation to your own self so the stuff you're doing whether it's the meditation enemas detoxing your products and stuff like that basic you know functional medicine stuff or the diet is all in your control which is why you can do this without me which has been the best like evidence I've ever you know I never even dreamed that was totally possible and now I'm super pumped about it because the last thing I wanted to be is like about you know the Kelly Brogan effect or something like this right at all what I'm interested in so yeah so you do all this years out do you make them eat though besides red meat okay so basically food okay so you're eating food animal fun right person literally never listen it's because tell me this isn't food so it's animal food including you know any kinds of meat fish eggs whole eggs not just the white any kind of vegetables except for white potatoes I'll explain why any kinds of fruit nuts and seed seeds natural salt as much as you want tons of filtered water that's important and then natural fats so like ghee which is like a clarified butter coconut oil olive oil that kind of thing that's food by the way what you're taking out is a little more challenging for some people so you're taking out all this is just for the month it gets so much easier in the future but you're taking out all grains all beans all dairy and then so the ice cream is going and then all refined sugar so like honey and maple syrup are fine and then coffee and alcohol hmm but listen if you were really desperate yes you might think about this oh yeah sure and it can be challenging for the first like week and then you start to see the dividends and you want to just have one month in your adult life where you just see what's up when you control for these variables it's worth it because then you know what the sort of relationships are between you your personal you know biology and these you know elements of your nutrition so what's the general reaction when you get someone to get rid of processed sugars cut out the grains cut out the nonsense Darry and just eat regular healthy food what's the what's a normal reaction that sometimes you feel worse real depending on how much the stuff you were eating you can literally go through like a mini withdrawal like headache fluish symptoms fatigue irritability and called it like the keto flu people get off of Caria paleo arms exactly so that can be real from the coffee to obviously anyone who's ever tried to work you know but it's like a couple days then you move through it and then one normally starts to happen is you start to like sort of feel the clearing right so your energy is better your sleep is better one of the most interesting things is how many people tell me that they sleep better when they eat more red meat like you would never make that connection right sounds crazy I didn't mention this I hope it goes without saying that there's massive like militant focus on organic and sourcing like I would tell people never to touch an animal food if they don't know you know that it was consciously raised okay so that's a caveat important caveat so so sleep gets better a lot of the like ravenous hunger like I have patients who can't even go as long as we've been talking without like having a snack or they get hangry right like the other yeah irritable lightheaded you know sort of racing hearts on Horeb addicts yeah pretty much but like who is it you know when you're just eating convenience food like that's a natural response and then sometimes it's much more radical so like in in Ali's case within two cycles she was completely symptom free so she went from grossly psychotic and suicidal to not only totally symptom free but now she's like moved through is moving through I would say a process of awakening like it's a spiritual shift right because it's like you know Gibran says like the the wound is where the light enters and and we don't have that consciousness as a society because we think that what that brings I mean the wound is where the light end it means that grief pain suffering is where you grow like it's where the real experience of being human and where the real contact with who you are right so this is true even for something like ayahuasca like why would anyone ever do something like that right but the point is through that experience of humbling surrender you meet yourself right but we don't have a consciousness for that in America in fact crying like literally tears is a symptom in the DSM so it's literally a pathological symptom to cry that is the most basic evidence of our humanity is that we cry and and if we are living in a culture that says you're sick when you're crying stop doing that you know take this so that you can stop feeling we have a bigger problem on our hands right so I know I can't just sit in my Madison Avenue office taking people off of meds and think like oh you know I'm changing the world that this is a systemic cultural issue that we make no room for things to fall apart we make no room do you know that with the dsm-5 so like the latest DSM they took out something called the bereavement clause from the depression diagnostic category and that means that if you meet criteria for depression which is what you would imagine you know wealth changes in sleep changes in appetite low mood poor concentration hopelessness if you meet that criteria it for two weeks it doesn't matter if your kid just died or your wife or like your dad so that's bereavement right it doesn't matter you're still a candidate for treatment or if you have fired or if you experienced natural disaster or if you lost your house in a fire right doesn't matter right so some people saw that as like wow really a last straw of pathologizing normal human experience so there's not one of the issues with these disassociative sort of chemicals that people get put on because that's like one of the ways to describe a lot of people's reaction to SSRIs and antidepressants is a disassociative yes like they have a very they can anything can happen in they're okay with it it's fine no worries no big deal so they don't get these highs and lows and so because they don't get the lows they don't get to read back and get the highs and then also find themselves understand themselves so they can manage how low the lows get except through the mind and through your just living in the moment and understanding exactly understanding that this is just a natural process of life and you've been through it before so instead of taking a pill just suck it up 100% I mean we don't write like in in tribal cultures like men are initiated right like I've got a video show you right like really tooth yanked out or you gotta like survive while African circumcision video if you really want your crap my gosh yeah one well you know so we think of ourselves as being lucky like they were lucky what else do that sure I'm not taking responsibility for what's in this video okay in any way related to what I'm talking about no it's definitely not sure you wouldn't approve but it's true like we we were just like we just baby our way through life because no one is teaching us how to to confront our deepest fears you like explore the shadow realms and integrate it into our own power right we have no understanding of that we make fun of that we think it's like woo weirdness that like other cultures can you know do in their little tropical islands but what I have found is that taking people off of psych meds somehow is seeming to serve as like an initiation process for like thousands today so interesting right like that you took it because you thought it was a good idea and it's so challenging to come off it and forces you to confront a lot of elements of your consciousness live differently it forces you to work with your body differently it forces you to begin to look at why you went on them in the first place and then there's a whole nother layer of just it's being really physically disabling in some cases to come off these meds and it really brings you to your knees sometimes and so a lot of what I think of myself is doing is just like holding space for that process to happen and then once it happens they move through into this like awakened state I mean the vast majority of might be and you know online course completers go on to become healers why else would that happen if they weren't making people crazy that's why they're turning to healers but you surely must experience a massive blow back from just conventional psychiatric medicine practitioners who are looking at what you're saying and saying so you're telling someone all they have to do is just stop eating sugar they won't be psychotic anymore that's fucking crazy I'm not saying I never know I know you're not saying that but I'm boiling down to that you're saying you took this woman and you took her off of processed foods you made her eat healthy vegetables in meat and eggs and detox and meditation coconut oil and avocado oil and detox and medication and all the inflammation went away the problem of the the insulin spikes and all the blood sugar spikes that goes away and then the body somehow or another comes back to some sort of a baseline that's right and you know in the New England Journal of Medicine recently there was a case report right 37 year-old woman who was so psychotic that her family took out a restraining order on her okay paranoid delusional totally psychotic she was treated with risperdal and Zoloft and antipsychotic and an antidepressant which did nothing a year of this nonsense later she was finally diagnosed with gluten sensitivity because a wheat sensitivity right they put her on a three this is in the hospital this is not like in some quacks office you know in in Boulder they how dare you go after Boulder like that it's one spot oh that is a spot in Sedona that's another one I'm going to actually Nexus I can't wait to check it out totally so so in three months on this strict gluten-free diet she was totally normal again Wow so this is not like a wellness fad it there are real route drivers but we don't know what it is for you right like I said it could be physiologic where it's like you know there's a similar story about a lifelong vegetarian woman this is in the published literature who became psychotically depressed was admitted for catatonia catatonia is like the worst diagnosis in psychiatry right she's basically unresponsive she was so mentally ill okay they treated her with electroshock therapy because the antipsychotics ended you depressants say they use didn't work finally she gets transferred to an outside hospital because they were like well we don't know what to do with this woman they check her b12 level and it's like you know tanked they give her a couple of b12 injections and not only is she better but she's better than she's been in like 14 years from a couple of b12 so my point is that for her it was b12 for her it was wheat for someone else it could be blood sugar instability for someone else by royde autoimmune thyroid can make you crazy can make you suicidal according to the literature it's not a theory have you ever had anybody that you put on this diet and they didn't respond and they stayed psychotic or whatever there she was here's why not a long time because I screen for readiness right so I screen for a mindset and that's we're talking about earlier because if you're ready and you believe that you're like a whole radical next chapter of your life is like forthcoming then I'm just part of the ritual you know and it's like using the placebo effect even I don't know I mean I'm very it's not really a Sebo right but it is a belief the if you don't believe that this is going to do anything for you and you're a skeptic it won't right it won't and I can show you all the science in the world and it won't work for you but the physiological changes of adjusting your diet those are real right so like why won't it but your beliefs can even override that whoa I think that's really possible okay so I'll tell you about another study so these are people like your friends and millions of others who think they were treated to remission think medication really helped them right right with Prozac okay so they're like well on Prozac okay so they're put in this study 12-week study and they get to either stay with their same dose of Prozac that helped them or they get crossed over to the placebo arm the sugar pill arm and they don't know which is going to happen right so what happened is that study is at the time they were crossed over or not they both both groups became statistically significantly depressed right so like Mary takes her 40 milligrams on Tuesday enters the study is still taking her 40 milligrams like next Thursday but now all the sudden she's acutely depressed just because of the possibility that she might have gotten the sugar pill that's called the nocebo effect so the nocebo effect is the impact of fear or negative beliefs that limit your ability to respond to a given intervention it's real it's more important than anything we're actually doing is what you believe so if somebody convinces you the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts could fix you that there literally might be some truth to that there could be and and I would I wouldn't wait on some level like psych meds with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts so there are some people who are going to say like wow that really helped me so so this guy Irving Kirsch right he's a psychologist who's like a placebo effect expert arguably what what he identified was that when you control for what's called the active placebo effect which is what happens when you feel the side effects you've been warned about of a given medication and then you feel the medication is working and then it actually works right so when you control for the active placebo effect by giving people in a trial antidepressant but then also a medication like atropine for example that has very similar side effects dry mouth you know headache constipation this kind of thing there's no difference so what he showed is that there is no statistically significant effect of antidepressants above and beyond placebo and that the reason that people believe that they're working and they are right so they believe it and then they do is because they feel a shift they feel a change and they've been educated by commercials and their doctor maybe about these side effects and then they start to say oh my chemical imbalance is being you know adjusted adjusted right so it's a it's subtle but this is not in just in psychiatry is really relevant to the gayatri but it's true in surgery you know they do sham operations and orthopedics and it's true in even you know the pain management you know that the placebo effect is so real and it's not like you're being fooled like you know like in in my training I was taught to dismiss the placebo effect like some nuisance we have to control for but it's if we could bruce lipton said this like if we could harness this we would have a side-effect free medicine for everyone you know but we don't study it we don't understand it and we just assume it's like people being tricked or something aren't the placebo effects fairly limited like nothing really truly miraculous it's true it's about 30% but that's exactly the efficacy of antidepressants this is around 30% so there was a study once um that was done on some a kid who had some horrible wart disease where it was incurable and it was like spreading all over their body and all over their arm do you know the study I don't and they gave this kid some sort of a placebo and it completely cleared it up and that's amazing I should know that yeah and then when they found out that it was possible then it became a problem I think it came back quickly yeah yeah yeah I think that there's something going on with the mind and the body right and that's what the placebo effect is demonstrating right but this is unharmed and this is untrained and this is very different than what's going on with the mind with meditation which is harnessed and trained and focused so your thought is that this mind factor is not just an inconvenience it's not just a variable but maybe one of the most crucial aspects to overall health that if not the most crucial yeah and again conventional medicine is interested in this to some extent now noticing that what people believe like that you'll lose less blood and surgery if you visualize losing less blood and surgery that that actually happens how can you control the physiologic activity of your body but you can that's I'm saying like we have to prove that it's a it's a study on how they convince them that they're going to lose less broad they met it they visualize it they meditate on it visualize losing less blood so they have one group that says you're going to do a visualization where you just like visualize your body letting go of less blood after the surgery or during the surgery and then the other group just does their thing if you have one group you say dude you're gonna spray like a fountain you look a broken fire hydrant you're gonna just be gushing over the table you're gonna be a sprinkler you're right you should conduct this study that would be fascinating to see if the nocebo effect would have it probably would they probably would you out imagine there's probably a way you could mind fuck someone into some memorable state right that so you know where we see this is in cancer diagnosis it's called Medical hexing that you know when you are diagnosed with cancer your risk your you know the completion of suicide but also other accidents and your health basically declines simply because of the diagnosis and that's why it's considered to be it's like bone pointing or something so it's voodoo it's what we've always known that like someone could put a hex on you and if you know that a hex is on you you know like god damn there's a goddamn hex on me that's and you start believing it's a and then it could really cause a huge issue i that's what i has become clear to me is real and we don't want to think about it that way because we think medicine is science and it's you know this you know sort of impenetrable you know the hallowed halls of truth but it's religion just like anything else in fact Nick Gonzales my mentor said it's the last really unrecognized religion on the planet is medicine and you know we have special language and we were costumes and there's an issue Tory rights we're talking about the hazing process but it's real in a lot of aspects like the medicine involved in treating a bacterial infection antibiotics that meta medicine involved in healing a broken arm you know there's just real stuff there antibiotics is a whole other conversation for sure emergency medicine listen if you know I get hit by a bus don't like bring me to my don't know yeah well you know my naturopath banners gonna look like I don't know exactly it's good I'm fine don't start changing my body for emergencies that so what conventional medicine is really designed for we only ran into trouble when we started extrapolating from acute setting medicine into the outpatient world well also the denial of the aspects of nutrition like the denial the influence of nutrition like this this idea of the only concentrating on the medicine and not concentrating on what we know to be viable alternatives and things that can make your body healthier like not taking that into account seems it seems almost insane it seems like you're gonna fix the car like I hear a banging I'm just gonna inflate these fucking tires and you know like what about the engine there's a banging in the engine should I fix the engine like no no no no no I just turn off the alarm like let's just turn the AC on like it's almost like there's there's but it's not certain aspects they're looking at the aspects of medication and because of all the aforementioned variables like student loans the consensus of your peers hey everybody's in this sort of group together it's all this unspoken word that you're not going to criticize the establishment and you can't really do that because if you do you're out of a job and all your money that you spent on god yeah I mean it's it's important to remember that the pharmaceutical industry is a business right when you when you forget that and you think that they're in it to protect your well-being I see painful if you forget that which is easy to do right you know especially because they work with doctors and we think of doctors as priests so if you forget that then you can get into trouble because you take their word for something you perhaps should be doing a broader investigation on but if you remember that it's a business and it's very lucrative successful business I mean it's the business model of all time then you'll look with some circumspection upon their claims and their approach you know but our education as doctors is is totally through the lens of pharmaceutical model you know regulatory agencies famously like the FDA CDC and industry it's a revolving door literally you know and this is totally available information on the internet that they're all the same people so we really do have the fox guarding the hen house and that's where we get into trouble if we don't have transparency around a true regulatory body that is not you know fiscally invested we're going to have a problem especially for presenting this as the only legitimate course of action for a sick patient you know where you can actually as a parent have your children taken away from you if you don't participate in the model have there ever been any serious suggestions that we remove this whole ask your doctor commercial aspect of Medicine I could just see so much it seems so crazy that we know how influential commercials are right I mean they're so influential and these are not just fact-based commercials they've got cheery music go on there's sunshine and butterflies and shit and it just makes you feel like super happily I want to be like these people they're smiling all the time totally and it's conditioning crazy that that they can do that for drugs but you could argue right that you're just empowering patients with knowledge to help themselves right like that's why we're we're allowing the commercials yeah cause the doctor fit vilifies and you keep you from jumping off a bridge or make you ask a doctor oh my god yeah so you said abilify was at one point in time the most prescribed everything it was the number one prescription I think it was a two years ago centroids always up there but yeah it was and it's it's because it's if they're those trends I guess these stylistic trends and prescribing that of course have no evidence-based but in psychiatry were really vulnerable to that because there isn't a clear you know a to be in terms of presenting symptoms and medication recommendation it's sort of a free for all you know you can pile on as many or as few as you want and there are algorithms but they're very loose what you're trying to say Scientology is right who said that it's kind of what you're trying to say Ryan I mean aren't they like super anti Scientology remember when Tom Cruise was on what's-his-face what's that dude's name the dude's name The Good Morning America guy he on open sale our Matt Lauer yeah Matt Lauer that's your glib Matt yeah he's been on out but an Oprah who's one he was in love Japan couch and he was in love like no straight man who's lived on the face of planet yeah he's in love I'm in love now I'm divorced but back then I was into it but no when when he was saying that on the Good Morning America show with Matt Lauer he was essentially just saying what Scientology's always had like if you go down sunset or Hollywood where was a psychiatry kill center oh right you know I think some sunset there's some part of Hollywood we assemble just outside people with like electroshock helmets on like ah and like it's like psychiatry kills like what is this it's a fucking Scientology Center now if you go in there they're like you don't need Scientology you need to hold on to these cans that are attached to the e meter we got to find out what's tickin you know and then they start manipulating your beliefs and that in turn helps you feel better so there is some sort of a correlation between the mind you know getting on I mean you know in a way like they're almost like not totally misguided in their efforts right yes and I would say an important difference in my perspective perhaps and theirs is that I believe in like individual empowerment also not asking for 10% of all their income you don't require two and a half hours of study every night yeah no it's awfully more difference isn't it but but no I mean it's you know if you're subsuming someone into a I want to say like cult culture how about a culture oh that's cool I'm just you pause before I say to chair cult chair then you're just transferring dependence you know from one model to the next and you know sort of my bag is to really people back there your power through a methodology that's you know their own alone I think that highlights why that stuff works for people and why a lot of different things work for people a lot of different kinds of religions and unfortunately a lot of different cults and a lot of different ideologies and a lot of different mindsets do work for people even fucking CrossFit there was a great article that I've read about equating CrossFit to the fact that people do not have these religious groups they don't have these social bonding community because they're not going to church anymore so now they're going to this gym and like a lot of them literally call the Jim Church totally yeah have you heard of the rat Park studies rat Park yeah rat like the rodent what which studies on what so the there are these Canadian studies that basically looked at the addictive model of cocaine right so like you put we know right if you put a rat in a cage by itself and you give it the choice of water or a cook or cocaine right it's gonna drink the cocaine until it dies yeah I'm aware of this but then these yeah so then these researchers were basically like well hold on a minute that's like totally a natural environment for right to be in so if we what if we like put it in rat heaven where I can like have sex with the rats and hang out and have like a community and there's things to play with and little wheels and whatever then what happens and if you give them cocaine or water they don't touch the cocaine and you can even a dick them in isolation and they will voluntarily detox in red heaven reddening yeah so what does that mean right it means that we fundamentally need community like we need each other like it or not and we don't have that as a part of the fabric we live in boxes we don't know our neighbors like we don't have communities anymore right and so any time we have the opportunity whether through AAA or CrossFit to plug into a community we fix something inside ourselves so we have less of a vulnerability to abuse the effects of a substance like cocaine ur right done the rat Park study is so important because so many people will cite that as evidence that cocaine is so incredibly addictive well then when they find out about this because this is a different variation on that study and they old okay I'm gonna wrap context yeah the context matters me you're kind of in a rat Park every day if you're in a cubicle environment right your car in traffic or you're on the bus no one's talking to anybody you're you're in your little cubicle by yourself you know with and then there's shared suffering that's coming from things like CrossFit we have these hanging these moments you're bonding together almost like you guys are you know you're in the trenches right yeah yeah they're celebrating together there's something to yoga class like that people get all satnaam namaste on you things like that there's a lot of struggle it's that it's hard it's hard super hard yeah yeah Yoga is really hard and that's part of what's good about it is that we need I think we need hard things I think your body if you're just constantly nerfed and everything's soft and everything is a free ride and there's no ups or downs and everything's middle like what is that that's not a human it's not like a hundred percent it's not your time for so like when you're having a difficult window in your life you know and maybe you know why like you had a loss maybe you don't know why and things are just off yeah right like either you have a consciousness that says there's something here you know there's something to this or some meaning to this I got to look deeper I got to pay attention to things I got a rebalance and different I gotta up my game you know self-care or you're like this sucks I don't want to feel this way and there are thousands of prescribers like happy to open their door to you yeah and that is really the problem right the real problem is that there's so many different options other than what's going to make you healthy and there's so many different ways to just numb this whole experience just numb it all down like let's put some ice on it baby you're going to be fine let's numb this whole thing down I I have been of the opinion especially over the last few years I've really focused on this heavily I've talked about it maybe too much but I think people need to struggle in order to appreciate how nice things are and also to mitigate the effects of actual bad things that happen to you if you can do difficult hard things on a daily basis on a regular basis you know whatever your schedule allows for but whether it's martial arts or whether it's yoga or whether difficult struggle physical struggles we have to test yourself we have to pull through you have to have discipline and resolve and it's hard to do when you get through that you you develop that muscle and that understanding of struggle and believe it or not this is where it's going to seem really weird the struggle that you get in a yoga class is so much harder than the struggle that you'll ever experience outside of that right we have any sense like no you're going to work out like this is just like no this not spin class man this is something like very intense not that spin class hey I was going to say I'm all about something um spin classes are too I mean it's a bad example what I should say is it's not like going to the gym and doing like a simple round of calisthenics right pushing you into your discomfort real serious discomfort what you want to quit you want to stop and you have to push through and that intense focus on difficult things it makes life more bearable total makes more enjoyable my awakening so to speak began when I gave birth for the first time well right yeah and I had a natural birth and doing a bath tub you're crazy so the second time I did a birthing center the first time the second time I had a home birth why'd you do that though what if I was anything wrong I need to get to the hospital um it's interesting because my first birth I was still in the matrix right so like I was still eating McDonald's and you know prescribing you like that kid less than the second cake like you have the matrix baby it's totally the meanwhile she's like a sage she had to compensate for all my dark energy so I actually had a natural birth because of the science because I was like in this real like know-it-all place in my life art believe it or not I've tried to move past that but I had this OB at the time and I was like she doesn't know what she's talking about well and I researched like what is the evidence show OB is actually like psychiatry only about 30 percent of obstetric all practices are evidence-based and the rest is consensus like the rest is just they're just doing it because they're doing it like what if that like the cords wrapped around the baby or anything what if nothing we've been doing this since the beginning of time any babies have died since the beginning of time because of these things so we actually have the home birth versus hospital birth data which it should be totally unnecessary right right but we actually have it at this point to demonstrate that that's like patent is fear mongering it's like patently but people do get choked by unbiblical cords right yes so we're doing anything is possible of course so when that's going down but the truth is that when you in a hospital when you research the intervention you will find so I had a natural birth because the research that I did on the interventions things like fetal monitoring episiotomy even ultrasound let alone c-section you know antibiotics during delivery etc what I found was that there wasn't science to support them and actually the science suggest that they should be abandoned so what I was left with was that what is the science suggest should be abandoned these interventions c-sections yeah oh I want the consensus even the w-h-o which is part of the machine but even even the w-h-o says they should be less than ten percent I mean they're over in New York there are upwards of almost almost 40% of Brits are Swaggart why are women doing that are they doing that to save the vaginas they're doing it because they don't want to feel bad feelings and they don't feel patient it's exactly what we're talking about I've heard women like specifically say they don't want to get stretched out I don't think that's a big yes certainly but I don't think that's a huge motivator I think people are really men have been made to feel afraid of their own bodies it's the birth control thing we were talking about earlier if you think of your body as a total pain you know that's dangerous it's going to fuck up at any given time and you're going to you know wish you would listen to your you know doctor who's a man and never had a baby then you could obviously be led down this path that says let me manage your body I know better science knows better how to do this your body it messes up all the time right so that's the mentality and in that mentality my opinion is that you're robbed of this opportunity like psychedelic level opportunity to have a transformation of your consciousness because it is hard and it is scary and it breaks your mind my mind broke on that day broke and it's also never been recovered because it was literally so intense that my mind was telling me you're going to die you're gonna die you're gonna die you're gonna pain it's like pain but it's more more than that it's not pain that you've ever you would have recognized because it's it's purposeful pain it's not just a signal of something wrong right so it's it's a sensation that is a part of the process of moving a human being through and out of your body so it's not we call it pain but you know midwives don't call it pain for example it's not pleasure either it's just another thing it's another thing so but why they screaming something it's pain because when you're in that intense portal you moan you have there are these primal sounds we make you know when we're making love or when we're experiencing you know fear when we're we're really in it you know we make those kinds of sounds and and you and there is a lot of fear but ultimately if you don't succumb to it you it breaks and you see oh that was trying to tell me I couldn't do this and look I just did it do you ever think that if you could meet your old self that your old self be like listen to this crazy bitch 100% I wouldn't even have hung out with me I like Olay I wouldn't even have like talked to me at our Kundalini placebos huh what do you want me to do eat eggs the fuck out of here this girl's crazy get her on building you need pills no you need pills you're delusional I'm talking about healers and holistic medicine it would have been the eye roll of all time total that's hilarious how do you uh how do you you know reconcile yeah because I feel myself like I feel 100% myself and so is it there's zero self conscious aspect of it where you do recognize that there are certain science-based practitioners that will be like rolling their eyes at you oh I don't care you don't know no care about that and it was interesting right so I published this book last year in March what's called again a mind of your own and I published it it was really weird experience because I you know I was total newbie I never written a book before or whatever and out the gate I got like this very generous advance from a mainstream publisher which shocked me and then it comes time to publish it and they can't get me on a single you know the Today Show dr. oz 60 minutes and they're used to waltzing their authors who they give these large advances to like write on to these platforms right mainstream media platforms them is not going to work with me like you haven't worked with someone like me before trust me it's not going to work out these are all pharma funded outlets even NPR PBS they all are so you know we're going to have to come up with something else and ultimately they didn't listen and they started to spaz when I a month before launch didn't have a single interview they never had that happen before and so it was cool because alt media you know like this I just called on a bunch of my friends and colleagues and we it was like top 20 on Amazon within the first week and that's like the power like mainstream media is totally dead I'd have to tell you that but it's weird it was so quiet for like the whole year afterward if you google my book there is not a negative review of this like very controversial text on the internet very weird because we have trolls on our site every single day on Facebook for example or you know Twitter even Instagram it's like part of the deal of being an activist is that you deal with astroturfing and you deal with that whole you know sort of astroturfing oh yeah you should there is um an amazing TED talk that you need to watch by sharyl Attkisson who's like a turncoat journalist right like she used to be an anchor I don't know where and so she has this TED talk on astroturf and she basically breaks it down as for turfing is like what's our the word right it's consider it's like a fake grassroots movement on social media right so it's paid industry paid bots basically who generate the impression that there is an opinion and tie anyone who threatens the establishment right and then they there are people who like organically glom on to that so they create this this okay so they'll come on my site by the thousands right and immediately after a comment is written like you quack like where did you get that fake medical degree like you're killing people you should be ashamed of yourself you're going yeah exactly and they almost always call me at water account that's like almost always part of it that's how you know and there will be like 500 likes within 10 minutes that's like one of the vacations that it's a troll you know what I mean so like the be a face model you know that that's the troll and not just people resonating with this idea that they hate quacks because I don't have that many people on my Facebook page that that would ever be a metric you know it's it's not even like probably algorithmically possible that it would be an organic phenomenon did you see that thing recently Jamie brought it up yesterday about Donald Trump it turns out that he just had millions of BOTS follow him on Twitter I don't know where this is like something like 4 million BOTS yeah just joined on it and everyone's like okay what's going on here what happened here what is this these are fake accounts yeah it's like a thing that's you know it's not surprising that the no that's right people figured out they can manipulate this in half a president Trump's Twitter followers are BOTS right holy shit this is so crazy so you generate the impression that there's a grassroots energy and that's it's actually not real he picked up three million Twitter followers in recent days most of which appeared to be recently created Twitter bot screenwriter John Niven pointed out Tuesday morning that trumps account saw a big spike in followers over the weekend most of them newly created accounts without photos are tweets tell Sarah tons signs of Twitter bots wow thats easy so that is something that they're doing they're making an active campaign sort of Bost up his public appeal is right and in that case you know i don't know specifically but in that case it would be to generate the impression that it's grassroots right when it's not that's why it's called astroturf a god it's figure it's got it but yeah so I have all that energy in my daily life but I didn't have a single negative review of this book and lucky you're left weird says it's false why this hits mostly false since President Trump like other Twitter users with large following has a large number of followers that appear to be BOTS or inauthentic automated user profiles what's false Trump did not receive an influx of 5 million new Twitter followers in 3 days oh so stops questioning yes so what how much how many did I thought they said 3 million as of May first it had 28.5 so it couldn't have gone up that fast over the month because it's Elena one and a half million gain I don't know that's not even abnormal for someone with that many millions he is 28 million I could only I don't know the story just got weirder so yeah hmm according to the image archived images Twitter page rumors of a surgeon flowers were great really exaggerated Wow that's that week that's the that's fake news I mean it's what he's talking about could've jumped on the fake story day yeah but I'm sure there's a ton of bots following him I know there's a ton of bots following me yeah I get them all the time these women that are fake women that want to talk about sex like um come chat with me about sex come sex me up and they're like it's all like the worst broken English like it's cuz you tried to have a conversation with them and I worked out who explained it to it yeah I tried DM them they don't ignore me who try to explain that to us that they use intentionally was it malice was it Michael mouths that they used intentionally shitty language so that if you follow them like their poor grammar yeah sort of like alerts them to suspicious people so that suspicious people don't interact with them but dumb people so they are there a honeypot that creates this environment that stupid people are attracted to because they can't see the grammatical errors because they're dumb and so it makes it more effective so these Nigerian scammers apparently purposely use bad grammar like they're more than capable of using good English but they use this shitty grammar so the people that they do get are just really dumb they're not trying to snag like let's trust you who the Ivy Leaguers yeah well anybody who's got a discerning eye yeah think you know what this may or may not be they're not trying to get that they're trying to get the gullible and there's plenty of them like why go fishing for sharks we can catch gummy you know and get nets full of Guppies they can't chew their way through the net this is easy pickings dunk people don't go trying to catch a whale dude that's too much work you know it's really interesting though it's I mean if that is how sophisticated they truly are it's kind of fascinating but once you know this stuff then you can interpret yeah you know it just helps to be aware of it it would be a big big deal if we found out that pharmaceutical companies were actively engaging in the use of these BOTS to attack people like you like if you had someone like WikiLeaks on your side that like dug into the shit and you know it's got some whistleblower from the pharmaceutical industry that cares and release that stuff that would be pretty giant where I have some colleagues working on really yeah yeah don't tell people now they're gonna not innovate over their tracks they'll never know no I mean the truth is that I don't think it's going to require that because I think people are waking up just like by sheer zeitgeist energy like people are waking up they are calling bullshit on a lot of the heavy-handed claims of the pharmaceutical industry they know the doctors aren't helping them you know they know that the conventional model has very limited ability to help them and or they've tried it and it's not worked so people are waking up and that's why in more recent time I focus my energy not on like fighting this dislike some David and Goliath you know situation but I I'm just focusing on making sure people know like what's possible it's like you know a fuller quote like you don't fight the existing system you know you you create one that makes the existing system obsolete basically I don't know who made this quote but it's a wonderful one in this regard that before diagnosing yourself a depression first make sure you're not surrounded by asshole it's who's quoted context it's a great quote oh yeah this is a great quote it is you know and also you might have a shitty life you know you might be bummed out because you're working all the time at a job that's uninspiring you might be bummed out because you got an abusive spouse you might be bummed out because you live in a crime infested neighborhood you might be bummed out for you know you might have some environmental issues that are causing health problems it's a lot going on you might work in a job that gets you exposed to toxic fumes or is that chemicals or right it's a lot of variables we you know we're in a medical system that blames your biology that's it yeah just blames your biology so if it doesn't convenient and because it suits the paradigm that people times name oh that's exactly right is that what uh it should be a lot of people ascribe it to Freud right but this quote Investigator calm says that it actually should go to this Twitter account a Twitter account yeah which Twitter account Debbie hope should be credited with exacting the saying it says Debbie wizard you whoever it was she nailed it did she nail it and attributed to Freud that's a kind of a clever move I don't want any attention it's out of the immersion yeah really awesome and attributed to some dead do too as a genius I found the site before it they kind of like do the telephone game with quotes and sort of like this is what you're saying and then they go through like just all the iterations of how it's been translated out well do you remember that one greg Giraldo joke that got attributed to me online and people had have photos of me with greg draw those quote and something that I never said it's absolutely not mine I didn't know whose it was and then someone had to say that's greg Giraldo and then people's like why he's stealing greg Giraldo shit my I'm not making memes like I'm not doing that somebody else did that but I put it on Twitter this is not mine I think I might have put it on Instagram too a long time ago but it was weird it was like I kept getting them or you get them these memes come in waves yes you know yeah I get ones that I did say I get those in waves too I get these pictures of me with like weird quotes that I had said memes are very powerful yeah video is even more powerful though because I think people have come like to this conclusion that they can't trust anything and reims are funny that's one of the things that like a good solid shame that's one of the things that was so egregious about that fat Jewish guy yet he was stealing these brilliant ideas and it made him look brilliant when really he's just sort of this aggregator of other people's awesome ideas without giving them credit and he just got in on this plagiarism loophole and everybody's like what and now he's got this weird thing that he does where he says that he puts up the the meme he writes his own quote and then just puts the originators name at the end of it he doesn't even say originally created by he just puts their name and that's like attribute incredible weird way super slimy like what's going on now with like and the problem is like someone will send you something and I have real issue with this like someone sends me something that's hilarious and I want to put it on Instagram like I don't know made it can I just put it up like what do I do do I say hey I don't know who the fuck made this let me know and then put it up and then people go oh you see what Joe Rogan said this is hilariously I didn't say it it matters I'm big into attribution cuz it makes it like it's like I have company around money you know I got also people returning to a business yeah like the mean business is a business and then they have sponsored a sponsored Instagram posts and sponsored tweets and they make a lot of money like there's a lot of money to be made if people were getting these development deals to do television shows and all sorts of other things based on the content of other people's ideas they're just aggregating that's amazing yeah well it's just a weird loophole it's like if you were doing it with music like say if you just wanted to take riffs that you thought were really awesome and put them on your music page people will go will fuck you you can't do that this is my stuff I created this but we get signature unless you're putting watermarks on everything the signature is not necessarily available with memes right cuz they're that powerful that's yeah and even if you do put a watermark you know what they do they just find the original photo put their own quote over it and just don't tribute anything to you because they don't want you to have the watermark on their page it's so sneaky it's like some weird copyright loophole that exists now you know no one knows exactly what to do about it we need some ambulance-chasing lawyers - mmm yes ambulance chambers chasers so what blowback have you experienced other than this influx of trolls and that's what I was saying right is that for a whole year none like I took out a large life insurance policy did you when I published my book expecting like pretty serious worried you were gonna die it's happened I have colleagues you know what do you what college do you have that have died I'm gonna leave that mystery hanger but if you think people been killed because they've criticized pharmaceutical companies you just have to know oh that it's the most powerful industry in the public eye anyway that's intense though what you just said like you you have colleagues that you believe may have been killing me you don't want to talk about it obviously he clammed right out it's hard to shut me up it's hard to shop if you really believe it serves like to title you know what I means like focus on this layering but I do on my line and gets a horrible narrative how about that it's a possible an area they might silence you and in in the realm of independent journalism and media where some random Schmo like me can actually have influence especially you know that I am credentialed in a way that people might pay attention to right then why would they not want to you know quiet me well they put labels on cigarettes no one gives a shit yeah you know I don't know if what you're saying is worth killing somebody over who knows I mean I'm still here so apparently not right and what you don't I mean it means like all those whistleblowers when it came to cigarettes and cancer who gives a shit people they make more money from cigarettes now than ever less people smoke so they just charge more for cigarettes and they make more than ever they make more now for cigarettes than they have in the last 15 years no no I believe that and and and it's true that just because but I write like I'm not just trying to scare people out of taking meds tryna hot also showing that you can totally shed your chronic illnesses completely forever why can't show forever but that you can have long-term shedding of your chronic illnesses that to me is a more threatening element of what I have to say than just like these pills are dangerous you shouldn't take them I'm not saying that I'm saying you might have been told you're broken that you have a mental illness for life but in fact you know like I have a woman who completed my online program had such bad migraine headaches that she had to be on IV treatment she was treated by the top neurologists at Emory she was on multiple pharmaceuticals she was bed bound for two years okay and she completed my program which we talked about this is not rocket science okay and she's totally symptom free Tonino so that's pretty threatening right to show you that in fact what you're told is a permanent problem you just have to deal and live with with pharmaceutical medicine could be completely dissolved is a very threatening concept and I'm not the only one I mean many functional medicine doctors and holistic healers are are you know working to create awareness of this possibility but regardless it was pretty weird that you know the book made the New York Times list strangely and there wasn't a mention of it in mainstream media for a year not once like nobody wanted you have to have you on their show this is amazing negative review like not a single mention in mainstream media so the negative review is the problem with that is that you could refute the negative reviews and also caused tension attention on it and let's see what her response is we decided to ignore me which I was really cool with because I had a very chill year but it's tough your life insurance policy yeah exactly just just waiting a you know to get my couple million to my kids but it's changing like even in the past month or so there's been like a more of a targeted effort and a couple of alluring Cosmo and a couple of mainstream outlets have begun to suggest that I am you know a dangerous reckless person who shames women who take meds they've said this in articles yeah yeah Wow I want to give it a shame the quick energy isn't that funny that like if you give advice that based on actual studies actual medicine give advice about you know hey maybe it's not a good idea that you take these crazy medications where we don't exactly know why you're taking them we don't know exactly if these are the right medications for you they're testing them on you literally as you go along that you're shaming I'm not even saying maybe it's not a good idea I'm just saying here's what the science says that you might not have been told and here's what's additionally possible you just at least know okay and here's the social proof you know interviews I'm publishing for case reports as we speak in the peer reviewed index medical literature you know so this is not like some random blog I wrote okay so just know that that's possible and then make your decision and guess what if you're on meds and this sounds interesting to you then I'm showing you there's a path to a new you know approach right that's you know that's it but actually it you know and I hate to even give it air waves because it's just sort of ridiculous and I do believe a lot of it initiated with Astro chirping but I'm being called an ableist oh that's what that word be wonderful it's one of the new ones the kids are using all these little snowflakes good to know love it so like some shaming people who can't do what I'm able to do including have a home birth you know vitalist this has been around for a while like - white - I know you have white privilege your woman it sounds bad white woman privilege is not real it is real no real it certainly is it certainly is but you guys have a you know struggle with that a bit more yes yeah I'm I'm a conqueror I'm a man terrible person done all things throughout history hailing all men response your blood level stuff yes nothing yeah ablest is a wonderful term you ever use that Jamie no call anybody neighborhood no one actually does yeah well in college they do and they do online who knew I don't know where I've been that I never heard that term people are just it's too easy to get by too easy to eat it's too easy to survive it's not enough difficulty out there people go looking for insults and looking for things that are often yeah there's a constant searching for outrage this quest for recreational outrage you know and people find things to be appalled at and then attack them and go nuts over it it's just it's a very strange time it's a I think it's beautiful though I think it's all it's all really good like where we're coming to grips with how preposterous we are and we're doing so in the middle of these embroiled battles over ideologies over cultural expression there's some girls in Portland that are taking a rash of shit because they're selling burritos and they're white they made a burrito truck and people are going crazy trying to shut them down shot damp down because they're not Mexican and they're selling burrito like they're not you know they're not pretending they're not like putting shoe polish on and pretending they're not putting brown face on they're just fucking selling burritos like it's so crazy I use that there it is critics saying that closed white womens Portland burrito stand for cultural theft what the fuck man there reto gee assholes Mexicans don't even eat burritos yes they do how gay are you when you want to measure don't you eat burritos I've eaten burritos in DL Mexican food yes I have had a real chicken burrito in Mexico it was quite delicious I love Mexico I just don't understand why anybody thinks that there's something wrong with learning a style of cooking it's like I think if you have cultural appropriation if you have like a person who's pretending they're from Laos and they start talking with a fake accent and you know and you go hey man you're from fucking Cleveland you're not even you not evil aus descent like you do it 23andme on you and you find out like your family's from Finland like the fuck is wrong with you like but there are people that do that and that is crazy right but that's just deceptive this is not deceptive is someone who likes making burritos they're making burritos and then these goofy white kids are fucking closing them down and that's what it is it's a cultural appropriation heroes just shouting out from the rooftop that you're wrong right you're wrong it's like you said we're just always looking for who to blame who to be mad at who to make sort of the the persecutor of our felt wrongness it's that same issue it's so crazy no it is a weird it is a weird time and the trouble is you know that the more that we this infighting is like in some ways a distraction from the greater issues that for sure government overreach and these greater issues that are allowed to unfold while we're busy calling each other names yeah you're doing that on Twitter and the government's literally reading your emails while you're doing it and you're like no but we have to worry about this burrito stank you think if I can't have salsa you can't have tortillas you're not from here like what is wrong with people that never existed before like whatever here's the thing here's what's fascinating it only works if the people that you're supposedly culturally stealing from are brown like if you try cooking French food and you're not a French descent nobody gives a shit you could cook Italian food all day long and no one cares about cultural appropriation like you could be a white woman from Switzerland who live is in New Jersey and runs an Italian restaurant and no one cares they won't care well arguably they haven't been like oppressed I guess in the same way they we're at one point time we just got through it night & Technik you know it's Mexican but it mean for real I mean that's literally the path of boxing in America was it was Jewish people Italians Irish it was the suppressed people black folks it was always the people that were the most economically suppressed that rose to and then they were also like my grandparents came from Italy and they experienced horrible racism back then back in the early 1900s but by the time they integrated into society like being Italian isn't even thought of as being not white anymore anything yeah but when my grandparents were kids it was like just like being Mexican it was the same kind of thing it was like you were treated like someone from somewhere else that they didn't want here right you know they called them Guinea wops and all these crazy slangs these horrible expressions that don't even mean anything anymore it's so ineffective now and our hope is right that one day it's gonna get like that with Mexicans the same way it's like you can't really mock someone from being from Holland no one gives a shit like you can say oh you're from Holland like a bit yeah like it's not what about Guido though like does that doesn't matter they call it Alves Guido's like they call themselves Guido now they'll call themself guineas they'll call themselves all and it's like almost like a term of endearment now it lives its its power it's true it's totally lost its power because it's culturally acceptable to be Italian and then one day I mean but the idea that these girls are stealing from Mexicans where it's so crazy like oh they're just they're just selling burritos folks just food it's just a certain way of preparing it you know it's not like they're pretending we invented this no one else did it it's a wrap like the people who make wraps those should be slapped that's not a wrap on the fucker that's a burrito you're making a shitty burrito and you're calling it a wrap right gluten-free those the real problem those the problem people the kana wraps zaps looks like a tortilla no no no no a rap what is what do they call did they call a rap at or in they say it's a tortilla what do they call that outside of a rap right it was a co-opting it's like a cuddly co-opting right that's the real theft as raps but it doesn't even taste good look if those girls were just selling raps everybody be like oh that's cool let's just do that that's just mislabeled it cuz I didn't have a Mexican flag anywhere any like a cartoon of a chili pepper sombrero it's just I really feel like this goes I mean it's it's a stretch granted but I really feel like this goes back to what we're talking about is that people need difficulty in their life they really do and that way they don't seek out difficulty you can you make sure it yeah yeah no it's true and I think that's one of the reasons why you're getting a lot of this from these college kids where there are tuitions being paid for they're you know they don't they don't have jobs they're not competing in the real world they're just operating on ideologies and they're being taught by these knuckleheads that are just trying to keep their tenure and they're trying to spread the same sort of ideology that they had when they were in college and they never really entered into the workforce in a lot of examples a lot of these people went from academia to teaching right I mean right in there just embedded into the system totally know hey ho these racist teachers I've got to go alright just people are going crazy today and I think a lot of it has to do with the same thing I think it's this newfound ability to communicate which is fantastic and it's going to have its hiccups it's going to be some issues and it's going to be some some real co-opting of the system like what you're experiencing with trolls attacking an idea but overall those ideas are spreading in a way that's unprecedented and impossible just a few decades ago like your ideas spreading the way they have where I hear about them and now you know you and I sit down and talk about this millions of people going to hear this conversation yeah this and this is unprecedented like this has never been available before so all the bad stuff you got to take it with all the good dark 100% yeah like what you're expressing what you're trying to get out to people this is all dis all new stuff like no one was saying this 20 years ago because we're all asleep matrix talk this is more hippie talk to you and hate 20 years ago he'd like oh my god I'm so crazy when I'm older but that's why it's a it is a cool time because it sort of like the democratization of information where if if you want to learn about other perspectives on anything you look it up you know and then you make your own decision so it is a time where you have the potential to be an individual in ways that were not honored in a more conformist you know controlled media environment I mean the trouble is that many people are still you know still believe that mainstream media is telling them the truth at that deconditioning is very challenging yeah but yeah that's a real problem I mean I think even though like the Trump stuff with all this fake news talk is so detrimental ultimately it is like you're getting people even if they realize that this guy's like knucklehead and he's wrong about a lot of stuff they're gonna they're at least challenging these ideas that these networks are only giving you the news I mean Fox News is a goddamn sexual-assault paradise over there I mean these these guys just keep getting kicked out of Fox News over and over again there's all these sexual harassment allegations and people are resigning left and right right well because of all that stuff it makes you go oh all these guys are creeps like there's a lot of creeps even there like when Brian Williams got busted lying and you're like oh that news guys just like another asshole they just make shit up like just because he's saying the real news right sometimes doesn't mean everything he says is true like any and there's no way to filter it so everybody has to question things now in a way that you never questioned during the Walter Cronkite era you know when people were giving the news back when Ted Koppel was on the air you weren't quite like Ted Koppel bullshit I don't say that you know right but Brian Williams is clearly full of shit but that's why it's weirder now to follow mainstream media because if you're not saying that like how are you have so much allegiance to the machine that you would never question it like to me that's surprising except also that machine is the only vehicle for these pharmaceutic companies they have to sandwich those commercials in between you know whatever show you're watching you know 360 whatever the fuck it is this guy is only ten minutes yeah and they just sandwich I'm in there whereas you're not going to see those commercials like no one's gonna read those drug ads on a podcast you're not gonna say okay well hey I've been really nice talking to you and I want to talk to you folks about abilify are you right now thinking about being suicidal and really want to cement those thoughts and solidify them to eat and make action so not funny it's right I shouldn't say it cuz I don't even know what I'm talking about you should be talking about this not me but Here I am where's this abilify drug blame for compulsive gambling eating shopping sex that's just life bro how can you get blame abilify here's why you can cuz this is impulsive anything I'm telling you yeah whoa no way a gambling habit cost her between 1 million and two million in less than five years you just suck at gambling lady stop blaming drugs the woman had been living in Las Vegas since 1999 but she had never ferreted on a gamble until she started taking the drug get the fuck out of here that lady got a real it lawyer she got a good lawyer and she's crazy I got 200 people on this lawsuit that had all have claimed that gambling has won get in on it I want to take a bill if I swing get some of that cash there was a drug called ria quip and there was a man in ireland that took this drug and said before the drug he was a healthy heterosexual and after he took the drug he became gay and a gambling addict and he would engage in risky sex and he would meet men in chat rooms and have unprotected sex with them and then he got off the drug was like what did i do like what anyone the equivalent of us somewhere in the neighborhood of $600,000 from Galax Oh Klein Smith yeah here it is man says Parkinson's drug made him addicted to gambling and gay sex what is that from mm what was it say up there yeah there's my memory that's what I remember I remember things that can turn me into a gay section cam jaunty like yeah hey meanwhile in what else works good on Parkinson's get pot yeah but and pot doesn't do that well good it's crazy this guy sue the shit out of them in one that's what's crazy that he won because I believe it well it's crazy as it's one dude hopes for new trucks I love how they sandwich that in there oh my god as many as 1 million people in United States have Parkinson's and there's some new stuff that I can turn on the side oh for sure yeah I like that when you scroll down the video keeps playing anyway like they put a little video like I can't escape the video it's always sitting in the corner like go ahead press play don't be tempted have been doing this on the bottom like where usually you'll see I got another story or similar stories a sponsored story oh yeah yeah can't even tell it's sponsored usually well you can now on CNN they have a ton of those on a lot of websites they have a ton of those yeah it's pretty fascinating and it's like you know you won't believe what they look like now and you're like God what do they look like now and then you have to go to like fucking 20 pages of what other people that look like shit now to get to this one person that you might not even do might even beyond that you know limit just totally missing you wasted ten minutes of your life they never get back yeah I mean on Medscape and he's like seemingly official medical websites there are Pharma ads that are appear to be diagnostic quizzes you know so like do you have depression and then you go take the quiz and this is this is known you know has been exposed 100 percent of people are identified pretty much no matter what you click you're identified as being a candidate for of course right then I like dude you're fine come on with your life go play frisbee Oh in this objective assessment your dad you're doing great yeah oh my god I'm so glad that I have to sell you drugs me wow that's so what what do you hope to to really get into people's heads with this book and with all this information and what you've gone on in your journey if you had a like sum it up well it's sort of like when you know better you do better it's like a Maya Angelou quotes like one of my favorite that's a great quote it is the because there's no shaming in that race cuz the fake Freud quote when you know better you do better it's really good okay when Freud said the word asshole in a quote so so with this information is there something in you that's like excited about it or that says like yeah there's something to that because if there is then you should know what's possible right because if you know what's possible then you will naturally move towards that and the transformations that I have seen and continue to see I mean like I cry thinking about it it's so deeply inspirational because it's a kind of human experience that is so redemptive it's like a real reclamation that is not possible through the pharmaceutical model in my opinion I want to tell you a quick story about antibiotics because you brought this up yes earlier so I went to India recently right and I bought some antibiotics when you get back no no I never take I would never I don't take any pharmacy you don't take antibiotics ever what if you got an infection like what if you got staph then I'll tell you exactly what would happen right so I went to India Oh Chi brought my little kit with me right knowing that there's like and honestly like I I don't believe in germ theory in the classical sense so I don't and neither should any one germ theory is like if you're exposed to a bad bug then you get sick right exposure equals infection right right but you know pester himself on his deathbed said that it was the terrain not the bug so what's the terrain the terrain is the context the terrain is your body in your lifestyle and you know in your existence so that seems to be more relevant and then the discovery of the microbiome like this inner ecology has totally we got to go back to the drawing board completely in medicine because we didn't know that before how recent is the discovery of the microbiome it's about like 20 years 20 years in 20 years we've the science of probiotics and and understanding the importance of consuming fermented foods exactly and you know super infections through antibiotic overuse and the fact that you can ever get out from under this idea of just killing the bad bugs right it doesn't work and so the more you sanitize and you use bleach alcohol and Purell and all that stuff you're actually distorting things and you're making it more likely for people to develop what are called nosocomial illnesses or infections which is hospital induced infections right this is a hospital is a sick environment in part because we have a wrong idea about how biologically ecosystems work there's no bad guys everything works together it's like a metaphor for life in fact there aren't really any bad guys it's all you know sort of part of the polarity of life we need we need bad - no we're good like it's that ancient philosophy so anyway so we go to India and I bring bentonite clay I bring colloidal silver I bring a bunch of little silver do you know that is a real that's that stuff ii like ii use like a little electrodes you stick the water or the stick yeah or you just rely on people to make that for you right in a responsible way didn't that turn some dude blue yeah yeah yeah when it can do that you to arrest the wrong if you're wheezing are if you are like Avatar like an avatar lady I'm making it work what do you mean think of it undermine my credibility I don't know freaky I'm super healthy but I'm blue as fuck thank you that poor guy he died oh my gosh yeah and that's it reversible apparently yeah that's not what we're gonna use or that's that's why it as a DIY it may not be the best idea jota's colloidal silver what's the benefits of colloidal silver so okay so like herbal but int like botanical you know sort of like anti microbials if you want to call them that they don't kill stuff they're I think they have like a rebalancing effect but they're you know for like you know SIBO small intestinal bacterial overgrowth it's like a thing people are struggling with that a lot of functional medicine doctors treat there's randomized trial looking at antibiotics versus herbal botanicals showing herbal botanicals are as effective so why would you ever bother with the risks of antibiotics which are legion i mean they're massive risks what herbal botanicals are specifically efficient things like oil of oregano for example it's like that's really good studied ones you know grapefruit seed extract their powder co there's a whole number of them goldenseal echinacea that these properties and a lot of supplements just sort of put them all together right okay so I'm making this story too long so I go to India I bring all this stuff right and one of the women it's like a Kundalini trip one of the women gets really sick like like projectile vomiting and like screaming in pain like bad scenes I laughed right before you got the screaming in pain sorry I thought she was just puking you know it was it was she was super sick and even the Indian dude who was sort of like our chaperone in a way like a friend of the woman who led the plate and led the trip was like oh we got to bring her to the hospital hospital and you're like no I gotta give her colloidal silver and I was like give me 12 hours really yeah I looked in the eyes is like give me 12 hours and I know her well enough to know that she would be down for this approach okay so and she was not afraid important detail she's not afraid she's super uncomfortable but she wasn't like freaking out and like oh my god way to die she just thought you sick which is true so in two hours she was completely well we were in the car for a two-hour trip going to like another part of northern India and how did you cure or treat she may very well have done it herself and and the ritual of these supplements of bentonite clay and whatever could have just been an accessory who knows the truth is that if she had taken antibiotics which she never did if she had taken them reflexively she probably would have been sick longer and she then ultimately when she got better would have attributed to the end of antibiotics right so she never would have had the opportunity to just see what her body is capable of so we make these assumptions about pharmaceuticals in the absence of any baseline evidence information or even experience to help us understand what our bodies are capable of but what if someone catches one of these antibiotic resistant very aggressive strains like MRSA I mean you know so so my partner has a website called remit info TOCOM right was it go green med info doc green med infocomm and he catalogs all of the data from PubMed gov on these natural substances that shows that something like garlic you know because there's a study he put up on on MRSA and I think it was like garlic and maybe honey or something you would laugh at right dr. Ronnie Patrick went through this and she talked about on the podcast she had a persistent staph infection that would not go away and treat she treated it with garlic and uh in a topical form and he cured it when nothing else would and she had gone through this host of antibiotics that really wrecked her gut biome and she was really fucked up for like a year because of it and she treated with a topical application of garlic which is crazy and it sounds crazy until you actually learned that there's you wouldn't know that there's actually science to support that yeah so there's a ton of science to support natural medicine I don't know who funds these studies it's crazy that they're even done because there certainly isn't Pharma money behind them but they are done and if you know about them it might help you to make an informed decision but this is reflexive assumption that well pharmaceutical medicine is the only legit choice if it gets bad enough is conditioning that's how I'm saying it's it's a conditioned assumption and if you have an experience that defies that then you'll make different decisions for yourself in the future but you have to have like that woman will probably make different decisions for herself in the future because now she trusts her body like just a little bit more you know she's that much less afraid of all of the horror stories the fear mongering is the greatest marketing device you know employed by the industry is scaring you into what if you don't do it but aren't there a bunch of people that like when they do catch mersa or something like that and then get devastated like the right move is to get on an IV antibiotic like isn't that sometimes the case you just told me a story where that's not true what I told you a story okay so then some people it is one but it's one and she had a topical issue but it if it's one and you're the one then that's important information for yourself it certainly is I mean anti 5.1 but I mean don't don't they serve a purpose in some function sometimes I mean you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater right I mean if someone has some rampant aggressive infection of bacterial infection I thought if we only used antibiotics for true life-or-death emergencies we would have a very different situation on our hands than what we have right which is a combination of you know devastating our ecosystem you know making people gravely ill because they have very serious and totally unpredictable side effects including long-term neurologic side effects you know the the what's even going on with our livestock like we are in a mess with our worship of this idea of and you know antibiotic means it means against life like literally there's something wrong headed about that mentality and so it comes back to philosophy like if you want to believe in in war you know you want a war against your body you want to war against and blame all the bad people who do all this bad things and you want to lock them up in prisons and you want to hate the you know you know Arabs and terrorists and if there's a hair talk again lady but if that's your general vibe then it's going to make sense to take medications like that for you right but I you know have plenty of colleagues and myself we have a different philosophy so that's why it comes down to it's a religion you know it really comes down to your belief system so your philosophy is improve the health of the gut biome take in natural antibiotics things like garlic things like oregano oil things with nature Yeah right right get back to the continuum like you know there's this notion that there's like a path we're meant to walk you know where we sort of follow our what our ancestors sort of set us up for and we've strayed from a big time and and we're in some ways being reminded you know that we can't go too much farther without like struggling pretty seriously I think one of the big points that you just made which is really huge is that if we only used antibiotics when necessary in life or death situations we wouldn't have the issues that we have right now with livestock with with chickens house and people take Z packs like it's going out of style I mean they take them like they take tylenol for a headache I know so many people that take antibiotics they just throw them down I feel so much better took a z-pack like you might feel better because you were going to feel better anyway and the z-pak you just threw on top of the mix and decided that that was what was taking you over the top that's right meanwhile it's like in the water supply now z packs but it's like - cosmic wells that you can't really they're not psychoactive right isn't it there was just this there was just something I put on social media it was like studying fish that are exposed to antidepressants water and they became like more aggressive well it was something like you know fish aren't made happier by but but the point is that antidepressants are just in the water supply now yeah suitable products apparently in dosage is relevant to clinical expression of fish behavior I don't know but Jesus Christ yeah I mean there's no free lunch there's no free lunch with Pharma I think it's but if you're in a fishing that's good cuz you want fish to be aggressive I mean maybe they don't want to be this long fuck what they were many eat nothing feel energy shell I've never seen one they try not to fish you're just eating things mostly other fish a bunch of goddamn cannibals all of them um that's yeah silly silly thoughts thanks for indulging those but um and thanks for coming on here I really appreciate we just ours it was fun wow that's quite an attention span so you do not need a tour all you're doing just know I'm scared of adderall if I just had two cups of coffee though but if I had adderall I just don't I want to try it one day but it's I'm terrified of it a Canadian study just came out but if if you take a simulant you're 13 times more likely to be prescribed antipsychotic and four times more likely to be prescribed Canadian they're not even like regular people there's a totally different stripper just very important it's super important to confound yet variable they're different the woods they're forest folks they talk weird I know all right Kelly so one more time tell people what is the name of your book where you can get it I'm sure you're gonna get a lot of positive and negative line for a couple days just I thought you had my back I do have your back I'm just telling you I don't want you I don't want you to get hit with the trolls yeah no no listen yeah first of all it's important it's my disclaimer that I'm not here to tell anyone what to do right okay it's just about informed consent and if you know all the information you want it's continue making your choice do you think but I do believe people are entitled to all of the information and I didn't know about it when I was prescribing so I I carry that charge now so my book is called a mind of your own and the rest of my nonsense on my website just Kelly broken empty calm all right beautiful thank you I really enjoy the screams yeah a pleasure all right my friends that's it we'll be back tomorrow with hilarious and drew Santino so until then get off those pills you fuck or don't tell me [Music]
