four three two one mr. Baker how are you mr. Rogan I'm doing well thanks very much what's going on man what are you doing in town I just was in town doing some work on a sizzle reel for a show a new show about that you tell people what it is well it's actually two of them one I can talk about it can tease it a little bit the marketing department I guess has to approve everything that said it started out it's gonna be on the Discovery Network I need a science Channel and it we're starting the main filming in February and we should be finished by the end of March so you know standby but it's started with a discussion about hidden budgets in the Defense Department like dark arts stuff yeah it's good the show's gonna be called black files and a UFO type shit well there's gonna be some of that uh some but but from a you know not from a you know you know did they lie at land today not it's it's we're really actually kind of tearing into some of the programs that were funded by you know hidden money in the Defense Department and how do they do that well I mean if you take like the CIA for example the agency's budget is hidden inside it's not hidden but it's placed inside the Defense Department and it's and it's a classified piece of information obviously because the Defense Department gets a certain budget the CIA gets a piece of that but nobody's allowed to know how much right or where it's been right because obviously you know the Russians the Chinese whomever would like to know you know how much money is sent over to the agency so that they can get a sense of size resources capabilities that sort of thing so that's where the show concept started you know what what does that money spent on both in the old days and now so it's a it's it kind of spans you know historical operations and events and activities and special units and it goes up to the present time and says you know where is you know money being devoted now for new technology or new programs new operations new intelligence gathering efforts whatever it might be so it's yeah I think it's it's got a lot of promise you know hopefully people tune in and find it interesting well people are always curious about where the money goes yeah yeah and you know I am like who oversees it who gets who gets to decide like what gets spent on what and how much money goes where and I do actually know I do this it's my job it's a good question you know that's I think a lot of people would be surprised at the amount that we're talking about you know and it's not just it's not the intelligence community it's also the military obviously can you discuss the actual numbers or could you discuss the numbers that they used to have we'll be able to discuss the numbers that went into past operations but anything that's currently classified obviously one's not gonna touch all right but we've been working hard and the producer has been working very hard to get excellent access you know where possible and get cooperation where possible it's gonna be a fairly immersive effort so it's the benefit of the CIA even divulging any of this information like why would they cooperate why wouldn't they say hey shut the fuck up yeah well and and and and frankly they should and and they have and they will but not necessarily with the agency but with other departments and certainly within the military there's you know some information out there that's accessible there's some ability to get them to cooperate on on certain again Declassified operations that just haven't come to light look at a lot of shits been Declassified over the years that's just never been looked at or talked about you know somebody maybe get some wild hair up their ass in missus I'm gonna look into this program and then they start you know peeling it back it's not that it's classified it's just nobody's ever bothered to dig into that information once it is too classified so you know it's it's it's gonna be a lot of fun a lot of travel some great people working on the program but you know apparently I have to keep it pretty much at that until the marketing department says okay here's what you could say right so eventually you'll be able to spill the beans to tell us everything exactly so like what they're making something like the b-52 if they're making a stealth bomber if they're making some spaceship looking thing like you're talking this insane amount of money in research and development and the budget of these things and they have to keep all that under wraps yeah shed yeah I mean look at you go back to the old days of of the u2 program new to program was developed a designed built maintained flown by the CIA all those years ago right now that was a massive effort and a lot of money and it was done under budget and it was done on time in part because I think you know things were a little bit easier back then and we weren't all pissing on each other up on Capitol Hill but yeah there's so it's it's it's programs like that that I think will surprise people when they find out both who was running it who was responsible and to the degree possible you know what did it cost us and you know who was involved and and to what degree did it lead to something else that we're doing now so there's a lot of lot of you know threads to pull on I think it should be a lot of a lot of fun so there's constantly projects that are in development that people other than the people that need to know the general public has no idea that's always the the purse the the people on the outside folks like myself you look at that you know wonder what kind of shit they have but they don't tell us about that's what you always want like what kind of invisibility cloak what kind of crazy you know that would be good dark matter weapons and what are they doing ya know it's it and it's it's true I mean you get these incredibly smart people and it but it comes down it's as simple as somebody gets an idea they're sitting around a table it's not unlike going out with your buddies and drinking and thinking you know come and somebody comes up with some you know dumbass idea the next thing you know it turns into a TV show or something but it's it's it's not unlike that a lot of smart guys sitting around a table thinking well here's the problem how do we resolve it and the key is to do it creatively right they come up with because if you get a bunch of engineer sitting around a table you hope that they're not at all approaching it from the same point of view right it's like with an operation if you've got it you got a high-value target out there and you got to figure out how to get yet access get to them you want ideas coming in from all directions you don't want it you don't want to you know squelch creativity and believe it or not I mean the Intel community the military they've been enormously creative over the years in developing new technologies and developing operational ideas and methodologies so it's what we're trying to do is shed some light on that well I would imagine there's a certain amount of I don't want to use the word fun but that's really the right word like some of it's got to be fun to develop this stuff and to implement it and go out and get bad guys with it and to see your pride come to fruition and actually have a positive effect on the world absolutely I mean if you it really is its it's that something because you know in operations anyway you know you engage in something out there in some you know you know place around the world wherever it may be and you know you realizes you walk in a way that you know there's not a lot of people doing this at this moment on the planet right I mean so the operational activity itself is is enormous ly entertaining as long as it goes right but it's also the buildup it's all that homework that gets you there right it's it's like that take down a bin Laden we didn't just happen to get lucky and rock up on its doorstep right in the body bod that was eight or nine years of fucking hard work right heavy lifting chasing down countless bad leads and doing enormous amounts of surveillance street work and and tracking down assets and doing a mean just it just the hard hard work that eventually allowed that you know all those guys from from the teams to land and do their job that's what's interesting to me - is that the guy who's writing the book about all this stuff and talking about you know the man who shot bin Laden that guy is persona non grata in the community like you talked to the other seals they're like you don't you don't do that right right you don't do that you know you don't write books about that you don't talk about that and I'll it for a short-term gain you know you make some profit off of it but you lose the brothership you lose a yeah exactly you you're you're kind of on the outs in the club and but I will say this the reason why I think the horse got out of the barn on on that whole issue of guys writing books are getting out there and talking about specific operations it's because senior commanders and and senior people right people that came out of the top levels of government started writing their memoirs you know started revisiting history while they were it was their watch and then and coming up with you know their explanations for history and I think all the guys below you know junior ranks and street level operators they looked at that and thought what the fuck if they can do it right on me and because you've got to set the tone from the top and I think that's where it got it got you know kind of sideways plus when you have someone who you know has a crazy story like marcus luttrell and it becomes an amazing movie it also it does help the community right because it gets a bunch of people that are really interested in becoming a seal it gets people to appreciate the the unbelievable sacrifice and hard work that's involved yeah I think that's I think that is there is an upside right yeah there's an upside to it but I think you this it's a fine balance right what point do you go over that line so so you're right in the sense that you know we see that with who mad with the FBI or DEA you know they got out there and put their thumbprint on some TV shows right because I think it kind of it it expanded in in part awareness of what they do I'm sure it helped their recruitment and so the seals are no different but at the same time you know you sign a piece of paper at the very beginning that says you're gonna keep your Yap shut yeah and and it's one thing to come out work from whatever unit or whatever team or whatever organization and say I'm gonna write I don't know about my time in it and it's not a look at sources and methods not look at operations it's not that it's more of you know this is what happened you know during my time and I think there's I'm not explaining it very well but I think there's a way you can do that without screwing the pooch but I think that I think the seals got overexposed and I think a lot of the guys resent that yeah and so but again you're right there there was some upside to it well there's upside to some of the stories right like that definitely is upside to marcus luttrell store because it's just so incredible to be fresh in here about it but I think that there's also it's important to maintain that honor it's more important to maintain that that bond of silence you know that you guys you know they're doing something that is probably one of the most dangerous and one of the most in terms of special operations one of the most significant in in in all of military in this country right yeah I think the the old-school guys the old-school operators out of the teams are definitely like yeah just shut your pie-holes don't talk about yeah the newer guys again because they came up in a different time right I mean information flows all around as much easier and quicker than it did in the 70s and 80s and you know early 90s but nowadays people are just used to reading everything as soon as it happens and I creates a different mindset so the younger guys in there they don't necessarily view it the same way I didn't even think about it until the dick marchenko books came out those were a long time was a long time ago yeah that's when I really was like wow I can't they wear regular clothes I mean I'm I mean I think I was like probably 18 or 19 when those books were out and I remember thinking what it this is crazy wear long hair and they dress like hippies it's just normal and go out and invade go ahead vade just invading hippies but I know they would get I mean marchenko is famous for wanting his guys to get drunk together too before like big things yeah well it's it's an idea team-building camaraderie yeah and however you do it but there was there was that sense that we do it and it's off the radar yeah it's not talked about yeah and we take pride in that but again I'll go back to the same thing if if like Bob gates you know Bob gates writes a book you know a former director of the agency and he's a brilliant guy great guy but he writes a book and you know and then you get somebody else maybe Mike Morell writes a book and so from you know inside the CIA you got a lot of officers going well shed maybe when I get out I'll write a book because what I'm doing is pretty damn interesting and there's no laws against that well there there are that's in and you know anybody who reveals sources and methods anybody who who breaks their agreement in terms of the proper handling which is a lifetime agreement of classified information there's supposed to be consequences and sometimes there are and sometimes if you're senior enough maybe there's not but yeah you you know you sign a piece of paper at the very beginning I'll never forget that I read it you know and I said ok good it was such keep your Yap shut I mean I don't want oversimplify it but it says you're being given the responsibility of handling extremely sensitive information and information that that if released can easily result in the loss of life I mean it's as simple as that essentially and your obligation is to shut your mouth and not talk about sources and methods and things that you know better not to talk about and but I think that the kind of the drip drip drip right of the books and the things that come out and there and the anonymous sources like the New York Times can write a an entire front page article based on nothing but anonymous sources nowadays never used to have them right okay you know editors would sit there and go hey you know you better get yourself some additional you know sources right and that we can discuss so people can put it in context nowadays that's not the case why do you think that is I think I don't know I word part of it is low standards low ilysm yeah I think lower standards I think competition I think the desire to get information out there quickly because every journalist is now playing beat the clock with everybody who's got a smartphone right and fancies themselves a blogger or a journalist on Twitter or whatever so they're all they're all doing this and I think it's just this idea right that says I it reminds me of me I had a meeting with with my company diligence for all your information and security needs and it was with a major multinational corporation and I was meeting with their head of security and some other folks and they do a lot of work overseas and some very difficult places and the competition that they face in their sector is huge and so we went in there and we thought this would be great there's a lot of things we can do for them in terms of gathering information preventing them from making mistakes as they're going into a new market all of these things and the bottom line was they said they looked at me and I said now you know what competitions so fierce we're just gonna go in if we make mistakes we'll clean it up later and they were willing to do that it's like acceptable lost credit card fraud loss you know for MasterCard or whomever they're willing to accept millions and millions and millions of dollars as acceptable loss for the cost of doing business and so it's a little bit like that I think with journalism they're willing to just throw shit out there and hey if they have to make a retraction fine but it compromises the way a person like myself views the news I mean look I hate to quote Trump but when he he's like parrots that fake news term over and over again you if you are a person who's or an organization that's being accused of lying it seems to me you should really dot your i's and cross your T's from then on out I mean you're being accused of lying by the president and I think it responsibly accused I mean the way he does it he does it to avoid questions that make him uncomfortable I mean and as the president I just don't think you should be able to do that right you can't point to someone from CNN and your fake news yeah like wow it smells right it serves no purpose for the press that I agree with the other percent I so much of what this administration does is a self-inflicted wound right and and part of it is is is that they're just crap and messaging part of it is this idea that you know he just says what's on his mind and he does yeah it's almost like he's got Tourette's but I think he views it as a strength he views it as a reason why he got elected and a lot of people out there think yeah that's his base you know the people they're really behind him no matter what I think they view it as part of his charm as well and the problem is he does release classified information sometimes yeah we've had that problem with several administrations they just don't know what to not say well I think part of it again is yeah there's there's a laxness that's developed over the years and I don't know why right because you know I mean I think about all various security issues we face and look we've been a war for you know 17 years right since 9/11 and all these things that have been happening to us you would think that we'd be pretty buttoned up but now every administration has had its moment where it's let slip and whether it was the press secretary whether it was somebody rushing to the podium it was somebody on Capitol Hill I mean they're famous for it up there you know congressmen and congresswomen or senators all in the in the rush to get in front of the camera to talk about something and then you know shit happens things get out that it shouldn't so I think it's it it all kind of contributes to this mentality that we started off talking about with with the seals where you know they're you know why are we in this point where people are writing books and maybe getting outside the box and I think it's just because yeah it's this constant drip and lowering of standards like you mentioned I think and it's I don't think we walk that dog bag I don't you know it's just the way it is now you're not in the agency anymore but I'm sure you stayed tight with people that are still there what what is the attitude now with this administration like what they're doing with like his the way he attack the FBI and the wait just seems it seems so reckless yeah it's it's uh it's unusual I mean that look like okay this here's the way I feel but I didn't vote for for the president I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton I didn't think either were more than you know the best we could do in a country of over 300 million we've talked about that for that was you or I that did what Hillary did would be in jail yeah exactly yeah and so but as far as you know what the the current mood inside the agency is I mean if you talk to some former folks they you know they they'll say uh morale is awful that was terrible and you know they just say you just you know hating life because there's no I I don't find that I find that the frankly they just more focused on operational concerns and priorities and tasking than anything else everybody's got a personal opinion right but I do think that the agency has proven itself over the years at being better at pushing that down and understanding and in part because it's a smaller organization right then most of them then almost all of them and but he's an he's not he doesn't go out to the CIA right he's only gone after the FBI he's got the FBI I mean he's you know he's questioned he's done he's done some things in terms of questioning CIA analysis and and and you know some of the advice and guidance that they've provided but that again you sort of look at and go hey look we're feeding this into the NSC the National Security Council you guys you know that's that's that's an editorial process at that point you guys are gonna have to make your decisions you know people are gonna say I'm just saying this because I'm subjective and I you know I'm providing top cover for the agency but for the most part they just focus on getting shit done and we also have the benefit of big focused overseas so we're not like the Bureau is you know it's a domestic organization right so they you know they're drawn in the agencies got the advantage of look we're having to deal with crap over there right not here so now what did you think when he said they were gonna pull out of Syria well first of all yeah yeah they just had that we've lost some servicemen up in northern Syria today today as a result of a bombing up there yeah Isis is taking credit for it so there-there was a Patrol we've got roughly 2,000 personnel in Syria and for the most part what are they doing there what they're providing guidance training they're assisting with targeting and because the the airpower is incredibly important over there right now and so we are our personnel are very much involved in selection of identification of targets for the air campaign and so we have these two thousand troops their president says he's gonna withdraw and then then some of the members of the administration start walking that dog back right and saying all right I may not happen right away but yeah they just a routine patrol if there's never really such thing as a routine patrol but there's a patrol and it got hit the military is not releasing a lot of details because they haven't finished notifying next to Ken but numbers so far indicate possibly four service men lost and that's going to refocus I think Congress and hopefully the White House on what the hell's going on the problem I've got with it is in terms of withdrawing look we could stay there forever and not accomplish the task right if the task is to finally defeat whatever that means radical Islam jihadists Isis that shit's never gonna happen we're not in our lifetimes we're not going to get rid of that mentality that that ideology the sort of what seems to be sometimes a bottomless well of recruits that they can draw on their ability to morph into something else as al Qaeda did over depending on you know how successful we are in a campaign against them they're like you know again it's a it's it's you know it's like you know you step on roaches over here and they pop up over here so I think it's the the biggest problem I've got is is that if we leave we're not we're not you know it's not like we're engaged in fire fights every day with Isis over there right we've left that to our allies and our allies in most part up there in the north of Syria are the Kurds and the Kurds have been our allies in one way or another in that part of the world for a long time now and it played a very important role and we have not been particularly honorable over the over the years in terms of how sometimes we deal with them if we walk out if we leave then Dajuan you know ahead of Turkey I guarantee you we'll be in there in short order to kill as many of them as possible because that's just what the Turkish authorities are going to do they honestly they're they couldn't be happier with the announcement that we're gonna leave because that opens the door for them to then go in there and from their perspective stamp out the Kurdish alliance that have been our allies were the only thing our presence that small presence you know not minimizing it but you know 2,000 troops has been what's prevented them from doing that so that's that's the number one issue I've got the other is I have no idea why any president or vice president or anybody in in the government ever not this administration or any administration ever thinks it's a it's a good idea to say we've defeated the enemy when we're talking about radical Islam we've seen it over and over again from previous administration from the Bush administration every time they say you know we've done it mission accomplished mission accomplished I would be beaten al Qaeda or we beat nicest it's there's no upside to saying that shut the fuck up stop saying things like that it's again it's a self-inflicted wound at the because now what's happening yeah the media is not focused on the fact that we've lost servicemen they're focused on well just just the other day the president said we defeated Isis and the vice president today said the same thing now look what's happened there's no benefit to saying that and it's not going to happen anyway so so the goal of being over there is to assist our allies but also to make sure that these Radical factions don't become more powerful and then eventually affect us and attack us so we can keep an eye on what they're planning what they're doing is that yes that an accurate yeah it is it's it's it's exactly it I mean if you look at the reason we went into Afghanistan and if we go back all the host years only shut and that was because the Taliban allowed al-qaeda to establish a beachhead in there for training and for communications and for finance and for plotting and planning attacks outside of Afghanistan against us and our allies that's why we went in there aside from just seeking revenge obviously was to route that out we then stayed you know thinking somehow we were going to turn the tide of history and create some pseudo federal democracy right so that didn't that didn't work but the reason now for being in Syria is yes we we have done a very solid job of beating back Isis removing their territory and degrading their ability to operate but we haven't stamped them out we haven't defeated them yet they're still there and so we've been providing the support and again in the form of weapons hardware gear of resources training and most importantly combat air operations air assaults and that's been critically important if we leave I have no doubt that Isis will find some way to rejuvenate maybe not in its current form but and maybe not in the same exact locations but they'll morph because that's what they do they just they just find a way to adapt and we already know what's happened in the past when we when we left Iraq we saw what happened with the rise of Isis so you know I the do I want to stay there forever absolutely not but both sides can make a valid argument one for staying one for leaving my I think the best argument for staying in the in certainly a short midterm is to ensure that Iran doesn't slaughter a bunch of Kurds who have been working with us honorably you know I don't know how else to say that so we'll see what happens is the best argument to stay is to protect the people that helped us to protect our allies yeah yeah so it's not in our best interest is in the best interest of our commitment and our agreement with them well is it in our national security interest to stay in Syria for example look right there was this there's so many levels to this thing and I'm sure right now everybody's listening going off fucksake he's not gonna disappear down the rabbit hole but but yes I am it for a while there there was just this this idea this was ridiculous pie in the sky thought that we were gonna get the Russians out of Syria never gonna fucking happen Russians said the only port for their Black Sea Fleet is in Syria yeah they've been there for decades and decades along with Iran we're net we it's not going to happen unless we want to go to war with Russia to kick them out of Syria that's not in our best interest so is it in our national security interest to keep troops there to fight and try to minimize Russian involvement in Syria I don't think so because we're not gonna shift them off that dime without going directly at them right it's in their best interest to stay and every nation acts in its own best interest are we going to shift Iran are we going to keep Iran from forming from too late for that they've already got a beachhead there that they're not going to give up and so you got to set those issues aside say well what the hell are we doing there oh we are we there simply because we have to you know finish the fight against Isis well you know at some point you gotta say you know I guess I wouldn't say that we've defeated them but I think we would say yeah we've degraded them sufficiently that we can we can now operate from elsewhere you know we can operate from forward bases in other locations where we're currently you know based great but again I keep coming back to the same thing that you know we've we've worked with the Kurds is this in our national security interest well no I guess it's not but there's something that tells me it's the right thing to do and and maybe sometimes that's enough you know that we should we should not let Iran have his way and also long term wouldn't it be in our best interest to honor our commitment and make sure that we protect our allies so that in the future other allies would be more willing to cooperate with us because they understand that once we're committed were fully committed and we yeah and we stand for something yeah so what's the benefit of getting out like the people that think we should get out like wouldn't when Trump said he wanted to pull out like what's his thinking I don't think it runs particularly deep I think it's just I think it's you know during the campaign he talked about you know stopping the endless wars well that's a very popular concept right no again nobody what the hell I mean and so it will be interesting to see you know what today's sad you know event does up on Capitol Hill you know do they they rethink their the the withdrawal order they accelerated like when they had the buildup in Iraq and it was highly criticized but then it was very effective like it did do what they intended it to do right and did knock back the enemy if they decided to ramp it up worldwide would that be a solution to any of this or is the opposite is it better to actually ramp up our defenses domestically and just stay the fuck away from all these people yeah well eventually he can only I mean you can only do so much I think on the domestic front and then you know if if they gain sufficient ability and strength and we've seen that from past attacks I think then then they'll come after you they'll come after us and that's just the way I suppose that's going to work but I don't disagree with the notion because it is hard pressed I look I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan frankly I don't care whether they've increased their literacy rate by 2% or built another road or whatever doesn't matter they don't they don't know what the hell we're trying to sell them right so I don't I'm not against the notion of getting out but this one's a tough one I guess that's what I'm saying is is that the Syria issue is I'm real conflicted on because of the Kurds and and what they've done on our behalf in the past and how they've suffered and knowing going years and years back you know having dealt with that issue two and a half decades ago a long time ago with the Turks and the Kurds knowing how vicious that could be and I don't trust her to want as far as I could throw them out a window so you know I think there's a problem there that we need to we need to make sure we've talked through thoroughly before we just say sure let's get him out of there you know what the hell you know we shouldn't have him there we shouldn't be there but like everything else so it gets kids it's complicated you would like to think that what they're having conversations like this up on Capitol Hill right you know between the the parties Republicans and the demonsaw my especially a guy like Trump if Trump is the guy who's decided we're gonna pull out us area like how does he have enough time to carefully consider that as well as all the other things that are on his plate yeah and when someone runs for president save someone's campaigning and they say you know where I support a non interventionist foreign policy I'm gonna get us out of these these wars I'm gonna get they're doing this based on a limited amount of information like it's not like the CIA or the FBI or anybody briefs them as they're running for president they don't have clearance right right right until you become the Party nominee right so when you're the party nominee then do you get a discussion you get you get some access right it's not you're still not the president right but you are given some ability to get more intensive briefings yeah yeah but it's not it's not to the degree that the president so someone like Hillary she was already Secretary of State she already knew pretty much most things yeah yeah she had she was you know very switched on very informed you know she was just an awful candidate yeah sorry I you know so I I think that look I there's certain things that this administration is doing foreign policy-wise that I think of good it makes sense there are other things that I think you know you just leave you scratching your head but that's like every administration I guess my point is we've gotten away from that ability right I have conversations I go out to dinner with folks that you know on the on the on the hard left and when you talk to them they fully believe fully believe that President Trump is a Russian puppet a witting asset of Putin who is just doing Putin spitting and they honestly honestly believe that and nothing is going to shift them off that position when you have a you know that sort of frame of reference you don't have the ability to look at anything rationally and say yeah okay I like this policy related to China it's about time we call them out and say that you obviously have not been a fair trading partner right that's something that every administration has agreed to but has never done anything about so you would think that everybody would be able to say hmm makes sense yeah I like it everybody should be able to say the immigration you know system here in the in the States is somewhat dysfunctional it needs fixing everybody's talked about that and yet they can't do it because they've got this this mindset that that prevents them from having any sort of conversation any sort of rational discussion that could lead to some compromise that could then advance the ball and make this government more functional so so where we're at right now is today is day water the shutdown 26th I thinks that would just be so eight hundred thousand American workers that work for the government are not getting paid so there are a month out many of these people paycheck to paycheck they'd only have medical necessities they don't have food people who are having to ration off their their their insulin if they're diabetic I mean I'm hearing these horror stories the lines at the airport or around the fuckin block it's it's chaos and it seems like there's no end in sight and it seems like Trump is just content to just hold this position I think both sides are content to hold their position that seems fucking crazy to me it is crazy it's it's absolutely crazy to think about and it's not just 800,000 I don't know the exact numbers but think about all the the contractors they met all the government contractors right and so this has and and you know the administration has admitted that look we initially underestimated the impact of a long-term shutdown and so they understand that and the Democrats you know talk about it every minute about how this is a terrible crisis and so you would think that if both sides feel that way then get something done looked at the Democrats did they've approved in the past recent past many these Democrats voted for fencing barriers whatever you want to call it yeah but we're lost in semantics and because the president's so hated by this you know this is this group that you know they've seized on this term wall if he had started his campaign by saying we need to improve our border security and find fixes to an immigration system that is both fair and secure and efficient if he had gone with that it's a wordy bumper sticker but if he had gone with that we'd have a different conversation right now we would but maybe would have a different president as well yeah that's okay that's a good point you know I something about that build that wall that's like the dopes are like yeah whoa I get it yeah it's a wall still simple build a wall oh yeah like a castle yeah build a wall yeah and it seems so it's it's such a visual no you're right that's and that's you know that's where I miss out I yeah I'm Way off on and when terms of being clever about politics but I think that well had a rope in rubes yeah yeah I should I should get better at this yeah seems like but he's got that down yeah boy I I didn't even know the people that voted for him the people that are like real Magus supporters I didn't even know they existed in the numbers they exist it's like he uncovered a rock like he flipped a rock over and there was an ant colony of rubes in there and just sheer numbers it's like whoa it's right it's mixed bag you've got a lot of people very you know because it's I don't buy the idea that it's all just a bunch of you know crackers or idiots no it's a it's a it's a real range of people there's there's that group of people that were just tired of being told they're idiots Yeah right and they came out in force right you can't tell you can't talk down to people this is for the Democrats you can't keep talking down to people and expect at some point then I got to punch you in the nose right well they're still doing that now and they're still there was some congressman recently that was talking about all the people that supported Trump and he was talking about them all being losers and alcoholics yeah yeah illiterate and like man you're talking about half the country right and no lesson learned right no absolutely no self-awareness and and that's you know that's the story of you know every election I think going forward is you know you've got the urban centers and you've got everybody else and everybody else feels as if they're getting kicked in the ass and so I but but yeah at the same time you think what we should be able to do better right we should i I again certain policies that they've got great but every day another you know tweet that seems a little dysfunctional everyday you know some misstep every day some self-inflicted wound shouldn't happen not in the country this size not not where we've got this much talent and skill and capability so I don't know what 2020 is gonna bring but it's it we gotta we're in for a hell of a ride between I'm you know look at all the shit that's happening yeah this seems like it might be one of the bigger moves on the chessboard though this government shutdown like how this gets resolved one way or another and who comes out at least the the visual is the optics are that they're the winner yeah it's it seems very critical because if the Democrats win and somehow or another he abandons his idea for a wall abandons the billions of dollars that he's been asking for for this wall that gives them momentum we kicked his ass with that wall and we're gonna kick his ass and 2020 that's exactly what they think that is that is exactly what they're discussing in the war room with Nancy Pelosi keeps them all in lockstep and she's done a good job so far of keeping the Dems in line and that's why they wanted her back in at least the old guard wanted them back in because that's what she does well aside from fundraising so I you know I have a feeling that look he's asking for whatever 5.7 billion dollars in the scheme of things that's a drop in the bucket Schumer and Pelosi and a wide variety of other people including the previous president have all voted in the past for additional funding for border security including fencing in barriers but they are they're not gonna budge off of this so what the hell does that mean does that mean he's he's being pushed into a corner where he has no option but to declare a national emergency use funds elsewhere so that he can say I finally got it and look the dams didn't do anything who knows but you're I think you're absolutely right whoever's perceived as the winner out of this you know ridiculous situation yeah they're gonna beat that drum all the way to 2020 one of the things they've been saying to about the wall is that they want to keep drugs from coming in illegal drugs but from this El Chapo trial we're learning how the biggest drug dealer in Mexico got his drugs in they didn't use they didn't get it through the wall they brought it in through mostly boats yeah it's usually not just mules you know individuals carting it across some you know broken part of the of the border they brought it on through cars and hidden compartments they brought it in through boats I mean they're there you know they basically have some people spilling the beans as to how the exact operation was was functional yeah that didn't seem to involve people carrying it over the border on backpacks and now now one of Guzman El Chapo's lieutenants is as cooperating witness yeah and he's now he's now claiming that the former president in Mexico Pina Neto was given a hundred million dollars at the outset of his term I think was 2012 when he started as president so when he was president-elect he'd already won but he was waiting to take the seat according to this this Colombian trafficker who was working with Guzman with Chapel pinion ëtil reached out to him possibly there was campaign manager who however the story goes my friend yeah and he asked for 250 million hmm and Chapel you know came back with a negotiated position and says 100 million which was then according to this again the guys at Colombian trafficker you know how legitimate is he you know then you know the money was transferred to pinion net dough and you know opinion Eddowes people are saying that's ridiculous look we were the ones who tracked him down you know even though he escaped you know 48 times or whatever he escaped and then but there's always been this this talk about how Chapo's arrests were orchestrated right but and that so that they the military the police were involved somehow that there was a coordinated effort and there's always been that The Lying rumor you know is it possible anything's possible but if he did get a hundred million dollars you would think El Chapo would be free Jesus Christ 100 million dollars get you free right right yeah I know and you would yeah you would assume that you know what's the upside for Chapel to not talk about it now right you know but you know who knows it's it's a president to me where is he it doesn't have tax returns they could look at they've moved it just moved it offshore immediately apparently was according to this witness or to this cooperating a witness he the money was delivered this may be the the the part of the story that doesn't hold up it was delivered to his campaign plane or something and this campaign manager you know took control of it and then they whisked it away and whether you know a hole in the ground somewhere yeah takes out a little at a time yeah no I was looking at that what's that crazy lady's name Laura Loomer lady Nancy Pelosi's fence oh yeah she camped out on her yard you know what made me think how Fox Nancy Pelosi owned that house where's she getting all that cash yeah what's her net worth now a couple hundred million really I forget for me to do what is she in business she came from a hardcore political family in Baltimore I think and there's so much dirty money yeah she's been doing she's what 100 million I was way less she's worth a hundred million estimated but that's like I don't know if it's one of those online that would get their money from you maybe she you know what maybe she's good at just crunching keeping her per diem yeah well I mean what is a wizard national salary well she just started getting it for this job wouldn't it be 450 grand Wow no no that's that's the net worth of fire rich net worth or a median net worth now ever since okay Congress person so it can't be anything higher than an sis something so it's probably not more than 180 it's all her good work she did with the Clinton Foundation Oh Speaker of the House gets two hundred twenty three thousand two hundred grand she's worth a hundred million dollars what in the hole fuck is that how's that and she does have a big wall around it place yeah not enough to keep Laurel or Loomis not an athlete right over that son of this knowledge he's a parkour athlete she show up with some illegals immigrants or whatever undocumented workers whatever she use she chained herself to Twitter I know she did that to that broad that's right she's going hard for attention it's it's very interesting when these these people just try so hard to make it into the news yeah well they're looking for a contributor slot they're looking for an on one network or another I think that's what they're doing they do you have to nowadays I think that that I think at least my theory is anyway if you want to be a paid contributor for a network nodes own about which network you got a stake out of position that involves some crazy right you've got to be like you either get be all in for President Trump or you've got to be all out yeah you if you live in the center that ain't happening nobody wants to hear from anybody in the middle because that shit's not picking up the ratings at all no no one wants reasonable middle right now no no the only time that I think reasonable middle would ever work out is if the two ends are so fucked up and they're fighting so hard on the opposite ends like someone's like God surely it's got to be a reasonable middle and then someone comes along it's almost like the people you've got to be screaming for it right now it doesn't seem like people are coming for a centrist position it's like World War one trench warfare that's the way this with the government shutdown right now yeah no Pelosi sitting over here in the mud the president Trump sitting over here in the mud and nobody's given any ground and they're just they're just occasionally taking a shot at each other throwing a hand grenade and nobody is making any any movement so I you know again how do they shut the air how do they stop this shutdown you can't if you're not talking if you're not if there's if there's no effort you it's not gonna happen so everybody's looking at this right now I'm thinking you know where is it go it's affecting the markets it makes us look like morons I mean not that others aren't I mean look at look at Britain alright with the types of thing look at France with the the yellow vests look at you know Germany's having its issues you know everybody's having some some problems but you know we didn't need to add to the noise john stossel had an interesting video that he put out where he's saying what this does actually highlight is that there's a lot of things that the government does it really should probably be privatized and we wouldn't have these issues yeah I mean you gotta made sense to me but I don't know a lot ya know I'm a small government person at the end of the day I think you know there's certain things that we need to rely on the government for and one of them would be of course national security terrific you know collection of federal taxes okay fine that they're gonna do that regardless but otherwise just stay out of my kitchen I don't don't you know and so and that's why I've always been surprised me the Republicans problem I got with them is you know you can't sit around and argue for small government and then try to tell people what to do with their bodies or who can get married and who can't get married who the fuck cares I just don't hurt people be a good person get on with it I don't need to celebrate your lifestyle but just do it I really don't care I don't expect you to care about my lifestyle I don't care about yours but the Republicans have always stuck their nose in this and you can't make that argument for for wanting small government and you know if you just want to step into people's bedrooms all the time yeah it doesn't make any sense and I think the only reason why they do it is because it gets people excited that they get to run to vote for them I think when they take these positions it's not like these are really having an effect on their lives or it's some moral stand that they must take because God wants him to do it I think they do it because they think that it's gonna get and it's going to shift the pole one way or another yeah and it's gonna get people excited about them possibly making some sort of a difference that they feel is going to significantly affect their position but do you ever get to the point I mean I don't know what whether that's gonna happen but you would think that you you've got the people on the hard right and the hard left they're not gonna shift right that's not gonna happen you're not gonna move those people so like everybody always talks about decisions are made by that small group in the center mm-hmm so a what point to the group in the center finally put their hands up and go you guys are all fucked up right how about a third party that's legitimate not a libertarian party because it hasn't been working out but something that creates a little bit of a different dynamic and when ever gonna get term limits so that's you know tilting at windmills but maybe you know maybe we get that multiparty thing going that again okay it's pie-in-the-sky will trap closes whoever got sit was Ross Perot right yeah pretty much yeah yeah he was but I don't know he took out a whole he took a block of time I believe was a half an hour on national television he bought the time yeah to explain how you're getting fucked yeah explain taxes and explain all these different things and and people like wait what that's how it works it's good TV if you can go back and find that it's gets Ross Perot was good TV I'll show you what I'm doing here see that's all that's all fucked up and here's really fun yeah shit hey we talked about remember less than we talked about hallway yes it hasn't gone away no it hasn't gotten away sees someone just got arrested yesterday two people yeah two people so so backstory fascinating this is a fascinating is an area I could definitely disappear down to Chinese SP to us right yeah they going on forever one again I I say you know I talk about our there's certain things that the current administration's doing that I like one of them is the way that they're dealing with China right now and yes the trade issue is buffeting the markets somewhat and causing some instability but again the previous administration the Bush administration clinton istration lots of lots of former presidents but they all acknowledged that china you know privately was not a fair trading partner this administration's at least trying to call them out and calling them out on that only in the cyber issue too on their on their theft of intellectual property so anyway Huawei supposedly owned by the founder and however many employees you know I think hawai way is by the way the number one telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world and they're the number two seller of smartphones right they there are bigger seller of smartphones and Apple so it's samsung qua way Apple for this and so supposedly the company's owned by the founder and his daughter is the chief operating officer chief financial officer she was arrested up in Canada and she was arrested at the request of the US she's up there on bail right now waiting extradition hearing and the reason was because supposedly she lied about Huawei's dealings with Iran and they were busting sanctions by dealing and providing certain types of equipment to Iran now this this past week we've had a hallway employee who's now been fired by a hallway in Poland arrested for espionage and along with him is a member of the Polish Intelligence Service right who retired and was now working for French telecommunications company but was arrested also for espionage related to kwame and related to this individual who up until just recently was working for wallet Huawei claims innocence and says well we have no idea and the founder just came out and gave this big speech and said I would never let the Chinese authorities tell me what to do and I would certainly never spy on anybody using hallways capabilities and technology and people are probably thinking what the fuck are you talking about this for Huawei embeds their telecommunications equipment throughout the world right so it's in our allies military operations which then are connected to ours right in terms of communications and transfer of intelligence and information they're everywhere and they chose Poland they've been in Poland for about 10 years Poland is a very important NATO ally so I'm taking a long time I realize to explain this but what I'm trying to say is nothing happens by happenstance the Chinese don't operate that way so the Chinese authorities some time ago years ago looked at it invent yeah this makes sense right we've got Huawei which by the way the founder is a former military People's Liberation Army engineer he they they looked at this and they thought Poland that would be a good beachhead for us right because they're a key element of NATO so let's go to Poland so they started burrowing into Poland striking deals and you know they're basically the most important for in relationship now corporation inside a Poland and they're fully embedded and they've had access to at this point to NATO communications and now the arrests of these two individuals and people will still despite this and despite their past despite their their their theft of information from everybody from US Steel to to Alcoa to Lockheed Martin to DuPont all the times they've been stealing information people will still go why I don't you know I don't I don't believe it I don't that doesn't make any sense I don't see why the Chinese would act that way and I don't see why we're being so harsh on them you know this tariff thing is a bad idea my point being you got to call them out they're not going to necessarily change their behavior but you gotta raise public awareness make our allies understand and well that's what we're doing right now we're saying you've got it you got to put the brakes on this build a firewall use the other companies telecommunications equipment because you know the fact that we're tied in with our allies with Poland and with Canada and was you know that gives them access to us so for someone on the outside like myself who's trying to look at this and you say that Huawei is stealing stuff like stealing stuff from us deal how are they doing that well they I mean the US Steel admittedly that was a that was a PLA that was a People's Liberation Army third Department operation against DuPont and and also against US Steel and others so that was a little bit different i conflated that - but Huawei one of the things that they do is by having access and and embedding their equipment in your communications infrastructure that gives them the ability then to in a simple way to tap in right in a packet intercept information right basically so you have communications imagine we're trading information through NATO channels all right all they need is that one in right that's it's like everything else it's like fishing right it's just like you know when when hackers just an individual hacker sitting in somebody's basement you know he just needs that one Avenue he needs to get one just just click on that email that gives me the pathway in so when when Huawei is able to embed their technology into you know polish communications and we're now connected because of our NATO alliance that gives him access to us to France to whomever and you know it's not as if it just happened it's not as if Huawei from a business perspective said you know I bet we could sell some of our equipment in Poland wouldn't that be good the guy who was arrested the Huawei person who was arrested was responsible for the provision of telecommunications equipment to government facilities that was his job hmm and the guy the Polish guy one of his last jobs with the Intel service was communications and I mean so I guess what I'm saying is none of this shit happens in a bubble and it's all it's all very well mapped out the Chinese have a very long view on things and they are very good at developing operations like this and so they've been very successful so we'll see but it's it's I'm glad that the current administration at least is calling them out I don't believe it's necessarily gonna change their behavior you know and we'll probably get some sort of deal where they'll claimed look just a couple years ago they agree with President Obama to stop their cyber shenanigans and they didn't so they just changed the way that they did it you know that's that's the world we live in but I think it is important to make a stand right yeah there's some of the tech people are saying that they think it's preposterous when they were talking about the ban on Android phones some of the tech people say that doesn't make any sense but what you're saying is it goes far beyond the actual phones itself and it's really the the mission of the actual company itself yeah I'm saying that that there is no way that Huawei and other important Chinese companies are solely privately owned and or have the ability to tell the Chinese authorities that they will not spy on their behalf it's just not happening it's just not happening you have to you have to go a long ways to come up with that sort of naive viewpoint that says that a Chinese company is going to put its foot down and tell President Xi absolutely not we will not do anything to harm another nations country our company force yet they've spent they've spent generations now decade jump-starting their industry and moving up the food chain on the global economy by hoovering up everything possible out there so if someone like a tech wizard got ahold of one of their routers can have they'd been able to detect something in there that doesn't belong or some sort of a backdoor or some sort of a way that they could tap in it's like if you were you know you were Apple and you were sending you know data to Raytheon or whatever and you're going back and forth they could tap in through that has it been proven that there's a device like that yeah a former NSA director McConnell back in 2015 I think early 2015 came out and NSA came out with an official statement it said every major u.s. corporation of any consequence has been attacked and exploited by Chinese and we have never ever not found Chinese malware within their systems Wow that was ever four years ago now we're being software right right right is there anything in the hardware itself yes in in a sense that yes in in the sense of like trying to remember that the name of it but not doing a very good job if you have access to or understanding of physical Hardware then you can affect easier you can affect physical control of systems right so Stuxnet remember I know if you remember Stuxnet was exact it was an attack on Iran to shut down their nuclear program right exactly - essentially what it did was it took over control of some centrifuges over spun them the heat broke and it was known virus and it was it was an energy software that was able to impact the the you know physical equipment it took control of those systems because in part whoever perpetrated it had much better understanding of that gear right or had access to that gear and that's a that's an important part of this and it's happened several times since then and you know I'm not disclosing anything because it's all it's been written about I'm sure it'll be a movie at some point but that is that's a concern I'm far more worried about a company like Huawei with its integration into Allied our allies telecommunications systems then I am about sort of the individual sale of phones and you know what that means said look you know Amazon and all the others are gathering more data on the average American then you know the US government or anybody else's government is doing at this point let me ask you this because this is something that just came up and we were trying to figure out it's nonsense or not my friend Adam was here the other day and we're talking about Toyota trucks and he didn't Google Toyota trucks just discussing it and he said since then his mentions have been filled with these little advertisements for Toyota trucks how does that work well you know how you talk to Siri yes yeah it's it's simple voice recognition it's it's a carryover from the old days of you know optical readers and how you know we all thought it was incredible that you could take a piece of paper put it into a system and it would like take that information that was on that piece of paper and now it was on a database that you could access and manipulate right and so you know voice recognition is no different and sense that so if if if for example if I had this switched on and it happens to people I'm sure all the time walking around their house they'll say something and all of a sudden Alexa will come on and go oh I couldn't find a result for that but do you want to listen to Ella Fitzgerald or whatever it's it's always on it's always listening right and you can do that with anything like this TV right here if you wanted to if you if I knew that TV was gonna go into the office of the deputy foreign minister of a country hostile to our interests I could turn that thing into a receiver obviously right right and if I could get my hands on that before delivery that's a wonderful thing now I've got this in there and it's like the old days when you would have to you know go in on an entry operation and you know you silent drills and put a you know device in the wall now you know we've delivered a TV now I get I get no video - hey good for me so that shit's always on you know in a sense and so a regular phone that you get if you just buy an iPhone and you have Siri turned on so you could say hey Siri and it turns on that phone is always listening to you well then now we're getting in over my head but it could be I mean it is is it possible is it capable of doing that yes could you do that as an intentional operation sure is it happening because Apple wants to do it and they want to get better understanding of consumer preferences and things I have no idea that's that's above my pay grade but I die will say from an operational perspective sure yeah you from an operational perspective right but like it would kind of be scandalous if we found out that apples listen to everything that you say and then they're sending them information to these companies and then they're trying to sell you whatever you were bringing out yeah but it's one it's really if you think about it's only one step above what they do anyway we're just I mean if I go in here and I search Toyota right yeah I mean I'm in the same situation I'm fucking inundated with Toyota mentions right afterwards so you know it's it's like the next iteration of that and I suspect that people would you know some folks would be outraged but I'll bet people would just live with it yeah right we seem to be willing to give up a lot of shit you know as long as we don't think that government's doing it right right if it's if it's Google if it's Google and somebody we seem to be fine with it but if it's a fucking if it's that NSA then our best but that's not who's fucking making jack off of these things right right so it's Amazon and angle and all these companies that are using it to sell your data to make a lot of money anyway what do you got Jamie senators call for investigation of t-mobile Sprint Verizon AT&T for selling location data hmm phone companies know where you are lawmakers want them to stop selling that information so they could figure out how to tax it yeah that seems but what do they sell on that location data for they want to know how many people in certain area telling you where anyone could you can buy that information and find anybody's location right but look they do these things now where there's their you know a billboards they'll put a billboard up in a square right and you'll walk by and the Billboard has the ability to see where the eyeballs are right one so you'll look and they'll say oh yeah it's looking at me that billboards looking at me so that's a success right I've scored a hit view you know and that was the old days it was like you know how you know how many clicks or how many got a camera there's a there's a ability for that billboard to sense and again this I go overboard if I start talking technical and someone will call me out and say well it's not exactly how it works but in simplistic terms yeah it's it's an ability to monitor pedestrian traffic to understand you know people's interests and to further refine so that they can sell a shit better Mike your outdoor advertising interactive this is putting your phone directly up to it this is like you committing that there but there is also what he's talking about to this huh this guy's talking about what's his name again okay so this you walk up to a phone that's in the photo you hold your phone up to it it sends a signal to your phone it seems like it's always Samsung knows it only Samsung phones maybe there's a galaxy add this app yeah I have a song for you these are galaxy ads huh but if you can do a one-way transaction that transaction can be two away instantly obviously right it has to be to some degree because there has to be an exchange of of you know sort of a handshake so I didn't know that billboards are staring at you though ya know it's it's a new pretty crazy shit look I mean this you can tracking now understanding where people are right as an example you know you used to be putting a beacon right investigations you know you put a beacon on a car right and you and it was a little clumsy but it got better and better as you go along you know now it's now it's it's it's it's pretty remarkable but you can also think about the electronics that exist in a current vehicle in a new vehicle you can every one of those has a unique signature so whether it's the tire pressure indicators you know how you get in your car and it says your left front tire is low well that's a particular signal if I know that signal for that car I'll bet I can find that car right and it's like it's the same with all the other electronics that exist within a vehicle at war just in the shit that we carry around they've all got some kind of signature so I but again I think you know most people are willing to give up a surprising amount of privacy for whatever reason maybe because they're getting accustomed to it and they're not shocked by shit anymore hey Jamie what were you saying today that somebody made a slip-up about phone calls that the thing you were saying about the different data that they've collected you were just telling me before the show about the with the some investigation that what was it that the thing I was just talking about we said find anybody's phone no you were saying that through the emails and phone phone calls the guy had fucked up by saying phone calls I got a lot of shit on my mind to bring now I'm still thinking about that hallway thing ya know we were talking about right before if you remember no big deal I think it had something to do with the mule investigation yeah yeah what do you think when's that gonna end fuck that guy is that me did he would scare the shit out of me if he was looking at my life cuz it seems like that guy takes his time yeah about two years at worth the time yeah the one thing I've got remember it was the national security advisory on CNN last night he was talking about the bill Barr is the access to information he would already have and and also be gaining I guess by becoming the Attorney General they were discussing whether he will share all the information coming out they wanted him to commit to doing that and he was sort of saying I can't commit because I don't know what's in there yet and they were just sort of like giving their both their sides I'm like what he could know what he would know what he will know and that's all I was sort of saying and he sort of cut himself off of sharing about how much information this guy might have access to it sort of it seemed like it mm-hmm and he was the former national security adviser I believe yeah that was so one of the things that everybody was scared of was that the NSA was building some gigantic place somewhere outside of Salt Lake where they would store every single phone call that you ever made in every single email yeah that's that there was that whole stink at one point about what they were actually holding on to the collection of information and there was some misreporting about how they've actually got your phone calls what they've got is they've got number and duration of call right I mean that's that's the key pieces of information that they've got good day at some point you know suddenly decide you're a target of interest and so we won't we will start collecting on your calls yeah but was the NSA gathering everybody's phone conversations no it used to be a thing that you would have to wiretap somebody like if you're going after the mob they had a data install a bug but they don't have to do that anymore no oh no no no no technology now is I mean I remember the old days of operations right I mean if we wanted to wear overseas its compounded incredibly it's made really difficult to do observation posts and listening post and everything overseas right because it's not your turf and so you got to come up with a like an airtight plan but it was the same way you still had to get physical access right to phone lines that yet to clip off and you had to you know then you had to figure out where am I putting the gear where am I gonna put the batteries how am I gonna store this shit and then then you gotta listen to it right then you got it and it is you start what happens it starts collecting like this you start getting mountains of tapes right and yeah and you're not getting the real time which is a problem but nowadays now it's entirely different but I think you know if if we if we look at today's concerns right if we look at what are people worried about what should they be worried about I know that privacy always comes up people always talk about it and I guess I keep going back to my same point which was I I don't see people like with pitchforks and and you know the torches going down to you know complain to Jeff Bezos that right you know Amazon's collecting massive amounts of data or you know t-mobile and Sprint and all these are mapping our locations as we move around I just don't see it I mean that probably raised nobody's interest for the most part you know article that you just pulled up and I you know I guess in part it's because again we become kind of used to it become he hasn't do it so so fine but you know what should we be worried about well I tell you what we should boy word up mostly is state-sponsored activity by countries whose interests almost never align with ours now what include China certainly includes Russia whose Iran the shit that they're doing China has a policy information domination right which means they've determined that the next war the next modern large-scale war is going to be won by whoever has control over information so where are they putting all the resources China knows that they're not gonna build a military that's going to be able to reach around the globe for the most part although they're you know they're beefing up the resources what are they doing it's cyber and it's space right so I know a lot of people we're kicking the president in the ass and laughing about the space force because it is funny right but the uniforms would be amazing but they they talk about this but China honestly believes and it's putting their resources into cyber into space and what does that mean well if they're anti satellite technology that they've been developing and working on and continue to work on the whole point of that is to take control of communications and surveillance abilities whether it's ours or our allies in the event of something major that happens so they would have the ability to shut off our sound yes now and if you do that then what does that mean well it means you're blind right and well suddenly walking around with compasses and maps you know trying to shoot an azimuth and figure out where the hell you know the target is so China is currently developing that or they have developed something that doesn't work now yeah they're working on it now that they develop some of it they're working to get the next generation it's like every nation that has the resources and ability understands that and is doing the same it's not like we're not right what what is their excuse as they should be they don't have an excuse they just they understand their they have the right to do it I mean it's not like they they you know right as long as they don't use it right in an illegal way they have the right to develop the Technic there's no treaty that says you can't develop anti satellite technology right there's the start treaties there's the nuclear you know conventions that we have with Russia which isn't another interesting topic because we're right now arguing with the Russians over over the the latest nuke agreement that took place some time ago it's coming up for renewal sometime soon a year or two years from now and the Russians have been cheating on a previous agreement and so we're you know now they try to say we're cheating on the new one and so that's an interesting thing to be watching but the point being is that you know the there's conventions that try to you know control the the numbers for warheads or for delivery mechanisms missiles or submarines or whatever bombers but not for this new world cyber space the Pentagon's still trying to figure out what you know war means in cyberspace you know how do you respond what what what's the threshold you know and then what's an appropriate response and so well maybe we'll get there maybe we'll start having these discussions and create treaties that will allow that but right now from China's perspective again not to beat on China but I'm much more concerned about China for our national security they're a much bigger concern than Russia is Russia's punching above its weight and Putin's you know Putin's a dick no doubt about it right and they've doing what they always do which is metal and democracy that's been their methodology for ever since they've been around yeah but you know that that's small potatoes they got the GDP of a small European country you know and when the oil prices you know are in the toilet they really are sucking wind so yeah we got to be concerned with Russia and understand that their interests are never aligned with ours you know for the most part maybe we tried to imagine they were with Syria and Isis and everything but Russia's only interested air was maintaining their leverage and increasing it and not not losing their military foothold there that was their primary interest we mirror our values and we mirror our interests on other countries and so we imagined it somehow we're all in this fight against Isis together yeah horseshit you know so so China is a much bigger issue and we and we should be focused on that and to some degree this administration is so that's where I say look you can't just keep complaining and bitching and moaning because you don't like President Trump there's certain things that are going on that you should be willing to say that okay that makes sense maybe I don't like the messenger but that part of it makes sense is it his personal life I mean is it because of his dealings with China from the business world that he understands it better that he's more concerned with the imbalance of the the trade I think what happened was what do I know and this is speculation so hey but I suspect that what happened was he came into it focused on the trade imbalance right and as he was sitting there and talking about the trade imbalance more of the conversation from the National Security Council and from the agency and others in terms of saying well yeah this is part of the reason why and this is the long-term effects of their theft of intellectual property this is why in part they've been successful in these areas so I think there was probably more and more discussion talking about their economic espionage and theft of IP and that became then an issue for him but I think initially and still to this day I think the big issue is just he wants to try to create a win in terms of the trade imbalance Russia seems to us here domestically Lee speaking from for myself when when I think about it and I think about the the narrative that's been sort of delivered to us that Russia is this military danger we're worried about Putin taking over other countries were worried about Putin's power the way he kills dissidents the way he kills political opponents and journalists we think about China and even with the Huawei arrests we're like no one seems to be concerned it doesn't seem to light any bulbs over here yeah no you're right I don't know why that is except you know Putin's more like a thug you know he's a visual right right and also I mean look he's he's been very clear about you know wanting to try to rebuild the Soviet Union so whether it's Crimea and the annexation of that or whether taking over eastern Ukraine and you know or maintaining a position in Georgia whatever it is he you know certainly you know his attacks or the FSB s attacks overseas against you know dissidents and others yeah he's just more in-your-face he's like Tony Soprano right and so you can look at that China has always been you know sort of this thing right and China's fantastic the history is amazing you know the places are incredible III think it's you know we should be trading with China we should be doing a huge amount of business with China we should you know clear the text and try to degree we can level the playing field but we should also be pragmatic and realize what they do you know in terms of their their theft of IP and so you know because that again I probably won't change but yeah we absolutely should be dealing with China all the time but I think that they've always kind of been viewed more and more of a sophisticated fashion maybe because Putin is just sort of in-your-face and he's you know he's good at it he's very successful he's a smart son of a bitch but he's I think he's pretty easy to read right he's thuggish and he you know he longs for those days of the Soviet Union so we should understand that everything he does is because of that it's because he's he he would love to rebuild the Soviet Union and so we shouldn't be surprised by any sort of you know aggressive move that he makes against his his neighbors and we should always push back and to be fair this administration not to beat their drum but the actions they've taken against Russia despite the fact that you've got people calling him a puppet of Putin are more significant than the previous administration took look what has he done the sanctions against you know key individuals and companies within Russia as an example those are the toughest sanctions you know have been placed on Russia ever the provision of weapons and an assistance to the Ukrainians all right that was some of the previous administration said no not gonna do that you know because we don't we don't want any blowback that's that's a good thing right that should be done pushing back against them on the on the 2011 nuke deal right and or sorry on the under the previous on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal and calling them out and saying look you're cheating on this and you you know you got to be held accountable I mean there's certain things there that that may sense then that don't add up if you talk to somebody who says well he's an absolute puppet you say well okay he's a puppet so why or is he doing certain things that seem counter to Russian interests and they'll say well because he's smart and he's like you just want to get caught out I see its he's playing he's playing a long game here and and I'm thinking okay maybe maybe who knows but I haven't I haven't strapped on my tinfoil hat yet to get to that point so I don't know yeah that seems they're complicated one if they have some compromising information about that was always the fear right is that they knew something or yeah maybe it was business dealings maybe it was people peeing on them or yeah okay if that if they had if they did not and again anything in today's world anything's possible right right and I wish we had somebody else in there who was more elegant and eloquent and sophisticated there's anybody not right now no I don't think anybody's gonna challenge him from the Republican side and on the Democratic side I think they're gonna get eighteen or twenty you know potential candidates in there and end up beating their own and so it could be it could be a real you know slugfest and turn each other as they're trying to establish someone who's a viable candidate kind of like what the Republicans did right he ended up with you know we ended up with President Trump and you know the Democrats if they're not careful you can end up with the same thing look they're talking about Joe Biden I tobin's an excellent cat rice 150 years old hundred fifty years old and he lost twice before yeah but everybody loves the person that's on the bench right right until they get in the game and so you know who knows where they're gonna go with that but you know could they had this idea that they've got compromising information on them here's here's what I think is that if Muller has figured this out right and it's been quiet about it and they then the most remarkable thing about this investigation will be that nobody leaked because you can't keep a secret in Washington and so the fact that for two years now we don't have like that that that bullet you know that they think they're going to come up with at some point my inclination is to think that you know mullahs gonna finish this investigation issue some findings and nobody's going to be happy because there won't be a bullet and so the left won't be happy the right won't be happy because he'll still be pointing out the fact that there was you know a lot of you know stupid moves on the campaigns part and that there was inappropriate activity by you know people like manna fort and others but do I think there's gonna be some smoking gun I don't I don't think so because and my reason for saying that is because I've never known Washington not be able to keep our - to be able to keep a secret right this is one like new or ever done one of these things before though he seems uniquely calculated yeah he's done this before and and he has he said look he's a very smart guy and a very seasoned operator investigator and he's got good people working for him and it's absolutely correct to let him go with this and just let him finish it up right but when is that gonna be who knows right nobody we have they've been talking about all he's gonna wrap it up next week he's gonna wrap it up this week he's gonna know he's not you know he'll you know you think he's gonna wrap it up who knows hey this guy this literally could go on to into it's gonna have to end before probably end of this year I don't think even he's gonna want to for political calculations let it go into too close to 2020 in the election right so regardless even though I don't think he's a big ly political individual I think he's gonna see that the wisdom of wrapping it up before then and then letting the chips fall wherever they do what's astonishing to me is how anytime something does come out on Trump it just seems to slide right off yeah yeah well that is true that is raising because I think what's happening is they're just throwing everything out there every day right yeah and it much like you know our willingness to give up privacy because we keep hearing about another hack or another leak or we know that Amazon is doing this or that I think you know it's that constant drumbeat and that mudslinging and I think the Dems haven't done themselves any favors or the resistance movement or whatever we want to call it because I think people are just immune to it and it's hardened the Trump's base to think you know he's under attack every minute well oh I gotta support him harder yeah yeah but you know who do you think's gonna end up in in the race I mean who's got the best chance it's a good question I mean on the left-hand side my real fear is that Hilary's gonna run again so I I almost did what those TV spit takes it's possible it lady is crazy you know one of the things that she said in one of the more recent interviews she said I'd like to be President I'd like to be president just what do you want to put it on your resume yeah what the fuck does that mean I think I could do a great job in turning this country around I have the leadership ability to really affect a change no no I'd like to be lousy president yeah I got some time I could do that I'm scared of them yeah well you know what and you're right she may but III do think there's gonna be so much pressure on her from the party then just say no you can't I think she's gonna look at that and go there's no chance I can rally the apparatus around me like I did the last time and because of that because even she can't run without the Machine right I mean that's they've got to figure that out so I just wonder if she has so many people that owe her favors and she's so deeply entrenched in the world that she could somehow another muster up enough support to give it one more shot yeah I mean it's it's possible I mean yeah but then what you're talking about hurried all the way to - what - you to Kamala Harris Cory Booker Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi Gabbard Tony Castro the veteran young makes a lot of sense very smart and articulate I think she has a real legitimate chance of getting people excited about a real future yeah yeah I would not you know I think it's it's time we're certainly close we're getting to that point where we'll you know we end up with a female president and hey good for us right I got no problems you know there's there's I think it would actually you know I think it would turn the ship in a nice direction right as long as the policies are good I don't care who it is as long as we're not you know veering off into you know sort of socialist policy you know and and thinking somehow we're gonna all going to end up with universal basic income you know I've got a guy coming on talking about that Andrew yang wants a described universal basic income and what the benefits would be yeah the reason being that they're worried Automation is going to kill a gigantic percentage of jobs in in manufacturing fast food a medical field the trucks all these different things that universal basic income might actually be something that we need at certain point in time because so many jobs will go away and go away so rapidly do you think that kills motivation that's a good question what I thought was maybe but maybe if the motivation is not just to survive but the motivation to succeed and do well it would get people to do what they actually want to do for a living or chase down what they actually want to do and get them motivated to have a better life not just motivated to live follow their passion yes it's it's hard because when you give people things for nothing right you generally do kill their motivation I mean you look neat look no further than trust fund kids right right yeah I think that's a great example most people will go towards you know welfare but I think you're right on the other end of the spectrum to me trust fund kids I've seen this listless way they approach life you know they just laze a fair just I just think that it's really hard for people to want something better when they have enough they're good yeah everything is good they don't have to do anything and you don't have to motivate yourself to do anything to get that money yeah I don't understand the the logistics behind it you know in terms of how it gets paid the actual numbers like that yeah but the part that worries me is this issue of motivation yeah and ensuring that then you know everybody's willing to unasked the sofa and and do something productive right and it's not just we can't be like a nation of people following their passion because their passion is is completely on for not obeying yeah Oh ever made um dream catchers pottery love pottery love dream catchers - I got one in my truck and no what are you doing I got a hula girl on the dashboard of my truck which is getting a new engine by the way even as we speak and the trucks can ya the wagon here it's a Grand Wagoneer they wood panel wagon yeah the last year they made at 91 and it still drive those things yeah absolutely it's a great car and and but I have to rebuild even when I get something that works good one this thing is great look that the the kids can climb all around it I Drive to the drive-in theater and they can they put a magnum back either yeah in a 50 watt that the hatchback and they just sit there and they it's blue with a sand interior who decided to go with those wood panels on the side it's fantastic and then how did that how did everybody wake up and decide that that sucks yeah it's a while I tell you something it's a great a great vehicle and it's also nobody gets anywhere near me cuz that fucker is made of all steel yeah yeah they're heavy and that son of a bitch will plow through anything but it's it's just a great car and the dog loves it and I can fit all the fish and I got you put the fishing poles in there it's all good that doesn't mean you have anti-lock brakes does it no no I'm lucky if I if I have brakes but don't you want a car with brakes when you work in security for just long you're like there's no security not the fuck out of here just nice seatbelt doesn't work doesn't and and but I've been meaning to fix it you have a seatbelt it had the receiver is broken and I'm hardware clicks yeah exactly I've been meaning to get that Phil's cars I don't know I've been Bing when you don't have your seat belt on or like no no it doesn't talk to me at all which is pretty you know what else nobody can track me in that car that nobody's dragging me in that son of a bitch so you leave your phone at home and your fucking ghost I'm good man I'm all Fikret boner my boner in there two burner phones come with boners yeah yeah it's it's a great it's a great vehicle like I said my kids love it Muggsy and scooter and Sluggo that's your thing that you got it because you can't track you with it and also they can't let me ask you this this is a tough one I want to ask you to conspiracy ones but this one's a tough one michael hastings do you know his case do you know a story yeah yeah what do you think happened there well let's let's explain what happened what who he was he was a journalist he was embedded in was it in Iraq during the during the war he was writing a story for the role for Rolling Stone and he was writing about which general was it it was done Christmas crystals day on the crystal yeah so he wrote this story and apparently while this happened the Iceland volcano went off so they suspended air travel so he was stuck there far longer than he was supposed to be and people got comfortable with this guy being around right and so they behaved the way they behaved they made some jokes about things he apparently made some jokes about Obama this guy put this Michael Hastings put all this stuff in Rolling Stone it wound up being a huge scandal McChrystal had to step down and there was a lot of people that hated that guy and a lot of people loved McChrystal and he was a highly respected general yeah absolutely he had a step down from his position and next thing you know X amount of time later this guy drives his car 150 miles an hour into a tree it blows up engine goes flying the whole deal the conspiracy theory was that there was a way cuz he had a brand-new Mercedes there was a way that they could take over the controls of your vehicle the acceleration the braking the steering and they could do all this remotely if they put something in your car like we were talking about if you could get a hold of this television you could turn that television to a receiver right do you think that it's possible that someone could have gotten a hold of his car and made him suicide himself two parts to it one is is it possible that you can take control of a vehicle a modern vehicle yes not the woody not the woody as we call it but so yes it's absolutely possible you can take those there's no two ways about celebration steering everything yeah if you've got and and and I mean think about people should think about they think about the the OnStar or think about the ability for your car to send data to the to the vehicle manufacturer right to tell them you know what's going on with your vehicle right that's a that's a handshake operation right once you do that that means there's an exchange of information what does that mean well that means you can access can you access that information sure of course you can does that mean you can then take physical control short that's it's it's an it's just another iteration of the exchange of information right software can take control of physical systems so that yeah so the first part is yes is it possible that that car could have been taken over sure do I think that's what happened I have no idea I really don't of course yeah but it's it's it's certainly a possibility I mean when I hear people talk about you know certain conspiracy theories I look at any go there's just no fucking way that could happen like what one what one do you say no fucking way ah no I have a hard time thinking of one I like the theory that with every burner phone you get a boner that's just I can't imagine that could happen but but it sounds good the burner phone because you're trying to get rid of though I didn't see the owner now I get yeah I got the priorities okay so secretary to get a burner phone - oh man just like Jeff Bezos man he's that's seventy billion dollars down there down the toilet oh yeah that's how did they can his text messages that's a good fuckin cybersecurity yeah they got his text messages to his mistress yeah who knows how that happens unless even maybe she may be meaning missus Bezos maybe she hired a you know some dodgy investigator to come only that you know well I noticed it was an iPhone no fizz's an iPhone and he had an iPad and she had the password to the iPad I could get all those messages now yeah but it's that where they live they live in Washington right state of Washington yeah yeah okay all right so I guess that's communal I think yeah well they started the company together she helped them yeah so that's a wrap hmm but you know whatever 70 billion yeah it's it's rough to give away seventy billion but let's be completely honest if yours if you have seventy billion dollars and you notice whether you have 70 or 100 yes yeah all kind of you might be an asshole yeah yeah that's how you know the difference yeah how the fuck do you even feel it if she takes 70 billion is his lifestyle change yeah cuz you have to get rid of one of those jets like what happened he's got to give up cable does he have a smaller ring for his mistress my mistress apparently they were separated we're not gonna say he's his girlfriend oh jeez really yeah okay so they're saying he was cheating on his wife but he wasn't really because they were they were separated yeah you would think that that's fair game but I'm sure that it's anyway it's gonna be costly she's so hot oh she's so hot who misses Bezos or one the new one oh I think they're friends I think she and my friends and their friends yeah it's all gonna be very messages they fucking circle they know what they're doing Wow with coyotes man no they just take their time patient wolves yeah I think it's interesting because I think he he's changed if you look at Bezos over the years right yeah and you look at the way he is now just his physical appearance no you can you can just tell that money yeah money probably hired a personal trainer no but he's got the money but he buddy's gonna probably have to let him go now 7 billion mark well the smart thing would honestly be to for him to give away half don't even Duke it out with lawyers I'll take too long yeah he has no prenup agreement there's no prenuptial holla it's understood that miss Sanchez is sent text message to a friend showing off her new relationship with the billionaire and the friend sent them to the Enquirer water con you would fucking dumbass oh damn she's hot though she looks like that actress I can't remember her name yeah yeah I can see what she sees at him he said yeah he's is it you know it's the thin neck in Malaysia the large head chicks love that Jeff yourself they love that look yes such a man did he send her like naked selfies - oh no not him - what is that you know why didn't dudes think that women want to look at their junk right I mean I know I just don't I don't get that part I don't get what makes you think unless you've really been drinking that you're gonna go you know what I'll bet she really wants to see my my balls some girls do some girls are crazy I guess damn she said Lauren Sanchez has been romantic relationship with Jeff Bezos she's hot since April 2018 or Sunday long so it's a long-term thing yeah June July that's enough he's probably shot so many loads Wow he's in love now yeah amazing do a Donald Trump had something to say about it what do you say so sorry to hear the news about Jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor who's reporting I understand is far more accurate in the reporting in his lobbyists newspaper the Amazon Washington Post hopefully the paper will soon be placed in a better and more responsible hands yeah he wants he wants he wants her to get it he wants basil's to not have the Washington Post which is highly critical of the president while The Enquirer has been known kill stories critical the president oh so the Enquirer got to hold the story I get it but you know it was I'll bet Jeff Bezos in president's mind I'll bet his his opinion went up when he saw that picture of Sanchez probably yeah I was like what then you probably read the text message like uh amateur yeah come on come on what were you gonna do jump right out of the frying pan get right back into the fire how about you go to fucking Ibiza and those broads take a little time off is what you said Jeff needs a he needs a coach isn't that interesting out dudes deuce and I think but wealthy to it seemed that more than others they seemed to go straight from one relationship immediately into another one yes whereas I think that the average dude I think is doing what you're thinking which is like I'm gonna take some time down well the average dude also isn't running a gigantic multinational corporation like Amazon that is the amount of time that that guy has to dedicate to his job this gotta be just unfathomable I mean I can't imagine what what is involved in that guy's day-to-day activity and he seems ruthless as fuck and very hands-on yeah so he probably doesn't have time to go to Ibiza if the average guy had anywhere close to a hundred billion dollars though oh they just appeal everyday beat strip clubs oh yes cash out - no more showing up at the office cash out - me I wouldn't keep going to me well no you just go I do podcasts I keep shoulder I wouldn't have any ads overheads expensive I need ideas fucking building and airing it's an amazing building by the way Internet thank you have you ever shown I mean if you like displayed it or at the gym you've got is fantastic yeah I said put some pictures of it up but yeah you know what man for me it's important because I'm not busy like Jeff Bezos but I'm fucking busy I need to get all my shit done in one spot so on when I can I come here early a bang out of work out in the morning I get my fucking sauna in float a float octa fold it you got a sauna here yeah I know this I well the tank yeah yeah I got a sauna it's it's for me it's nice I can get everything done in one spot it actually saves me money just because the amount of time that I have yeah but by the way I did not say it at the outset but I should say that show you didn't Boise Boise is in Idaho it's a beautiful place that was fucking brilliant thank you that show was fantastic fun people were talking about that for a lot of long time afterwards it was and it was a great crowd done a giant-ass plays yeah yeah yeah it was fun yeah it was a really good time I miss it for people listening it was a massive it's a Taco Bell Arena which is yeah the best venue in the city it's a big venue and there was lines just blocks and blocks and blocks before they opened the doors and even after they open doors cuz there were so many people Boise is a great town man I was I had heard how good it was that was my first time ever going there and I was blown away the people are super friendly it's gorgeous there everything is clean I don't want to talk about it I don't know anybody to move in people are moving in I think how we talked about that yeah before the show started was a Wall Street Journal wrote an article saying is it some time ago a couple of months ago or whatever it's saying it's a fastest growing city in the in the country once you go there you go okay like if you brought your wife there and you said look this is we're gonna move here she'll be like yeah we got a lot of people from California coming up there of course say that much yeah and then some good friends of mine who would living down on the beach right now they seriously looking at it they've been you know looking at property and they give Seawolves up with coyotes yeah no wolves no well no we haven't seen him we got him but we've got we had a coyote in our neighborhood for quite a while he kind of became famous and they're they're good looking coyotes you know he's close they're yeah they're they're like skinny and frail they look like Wiley coyote but out here or out west up there they're well fed well you have so much wildlife yeah yeah no Idaho has an incredible mule deer population you have amazing elk hunting fans yeah oh it's beautiful yeah and so decided to go off the grid that's one of my prime spots where you go I'm telling nobody I'll tell you let me know I'm gonna pave the way man it's so it's yeah it's it's a good spot and and I got to stop talking about it too because I'd get a lot of shit for say nice things about it but I can't help it it says there are some unheralded spots in this country and I think that's most certainly one of them yeah there's a there's a gang of other ones too though you know and it's it's really the West in the West like these areas that just don't have the gigantic populations but have everything else gorgeous scenery and the mountain air and just god damn yeah the fishing is that's the other thing oh my god the shore fly-fishing and my oldest boy scooters is really gotten into fly-fishing and he's got a great mindset for it right you know he just he's he's one of those guys he could be out there for a few hours not catch anything and still have a great time and and really uh you got other kids like my two younger kids you know they just they want to dynamite fish get the fucking fish get on with it move yeah and so they know they're not gonna fly fish anytime soon but scooters all about it and yeah not to uh not to bang on about them you guys have basically all the wildlife activities or all the outdoor active yeah we got more river frontage more river mileage than any state except for Alaska really yeah we got more and so the white waters fantastic it's great rafting up there the climbing's fantastic mountain biking I mean we jump on our bikes we can be up in the foothills in literally in about seven minutes and then spend the afternoon and not see anybody I mean it's crazy and we live right in the center of town basically and yeah and it's you know so anyway yeah no yeah oh I got a note from I go from Mugsy Mike my youngest boys teacher he's like seven years old and he's not like seven years he has seven psyche he's approximately somewhere in the range no one big yeah yeah I try to hide his actual age for security reasons and so anyway got a note from his teacher saying hmm he's having a little bit of trouble finishing his assignments on time and he just kind of wanted to check in with you to see how to motivate him and this was just yesterday and I got this message in as did my absolutely fantastic wife and so we had a funny conversation about you know how do we respond to that I mean like he's seven years old yeah right I mean doing working for a living yeah exactly how do you motivate him to cut and paste faster or something but so I you know all I could think I was food right like my retriever he you know he's food motivated my dog and and so I'm figuring you know mugs he's the same way you know he give him a cupcake and he'll finish that assignment so I don't I had no idea I was really stymied you know because I think I know we all you know I mean our kids are you know like everybody else you always view kids great kids are smart and everything but you know and I so I give her I give the teacher a lot of credit you know for being focused like that but at the same time I step back and I look and I go yeah it's okay if he wants to slack off a little bit he's 77 exactly how do we have this obsession with getting kids to Buster like I was I have a friend who's gonna put their kid in Waldorf school and we were talking about that and I guess they don't even teach him to read until the third grade and my wife was like get the fuck out of here with that because my daughter's in the third grade she reads great I mean we read every night she reads perfectly I'm like imagine if she hadn't even started learning how to read yet now that that and that that's what opens up everything else yes you can't you can't delay that part of it yeah and but yeah it's so yeah I know we finish every evening with a with a the kids have to read write get on you don't finish in it and she likes reading too that's the other thing like I don't think it's a bad thing to have kids read but what I do what does elements reversal I'm taking a country where I shall stand on I support it right there but what does concern me though is homework cuz you know my ten-year-old sometimes she cries she's got so much homework we're old school enough to do two hours of them it's just there's probably got activities to yes sports activities that consumes to gymnastics a bunch of other shit too it's these kids they want these kids to grow up to become hugely successful and you know they push them so hard and everybody in the community is this is when you're in these wealthy communities too that's the other things all these other people they all everybody's working so hard they want their kids to work so hard you like Jesus I'm in this weird spot where I'm gonna I'm an an insider outsider it's cuz I'm in there and I kind of work hard okay got you work hard shit what do you think kind of work hard it's not really work none of its fucking scam this system jobs I got three fake jobs you have seen fake job stand-up comedy fake ass job podcasting definitely a fake job I got three fake jobs the toughest the toughest is right now what's the toughest I probably stand up stand up is the hardest to pull off how long did telling me ask you how long did it take for like the set that you did up in Boise which was fantastic how long did that run I didn't I was laughing my ass I'm sorry I don't I did an hour and went like an hour and 15 minutes and that took me that was what when I went up to Boise was a couple months before I filmed my special so that was the end of my run so what I do is I develop an act for like a year I tour with it for a year and then at the end of that tour I film a special okay so it takes me two years to put it together where it's I fucking hammer that samurai sword down polish it and it's live performance you know it's fucking weird sometimes one night a bit kills the other bit tonight it comes out a little clunky you never sure how to do it it's it's a constant thing of evolving it and moving it and changing it do you ever just drop something yeah I mean that's all it's been working and then you go and you think oh fuck it yeah you have to be enthusiastic yeah yeah in the beginning you stand up you treat your jokes like they're tools like oh this is a phillips-head I need two Phillips head screwdriver I'll fit that in there and then after a while you realize like okay let me do what I like I'm gonna talk about shit that I like and then you have anything you realize well the art form is trying to figure out how to make ideas funny and then then it becomes if these ideas are funny to me I got to figure out a way to get them funny for other people but if they're not funny to me I'm not interested and then so what do you do you put something together and then you test it out on the kids or at home or no I'm kidding you take it to like a small place right just take it to clubs yeah I go to the Ice House in the Comedy Store and The Improv and I go to these local places in LA and I might do like last night I did three shows and I'll do that all the time I'll do that I'll do four shows I'll do one show at The Improv three at the Comedy Store do that all how long are the shows each I mean each hour okay half-hour you know sometimes less sometimes must be exhausting I mean in a way so you talked about how it's a fake job yeah I mean get up in front of people you don't know what the reactions gonna be that's the best job that I do but also the most work but it's the best out of the fake jobs that I have that's the best fake job because it's the most fun like you know the Boise thing was like eleven thousand people you know crushed in front of 11,000 people that feeling is just when you hear the roar like you hit a punchline you hear the roar of the crowd it's like there's nothing like that yeah nothing like that in the world that was it was it again anybody get a chance to go see go see a show because this would just go see a Netflix but Netflix now yeah what is it like 10 bucks yeah 17% more I think you're gonna check it really yeah you have so much good shit though like if you want to just waste your life and sit in front of TV it's crazy like when we were kids maybe that's your passion so you get that Universal basic income and my following my passion means I got to sit and watch every episode of a negress fart under the sheets there's a lot of people doing that right now I don't know if that's bad I mean yes it is but then doesn't that open the door for the the people that aren't gonna be like that like look less people out there really actually trying to get ahead I think the people that are gonna try to succeed are always gonna try to succeed I think that's true and I think so I think that's maybe that's an argument against it also which is that like I don't think it's gonna unlock a whole treasure trove of innovators right if suddenly you give people money and say okay you don't have to go pour coffee or flip burgers or you know clean up that road or whatever you're gonna do for a living you can follow your passion I don't think we're gonna find some exponential increase in the number inventing the wheel I just think that it's gonna be a lot more people farting under the blankets or something I don't know they might be right but the only good that I think could come out of it is a less people are in abject poverty and less people are desperate so it might reduce crime you might have lazy people but you might also have less people that are inclined to steal things or do something that's illegal because their basic needs are taken care of yeah I've read something that's it's stunned me I was on the plane flying to to LA and I read an article about this this strike right the teachers trying to sorry the tea here in Los Angeles big strike Los Angeles Unified School Authority or whatever it's called and it was just before they they went on strike but it talked about the problems that the school district has and I don't know whether this statistic is right I read it numerous times because I was so surprised by it 80% of the families that used the Los Angeles public school system are at the poverty level or below and that means of course also that they rely on the free meal assistance right that schools provide which is kind of what the point of the story was like the schools are closed right now and so you know kids aren't getting a chance to eat because that's their only chance to get to eat right but that number was stunning that's crazy right so I don't I meant to look into it and do more research to see whether the article was actually correct or not but hay was in the newspaper so it must be true right anyway yeah that's a disturbing number it's a very disturbing number but it also talked about how 12 percent I think 12 percent of all kids that go to high school here in Los Angeles then go on to college twelve percent and it was a similar number that never get out of high school it's even worse in a place like New York City public schools so I guess the point being is a public school system is its dog show yeah and in the larger urban centers it's got some real problems and I think a lot of those people that are the really sad thing is a lot of those people that are at the poverty line are below work hard it's not a lack of motivation it's they just don't have opportunities you know what to do that not doing it the right way they don't have guidance they never learned correctly when they were young and he's a single parent they've what's in two or three jobs and no but California's got also it's interesting issues I mean there's you know talking to some folks and they said a quarter of the nation's homeless people live here in California 25% of the nation's homeless people live in California in the last few days yeah most of the time it's beautiful weather hey you can't complain about the weather it is crazy and and it also talked about how a lot of those people they work but they're homeless right the cost of housing and so you've got people that have a job but they're living in their cars right because they can't afford housing whether it's in San Francisco or in Santa that isn't that place is insanity so your point about the basic universal income I take that point I see what that the you know if it was possible to pay for it and and again kind of do this thing where you you're monitoring this issue of motivation so you're not creating another follow-on generation complete slack asses then I think that's it that's a really valid point I my concern would be people that didn't appreciate it and people that felt entitled like they felt like someone owed them that money yeah you know and you're gonna have that I mean this is the this is the biggest problem that people have with socialism and socialist attitudes that some of these kids that are coming up right now they look at what they call income inequality what they don't look at is effort inequality like some people put in more fucking work yeah it's not and are smarter they've figured their way through the game better than you have yeah I'm never doing it for 50 years or whatever they're right right it's not I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that I'd I never begrudge anybody I never got pissed off with a rich person because they were rich right I think it hey that's good I'd like to be rich right so I might want to talk and find out how did you do it how'd you do it and yeah it's the system sometimes you know set up so that once you have some money you can get more money well of course the fuck it is yeah I mean if I have some money I can invest that money and make more money you know if I'm smart about it if I do it right yeah if you do it right but I absolutely I don't you know I don't begrudge the idea that's it so that's part of it is also I'm fairly steeped in the idea that you know we're living in a very unique country right and and I do worry sometimes it that people don't you know you know even family and I've got some friends in others who we just constantly pissin and moanin about this place and I'm thinking I spent almost all my life over in shit holes around the world and I there is no other place I would rather be as a country and I know that's you know it's jingoistic or whatever but honest to god I still believe and if you go someplace and you talk to somebody in some fifth world they will also my experience has been anyway maybe your listening and your experience is different but that's the way it works is that they'll think if I go to America if I can get to America and I work hard I can I can be successful and that I think is still true and that's what I worry about with entitlements and things that that may kill that belief and you're right income inequality yeah that's but it's you're right you work harder now it doesn't always happen but life's not supposed to be fair it was maybe it's supposed to be fair but it's not fair so sorry if it's just supposed to be life lights definitely not fair yeah yeah it's I I completely see your point and and I agree with it i I think that the real concern is that people don't appreciate already how great they have and what incredible opportunity they have and if we increase the more benefits with less effort then you're going to develop more of this attitude that we find disturbing which is people that don't have an appreciation for literally the greatest experiment in self-government the world has ever known yeah yeah no I but I think also that there's parts of it that need to be looked at like there's that there's an interesting study about about college and graduation rates from college for for disadvantaged folks you know and that was again why they made it easier for you know tuition assistance right so the idea was we want to expand the college ability for everybody which is a great idea right but what they found was they expanded the the the college opportunity for everybody but over the past decade decade and a half fewer people from the lower income categories have been graduating right so you've what you've done is you said come on in it's like you know it's like special operators right if if if you lower the bar right right and this is where I'm gonna get in trouble probably I'll talk about the Marines and you know allowing women into combat elements I know oh my god well what do they do well you lower the bar you make it different well not nothing could get through the course so I'm gonna change the regulations you know and so if you change the regulations what they found with the college was if you if you increase that pool of people going it doesn't mean that they're going to be successful right and now what you've done is you've kind of saddled them with some college debt and they didn't graduate so they're still earning what a high school you know graduate earns and that in the system doesn't work and so I think sometimes just the idea throwing money at the problem or it doesn't it's not helpful if we don't think it through and then assess the results so but yeah that that whole marine experiment I think they're they're catching it late in the chain and I think it's good to give people the opportunity to succeed and to advance themselves but if you really want to address it as a systemic problem you got to get to the root of it which is these unbelievably horrible neighborhoods and these these toxic environments that these kids are growing up and being abused and being scared and bullied and terrible piss-poor education you know first through all the way up to high school that's I mean that's really where you have to address it I mean addressing it just at the college level and giving them the opportunity to get into college and making it easier for them it doesn't negate the terrible foundation that's been laid by their life right yeah and I think that's yeah we had this idea that that college should be for everybody right and that's okay that's great that's I think that's where the you know people like Cortes and Bernie Sanders and others with their idea of free tuition yes you know they're thinking okay wow look at Europe you know there's some countries in Europe have free tuition and hey it's you know it's relatively prosper and there's nothing wrong with that but at the same time you know III think we don't we we don't assess the cost and the overall efficiency of an idea sometimes and so we just assume and you know open it up let everybody go and somehow this is gonna work right to our advantage and the honest-to-god answer is no you know I think somebody is better off sometimes you know going to you know becoming a plumber yeah you know you may be making an honorable living it's a great living it's a great living is it one of the happiest guys saying though is my plumber in Boise that guy is I mean he's got it not right he's always out for hunting season and you know he'll call I'll say look I got a I got a leak right I mean my ceilings about the cave and he goes well I'm going hunting sorry he's just got he's got his own schedule right but he's got a great job and there's nothing wrong with that but I think we developed this idea so like homeownership everybody should own a home right well we saw with that tokus yeah when you lower the requirements and suddenly we're all you know it's blowing up and we're fucked but anyway yeah what do I know what do i what do I know either but I I see your points and I know what you're saying I think that one thing that disturbs the shit out of me is student loans I mean you were one of the worst ways to prepare a kid for the futures to saddle them down with a quarter million dollars worth of debt by the time they graduate from college right now absolutely and then they get a $50,000 a year job and they're like what in the end they're doing well with a $50,000 a year job that's a great job to get out of college and and you just look at the debt that you have and you're like what the fuck is this yeah how am I gonna pay this shit yeah no I know and we have sold the students a bill of goods yes and and and you know some of it okay some of it's on them right some of it you know the older students are the ones who are willing to take out this loan and then suddenly they're using the money for something else okay finally there's individual responsibility but no I I agree with it the student loan debt is a major issue we occasionally that the Capitol Hill talks about it but not really I told I told my daughter who's a fantastic person this is you know the biggest gift you're getting is getting out of college without any any debt yeah that's you know so you know dad's not going to buy you your own Wagoneer you know tuition and that's that's that's it what's best second that's a gigantic head start for kids no I mean it sounds so fucked up but it's true to not be in debt is gigantic look they're giving kids credit cards and their frontal lobes aren't even developed yet they're doing all kinds of wacky they're like wow figure it out like you ain't figuring out shit you never figured out things up till now and the idea that you're gonna get magically smarter over the next six months while you owe all this money is crazy right you kids do oldest have a phone yet for security purposes er what is this what do you got here Jam clock oh my god what is I can't even figure out what that is 1.6 trillion to go oh so what is this website that people can go to this college debt com I just typed in student loan whole long shit look at look at that that is an insane amount of money thanks Munro second I said what it is look I'm just kind of guessing I thought what I'm seeing yeah oh that's an insane amount of money so you just made that number up you just look at credit cards auto loans is that credit cards and auto loans for us all of us Americans or students yes and then those it's all credit card debt what I just looked at to on another page that had a clock it back it's this is the same number it's it's not including the interest on the federal loans that's that's crazy so so you look at that you think okay no wonder it's a it's a popular idea of saying you gotta write down student loans you've got to get free tuition going on yeah do all these things and I again you know can the country pay for it I don't think so should we be talking about it absolutely she'll be looking for other alternatives and other options yeah but you know I think it's it's uh you know we're not even willing to address the issue of Social Security and Medicare and you know and and trying to deal with entitlements as they currently exist which we know you know are going to bankrupt us at some point we know that it's not it's not a mystery and we can't deal with that so how are we gonna deal with these other issues well that's what the the question I had about a guy like Trump who doesn't seem to like to pay attention to things how the hell is one person supposed to be in the the director of all these various aspects of our world ya know I've heard that you know from was the name The Economist camera members name but they were a very very smart guy very smart economist who was talking about this and saying this is what we expect of a president think about all these things the president has to be cognizant of and and and supposedly capable of digesting a lot of information and making decisions on a very number of things and obviously yeah you delegate and your to then fine but it is an interesting system and it is interesting how you know I mean right now there's a lot of people that don't have faith in the current president to make you know some of your basic decisions previous administration there were a lot of people that was convinced he could you know understand anything right I mean he was you know capable of all of it so I don't think the job itself is too big and I just think that yeah the way that we go through the selection process has slowly over a period of time you know gone downhill and as you know kind of resulted in what we're doing right now part of its that the bullshit primary process you know and the way that we do the initial selection there's there's you know there's a lot of things I suppose sure the fact you have to be registered as a Democrat or Republican to vote in the primaries and all those things and then you know it was just so everything like the whole thing is a big mess but on the flip side here's what's crazy Trump doesn't seem to be aging ages so hard yeah they age so hard because they're paying attention to everything and they have real concern well yeah he seems to be just like a fucking water on a duck's back well you know maybe he's he's gonna outlive us all maybe he's figured out how to avoid the stress yeah it seemed in the old yeah oh you remember what present Obama looked like when he finally walked out of office or Bill Clinton I saw Bill Clinton not too long ago we went down a little rock and you saw him yeah he was at an event that we were is a relatively small dinner and Jason pussy yeah I'm not saying he fly on the wall in a room with that guy but I will say this much about him he was we started talking I thought I was just gonna go up and shake his hand and say you know hey yeah mr. president you know good to see you because I always like the guy right and okay you know aside from his obvious you know issue and the problem he had in terms of his ability to to govern and the fact he's a smart son of a bitch and he I just found him you know capable of the job right I just like I did with President Bush and you know there were good aspects of President Obama like I don't have a dog in the hunt right I mean I'd rather see the results in the person but anyway talking to President Clinton he we started talking and he immediately went to a agency operation an old thing that had happened during his time when he was president to talk about it I and and you could tell that he I mean he had retained a tremendous amount of information right and we were talking and and we ended up talking for 15 minutes or so just kind of about this particular incident and he was kind of curious and he wanted to you know and he wanted to recount kind of some of the thought process that they were you know going through and and I found it really interesting in the sense that that was it it was a surprisingly deep conversation right for some and he's curious and I always thought that was the most important quality for anybody who gets in that job is he they have to be curious right they have to be inquisitive and you know on the scale of you know presidents where does the current president you know exist in the curiosity scale I don't know but I think that's probably not his strong suit so maybe that's one of the reasons why he's not aging is because he he's you know he's not asking that fourth or fifth question that leads you to the point where you go huh it's a pretty fucked up situation now we got to worry about that one yeah so maybe it is you know water off the back and he's and he's he's figured out a way to deal with stress well on the plus side he seems to be making business owners happy he seems at least ones that aren't affected by the sanctions against China because there's like steel manufacturing and a lot of other companies that are very upset by yeah yeah well I think it's the regulations that they've done that they haven't really touted in terms of deregulating some of the things that make us like the previous administration you know a lot of good points but some bad points one of the bad points was sort of the hamstringing of industry through over-regulation yes on everything right and so lifting some of that on you know there's this yeah you can argue whether you know you want bigger government or less government but you can't argue with the fact that it did unleash you know industry and business more than the previous administration so that's a good thing but yeah look at all the other concerns I mean now we're talking about it you know a global slowdown okay because you know China's numbers are looking soft Germany's looking soft what does that mean everybody's worried about brexit so there's there's a lot of things for people to be focused on you know and I worry sometimes that all we do here in the states it's kind of like chase the next you know shiny ball tinfoil because we're all a bunch of raccoons right we have such a short attention span for everything and yeah anyway what am I saying I don't know sorry everybody was talking about attention span the last thing definitely want to talk to you about is one of the things that Trump brought up recently is the JFK case and releasing some of the files and they wanted to redact the information that pertained to the people that were still alive now I want to know what what I don't know what you could say but what do you think about the JFK case do you think the Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone I can see of all of all the sort of incidents of all it that don't minimize it but minimize it by calling it an incident but of all those situations the Kennedy assassination and MLK and Martin Luther King's assassination those are the two that I understand more than anything else why they've Lincoln why people don't believe this shit that they've seen and why they did why they have concerns about it Martin Luther King more than Kennedy III I believe that there was something there that we still don't understand in terms of who else was responsible and who organized that and who who assisted in that right I just think of those two that's the one I've got bigger questions on the Kennedy assassination I think that I think that Walt pulled the trigger I think in his mind the reason he was doing it was for the greater good of communism and to boost his image with the Soviets and and with the the Cuban regime do I think that he had assistance I don't you know I don't think so but I could be swayed from that with with better evidence than I've seen but I understand why people are so delegating on it right because I mean look it was a massive event right it was a massive event but Oswald had sufficient training you did not have to be a rocket scientist let's figure this out it was a different era and we don't understand it in today's terms but when you get right in that position and look out that window and look at the shot that was taken and you know what was involved in that I was not at you know you've shot you know you've this sounds terrible but you know every you know anybody who's hunted you know has taken a more difficult shot than that yeah so that part of it and and his motivation and his past ties to the Soviets do I think the Soviets were pulling the trigger on to I think them off you were pulling the trigger I I haven't seen anything that convinces me that that was the case I think that Ozma felt like he was doing it for them or he was going to prove himself in that regard but again I I understand why people have dug in the MLK one Martin Luther King I just I think that I don't think he acted alone what makes you think that I think that look he was a loser a two-bit criminal right who was constantly getting picked up for the shit that he was doing and ending up in jail all right he was a mess right there was nothing clever about him and then leading up to the assassination he cleaned up right his act suddenly he went from looking like a two-bit you know criminal you know to a college professor basically and he had cash he was able to you know purchase a vehicle and he kind of went off the grid for a while he went on with his drive right and sort of stayed off the grid and he behaved in a way that he hadn't up until you know months before this thing took place and then he ended up in Europe you know and I just something tells me that he had assistance in some fashion I don't know who write or whatever but I just that's the one that more than any others that I've looked at you know makes me step back and go now we don't we don't know the whole story here the Kennedy thing I again maybe there's something out there that we just haven't turned over mm-hm it's always a possibility but yeah MLK I think is that's the one that's most disturbing that's interesting I don't know enough about the MLK murder I need to go look into that now especially if you think that something was going on look at his behavior what the hell was his name again James or James Earl Ray and I've talked to his brother I've interviewed his brother for what for a show a series where we did a kind of investigative look into this mm-hm and madhu when you're when you're looking at this is to look at Ray's behavior in that year leading up to the the assassination that's the that's the interesting for me that's the most interesting part I mean put it in context with everything he did up until that point which was he was basically again just a two-bit criminal couldn't stay out of jail and then you get this and you get this change in behavior and this change in appearance and this you know sudden ability to you know be something that he wasn't up until that point I guess everybody can change but that was that was the most striking part for me there's no obvious source of income no no justjust just you know just again just a penny any criminal basically and there was plenty of information it wasn't like he couldn't have gathered if you say well no he acted on his own well okay yeah was there information yes the leading right up to the the day before there was talk about you know there were news reports showing king at the Lorraine Motel and you know coming in and out of the room you know that he was staying in and so it wasn't as if you know you couldn't gather that information on your own you know but it was again it was that behavior leading up to it and I'm not a conspiracy guy at all right I've seen you know too much shit to you know to think that you know every conspiracies holding water so but this one it was disturbing yeah in that regard what that's worth yeah you should look into it and we'll talk about next time see what you think cuz I'd really be interested I think I don't think we're gonna this show that we're gonna get ready to do here start filming in next month is it's not going to be looking at things like that what is a what is it called it's gonna be called black files they may change the names just by the name just before we go on the air but you know I really enjoyed the shows that I did in the past America Declassified with the they're looking into conspiracies I've really enjoyed it I really really thought it was fascinating and I get why people feel that way yeah Kennedy for sure when they're on the outside the Kennedy went to me the bullet is the most disturbing thing yeah that bullet that just showed up on Connolly's gurney oh look what we found we found this bullet yeah and it's not distorted and supposedly went through two people and shattered bone the magic bullet the magic bullet yeah it's I don't buy it I think that that bullet came from there that's probably the most of all things so because we looked at the the grassy knoll su and the possibility of spotting the other side yeah the fuck yeah that bullet drives me crazy that there's more pieces of the bullet fragments in Connolly's body when you look at the look at the x-rays of Connolly's bodies that show bullet fragments there's little pieces they found little tiny pieces of metal in his body from the bullet fragments now but you don't see that missing from the bullet it's bullshit yeah the bullet thing is is and and I again there's there's elements of it that you look at but collectively just you know and again maybe there's something else out there maybe there is and and we just haven't uncovered you know maybe this will you know prompt you know some additional information who knows but yeah anyway it's it's fascinating shit but I do get it because it's it was such a seminal moment right and nobody wants to think that something that bad that horrific and that something that could sort of shatter the country in that fashion could be done by one one guy Mike Lee Harvey Oswald or John Hinckley yeah yeah exactly I just let him out yeah well not for good right not for good I think it was on a release yeah fuck out of here for life get the fuck out of here forever I don't care how how well you've been behaving for 20 years while you've been locked up in a mental assignment he shot the president get the fuck out of here what is wrong with people yeah it's it's that old idea he's done his time he said it's time yeah he's been he's been rehabilitated and and that's always that argument it's prison for incarceration or is it for rehabilitation it's for us yeah for us he shot the president get in the cage hey can I say one thing please we finish up this is sort of a bump for a buddy of mine who's in Boise just wrote his first book if anybody's out there and they're looking for a book to read his name is Andrew Cousins and he's former operator who you know knows his shit and it's his first attempt at a fiction novel it's called a failed state and it's set in understand and also here in the US and and a couple other places Turkey and Germany and elsewhere interesting rate a lot of technical information in there it's a fiction novel but he's dumped a lot of information in there so it's clear he knows what he's talking about but it's worth
