the Joe Rogan experience news I think question is how do people kind of lose their collective minds in every once in a while in history and part of the answer is if you start a kind of vicious circle of denouncing people and then denouncing people who don't denounce people yes denouncing people who call the whistle on on other people denouncing people then you can get a kind of circle of Terror where no one wants everyone is so afraid of being denounced that they wanted denounced first the Stalinist Soviet Union is another example a Maoist China and that's somehow some one of the ways in which dictators could often enforce their power by have is turning the citizens against each other so everyone's denouncing everyone else out of fear that they'll be denounced first that's going on right now in North Korea right absolutely yeah yeah North Korea they have this thing where they each have to report on each other like when people are together they report on each other for different things that they did that were violations of whatever code that they follow absolutely and so governments know how to exploit it but it isn't just governments it can happen spontaneously too it's a weird human trait isn't it it is it's a combination of a kind of human trait and a kind of dynamic when you have kind of a network of people and and they all are kind of trapped and no one can be the first person to escape from this vicious circle because they don't want to be the one who is denounced and imprisoned and tortured or whatever the consequence may be what do you think where do you think if you think at all about this where do you think this is all headed like especially in terms of social media and certainly yes it's hard to tell but I you mentioned the possibility that there's been such growing recognition of the problem that we will mount a response that it'll just seem ridiculous at the outraged mob once it's recognized that there are outrage mobs and virtual signaling fanatics and once we have a label for them once we know that it's a thing it'll seem so ridiculous that people will be less tempted to do it I mean that's the optimistic outcome I'd never really had followed his political or his his public speaking type life so I was like holy crap this guy's pretty dialed in it's probably the plan yeah how it takes over when he might retire he might I mean he's 40 so he's just kind of getting his feet under slides right in in that world and Trump dynasty just like they did with the bushes that's right just know all of them Clinton's clean bushes you know what you're in there it's like that's all they want it's not interesting that's crazy but he I would feel I mean man well that's what you seem like a good guy Dudley I wish that Don jr. was running for president yeah he says he Don jr. is very reasonable oh man totally it's funny if he if he says one thing wrong one thing one slip-up of a word which by the way everybody does every day I do it every day yeah me too one one slip-up of the word Cory Knowlton right one fuck up like that and then this dunce I mean that you know all this magnified ridiculous hate that comes his way and the attacks against him and people people right now listening this probably yelling at therefore cuz they're fuckin just to fill our time mister shirt here's a show these are those who that it's yeah yeah they it's it's I mean it is really hard not to get pissed off what's really hard to be unbiased it's really hard to just have enough balanced perspective and I don't think anybody does a good job as president I've never seen a single person do it well but really my drug of choice was meth back in that day that was what I really liked and that was actually what I was addicted to at one point and I ended up going to jail and that was what got me out of addiction I didn't realize I was addicted until I was in jail so what made you realize it when you were in jail I just thought you know just couldn't stop thinking about it and just one in just I mean I didn't get have like like like cold sweats or anything I don't think that happens with uppers but I mean I was just you know like like what couldn't stop thinking about him as I did like just a lot of that anger was coming out I was just like God like what the fuck I got want to fight everybody I was like somebody give me something you know Wow yeah it was just really terrible experience but probably lasted three four days not even maybe not even that and then you came out of it yeah I mean I was just like able to accept my fate and deal with it what does it feel like to be on the mouth you take adderall I'd never taken that role now pretty similar to a door alright yeah it's like adderall I mean that's the closest I would say I mean you're high but you don't have I mean I said that euphoria more than anything just to excuse me just an extreme sense of euphoria just everything's beautiful but then men soon as you start to lose out a little bit you just itch for it's so bad man so bad thought you just want it again you don't want to sleep your teeth to be grinding you're just like like you're just tensing up all your muscles I God well I gotta get more of that you know now what you working out at all back then no no well that's a well not working out like it should be so again I was angry a lot of times like I'd be at a party that this was a common thing I'd be like a party or just doing drugs whatever and I just started getting look at everybody like a fuckin don't like none of you and I would just walk outside and I would go for a run I'd run five six miles come back and give me another line or whatever Wow yeah and run and then come back yeah yeah and then sometimes I would fight people you know that was common very very common if you call that working out and we like this particular time in my life I would let me see what we got here billionaire heir Wyatt coke makes shirts about money I
