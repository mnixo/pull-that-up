your problem with Brian's fucking microphone listen that goddamn fan kinda fan sucks yeah until you when you turn your mic up and down when you're gonna have to do that when you talk cuz that microphones dog shit should be careful you drink their the Joe Rogan experience [Music] things loud as heck out over here yeah we live yeah okay yeah the things loud was fuck we have a problem here folks it's not a major problem we have this new TriCaster setup HD Joe ds3 HD now but unfortunately the TriCaster has fans on it super noisy where Brian's microphone is positioned maybe I could just sit over there till we fix this it's it over there yeah yeah we'll throw a camera on you don't let Jamie run it fuck it yeah come on okay better be one of us come over to the big boys table we we got this TriCaster setup and it's pretty sweet it's cuz a lot of people watch this on their television so you know you take like chromecast or you just use an HDMI cable there's a bunch of different ways you could do it and you send or you could use that Apple thing where you throw it to Apple TV and you could watch around Apple TV what is that called Apple TV airplay airplay yeah so anything that's on your computer you could watch on TV you just shoot it to that and if you're using the air that's how it works right yeah do it from your iPad or your iPhone or anything like that yeah it's pretty fucking sweet so we're moving into 2015 Joe Diaz fucking crazy we take it to the next my wife cancelled cable did she really yeah she kept some package she said that's it we will live on Netflix I love it well I gotta tell you I love it I love it - I love it hang on live in one hand I'm home at night from comedy Netflix ran whined and I could watch whatever the fuck I want yeah a buddy of mine worked for sci-fi for 20 years and he said I got it once because I would watch how my children of watch TV mm-hmm yeah yeah and I kept going to Syfy and telling them and they were like fuck do you know what you talking about quit he started his own YouTube channel horosho he's fucking kill but it's funny how even my daughter goes natural a commercial comes on when she's watching the Bubble Guppies and the commercial comes on she - and she looks something like she's not used yeah The Grinch that stole Christmas or whatever there's no commercial so for her it's fucking nice so I watched her then I'm like look at this yeah even a fucking two-year-old tells you that commercial suck ass yeah they're not fun it's it's unnecessary and it ruins the the vibe of the show I've watched The Walking Dead almost entirely on Netflix or an Apple TV rather but I decided to record it on my DVR one night and I tried watching it on regular TV oh it's fucking awful then I watched it though that's what it was I watched it live without recording it because you can't watch on Apple TV until the next day so it came in on Sunday so I watched it live so we just paused it and walked away for 20 minutes and came back so we could fast-forward through all the bullshit but it's like every fucking 15 minutes they have this big break and the show stops and it's it's a dumb way to intrude on television it's like for whatever reason they started doing it like that and they stuck with it and some guys do it like that with podcasts like I love Adam Carolla but Adam Carolla does commercials like a radio show he just he does him all the time he does him every 15 minutes you know he's like he's got like brakes like hard brakes just like a radio show you know I guess that says with the world he came from do it that way well these new marketing agencies that contact you know they they're trying to ruin you they dangle big money out here but they want you to read 18 times a show you can't do that it becomes what we went to get away from yeah you know no I don't interrupt I won't interrupt I do it before I do it afterwards I'll put shit on Twitter if I think it's a good product and I enjoy it I'll do it but I'll do it with no contract like if I if I tweet something like if you see me tweet something about naturebox it's cuz I like it like I got these sriracha cashews they're the shit and I love them I love them so I tweet it like there's no agreement I don't have it there's no like you have to tweet this five times a week shit so I don't interrupt any podcast and I don't because I don't want that it what I'm listening to stuff I like stuff to go all the way through to the end and I'd be more inclined to support something that supported that then I would be too inclined support something that's that same old system that system sucks man at every 15 minutes system you don't do it you don't have commercials I mean you're fine don't do any commercial yeah no no that's silly you just say hey go do if you want to help out just go to shop squad and then that just takes care of everything one little swoop we rockin a split screen no old-school like like the old days oh we're going old but we're going new again don't have I'm sorry good between Apple TV and Netflix well Netflix has incorporated in Apple TV so if you have an Apple TV there's Netflix in there you just gotta sign up for an account but you said that Apple comes out the next day Netflix yeah no Netflix doesn't have I don't think they have the Walking Dead if they do it's probably at the earlier seasons with Apple you buy the whole season like you rent a season and you could watch like all the episodes at once which is the suit if you have a dud you watch Walking Dead we would get high and go to Dawn of the Dead and those type of movies you know and that was George Law Romero was the fucking crazy fucking when I was a kid that's the guy that made all those yeah Night of the Living Dead and I still remember that one thing with the black guys yelling mama mama he stands next to the helicopter and the helicopter just cuts the top of his fucking head off oh god I'm just never a knight you know I don't know it's not for me people walk around like zombies shit I have fucking nightmares nothing American Horror Story is probably one of the scariest motherfucking shows I turned down and lasted for like 13 or 14 minutes is it really that lady's fucking scary those oh yeah what is her name again used to be good-looking so it's fuck yeah how does fucking we were young what is her name John Huston something like that not Angelica Houston the other one she was in the mailman Always Rings Twice the postman oh my god damn she was hot back then what is her name ma'am just try Jessica Lange Jessica Lane yes that's it is you know she was Fay Wray in the King Kong remake the Dino De Laurentiis is that his name King Kong remake with Rick Baker which is like that was like the second King Kong it was like the the old-school King Kong it's a stop-motion claymation it looks like shit but then Rick Baker did a version of King Kong it was super sophisticated for the time and she was Jessica Lange was the fey range Jack Nicholson put her on the table and fucking in that movie oh yeah she was smoldering but you know what man she as an actress like or an actor or I guess you say doesn't need to be gender specific she fucking holds her own right now she is as good as anybody man she's so creepy on that show she's so like powerfully creepy you know like there's like there's there's just a realism to her the crazy that she projects it scares the shit out of me man on there too when that played Tina Turner with with is she she's in the new season I haven't watched the fat chick from the cutoff Jack nods legs James Caan's legen Kathy Bates is a do you have to watch the older seasons to be caught up or is it a new season a totally new story I don't know how fucking works man you just tuned in and freak out and get out of the room I sit down eight minutes i watch Jessica Lange what's the black chick and I get the fuck out of it that's a Larry of you with that shit at all what angel heart I couldn't sleep the fucking angel heart was on a couple weeks ago and I stayed up and watched the fucking scared the shit out of it it's really well written cuz they set up the first episodes I don't give any spoilers but a family moves into this house and Jessica Lange's like the neighbor or she comes by and she comes by like a noun so it's real creepy how she does it and it may you know you know she's fucking nuts but so you the guys there was wife and his children and you're like oh fuck like this is gonna end terrible it's like draws you in like right away you get nervous and you feel freaked out like right away give Hulu Joey did you ever get Hulu I think so yeah I quit my cable also and Hulu is actually one of the best ones because you can do shows usually the day after or then at the same day like South Park's a good one on there if you like South Park but uh networks do they have good news they have a lot of Fox ones they have nine nine yeah they have a lot of NBC like Saturday Night Live and stuff like that it's it's it's a nice blend of all the the main networks and also you also have movies on there so it's a nice little change from also Amazon Prime is another thing if I have Amazon Prime you get access to all of Amazon Prime stuff awesome they have their own shows and you can also rent movies thrum which is nice so Wow yeah it's all the options that are available today you're not the first one to tell me there I have several friends that have cancer book they said I don't want to do a buck-and-a-half mobile I'm not doing it yeah it seems ridiculous not doing it Netflix is seven bucks a month really needs seven dollars yeah look that's so insane and the other ones $8.99 yeah so 420 you got everything and I think CBS just announced that they have something for like five bucks and you just get all of his PBS which is silly because you get it for free already but I guess the convenience of downloading whatever you want HBO is going right yeah if you just want to watch Game of Thrones yeah yeah you just go HBO HBO it's pretty much becoming other cart which is something that I've always wanted in a cable company being able to pick and choose which channels you want the cable companies are screwed yeah when you develop a show like if you were when I was doing that sci-fi show you filmed the show you edit it and once it's edited then it has to wait for you know whatever night it's on Tuesday night at 8 o'clock whatever it is and then you wait for it to go on and then the show broadcast live Tuesday night a day and they sandwich in a bunch of shit you don't want to see so in between there you're watching prilosec commercials and fucking Toyota commercials and all this shit that you don't give a fuck your just being there they're literally fucking with your experience just come on by me come on by this hey what about this I feel better look at my wife look at my car next one what about us you could buy a stool what about us do you have insurance as your insurance run by a lizard and the Apple is fucking goofy shit and you you it ruins your experience they don't have to do that anymore what are they gonna do for commercials product placements I think mostly even grosser and I think that's the reason why we're paying a monthly subscription fee if you like holding up a fucking soda yeah I know why he killed her it's done right though South Park is a good example of them doing it right where they actually I think have sponsors but they just trashed the sponsor the whole time and really yeah I know where there's just one episode they'll be doing like you know like Dr Pepper but yet the day just talk shit mad shit on dr. pepper the whole time you could talk shit on dr. pepper and dr. peppers bears basically invincible yeah as long as you're talking about dr. pepper let's just killin anybody it's not killing anybody but if you want to talk shit about the way dr. pepper taste you ain't affecting anybody you know I noticed that one thing that was watching Diane Sawyer the day that fucko said something was the guy who's the guy that said Oh rush limbaugh what else it's a pill you know he was twenty years ago but then a couple years ago on his radio show he said some I'm sitting there watching Diane Sawyer and she pops up on the screen and also they pop up the sponsors that left him don't once's were like fuck rush limbaugh we just hit the jackpot that's what they don't really realize if they sponsored Joey Diaz his radio show and he says fuck whoever whatever John Wood grew and they get rid of them Diane Sawyer's and I come up with oh did you hear what happened to Joey Diaz today like I don't want some they show American an line Delta Delta's gone we didn't lose we fuckin six-thirty Diane SOI right that's as good as it fucking gets yeah that's it they didn't lose so either way you don't lose because they mentioned you nobody loses they don't really fucking lose did you see what happened with his perfect example and I'm not trashing Idol Crowe I like I said I love out but Adam had this chick Alison house and who's on her show and he just decided he wanted to try something different which is his prerogative but here's what happened her show shot through the fucking ratings it was number one at all podcasts on iTunes and you know why because people responded she's really nice like Alison Rosen is really nice and really smart and she's a good podcaster so like I think and I even sent her an email I said you're gonna be fantastic on your own like you don't need anybody like it's probably better for her to be completely independent because I think her show could be really profitable it could be really good and I think when you're that smart in that opinion you should have your own show I mean she's really good people always like no she still has it Rosen is your best friend or your new best friend so what she got fired so just shot through the fucking roof and I think that just shows you that like if you're if if it gets out there if there's controversy like Oh Alison got fired poor Alison poor Alison what are you crazy she's number one now she's never once she shot past all of us she probably because there were so many online stories about it and you know because the timing was really bad for her well yeah dog died and she was out of town and it was done by email you know there was like a lot going on with it but you know hey man I know the guy should be able to do whatever the fuck he wants to do with this show but the bottom line is like she showed that she was really good on the show and then the controversy of him firing her was huge it was way better than him like giving her like some title or a promotion or you know like if he announced Alison Rosen been the vice president of controversy and Adam Carolla Enterprises nobody would give a fuck but her getting fired for it like if if you got on the radio and you like fuck the pulp fuck Castro fuck all these cocksuckers suck my dick and then you know naturebox pulled out and everybody got crazy we're no longer sponsoring the toy and it was a big - all over these websites naturebox pulls out of the Joey Diaz podcast you would get hundreds of thousands more downloads that week hundreds of that offers look at his name two and a half BAM Charlie Sheen he got fired drugs hookers blow fuck FX was right there with an envelope not only were there an envelope they gave him the stupidest deal anyone's ever given anybody ever he made all the episodes they had they did a 100 episode deal and they make him over a really short period of time churning out scripts like you I don't have to tell you it takes time to write something good sometimes it doesn't sometimes you have the best idea like you'll hear about Quentin Tarantino he did blow he ran up to his apartment real quick and he just spent the next six hours writing a script you know Pulp Fiction too or some shit occasionally that does happen like Hunter Thompson wrote most of his uh Charlie the the book he wrote about Hell's Angels he wrote most of it coked up like in one night like most of it like you finished up the book like in one night just rattled off it is possible but most of the time you got to spend time you got to do revisions so they're not doing any of that they just fucking slam in the mouth there and if it went past X amount of episodes I forget what the deal was they had to film all 90 so he got this huge deal see he means like nine hundred million dollars or something stupid or ninety million dollars just some ungodly sum of money from that deal somewhat a nine in it Jamie would know I bet Jamie knows the exact number but he's going to well he was talking about it all morning today I love gossip Jamie the whole idea it makes me laugh but it's the the controversy for for anything is almost like worth doing that's why you know people they stir up shit on purpose like anybody that's in like the reality show business they look they're all they're doing is just controversy controversy contra can we get some controversy if we have controversies we got a show controversy I mean that's all they're trying to sell that's all they're trying to sell but you can see right through it you can I can't this is bullshit this is that the white chick who caught the black husband with a transvestite and took him back and the shows on me and she's like what do I do it's such a tough he was with a fucking transvestite you get rid of that fucking freak now she took them back again and now it they're on season eight and you know who even cares about that fucking broad I don't give a fuck people care if they put them on the cover of a magazine like if you cut on the cover of a magazine and that's what you sell like those realities star type people it just has to be there on the cover and then something happens she dumped him for this guy there's a more handsome guy shit now he's in the dumps hmm that's all you need to do and all you need to do and then people go well what happens next what happens to him what happens to her will they be reunited will she forgive him will he forgive her ah they got me hooked I mean you don't even know what Kim Kardashian's fucking voice sounds like you understand that like you would not be able to tell that if Kim Kardashian was doing a commercial for Delta you wouldn't be like oh that's Kim Kardashian but if like say what's her name from friends no the other one phoebe cates what's a--what's her no not Phoebe kzc what's your Kudrow Lisa Kudrow thank you what's G gossip Jaime Roy how funny it is when he turns the mic on that's turning out for a second just so everybody can hear the fan that's so stupid looks beautiful um what is your name again uh Courtney Cox Jennifer Lisa Kudrow fucking guys big tip of the sea very countess's show no I have not the fucking plastic surgery I've seen her and they put they put friends before it some nights I'm late TN to fuck with her yeah they have her on PMT and something on TBS they have friends on TBS and Cugat Alan you're in a hotel room after doing the show and you go and there they are you're like oh my god what the fuck happened that fucking plastic surgery those chicks do it doesn't make them look better just makes them look different you know it silly when you start shooting shit in your face to freeze it up and puff your cheeks up to hide wrinkles it does not make you look better it just makes you look different and there's the uncanny valley you know the uncanny valley is they do that this is a term they used for video games where with CGI they're really close to being able to completely replicate what a person normally looks like don't pull up her face don't be rude bitch this motherfucker he's gonna uncanny valley like there's like there's some videos that you can see now like that Nvidia has created where they are so close to it looking what is this what are you showing it shows you all the different steps they're not seeing if this is for us oh all the different versions of the uncanny valley I pop it up stick okay well let me just explain the term don't you know don't put don't pull this up um the the term that they use in you confusing the shit oh yeah there's nothing to do with that that's a different uncanny valley the the uncanny valley that we're talking about is the difference between CGI like high-level CGI and a person like it's so close but there's something creepy about it and that's what they call it the uncanny valley there's this valley that they can't quite cross like did you see them yeah I yeah well did you see the the latest Nvidia shit have you seen that I'm pretty sure we could show that show Nvidia's latest technology for CG oh the guys yeah the guy's face we we saw it in person me and Todd Mesirow from my TV show we went to see it in person in Northern California that's it that's the guy it's fucking incredible man but it still hasn't bridged that uncanny valley we can show this on the podcast yeah this is all invidious technology and they have pores they have sweat but they what they can't do is tongues so when the guys talking they can't quite do tongues and the teeth look a little fucking weird but yeah but goddamn that's pretty close that's getting real close rip but there's still something about it we're like man I don't know they got skin down and they but they don't have edge down like the edge detection around the forehead you can see it's a little weird yeah like a green screen right it's yeah yeah it's like the difference between the reality well it's also why is everything in the background blurry yeah you know I guess that's just a sample but still it's but you're pretending what this is an old-school camera is that what you're doing like why is that oh well I said all blurry like that that's ridiculous and it's heads floating but that's that's like real close but they they're still they can't do that yet you know they can't I don't know why we were bringing up the uncanny valley because the fucking people that's what they all look the same and they all sound a little creepy and creepier they're not all gonna be happy till y'all look like walking dead or something like that they're all gonna be they're all gonna be hanging out together all yours looks great did you get it done no you don't laughing great you look like a fucking something monstrous they start looking monstrous they sits it's unfortunate and it looks you know it looks crazy like you're a crazy person like you're doing you'd you know it's not like some tribal thing where you're doing like some tribal scarring on your face with some other wives have you ever seen those women no two big ones Big Ang I just saw her last night when I was scrolling yeah oh my god they just she's shooting shit she's just shooting shit constantly all those women those East Coast women the fake tits the the fat taking off their body the tightening the legs the the ass implants you could put implants in your ass by the way thought I've been torturing this for about a month Bobby Slayton style just torture torture you know there's I I went to 7-Eleven one night on Magnolia there and then come on there's a black girl on the Jeep that is banging but she comes out and I'm like yeah she goes I really I think I understand though I'd like to talk more about it well there's an open mic at the haha good Amish cuz I've been down there but the guy's rude to me and all this shit so I go down there like three weeks later I see it hey man you guys know I'm still taking notes I mean this chick is gorgeous she's I'm still taking notes but you could tell this something not right you know where there's something not right so she's like you know I just need somebody to take me under their wing and doing them you know it's tough can I get your digits and not give you a call and then she started with the calls you know how are you I'm like I'm fine she goes Winkley I can't you know I can't teach accounting you gotta go out

where you going some will akame store can you talk to them for me I can't get you up at the fucking Comedy Store and then when they should start talking about her Jeep blew up and she needs a thousand dollars you know right there I just started giggling like I I just know now once they do that you're intrigued right to see where it goes now you want to talk to them right no she's trying to play

can't even have fun with her right because she's trying to lie to me I oh yeah at least if she would just tell me she was a hook I would torment right so finally the clouds parted and she's like you

7-eleven yeah we'll talk given out her spot Joey her spot she needs a thousand one's gonna go down there and go you know Joey Diaz but talking shit about this intensity Oh in fact she hangs outside of gaussians and waits for old Jewish rebel oh man really I've seen it I've walked there my wife is gonna the Gelson's I waited outside with the baby and seen her with a blonde wig I've been in that coffee shop but she walks by and everybody looks like she's young she's young cuz she came into the coffee shop once and she's not asking us questions about where this that like plan my thing just in case somebody said you look good right why busy right now what are you doing you could tell she's right they got away with it oh yeah she's a professional the young girl does it right she doesn't wear the heels she has the backpack you know she's the real deal I've seen her up and down that fucking thing for months so this girl if you do it right they you know they get away with it with the back back though sexy clothes when a blonde wig black and blonde wig always makes me think trans ginger black and blonde black what the redheaded wig they're good yeah that's the brightest yeah her hair is bright orange look weird blonde wig is weird on a black lady oh okay it looks kind of like it's odd disguisey well it's you know you should be able to wear whatever the fuck you want to wear but when I see like a Chinese chick with blonde hair an asian chick with blond hair or a black chick with bunny I'm like you look good with black hair you don't have to do that right but what difference blonde hair who's Eve Eve - chick from that TV show of a rapper what TV shows I don't know Eve Jamie you know what it is it's from like the 90s early 2000 balls tall she's in barber shop she has blonde hair not this fucking guy that looks like the old manager from the economy's doing she's big joe rogan that's a big model that's a pretty girl I guess she's good-looking I like look at her yeah she's in barber shop I think she wears a blonde wig that's that's her hair that's nice no she's banging guys and she's tall well so many black chicks wear weaves you know which is really strange like they they wear hair like kind of sewn into their hair have you ever smelled carrot top or fucking like gasoline and fucking oldest fucking explode thing to be some fermenting going on right and it's hard it's it's not like I never mind I can't say that story well you feel the we when you run your fingers right yeah you can't really it feels like plastic there's a whole bunch of different kinds like Tiffany Haddish had one that was like plastic where felt like the pretty look like the Predators hair and meeting Tiffany hatice's hair lately now she just has this humongous like seventies fro nice and every time she's in a picture with somebody it looks like she's like in between two ferns it's great yeah we know this documentary Jamie shut all the shit out there the weaves is like what the blonde girl had yes we that's a weave I'm talking about what black girls have like yeah that's a weave too okay it's a hair was confused we can get a weave yeah guys could get weaves yeah just so your hair on two other cage yeah it's a fucking weave and everything well they also have these these wigs that have with it's like a lace front so it looks like your skin like if they glue it to your head and it looks like the hair is coming right out of your skin until you get right up in there yeah they don't have that down variety either because it like it's there's that show Undercover Boss um have you ever see that where they take like a CEO of like Boston Market and then he gets thrown in as a regular employee at one of their stores and it's cool because he catches all the things wrong with his store and people don't know but they always give him like the dumbest like fake mustache and it looks so fake and all the employees have to be like all right what is this Undercover Boss like there's a employees are probably all in on it yeah it's probably a horse shit yeah and then there's so much of those shows are they're faking like what I'm in trouble what like so many of them are set up in advance and especially ones that make people look bad because you got to think like well how much they gonna pay these put this person to ruin their life what are they gonna give you 1,500 bucks like what scale on one of those shows they're gonna ruin your life and you agree to this they can't just film you and put you on television you have to sign a waiver yeah what'd they say how they do that is they say say it's a different reality show it's like this is a reality show about a guy that's he's a waiter yeah at this table and we're giving him the opportunity to own his own restaurant so it's like it's like another game show that's not Undercover Boss that's how they signed the papers and they also it's deception yes deception seems like they could get sued well it's deception by its own company that they work for so I think it's kind of there's like that loophole going back this pool kids were making ten bucks an hour you give him a check for six hundred a day once you cash that check ain't no going back Jack you know that's that's there's a lot of those shows now - it's amazing how easy it is to make one of those shows it's still hidden camera show yeah did you know that my friends still executive produce hidden cameras well Howie Mandel has that show right he has a show where he does hidden camera things where would you make money the more do you get people to do like you gotta tell your wife you're leaving her for a man and you know I can you get like 500 bucks for that you get more for more things you do it's like I did that show for CBS years ago like six years ago it was called gameshow in my head and I would put like this little earpiece and these people and then they would go out and we would make them do shit on camera like we we had this guy put him in the middle of Hollywood and told him they gave him a suit and put some news cameras like like it was a news camera show and had these people come over and you had to tell people that you were there to talk to someone who was a witness for a UFO and they took off and you gotta ask these other people would you pretend it was you would you pretend that you saw this UFO and you got to get them to admit that they were taken aboard the aircraft and that they were probed that they did some medical examinations on them and they got people to do it yeah that's how I knew that all that that's that was like a huge eye-opener for me about how full of shit people are when it comes to UFOs well everybody's talking about it yeah it came down the field and it wasn't from Earth I've seen a lot of airplanes on TV didn't look nothing like that and it was spinning around a circle there was no doors and I saw these Lucan those people are full of shit there's a giant percentage of those people you put a camera in front of their face and they just start talking and that we we didn't have no problem we got like seven people to just right away they just start making shit up right off the top of their head all of them did it no one said no it was ridiculous and we all everyone that did that show with me we all left and we're like what the fuck man like everybody just lie like at least I expected a few people to be like what you want me to make up a story about being taken aboard a UFO the fuck out of here that's the reality show yeah just to play Martians get my coffee and just go to places like a 1 in the morning like land and we're here bitches Martians all these fuckers run down that Street like it's king fuckin calm it would start shooting yeah too many people have guns the fucking 90s they would have shot UFOs they would shoot UFOs anywhere in time someone's had a gun there they're willing to shoot like a UFO if it lands like the odds of if you get a thousand people with guns and a UFO lands in front of them five hundred people are pulling that fucking trigger I mean sure that elegent guy when you have a UFO landing and you have 10 people that concur they saw the same thing or they saw something what is that well I go from door to fucking door and pay people and what the fuck it could be a bunch of things the thing is it could be from another planet it could be if it's possible for us to put a rover on Mars it's possible for them to send a ship from another galaxy of course it's possible not only that we assume that these aliens that everybody keeps seeing these gray aliens the big black eyes we assume that they're living beings they could easily be robots if we're this close to crossing that uncanny valley and making some sort of an artificial computer-generated image how I mean if the technology continues to accelerate to the point where you could actually get a ship to go through a fucking wormhole the real the real like impeding factor I would think would be biological life like why send something living when you can make something artificial they're so close to being able to make artificial life and what I say so close within a hundred years I mean I think only anybody disputes that they'll have some form of artificial life 100 year old robot West kid that looks like guys now go in the future let's the earth is for something billion years old but we're not the oldest planet we're not in the oldest galaxy like not even close like the universe is 14 billion years old supposedly so that means an extra ten billion years for things to form and possibly grow even up 1 billion years even a million years who the fuck knows we could do in a million years so if these UFOs show up and these little aliens are inside of it they're probably robots I would assume that they if unless they figured out some incredible way to bypass space and time into fold space and create a wormhole and punched through life that didn't event horizon and all these you know physics documentaries they talked about the possibility of using wormholes and it's all like crazy theoretical shit but until they figure out how to do that and send like monkeys back and forth for a few years they're not gonna mean why wouldn't they just send robots just like we're sending a robot to Mars I mean it looks like a toaster and it's got wheels and it's rolling around but it's a robot if we sent a robot that looked like Traci Lords and it was walking around on Mars I mean that would be what it looked like you know it just so happens that we set one that looks like a toaster but it doesn't you know we could say whatever the fuck we want we could send Bob costis to the moon you know Bob Costas robot Bob Costas would be reporting from the surface in the fucking moon I've never been a big Martian guy and I always thought that fucking you know you always think that the high population of areas area 51 and maybe in the south right you know you know you just write it off but it isn't the high populations of Martian sightings and UFOs is why grew up in northern New Jersey I fucking couldn't believe it well you know why this is the conspiracy theories you know the conspiracy why that's where bell laboratories are they busy yes the bill the big conspiracy this is the big conspiracy this goes back way back there was a company on the internet if you remember it called the American computer company and they had this website they made computers there was back in the day when you'd call up or you would fill out like specs like you know hey I want a 300 Celeron processor and this and that and they would put together computer for you but they also had this website page that was dedicated to conspiracies about the creation of the the was it the transistor the stereo there was laboratories yeah yeah there's there was certain aspects of of sound and electronics that were invented in Bell Laboratories and this website supposedly pulls vis the big conspiracy polls the cover over the creation of these things and says this all shit came all this shit came out of area 51 from some shit that crashed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 it was all about the Roswell New Mexico crash they took all those whatever those parts of those UFOs were and back engineered them and that's how they created all this stuff and this this website was totally dedicated to it it was talking about how there's a military base that's outside of Bell Labs like that they said was to protect New York City like why would you protect New York City from way the fuck out there you wouldn't it would take way too long for everything to coordinate that but it's right next to Bell Labs and you know during the military days of you know I guess this is like Bell Labs was probably created post-world War two I think so you got to think you know there's the Cold War days and the Russians and there's all this there's the technological race is to try to get to the moon and all that other shit I mean we were we were racing with the Russians virtually everything nuclear power nuclear weapons space travel and so this this Bell Labs apparently played a very vital role in you know United States strategic technology advancement like for whatever it was but this American computer company was convinced that all this shit came from UFOs from the crash saucer and Roswell and they back engineered it there's a lot of people that believe that northern New Jersey is like the Capitol if you look at my own fucking sightings it's not Roswell the Jersey that's fucked kallstadt all the way the fuck is like Bergen County well it could also be the air quality in New Jersey it's so fucking bad that people were just delirious all the time but there's live in those swamp towns but there's one story that came in North Bergen and this is the part of town where it's fucking uppity and they interview to all these people and I stayed up one thing look that there's a tape on YouTube this is right on YouTube they have but they show where the thing lands on the baseball diamond all this shit but then they went to all those business owners and whenever you see last night I was why to summer they should have viewed New York is a circular building that's the building that complained the most if they saw the lights people landing Brian samples of dirt out I mean it was could've been anybody before come with him but not all these people in conjunction not alright the liquor store maybe had a couple cocktails but all these people in the building saw the lights the flashing they heard the landing they heard the booms maybe all those broads were just seeing stars Moxa's own line meanwhile you thought about that before you said it you like this is the shit we can sing saying that they so lights and there you talk about jerseys whatever you know what I think that's you don't even explain it I know doesn't work you know I think to the CIA came out with this report recently about how many of the UFO sightings that people saw was actually experimental aircraft that they were working on and that was that was real recent like they admitted this kind of stuff but then you also have like remote control drones it means they've they've had that kind of technology like radio-controlled technology they've had that for a long time and they've been able to do things not like quite to the level that they can do them now but they've been able to do things like they used to have drone airliners they could send an airliner with no people on it just launched they we're gonna use that that was part of Operation Northwoods they were gonna blow it up they can't land them they couldn't land him in like 1962 but they could launch him so what they were gonna do is they were gonna have this plane take off and we're gonna say all these people are in and we're gonna blow it up in the sky and they were gonna blame it on Cuba and that was gonna be what led us to go to war with Cuba because that was when like the Russians were trying to put military bases there and they were gonna have missiles pointed at the u.s. from right over there that was the Bay of Pigs and all that shit like it got real hot and heavy there was this like like real showdown between the United States and Russia over Cuba and over them having missiles in Cuba and one of the things we're gonna do they're gonna armed Cuban friendlies they're gonna give like people that they were they had good relationships with they were gonna give them arms and have them attack Guantanamo Bay because we have a military base in Cuba and this blowing up this airliner was a big part of their thing everyone's make up a bunch of fake people they're all missing and have actors play their parents crying on TV all that kind of shit but they didn't had the capability in 1962 to shoot a plane up they couldn't land it like I said but they could definitely fly that fucking thing it's pretty crazy so you gotta think how many like remote-controlled like saucers do they have how many remote-controlled means some of the drones that they have now they look completely is early seventies the Martians landed in Hudson County Park mid seventies when they landed so but since then it's it's there's a ton of fuckin spots and people spotted those things in northern New Jersey yeah CIA admits most UFC most UFO UFC most UFO sightings in the 1950s and the 60s where our planes yeah they have all these crazy Jets apparently they're working on it was confirming in a report that the u-2 spy planes and test flights over the US coincided with a lot of the UFO sightings yeah I mean they think about that fucking have you ever seen one of those stealth bombers in real life you ever seen one flying overhead no dude it looks like you're in a science fiction movie it's like some War of the Worlds Star Trek type shit we were in Palmdale and we were doing fear factor and we saw several of them because fear factor started post 9/11 so it was like right after 9/11 it was actually one of the things that people saying one of the dumbass fucking reporter questions that I got when I was doing press for fear factor this lady goes don't you think that it's in poor taste to have a show that concentrates on fear right after 9/11 Wow like you fucking idiot they're gonna jump off a bridge with a bungee cord and eat a eyeball like yeah it's like the terrorist one you're right the terrorist one but my point being that like we when those things flew by we were out there in Palmdale and those things flew by because it was like a lot of military activity like it was right when the war was about to start they looked like they were from another planet man I know they weren't I know they were they were going they were going to Edward Edwards Air Force Base it's right out there didn't matter when you see him you like those are aliens like it feels like they're alien like you see that black fucking thing sound dude they're fast as shit and they look they don't look like any plane you've ever seen before they look like spaceships it looks like a scene in Star Wars well you have some sort of a star port and then you know in the background all these planes are landing and taking off into space but that's what we all thought we would be seeing by now anyway right we would all when you if you were a kid and he said hey Joey what do you think it's gonna be like in 2015 Oh fucking space travel for sure right everybody thought we'd have bases on the moon by now everybody thought would be flying around in jets everybody would be going all over the place and hover cars back to the future this was the year that 2015 was Back to the Future - when he comes in and ours all the cars flying around we had hot words ya know flying cars flying cars they do have will fucking kill you actually there's one that's supposed to be pretty good there's a couple different guys who've made flying cars but one of them has like these folding wings and you drive around like this and then when you take off the thing goes yeah clink clink and Shaun the way the wings come down and you fly like so you're driving around with the wings up and you can drive around town like a normal you know as good as like a Prius or something and then when you want to you lower the wings down well I've got traffic pick this motherfucker up right here I would need a large parachute on that fucking thing fuck that there's any drunk drivers in the sky now that's are all everyone's houses will have like a car in it at one point here I think once they figure out like Google Drive you know like Google's driving cars and they figure out how to keep cars in their lanes and have them avoid each other like no matter what they can't collide once that technology becomes like standard then I think you could might be able to have some sort of a flying vehicle but until they do you gonna have people like you ever watch people and like little private planes just fly around they fly this is fucking fly around I went with phil heartman he took me up to to look at real estate and we got in one of his he had a little single-engine plane and we took this plane up into the sky and we just flew he went wherever he wanted to like I'll show you were male blue he doesn't have to call somebody and say hey I'm gonna fly over by Malibu is that cool no he just does it like they and they hit each other sometime all the time one just crashed on Van Nuys yeah the only reason why more don't is cuz they're not more people flying yeah you know did you watch people fucking spin out like retards in this rain oh yeah oh so many people yeah I saw so many people crash in the rain they just forgot how to drive in the rain yeah I got some good videos I have that dashboard camera now so everywhere I go it records HD video and every night during the rainstorm just pull out save it to computer there's just tons of clips of people like running red lights almost hitting other cars they don't know how to stop it they don't know how to slow down it's it's amazing California we get rain maybe ten times a year a crazy here no people don't believe that but that is real right I mean last year did we get rain three times last year it was it even three times yeah probably wasn't right they say we need 11 trillion gallons of water to even out what we've lost in this three-year drought we're still in a bad drought right like that no that rain did anything right I mean it's better than no brain but we need 11 trillion gallons of North they're taking the water out of the ground recycling and using all the vegetation that's Bakersfield live off cherries fuck they live off strawberries shit yeah 60 minutes a couple weeks ago was on do company they're busy till fucking 2020 are they baking wells is that what they're doing no they come up and pull the fucking water from all the deepest parts of the earth and they recycle and use it again it's not a well no Dave Dave go deep look it up it was just on 16 minutes maybe three weeks ago really interesting shit all right I'm amazed that no one's figured out a way to take salt out of water they do yeah laughs but it's not it's commercially effective it's really a sewer water they they have the lure with sewer water and had the people drinking it yeah right from the fucking sewer and people drinking water look like this dog right from the zoo already was shit yeah bill gates IRISA ridges spills fucking old speakers in there drinking it like a fucking mojito and you pay for it and you pay for it but it's a little machine Oh tremendous do you think in the future we're gonna have our own water like it's the water is gonna be so you know bad that we have our own like I don't 20 gallons supply of water that we can use to cook wash ourselves then we pee it out clean it but it's our personal water like we you have to like keep your own water that's totally possible Yeah right it actually might not be the worst idea I would be happier drinking my piss water right cuz if you come one else's piss water she can hack it yeah and would you would you use your girlfriend's water like you would you and your loved one would switch waters cuz it's a little bit well here's the deal all of your water came out of someone's dick how about that dinosaur bellows do you think about it some animal most likely pissed away some water and it evaporated came down as rain and you know who I mean care water yeah water that I think the amount of water we have is finite like and even though we're like aw we're running out of water I think the water is going somewhere I mean it's still in earth it's like you might not be able to get to it it might be pouring in Seattle or I might be but it's all just water like somehow or another it gets reused it evaporates it comes down again it's all kind of contained in this crazy ball and they say that a lot of the water that we drink you know it's very likely some of it passed through an animal's body and was pissed out and was filtered down through the the like a stream like if you ever like seen a creek where you have like crystal-clear spring water that's coming down from a glacier like that of woolly mammoth mammoth dick pissed out some of this water and that water like seeped into the earth or get sucked up in moisture it's very possible that a lot of this stuff actually came from animals dicks mm-hmm so if we get to a point where we're so good at recycling water that you know when you're getting water even though it was poopy water or piss water or whatever there's nothing in there but water it's absolutely clear pure in the states and spirits yes beautiful art collects the spirits of the past can't get the spirit they drained the Hudson River to use that water how many bodies oh my god a bridge and through a bag of blow over oh yeah well hook his finger or a hooker condoms in that river they're gonna fucking eventually you're gonna clean it out with that machine they got a bunch of old machine horrifies it the whole thing don't they already do that with a lot of water they take sewage treatment and they they treat the water and then they put it right back into the supplies but they do right now that's you know our waters are that drainage the the le river or whatever that all gets clean and put back into this the faucets do you guys even drink faucet water anymore though I was think about to see how they I won't touch my wife but don't you cook with it that's a issue we all cook with water yeah yeah I guess but I don't I don't use my kitchen I just get out right but yeah I guess I do cook with it what if you like make tea or coffee no I have a arrowheads yeah people like to be bohemian use that city water I was watching some news show the other day I forget what town I man but it was showing I think with San Francisco they were showing all these different blocks well you couldn't drink the water right now like there was this whole area where they're saying don't drink the water if you live on these streets like what what are you saying like I have to just be on Twitter or I have to be paying attention to the news to know this what if I'm a guy that likes to read newspapers and sit at home for a few days and I'm drinking the water you knocking on my door are you telling people you assuming they have Facebook how you're just gonna make them drink this fucking shit water they should have stormtroopers knock on everybody's door don't drink the water but they don't I have hard water what's that cuz I like if I wash my car with my my car will be white when it dries minerals yes is that really bad for you or really good seems like it'll be good for you too I think some trace minerals are good for you but I don't know if like that quantity of minerals is good for you like hard water it's really hard but they say that that's one of the things that it's bad for people when you have distilled water as you drink distilled water it doesn't have any minerals in it like you can actually kind of fuck your body up if you only drink distilled water like distilled water something that wrestlers take a lot of times for they cut weight because when you drink it it flushes all your system out it flushes all the minerals and your but a lot of people are saying like I don't think Dulce fucks with that stuff I think a lot of guys are saying like that hasn't that good for you like you need those like that those elements of the water with minerals it might make it easier to to dehydrate yourself that way because your foot but it's not good like I think all that shit in water is actually probably good for you I'm laughing I got my old Cody Lisa drink distilled water potential health impacts of hard water here goes this is a pubmed study so it says in the past five decades or so evidence has been accumulating about an environmental factor which appears to be influencing mortality in particular cardiovascular mortality and this is the hardness of the drinking water oh shit in addition several epidemic epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the relation between risk for cardiovascular disease growth retardation reproductive failure and other health problems and the hardness of drinking water or its content of magnesium and calcium which is weird because magnesium and calcium are things that people take as supplements right there's like a fucking balance to being a person you know if you have if you drink a pound of salt you're dead you know that's fucked in addition the acidity of the water influences the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium in the renal tube tube you'll not only calcium and magnesium but other constituents also affect different health aspects thus the present review attempts to explore the health effects of hard water as constituents wow that's crazy man Alzheimer's disease is linked to Alzheimer's disease cardiovascular disease diabetes and cancer hard waters fucking terrible for you yeah that's weird man well the only thing I use it for is really just taking a shower that doesn't but is that bad for you because I know that like you absorb magnesium through your skin it's one of the benefits actually of like flotation tanks the absorbed magnesium for your skin mm-hmm yeah but maybe they need to do Studies on that maybe it's not good to absorb too much magnesium through your skin yeah I mean fuck I know you're taking magnesium though is like especially for men it's very beneficial there's correlations between magnesium and testosterone and zinc zinc and testosterone as well this is weird oh so it's a ratio of magnesium and calcium in the water it's a crucial factor indicating the hardness so I guess it's just like when shit gets really wacky there's concentrations of dissolved calcium and magnesium it's soft and hard water you're dealing with like hard numbers or yes yeah it's weird because like minerals are really good for you it's important like if you have minerals that's where osteoporosis comes from you lack of calcium your bars has drawn calcium out of your bones like one of the best ways to prevent it you take calcium but they also say that a lot of gold out of our farmlands like the vegetables that we're getting and the the plants that we eat a lot of them are nutrient deficient because a lot of the farmlands like they there have been like they've been grown shit on them for so long they kind of like sucked all the good stuff out of the ground it's dead you know if there's a gars in cuba they say they're not that good no more the reeling took some of the old time the Cubans say the fucking ground has been you know how many fucking leaflets can you get out of this it's 19 fucking 40 of protecting the dirt you got to use mulch you know you gotta use compost together like you replenish manure yeah and also compost is big to replenishing the nutrients like that's the thing about dirt is it's like you look at soil you think of it as dirt but it's like it's alive there's all sorts of shit in there it's not just like minerals there's organisms and worms and but you need worms like worms are great people add worms to their garden you like want them all living in there you know you want all that soil you want worm shit you want worms to shit you want them to eat the dirt and shit it makes it all nice easy to grow in those mushrooms I in Vegas things with good jack Joey was up til 5 o'clock in the morning never seen Joey I didn't sleep he didn't sleep I went right to the airport dude sleeps late to that I just giggles I just giggling my ass off it was tremendous what is Vegas like on mushrooms like what is the experience of the craziness of Venice really we went and did the show right walk off stage and I have a fucking handful wave but that was my Vega but then we went out we had some dinner but we didn't really walk and talk to fucking crazy people right you know I mean Duncan had that fucking meth guy after the show that was telling about his email address that's the you know the mushrooms when you go out in public any of those drugs it becomes something else it really enhances you know there's there's a couple different mushrooms you could take I mean of trips you know you could take the mushroom at home and become very whatever that word isn't to yourself I'm writing you could take mushrooms and leave and go for a fucking complete different Odyssey that's an odyssey when you out were like four friends and you reach fucked up and you have to be tight with those four friends so I don't have to look at you we don't have to communicate all I have to do is look at you and I can send you the fucking mushroom telepathically we know we'll lose each other in a bar and every couple of hours we'll just look at each other that's you know what's going on by that look like and your own body of tell you like you'll be drinking giggles and some wisdom joke and you'll look at that same time and we'll look at each other go and you go back that's the fun of it it's that certain connection with your friends with me Annie grew up on on mushrooms I was more of a microdot acid guy growing up all those type of loosely the Gennie's which were basically fucking poison but I had the same experiences my friends we go into large venues concerts we all didn't sit together but we'd always find each Duncan told me he took that kind of acid that's formaldehyde enough paid blotter acid on paper you know he said he has been taking pure stuff for a while he took this stuff and he was like it's so disgusting there's like it hurt my bones yeah why does it have strychnine that's all part of the process like when you smoke crack this fucking - turpentine in man you know - sell us the paper supposedly we were told it was to stick it to the paper it really is trick 9 is that of Snopes things might it might have been a Snopes thing I do know that when you when I used to have it in my vials and like sell it and I'm just like you got a sugar cube and I'll just drop a little drop on the sugar cube that never had the back or the bone problems you know with the liquid acid and the microdots didn't either this was worth like those little black ones that pretty much just had a bubble of acid right the liquid always work to me the liquid and the sugar cube or in the eye right there I hope I never did that was fucked me up I was very fortunate I got this I got to meet these guys when I was growing up there were hallucinogenic expert you know that's what they did they made that shit on the weekends all week longer they pumped it out to college kids but they pumped out you know grocers they would sell you 144 hits you know and that's all they did and they made 10,000 fucking hits everything a week and every time you went up there on Saturday they had something different yeah it's okay anti-drug educators frequently tell their students at some variant of the theme of inevitable strychnine poisoning through LSD use for example the strychnine is commonly sold as a cheaper substitute for LSD by unscrupulous drug dealers that strychnine is a byproduct of LSD synthesis that the body produces strict on as a result of LSD metabolism or that strychnine is used as a preservative to prevent the otherwise natural rapid decomposition of the LSD allowing it to be stored or that strychnine is somehow necessary to bond LSD to blotter paper none of this is true yeah these claims have you been believed to be propagated by drug users themselves in reality most hallucinogens caused some degree of mental or physical discomfort after the trip is over this is an indirect effect of the drug not strychnine or any other adulterant there we go they used to always also say that the old witch always seemed fake like so much strict on on that that it collects in your back and if you ever get in a car accident and hit that part in your back you're gonna trip forever yeah stores your fingernails and you know to your fingernails constantly grow that means you'll constantly be tripping it's amazing I met that guy last night did you it was one of them same guy I'm doing a documentary I'd love to have you involved to raise consciousness and expand consciousness sort of an overall sense of consciousness it's basically like the the vibe I'm on right now is sanity we care about money I'm just all about spreading peace and consciousness it's so funny those guys that you meet that follow you that are fans of you but the other day there was a few of them and we would play this game where like one would come up to us and as we talk about the ghost no but that christina pazsitzky was there and and he starts talking to me and Christina Christina said something to him and the next thing she know she looks over and I'm gone you know cuz I'm just it's kind of like hot potato you pass off the crazy person too it's one thing I'm not enjoying about being at the comic stores how people are pitching the ideas you can't just hang out there for guys pitched me ideas last night came up to me hey man I came here to talk to about this project I'm doing it really one guy was the history of the fart joke I'm not joking he's doing a documentary on the history the fart joke and I'm I'm and this is true I kind of no time for anything I give no time for other stuff I have exactly amount of time for the stuff that I'm doing right now and you know anybody that comes out to me hey can you do this cue do my podcast I literally don't have the time I just not available so I can't do it and so the guy goes well can I go through proper channels and talking without what what does that mean I just said no like I don't want to do a history of the fart joke documentary we don't have there's no proper channel like good luck even be great I mean look they knew that a documentary on corn would be great you could have an awesome documentary on the history of the fart joke I just don't have the time what's he like whatever dude here's a joke you pull my finger it was it was a good guy and wasn't a bad guy wasn't he was like really cool about it in comparison to how many other different people have come by with ridiculous ideas where they weren't cool about it where it's just like you know I had to tell a guy last night I'm like dude you got to stop pitching me I'm not pitching you I go yes you are I go I'm trying to have this conversation with Ari you've sandwich yourself in between us and you're telling me about this movie you're doing or this thing you're doing like I can't do it like you stop it's like you can't hang out there I don't get those you know when I get another business proposition well you need to move to Denver with Rogen and open up a weed store and when people come you pick them up at the airport do a tour of the city half your money to charity I really don't give a fuck anyway consciousness I don't know about fucking get up you fucking it's easy I don't want to hear about nothing nobody gets that shit you go to a town now you get 19 people wanna do a podcast I don't have the fucking time yeah they want you to jump in their car you fucking know you yeah I fucking know you I'll take you three minutes away 20 minutes in your fuckin the world that's 40 minutes in my fucking world when I go to a town I don't want to do dick once I got on that plane to go to any where the fuck I go I don't wanna do yeah I will do the radio that they have for me and that's it I've already done my podcast for the week I've done everything I going into fucking get a computer I got that little what's that new thing that the substance I don't even know what the fuck it is a surface surface tripping yes yeah you got one of those yeah little windows come yeah perfect

something you know what the fuck they don't get a joke they don't get nothing right you got to stop what the fuck you doing she runs into the computer room and jumps on my lap that's the end of the computer it's YouTube and they had a watch fucking something about the window what's raining it's not about animals and I love it but that's just how it goes so when I go to a town it's the fucking sit down and write a few jokes and fucking focus on the acts of tonight tomorrow night and I don't want to fucking drive 40 minutes say you tell me then they want to stop and introduce you to their

you're talking about they dude they have been coming out for the comedy stone full force full force accent the swarms of you told every show I've done in the past three weeks I've been hit up for something they don't bother me they just you know I love talking to those people I don't mind talking to people that's not the problem it's the people that are pitching shit just regular folks who want to come by and say what's up that's cool that's fun that's me you have great conversations some of those people it's the people that like interrupt other conversations just sandwich themselves in and gay I've got to talk to you about this movie we're about to jump off Seth Rogen's involve it's very big it's gonna be huge I've got a lot of Bobcat Goldthwait we're in negotiation let's shut the

get probably I don't have my sugar I mean I give a dessert every now and again but that's not even the point the point is like why would I do that why would I give some food to my kid from some strange lady that the first thing she says is I have a cake for your daughter like not hello not how's your night going not what are you guys up to hey that was a really funny show Joey you know what do you what are you wear yet next to you'd go on the road no it's like right away I've got a cake for your daughter out of here crazy shit is that I don't think people understand how creepy that actually sounds cuz they're from probably from a small town where it's like you know they're bringing apple pie over to strangers like your neighbor yeah and shit like that in the middle of talking to someone last night this guy comes over interrupts in the first words were his mouth hey man could do me a favor and he's got his camera out he wants me to make a video for him like no no no I can't do your favorite you don't even care that we're talking like it doesn't even bother you you're not excuse me can I ask you a question real quick is you guys free right now can I can I ask you something like right away can you do me a favor oh I'm gonna make a video I want you to be like get out of here no but that place needs a greenroom it does have one yeah but nobody uses yeah yeah yeah you use it in the main room but in the main room the other night a guy came in the guy weasel Denny was already already in the back and me and Russell we're talking about the other night it's ridiculous how I talk to my people but there's a line that I wouldn't even cross with somebody I'd love to go up to somebody me and Redman we breakfast in Atlanta we show up Tommy Heinsohn from the south excuse me you must I said yeah it's an honor to meet you even bother we want a fucking picture stop with your fucking bitches stop with the fucking pictures I'm gonna bother this fucking guy breakfast miss Tyne I was a fan I went things really says yeah not Bergen your second cousins with the Halloween yeah thank you for your time you left I didn't stop I'm not gonna stop him and get a fucking hug I don't give a fuck I really don't I've never given a fuck I've seen people like that's like all right whatever yeah I'm gonna go bother this fucking person get them I just I don't mind talking to people I love talking I became a comic I love it but there's a line that I you know when I go out at night I want to do stand-up nothing else I don't know what the fuck you're talking about we think I did on the way to the show do you think I smoke 15 joints I already got high you know and I already ate a fucking pot cookie I'm where I need to be you know if I want to smoke like this times I smoke with people but there's other times I'm already baked and I gotta get back on Laurel Canyon what if I get pulled over I got your shitty weed on my fucking breath yeah 90 days cuz you won't have it with that fucking big purple fucking fake weed you gotta shit forget it you know just enjoy it I just I don't want to get pitched I know where you're coming from I don't wanna I like talking with people it's the weird people before you go onstage so that's the only well sometimes people at the Comedy Store like literally they'll be introducing you and no people say hey man can I get a picture like do you you don't hear that guy you're like bringing me up on stage right now like you don't they don't care they just want to get that thing on their Facebook and that's a real fucking problem with the access to cameras people want to use him even if it doesn't make any sense that people weren't bringing cameras out in like 2000 when we go on the road people weren't bringing that many cameras with him we didn't take that many pictures of people most the time when you talk to people off the show you said hi to him took a few pictures of the folks but not and not everybody had a camera now every fucking person you meet every day has a camera that's a mind-blowing change between two decades ago yeah can you imagine like 20 years ago everyone just having camcorders walking around the circulars and the worst part is that you don't know when people are recording so like that that people where people are sitting there texting but they're just recording you oh yeah I was that with my girlfriend the other day and it was one of those guys are just sitting there staring like oh I know this guy I know this guy he's just he's sitting up with his camera just up like he's looking and I know he is just sitting there recording or doing something yeah people are fucking we're here it's it's a weird time like they the people have lost like their etiquette like and because this is such a new world like there's no etiquette as far as like cameras and and sticking them in people's faces or asking for photos like how many times you get asked while you're eating a mouthful of food hey man go get a picture like who the fuck would ever come up to you in the middle of eating you're gonna in the middle of hey man kind of talked about something like no this is not the time to talk to people these are people are eating food they're having a meal not only that they're they're sitting at a table looking at each other having a conversation it's one of the most enjoyable things we do as friends sit around and have a meal together you know it's like that's like that expression breaking bread you break bread with people and you what are you saying I can't do it in public or I'm gonna be interrupted every five seconds by somebody wants to take a photograph of course not most people realize that and they don't interrupt you while you're eating but some people do not give a fuck you could be eating with a baby on your lap mouth full of food answering the phone and they tap you hey man okay you get a picture huh get a picture hey man go get a picture hey excuse me can I get a picture I'd hate to be that guy but can I get a picture you hate to be that guy but you're being that guy I bought a new car particularly Joe I bought her off the lot I was the rush I left the indoor light on my car was dead on Cahuenga in fucking Hollywood at rush hour do you know that the guy that came over they say do you need help if the process goes hey man that was the worst thing ever when I'm on Cahuenga the car won't start I have fuckin groceries to call the key the fucking phone was in the car something and my car won't start I got these groceries I got to put him down pop the trunk and wait for somebody with a fucking this motherfucker pulls over I go you got jumper cables he goes no I don't but I gotta ask you something can I drop off a script to your age uncle and I looked at him like no you fuck it was like a Jersey boy Thanks what he wanted me to dance I couldn't fuck and he had met me one time he's just happy to see me on the street and pulled over in the middle of my flare and came up to me man do you think you couldn't go anywhere you were trapped and I looked at him I go you got to get the fuck out I give in I'm fucking serious right now you have to go to the proper fucking channels I take pictures with everybody ID everybody I do theatres and after this show I don't charge anybody I stay for hours I'll take hundreds of pictures there's lines we have videos of it of all these theaters where there's lines around spiral staircases and I'll wait till everybody's done before I go get something to eat I do it all the time this it's not like I don't want to meet people I want to meet everybody and be friendly but there's a certain the line that people cross that just shows they're socially goofy they're just klutzy and clumsy and those the exact type of people throws trying to pitch you something who the fuck have you ever pitched anything - who the fuck have you ever pitched anything - I've never pitched anybody an idea I've never come up to someone and said hey man there's this project if we had a name attached to it like you I really think you could jump off like I don't even know you like you're supposed to have an agent like there's a whole system of things that are in place for a reason you have a script the script is good the script gets read by reviewers a reviewers take it the agency represents it they bring it out they contact other people they say hey we've got this script we think that this could be really good script you have any actors that are we interested in doing this and then they contact the agents of the actors you have meetings that's how shit gets done you don't just show up when Joey Diaz his car is broken down and try to break into the business like well you're doing it wrong it's like coming up to me and saying hey man can I open for you absolutely not I don't know you you want to come with me on the road what a great idea a guy I don't know flying around with me being fucking weird and who knows how bad you suck you know you could be terrible I've had people that told me they've never gone on stage before but they know that they would be fucking awesome and if they could just go up during my show it would be the right kind of show to go up for because we have the same sensibilities oh what a great idea you should do knowable Mike nights you should just go directly to a bunch of people that paid to see me and I'll just let you onstage and you do whatever fuck you want to do I don't even know you a cool ass who says hey man I'm the best basically baseball player of all time and just like Dodgers should just let me play one day and just get out there and show what I can do do you want audition no man just let me hit the ball bro I'll fucking hit a home run a guarantee there's people out there they're that goofy there's a lot of a man and this just town it's like a magnet for him because some of them get on TV some of them get on a reality show and they're so retarded that they're compelling and then you listen to him I mean how many fucking look at Windy City Heat how about that fucking movie that's exactly what we're talking about Windy City heat is a diary of a madman I mean it's a fucking biography dombarris Jimmy Kimmel put together took this guy was out of his fucking mind and they had this guy convinced that he was a movie star and that he was some special he was a celebrity and they've they hosed him the entire way I mean the guy wasn't in on it at all and that fucking guy still around man and he still thinks he's uh he gets people coming to his shows he's a real headliner you have to hear what this shit that comes out of his mouth he's all areas it's kind of fucked up man because they've essentially taken advantage there's Bobcat Goldthwait that sick fuck look at that look at his face and he loves it and Dom Paris is the master of dealing with retards dombarris has a PhD in nuts if he knows how to deal with it who's the guy with the wig that's the the guy that fucks with scary Perry all the time ridiculous one of the big three but like those type of people with the people that you get at The Comedy Store I don't mind the

Marc Babbitt Oh Shh I have to go and listen to shut the fuck up Marc Babbitt that's your cocaine buddy oh those bags are the same that may believe there was something so important and at the end of the week we outlasted them we outlasted those fuckers those people were important too because look when Marc Babbitt was around I hate to be divided Babbitt was a great guy he was a great but the importance that houston look at Houston comedy went kaput after that it did go that's what I'm saying but he broke but no but he kept it alive he was like the Jim Jones of common he was given up you know recruiting young kids somebody bust them puttin that out for young kids you know it was you know the fuckin how creepy was a guy from his whole vocabulary he couldn't wait to say Spade he loved saying the word the spades no like David Spade Oh Spade David Spade Phoenix rather hard conversation stupid fucking Club in Arizona okay they're not coming to your dumb fucking comedy club in Tempe that year like that all those common you know I'll get him out of it you're friends with the guy that said that all wasn't worth funny once he got fired your letterman juice got lost that's the only reason why he would go to New York and go to a lot of it it's amazing the self-importance they add up themselves and at the end of the day they were worth nothing and what they don't know about comics is that 90% of comics a fucking horse they have zero loyalty so once those motherfuckers are gone they're gone like they try to call people say hey how you doing comics just hang up we have nothing to get from you no more we have nothing in common with you I've spoken to 20 club owners to the God that I've said that Jesus I call trying to call pilots you never return my call you got none forum well together this one night yeah from Peter to him to jump to more fabok to the guy in Phoenix call me I've reached out to 20 comics now what will happen you don't have a club no more guy I'm the only moron that causes your back cause I feel bad fee cuz you were very good to me you know Sarah and I was the biggest con ever think that she but Chinese check them worth for the improv guys you don't know what the word cunt was before Sarah died she was an asian chick that book Cleveland and Buffalo in the 90s and she would abuse you she would abused you like if I ever seein now I will get you better called domestic violence cuz I will smack her in the mouth well she that's threatening you know a lot of threatened jail on the Internet fuck this is terrorism she would this is against the patient she would book Miami Buffalo and Cleveland what she used to do to comics was fucking rude statements you hear are the opinions of Joey Diaz and joy gears and law my opinion my fucking heart that's that you know these people actually picked up this thing like they were important and they were no more important than Talent well I get yeah well I gotta tell you though in the the Co argument the counter arguments that is a mark Babbitt I think as crazy as he was was responsible for creating a scene like a creative scene no I with you they had a goddamn open mic night that laughs stop that was packed remember it would start at like 8 o'clock morning and next door they would be doing another show so they'd have a show in the main room which was a perfectly shaped perfectly sized room that laughs stop in River Oaks is one of the greatest clubs of all time well that fucking maniac ran it and yeah apparently there was some inconsistencies with the books and there was all sorts of issues according with the ball owners yeah it was it's not the back of Bill Cosby shit that he had at the base of that I have no no but here's the flaw - oh I had he broke my ball white Babbitt was one let me just tell you the Morgan babby story Mike babble went to Freddy Soto I sound looking for free tracks so Freddy came up to me at the copy store one day he was a man Mark Ballas little feature I sent them a tape I refused to send the tape especially promised the motherfuckin Tommy store ok I'm not saying you know fucking tape why is that I've got busy Shores Kombi story you want to

one day I went to fucking Ralph's bought a tape but an envelope a simple Joey do you stand there was nothing tape you know that motherfucker called me a week later and sale of my tape behind me is a

called him up and I said so that's what you're doing you mean to tell me that you're not gonna fuck you call me back a week later they gave me two gigs opening up for Paul Rodriguez the biggest feel is that we cool but I sent them a blank tape that's so funny then he called me I loved it it was amazing joy Danna Joey Diaz and I did a free show there once and he lost his fucking mind that we decided it was when my first CD I recorded a CD in he called me Pete little Houston that's a layer how fucking cold you must be listening yeah but that's good Pete Pete was the owner's son and they are they they found out some discrepancies Bobby came in the middle of 9/11 with everything see babbitt was doing that Carlos Mencia concerts with the blast stops money and then he would put the check back in on Monday morning so nobody knew there's an old fucking trick but I was a kid I know a guy that worked at a bank that would give you cash 30 grand on a Friday you better have that cash back by Monday at 9:00 a.m. or some people gonna come knock you the fuck out Ethan uh the bank bro so we take the money out yes like 30 kilo days you gonna give you 30 grand for a kilo but you better be back here Monday with my 45 so he pull it out of the bank pull it right out of the fucking Bank yeah give it right back to you I was friends with that guy for years I met him my sophomore year I was mailing something something fell I was looking on a lumberyard and that blow fell down when I went to pick it up at the end ago I was saying that I ripped I put in my pocket that night I went home there was two credit cards and two checks one for like 20 and will for like 18 and I was gonna use the credit card I was a young kid my mom I just died I didn't know what the fuck to do then I went to a buddy of mine who I knew his brother was a little fucked up and he knew those people and I said da got these two choco for 18 one for 20 he wrote his brothers number he's called my brother he'll take care of it for you I called the brother brother met me the brother had to be like 20 he came with like three other fucking mafioso season they go what do you want from this I go I want one of the checks you keep the other cuz you'll have your cash tomorrow don't those motherfuckers gave me 20 grand in the bank envelope when I was 16 years old the week John Lennon got shot don't you think though like we think about like how many guys that benefited from having babbitt run that club oh it was a great club was a great I'm just saying that I'm not talking about the job they did I was talking how most people ran around thinking there was a hand all Bo like there's a colada club owners that they get to a point and they get so cocky they're like you know how called Hollywood you'll never work again and people really trip you know when I first started his business is a guy that's the Holly the drummer from the Buddy Holly he had books in Texas he's a real cunt back what he does is he calls and he goes I'm gonna pay you 250 at night from Tuesday the Saturday and then what's the gig we comes up we only have Saturday well my kids ride from Boston to fucking New Orleans for fucking Saturday night no you know I'm not doing it so I was working with the guy I had a great relationship with the guy when I moved to Seattle and he gave me this week in New Mexico and I wanted to go down and had great clubs in New Mexico at the time sure enough two more phone calls me because there's only one night and Saturday night I go talk I believe this Seattle know I could have gotten on there for the other money but I can't go for one night this motherfucker told me if you fucking cancel on me you'll never work an improv you'll never work for nobody I waited to the night of the gig and I call this motherfucker at 1/4 day he kept calling me a major where are you and I kept calling back I'm 30 miles out how about correlate I call this motherfucker I said don't you ever threaten me again that looks like your mother's headlining that motherfucker it's so then a couple years then I go to Houston that's our there's some guy he's looking for somebody go to Mississippi tomorrow I feel like 300 bucks and I go I'll do it and they told me the guy god that's the guy I beat they forgot Columbine about this third that movies just give me the gig for three bills he goes out your name sounds really Kwame tomorrow the next day because I remember you you ever got a coffee attempt a Tommy hooked up my mother the headline that's the shit that bothered me that's my thing that we're young was stupid when I Eve and we believe and those people take advantage of us it's like anybody else taking energy he Babbitt was a great guy but the reason why the Houston Tommy says the way there's because Babbitt fuck with those kids had at some point he had them like bitches don't look at me don't make eye contact one more fucking floor look at the kid that Bob at the Comedy Store you never did calm me again Babbitt had him telling them you're gonna be bigger than Carlos you're gonna be bigger than this guy gonna be bigger than this you know thanks Bill Hicks you know well he did have bad taste right he would tell you a guy I want this guy to open for you and you would go what are you talking about like what are you fuckin crazy I'm not gonna have people pay to hear that guy talk like he would have guys that were they had nothing there was nothing there it's one guy who would just memorize these like fake rants it was like this long for he was like have these the big deep breaths in between the rants and just rant this thing out like all these stats and numbers and you'd say all the shit and it was because he had memorized it all that it was so impressive but there was no funny in it there was no comedy at it was like us a trick it was like he memorized all the stuff that's crazy Brandon wasn't it huh and then everybody go oh that was great he did that thing and that was his whole Act these rents but they weren't like it wasn't like a rant like he had a point or at me like a bill burr rap well you know where it's a rant but there's all his jokes point and shit out and you laugh and no there was nothing at the end in the end you would clap he was well he was one of the beginnings of alternative comedy like people go see him oh my god that's such a brilliant you know because when Jesus George wrote that song and you're like Jesus what the fuck are you talking about okay he faded away and he cracked he became a bard time there was something and that's what you know couple Maya my breakthrough in my life really came by did analyze that and I met that director when I met that dude that was that they told to go fuck himself outside that live what dude is that our Ramos oh really yeah now really changed my life dangling to our I had a great talk to him about comedy and he goes i watch the tape why don't you go to Montreal wait a minute yeah a tape I had a stand-up tape at the time gave a tape to him I fuck you that's how I get to stay that's how a rapist I put together and go fucking so I know yes at that time I went to I went to see there's no the rules no no I wanted to see this lady for a movie and she goes you're not perfect for this movie but my next movie gonna be good for us because I want you to keep in touch with me and it was Helen chana what that bitch is bad like that bitch just hangs out with De Niro she was just doing that she did Bronx out she did Bronx Tale those type of movies and she really took a liking to me so she would tell me except me everything you got I want to push you for this morning by me for you to send me what you got so I only had at that time I only had the mezzos I had that gay mafia thing that's all I had so I put stand upon her I had it really good said somewhere and sent it to her and I'm about how a rain was pulling me on he was your natural these pricks I see in Montreal I ain't got dick on you I mean this guy said shit this is Harold fuckin rabbit and he's the I know my god he was like don't take shit from these bullshit from these pussies because once you take it it's like the compliance Clemenza told Michael bitch they shoulda stopped Hitler in Munich once you take this shit and I remember I shot that movie in like September and that October I did that know that December of Pete from the goodness of his heart used to headline me and he was in the first guy to ever hello I'm he was Pete Houston that's why he still calls me and I give him the respect as a man I still call him in fact nobody else feelings feature me he was headlining he's like you're a bad motherfucker he saw me with Pablo in Houston he's like I'm gonna headline you so he would headline me in Christmas for two weeks and pay me choke before anybody paid me I went down and did blow went crazy but that wasn't the point boy I went crazy no I wish to go crazy not happen I just watched my episode of coke case after two weeks in Houston I was like 400 pounds my neck was swollen from the sodium and the fuckin inositol and choline in the cocaine my neck was swollen I would go to use them just eat that barbecue everything do burritos backward and I got a call from a guy improv and this guy it's pretty cool guy it's what I say man you know this is a true story Joe it's like January 6th of 2003 and I had just done analyze that and this is the first time I was an attached with hair already said to me he goes both take shit from Billy's Kambli guys and tell them all to go fuck

right now no listen to conversations about you know well that's anti-competitive practice no the competition they hang on the conversations over and he goes no it's not good you just won't work any of our improv yeah that again to me I go say that again I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna bang your head off their fucking desk Joe Rogan just like that I wasn't one of those cocaine morning movies like 10:15 a bad time to catch me in those cocaine days because I was probably broke and thinking oh where am I gonna get my next fix from and you're calling me threatening me at 10 and 15 the more telling me I can't work Houston when you don't do dick for me and I said say another word I'm three or I'm three blocks from your office I'm gonna go then I'm gonna bang your head off you know I said you're gonna say something I'm gonna say something you're gonna say something I'm gonna seize them but I'm three blocks from your office oh my god I'm gonna bang your head off you fucking didn't call nobody I thought I was done at The Improv and do you know that two days later I got a motherfucking car with three weeks from The Improv as a feature spot in Southern California so sometimes you got to put your foot down with these creepy motherfuckers dawg because they get a power up two in LA nothing happens to you til they see you on television they treat you like shit once they see you in a commercial you know what you may not be that motherfucker but you might become that motherfucker so they don't give you everything they still break your balls but they don't now they know that you're real this motherfucker could strike yeah that's the most important thing with me that every year I keep throwing jabs at them so they capped off all the shit they want but I'm still alive motherfucker you follow me so you can say all this shit they were together yeah but I'm still here with the fucking you when a company has too many rooms like that and they want too big of a piece of pie and then they want you to stop doing the other rooms that are in town that you've had a relationship forever whether it's Atlanta or Denver Denver they had a big issue in Denver where you know when you go there Wendy will tell you the whole fucking story about it she she had this meeting with people they were gonna open up another club in town and they wanted to tell her they were you know they're gonna either go into business with her allow her to buy in or you know they basically run her out of town she's like oh yeah good luck with that what are you guys gonna do for open mic nights it's one of the things she asked him and they said we're not gonna have an open mic night she goes okay so let me get this straight you sell it's like if you sold widgets why wouldn't you make widgets you got to get your widgets from somewhere else like why don't you make your own widgets like you're not gonna develop any widgets and they're not thinking in terms of like long term especially like someone like Wendy's the best-case example Wendy in my opinion is the reason why there's a Denver comedy scene like her supporting those two clubs that comedy works for to the best clubs in the country she's a reason why there's a scene in Denver but she's the best case scenario she's a cool person she loves calm and she's fun to be around she does it right but then you got like a Babbitt that you got to deal with his shit or you got Tom you gotta deal with his shit well I didn't have to deal with it but you got to deal with it you know and these people they're responsible for the fucking scene they're a big part of the scene Babbitt was responsible for the scene it's obvious when he once he left the scene went away he was a he was a key cog in that wheel you know and when you got a person like Wendy or a person like Babbitt that's like a big player in the whole scene like they're so important because otherwise all you have is LA in New York and Chicago barely has a scene what's the Chicago scene like Chicago is record ripa - rocket is it ripping rockin now yeah where what's club you got zany's which is downtown's a great club do they have an open mic night I don't know but the Laugh Factory is doing great really more than my buddy is fucking kicking ass over there's the manager dog he he sells out on Friday and Saturday - no hammer that's how good Brian Boyd's going after Brian Morton walked into that laughs factor sound to be a County man and Jay Bruce honest said well yeah buddy who was your favorite comedians he said Joey Diaz Larry motherfucker sure feel he said the guy turned pale he hired them and the dudes over there ripping that fucking place apart so who does he have local guys helpful guys oh he's got a local school but zany's is great that one Richmond or the other one Sandi's has three of them yeah there's there's um what's the one that's just outside the airport is tremendous I've done the other one that's just outside what is it what is that it's a glitch Oh how was shooter special there I went often so who's doing the open mic nights though there's a couple clubs now there's a couple of this what other club in Chicago the Laugh Factory is gonna open my sysm economy's seen a lot of places now you'd be surprised you know Mike Epps won a club in Miami he did Miami huh yeah does he live down there I don't know I don't know the particulars I just heard that but there's a lot of comedy going on do you think you would ever want to own a club yes seems like it would be a huge fuckin headache it would be a huge headache depending on how you did it I think that the club's their opening now a huge headings because a there's a couple years ago I was a very good tastes like dick the reason why is because these headless fucking people that never grew up on Dairy Queen they bought it as an investment they mixed it with orange juice no no no they're from another country and they went to somebody they thought that was the best thing would you go when I go to the Dairy Queen in Tennessee that motherfuckers on there for 41 years when you go in there you could tell he knows his Iceland same thing with some of these clown knee clubs now for some people their investments and they come and go it's the people will really love comedy and I will tell you one thing Wendy was there when I walked into that Club in 1991 January 18 June 18 1991 when I walked in fact hobby club when he was there I'm gonna tell you something else Wendy was doing things at that club 24 years ago that nobody else is doing she was putting motherfuckers in like Bobby Collins on a Tuesday and Wednesday nobody was doing it and having a different headline to come in Wednesday and Thursday then have a different headliner coming Friday and Saturday don't tell me because I was there Wendy is really good at what she does Wendy is one of the top three County people in this three Wendy could make a call and shut your fucking lights out if she really wants to win the deals with everybody everybody likes one thing Wendy loves comedy when Wendy dreams at night she dreams of an orgy [Laughter] okay Wendy dollars I respect Wendy I never had a problem Wendy Wendy asked me to leave I was a man it was business it wasn't my copy or wasn't that she hated me it was something that happened she's a real I've never I never used one thing I'm talking about 50% ease people that they actually become the end-all be-all in comedy and we're scandal and they fuck with us they fuck with you Joe they fuck with you a lot of levels but do you imagine what it would be like to fucking deal with comedians I mean they develop this Jay it's like if you deal like if you're a woman okay and you're walking down the street and everywhere you go man they're fucking cat calling you and yelling shit out you and freaking you out and you run into a guy in elevator you're automatically gonna be like what you know you're automatically gonna be like Jesus Christ another guy like I'm tired of getting hit on by guys if you're a fucking owner of a comedy club and you're dealing with wacko comedians all day long constantly think about all the people that we know that are fucking crazy crazy crazy people that we've dealt with over the years at the store where the craziest bunch of the world but there's a certain way to deal with there used to be a guy in San Francisco at the punchline that you catch or what I was fucking there's another cunt that you go up there and there was no list he pointed you to tell you he was next and you had to sit down like an ugly girl at the prom and hoped that he would put your ha and after there was 50 people at the other night Agora everybody got to see you next week it was like on the waterfront when those people went and they would get called all Union jobs right morning you're working for that you're working you're working the rest do you go home he didn't know way to make you feel bad Todd Sawyer did the same thing the people at Cobbs he's doing open mic on Mondays I heard people used to call them club owners ago I'm sending Joe Rogan up there to do it okay then he'd come up thing have a spa fee bitch I came all the way up to San Francisco and I'm like I'm saying right that wasn't a douchey things well how about Jamie makes people wait in front of the Laugh Factory don't make them sign up in the morning and wait all day in the Sun in LA it's a hundred fucking degrees outside and there's a line around the side of the building a people waiting to go on stage for three minutes and there that's actually waiting in line to go next week you don't you you have to wait in that whole entire line but just sign up to for next week's show where you have to wait in line again so that it didn't used to be like that it used to be the week of okay do you uh you go someplace and they sign you up and you come back and si listen you get as many minutes as people you bring your earning your keep that's one thing I rather know where I stand and get fuckwit that's the leg I'm talking about really you need a tape of me you just saw about the store what the fuck do you need sure why do you want to tape who the fuck are you in your fucking shit down to wanna take from me a fucking comedy The Comedy Store you called me you want a tape go fuck yourself I'm not sending you a fucking date it's against my fucking will it's like these people now with movies and TV Joey they they want you to do a co-star but they want you to send the real no don't send shit Joey but they know it's a co-star they could offer it to me and if they don't that fine I'll do my podcast now live another week that's the mind and eventually they'll go this motherfucker isn't gonna we might as well give it to him I'm not doing it for that you want me to fucking be a guest star reoccur you want to give me a series regular I'll give you a fucking tape and I'll fucking from down and talk to you before a co-star we've been doing this look at the IMDB what fucking tape you got something you to decide let me see your fucking tape let me see your fucking tape he said you know fucking tape even then I had my fucking pride even then I wouldn't send the fucking paper I refuse I finally sends a blank tape he gave me an answer I never have respectful again because I found that it was a power play it was like you're on my court you know you want to give me some respect or respect will you do you're a pimp you take 20% of what people come to the fucking door what the fuck do you do what have you done you can't even play the fucking ukulele the fuck you do you can't put a fucking ukulele what the fuck have you done that's my that's where I'm coming from I didn't want one cell phone as a Babbitt they did great jobs it was the shit they pulled that I didn't fucking like I used to bring Joey in the road me like way back in the day we started going the road together what like the late 90s yeah we started going on the road together and I would bring him to clubs and they would go you know I just don't think your friend is a good fit for this club I mean it's uh you know he's I like what he did you not hear the people laughing I go there they're all laughing you hear all those people laughing yeah it's just on our kind of comedy like what kind of comedy is that I know you don't like funny comedy like I've had guys tell me that he makes me look bad this is like way back in the days before people knew who he was and they were like you know let's just say we just don't think he's that good and it's just not what we want for our club and I'd be like I'd open the door listen to that you hear buddy laughing what's that you know and they didn't have these ideas especially in the 90s they had ideas of like what comedy was and there was a lot of pressure to be clean there was a lot of a lot more push now before the internet once the internet came along slowly but surely it's sort of expanded everybody's idea of what's acceptable like even things on television are so like look at the fucking scene in the walking dead I don't tell you spoiler alert where they hit the people over the head with a bass they cut their throats that was on fucking cable television it's not on HBO I mean and they showed it in the most graphic way possible I don't think people would have accepted that before the internet had come along I don't think people accept that but now like our ideas are like what you could say what you can't say they're all so different and you can get famous from the internet and because Joey's become famous from the internet you know I get to say like see I fucking told you I told you you were wrong you had this idea that everybody had to fit in your cookie cutter world and they thought that I was like a sick fuck for thinking that you were funny I'm like I'm not the only one like you're not hearing the rest of the crowd but until someone comes along and puts you on a television show or puts you in a movie then they don't want to take that chance they don't want to take the chance on this wild man you know it was you is Ari Duncan was the only one that nobody ever complained about nobody ever complained about me doing it Duncan someone there you know he's a good joke writer but he's also not what he is now he's got much more offensive yeah he's got again I don't want to spoiler alert it but he's got some great fucking jokes but it was this idea that comedy couldn't it couldn't be like what goes on at the store it had to be like what they saw on MTV it had to be what they saw on Comedy Central you know how to be censor chest Joe they saw what they want to see I saw a fat little ugly Mexican woman for years killing late Marilyn Martinez oh yeah and then one day and the girl couldn't pay her rent and then one day a girl by the name of Lisa went Bentley came around with the same act only she was a white girl she fucking killed and they went crazy over well Lisa don't kneel you did Martin you don't know what they're gonna go for what comes out of my mouth and look I've seen people say worse than me and they love them and they love them you know I've ever got one for a showcase for two and a Half Men before the show you were started do you know that they were looking for comedians for sidekicks at the Laugh Factory 10 years ago we all went on a Monday night and there they were Bobby there was they really like me but he's a little too dirty for our show I never watched a show about five years ago when there was a hotel huh the whole show is about sex was all about Charlie Sheen being a pervy an apartment that was like so what we what was your point that night embarrassing me taught me I was dirty I always found that you guys chose picked on a little magic club I remember he thought you were too dirty hurry was allowed to go he was a gentleman because he told me to my face yeah that guy for the comedy magic club I give him the utmost respect because he told me on the Saturday night after I went there bombed he pulled me aside and enjoy I think this is the last time you can't you don't want the fuck up with him answer me and I'm not bad I think he's got that Jay Leno crowd right and he told me to my face all I want go dog Joe Rogan and I know that you I've been fucked it's a little bit that's why I am as defensive as I am I don't have time for these people and I didn't have time for them once I made up my mind that I was working hard and that I was doing the right thing I didn't let people influence I didn't want to go to Montreal no more they can't then I'll hold on since 2004 I haven't want to do nothing I don't wanna do nothing they were part of you don't see me I don't bother nobody I'm in my own circle nobody sees me I go to the store I'm not a part of the battle want it they don't want me and I don't want to include but I'm gonna keep doing what the fuck I do it is I keep getting funnier I'm gonna keep getting funnier I'm gonna get a hold this and you're gonna be what a fuck you gonna be you're gonna keep saying you don't like my style of comedy how bad are you gonna look that's been my life since day one though I've always been trying to prove somebody fucking off of something no they don't like that can't be trusted well I'm still fucking here 15 years later and there's been no problems and nobody's missing a fucking head so few people couldn't trust me and you're wrong too if I wanted to rob you I would have robbed your long fucking time ago it would be my pleasure to rob some of these bullshit about me that's how I roll is you know stuffed up or something nobody knows is not working at all is it when I blow it do you I did I went before but you want tissue papers yeah I just thought there was something wrong doing that weird cracking noise I thought it was like it was static hang out I see yeah they do to people I see what they don't I know I could city a cry some some amount of energy is you know it's good to recognize it and just see what it is but you know some amount of energy start talking about too much it becomes time and now I the best line any Griffin ever said was when he went to see Amistad he saw a white people walking out covering their faces I love seeing people that didn't like me 10 years ago I smell it well do you remember that one time was not mentioning names but there was this one agent that would tell me that you weren't talented and then one day you and I weren't first-class he walked past us into coach Cho Chang and Joey was laughing at him look at this fucking bum off get back there where you belong I think these guys get a little god complex and they're not God because they don't know the work and the effort we put into it they're my feelings a lot of my feeling well you win Joey but it was the man than they ever did because it's like they made it hard for you yeah they made it hard for me no they're not around not there's so many people were not a lot of comics who came to their stop fucking barreling through the storm arch your deals this and that and they fucking disappeared and then there's guys like me and Ari let me tell you something I'm gonna tell you something to your face right now you to read bad what are we did in front of me in Vegas is some of the best material ever in the last two years I'm gonna tell you that right now killing the biggie small stuff so everything about shit in China guys and me that's materia I've heard the last two years and for your motherfuckers that had your complaints about happen but somebody coming out a club owner telling me million one of his first big jokes his texting and shitty playing video games I'll never forget that owner saying that was the worst bet he ever heard in his life and me going I'm not a fucking moron that doesn't know anything about what we're doing what was the same thing it was like there was no TV credits and I would bring you guys to open and they would just decide that you weren't ready or you weren't good or that I was picking the wrong horse and you know they would tell me that they would tell me that like these guys they're not that talented I'm like yo you're out of your fucking mind like I know what funny is I've been around funny for a long time if I was a talent scout I mean my my record frilly picking guys to open for me that are funny that turn out to be like big headliners it's not undisputed like just every one of them everybody became a big headliner you know all of them it's like comics know what's good and you're not gonna be good every night there's not gonna be good every joke every time you try new shit you run the risk of it not working but the guys who try new shit are the guys who are good and the guys you know sometimes the sets go bad sometimes things go awry but that's because you're taking chances is these this cut cookie cutter bland non offensive stuff that's not exciting to me what's exciting to me is people that do wild shit and take chances but when you don't have credits man they automatically assume look I that the difference between and my experience have it happened for me really quickly but the the difference between how people reacted to me before I was on TV and how they reacted after I was on television like the gigs that I could get places that I could work are the same act but all of a sudden just one or two TV credits and all sudden they let me in all those like early TV credits that I got like caroline's Comedy Hour and MTV half-hour comedy or as soon as I got that I was in it's just like they needed a pass they needed to be able to say oh this guy's approved by a higher power you know whether it's MTV or whatever it is then you're on a sitcom like you could work anywhere when I was a kid I watched Pryor Jamie Vernon can hold a big ladder and I used to watch Pryor whatever Kenneth Bryan red band got a pee on him I always thought that was the best time for comedy in our lives but I gotta tell you something right now in the last 100 years I'm not talking this out of my ass you could go home and think about what the fuck I'm telling you right now is the best time that commie has ever been oh yeah but I you want yeah they gave us great they gave us Gleason they gave us this guy they gave us that guy and how good really worthy you know now today what we have is we have what you fucking idiots buy into the shit that they shove down your throat but guess what's also happened the Underground has become mainstream because of the Internet so you don't this shit that they were pushing at you 20 years ago the shit they're pushing out here in these fucking commie channels anymore it's not the end-all be-all now you motherfuckers are figuring out for yourselves that they've been shoving shit down on the fucking throats well will you know and what I know is there was this period of time for more than ten years where they were focusing on what they thought what the agents and the managers thought was clever or inside comedy like comedy that the comedian's thought was appropriate there or that that like certain groups thought was appropriate like you got that alternative movement and they were trying to push that hard like this was the hip guy to be attached to this was the hip got and how many of those guys did we want just fucking die welcome die and they walked around like they were doing something different yeah like what they were doing even though it wasn't funny it was better it was better welcome because somehow or another you awkward because you talked about getting your dick sucked or doing coke like always tips oh who wants to hear that it's funny that's what you're missing you're missed like and that's one of the things that freed us with podcasts because you don't have to constantly like express yourself in a way where people have this you know this idea of you onstage you don't have to present who you are everybody knows you they know who you are so when you're talking about something on stage yes this is what I think it's funny about this you don't have to like this is what it's his philosophy how does he feel about the New World Order what is his thoughts on chemtrails how does he feel about it is he equal rights is he pro-choice you don't have to say any of that like do you don't have to excel as a left-wing guy or a right-wing guy but that was like a big part of comedy for a while was like people would do stuff that would establish himself like guys would say things that weren't funny at all but like you know if you wanna like Bill Hicks had a fucking bit about if you want you know if you want people to not have abortions you fuckin raise those kids you fuckin raise those kids yeah okay where's the joke there was no joking it because back then if you had an important point you wanted a sandwich that point in between jokes because in people a lot of times this day people get upset at that commie and rightly so and they say it's preachy you're using your your your time on stage to preach instead of to be funny and you can do both and if you didn't if you're not doing both you're taking a shortcut because you you you you have an advantage you're on stage if you're on stage and you start talking about something you have a point of view about Republicans or Democrats and it's not funny it's just your opinion if I'm in the audience I'm like I disagree you know I think this my opinion and it differs it I don't want to hear your opinion how come I can't talk about my opinion but if you'll onstage with your opinion and you make me laugh well that's different because then like you've planted an idea in my head that I might not ordinarily accept ever but you've maybe laugh with it you know and like ari says fucked up shit all the time that I don't agree with but it's hilarious because he's not necessarily even saying it cuz he agrees with it he's saying because it's a funnier thing to say you know you do that - you say Sharon's things I know you don't really mean but you it's fucking funny and I talk about it I talked about in my last special it's a very important point that we do we say shit we don't really mean because it's funnier that's what comedy is and for the longest time there was this idea the comedy had to adhere to like certain rules and aren't for it to be highbrow or certain rules for it to be considered alternative or sophisticated or you know this is you know this is progressive stand-up comedy like but you're missing the funny part it's missing a lot of that to become this other thing it's like fit into this ideology to be accepted you've missing a lot of the funny like it's not in there like you certain things you don't talk about you won't talk about sex you don't ever talk about sex like you're on stage you don't talk about sex that seems a ridiculous to me like that's that seemed just outrageous and someone says like oh how could this guy be good he's doing jokes about I've heard people say that like you told me this guy's doing jokes about jerking off like yeah that's really challenging um I don't I'm not asking him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro alright I'm asking him to tell jokes that are funny that make me laugh I want good stuff you know and doesn't matter what it's about if it's funny it's fucking funny and those people have this idea and for the longest time they push that idea but now the floodgates are broken now the fucking the Brody Stephens are running through I mean everybody's running through Brody could be mainstreaming Brody's like squeaky clean but it's like nobody could figure out what to do with Brody and then all sudden people realize like we got to put him on TV in some way Ikeys fucking goddamn hilarious like how can we figure out a way to get that guy on TV and you're the same thing and Ahri's the same thing it's like the Internet has allowed people to see what you really are you know it allowed people to see the unit and all you had to do is I see the numbers of the podcast that get downloaded and then they go well I guess we got to get on board here and then they all just get on board it's 2015 a lot of these comedy clubs don't even know about the podcasters yeah it's amazing and I'm like this is your realm of business and you have no idea how to you know no I'm not doing a pike you have guys have no you just want somebody comment no no you guys have no idea no concept you in the fucking entertainment business don't know within a year or two within a year or two everyone will know it'll be the most important thing that they invest in every comedy club if you have a local scene every comedy club should have a podcast chef your own podcast how hard is that you got a guy coming in for a week to tell me hey come down you're gonna do this radio station you gonna do that radio station you can do our podcast for an hour we'll put our podcast up that day everybody is addicted to the podcast they know who the guys are they're gonna be on that week a nichts Apollo's in town he's gonna be doing the blah blah blah club podcast you know the fucking ice house Chronicles podcast or the fucking flappers finale for hot fest whatever the fuck you know name it up the Comedy Store countdown you know whatever the hell if every club should have its own shit so like you you have a guy who's you know maybe not the store it's not a headline club for the weekend but any club that's like the like zany's in Nashville they should have an hour podcast they release every week with the headliner how hard would that be you know have a local guy host it have them understand that the idea is to just shoot the shit with this you know if you had a good local guy you could do it and you do it under the name of the comical but maybe even switch hosts out like maybe you have the middle guy in the headliner every week do a podcast together that you would get a lot of people addicted first of all addicted to that podcast and excited about going to the club that week we got yeah I mean how hard is it you know he's been doing that for a while was the Atlanta yeah because I remember that much longer viewing you a long time ago Jamie yeah yeah fuck yeah that was uh Jesus that was like when we first started doing podcast it's me been longer than that maybe did he have a podcast before we did yeah I think I remember him interview you interviewing you in the office and this was like when you threw me up on stage the first time back from my break which was like six years ago you're right it was probably before we even started ours yeah yeah yeah he had a he had a good sense of it well that's a good club too that fosters local talent there's a lot of local guys that come out of Atlanta that they are actually moving the punch line that they're losing their location Oh No yeah they're moving to another spot apparently that they had always had an issue with parking there and apparently just got a problem in that green room Oh didn't they have that laughing stall - it's a great fucking spot laughing skulls a great spot yeah and I'm gonna tell you something else about Wendy and her defense in 1994 Wendy hired two headliners to help the open mic is develop do you know that hired them like to help him write the material you would meet at 6 at the Comedy Works she buys she'd cater it get like tacos and you sat around and you wrote material with the headliner and then you went did the open mic and the headliner great in you Wow a lot of clothes 19:34 bat woods was the guy who gave me the talk who told me get your life together don't come back here you're funny but you're wasting your time right that's how I got that she used to paint bat woods Wow and she paid a couple other guys man so that's how much she had foresight but she really believes developing they give you three minutes once a month at the Comedy Works that's what it used to be so then you had to work around town you gotta do McKelvey's what's that got to do those open mics you know but when he always did try to homegrown her own comics you know all those holidays she puts locals you know any time she could sneak locals in there you know they have our lineup is killers a lot of people used to bring their own people because then I'm like working that because she'd have records you know ty Jordan Steve McGrew and some guy had to come and follow and it was hard for them it's really so they guys would bring in their own acts because the local guys were too strong she always had so it's like the comedy store so what if I call the copies go and say all right I'm coming in for the weekend Thursday Friday Saturday I'm working it but there's no feature or emcee it's the Comedy Store lineup so I'll go in and it's you Barrett and Sebastian and I'm going up to add line I don't want to follow that mess yes that's work jack hmm so a lot of people started bringing their own Wendy's very smart Wendy had a club in Tampa when the comedy forks first when I first got involved with the comedy works they had Tampa and Fort Collins really and whether used to send me up Tampa Florida Tampa Florida and Fort Collins I used to go to Fort Collins when I first started when they sent me to Fort Collins every Tuesday every Monday as I'm Wednesday they did an open mic for comics did five minutes and then they've started a regular show and they closed Fort Collins they closed to hamper and they kept that because Deborah was her bread and butter once she wasn't she gonna open in Chicago at one point in time - yes yes but why he's very smart man what he knows that you're not gonna do the job nobody's gonna do the job you're doing unless they love comedy as much as you do right Wendy's very hands-on yeah and you get somebody to run your club that loves you go you know you you've been to a club when you walk in you yeah these people don't know what the fuck they're doing I think this guy was at a an Olive Garden for eight years he's doing Tom it doesn't fucking translate like Chicago is broad I mean the guy was watching us we couldn't smoke dope we couldn't bring people up on stage yeah he had some craziness going on once and they were freaking out he's got people on stage with you we can't have it the greenroom we came out to Bob Marley exited us oh I don't know we have this dentist music well God went to a kind of all I know yeah they were trying to do some goofy shit you know that you know what's funny there's two things that happened there was like two shifts and bringing you guys on the road with me the first one was like people didn't want you guys cuz you were too dirty but the second one was why you bringing these guys are too good this is like there was there was a shift somewhere like in the 2000s or you know I tell people you know Joey Diaz comes on the road with me I like tell like you have Joey Diaz open for you on purpose like why the fuck would you do that but it's what you were talking about with this Denver thing like people don't want to follow people that are strong like funny acts but it doesn't that make it fun for everybody for everybody like why is that why is that a bad thing you know I mean that's it should be the opposite attitude I mean if you've worked on your comedy and your comedy is good you should be excited that the whole show is really good and you just ride that wave going after especially if you are friends with the guys who are on the show with you if you love them you want them to have fun you want everybody to laugh at them because you love them and then you just like we did this show we just didn't Vegas that fucking show was amazing that was a fun show it was re Duncan Joey me and the Mirage that fucking Terry phaidor showroom is so good they have they set it up for that ventriloquist dude so the voice has to be perfect you know you have to be able to hear his voice is act so they the speaker system is amazing you're in the I was in the back of the room I could hear everything like crystal clear when you were on stage I was in the back of the room not this time but one of the other times we did it you hear everything you say crystal clear it's perfect it's amazing room but just to emphasize that you know while the comics listen to these shows these podcasts and they walked around like I did fucking scared you know and then one day I got it I'm like fuck these bitches this is my mother fucking playing field and if they don't like it they gonna go down and my life changed my comedy changed my outlook changed you know I let them scare me the same way I let people scare me about life you know when I was young and we'll dance and fuck you motherfuckers and this is saying thinking I'm happy I did that we calmly I would have been running scared you know this car bonus of course you know hey next time there's a club owner that I've worked for years ago man you should put something on that joke and then after you got off the second show he's like you didn't add my tag bitch I don't fucking know you you said that to you there's some fucking jerk oh that's still around I don't wanna you know he would come up to me and say all this tag would sound better I can't you know get the fuck out of mine that learn the way hope you tell me again you gotta really use my tagging for what that's a dog what was the last time you want fucking stage let me use your fucking tag the fuck outta here but after that he would hire me would talk to me the whole weekend fuck out of my face bad guy you know we work hard at what we do it you gotta respect that it's like a plumber or an electrician coming to my house and me tell them how to fucking do his job well fuck it mine you booked me now you're gonna tell me how the fuck to do it get the fuck out of my face well a lot of them used to be comics there was a lot of guys those are the works those are the worst those are the worst there goes one college early well he was but he became a good fucking manager you know these guy who are you right now become Jesus these guys well the proof is in the pudding yeah Danny had a lot of good people it's had it's a good word that's my point but still he had me he developed them if they did something while he had him this people were comedy clubs they were comedians that one day your whole winter I'm gonna figure out how to make money on these jerk-offs then they become comedy club owners there's a couple of local clubs around here that tell you what to say you can't work clean though can't wear clean but you can't work they don't want to pay you'll come to radio we're not gonna give you a hotel what are you talking about you were coming so when I work for a copy I love Norma off the bat listen before this goes any further you're a comic so I'm gonna have to tell you how to act correctly what's that mean that there's a TV in the greenroom that everything's copacetic cuz you're a comic and that's why I just don't understand what you're saying she's the comic there's a TV if you're a fuckin comedy 7 I'll be no misunderstandings because you're a comic and you know the business right you know how we acted you know how it works I don't wanna have no misunderstandings about checks or how the green room should be of this should be so doesn't agree but you're a fucking comic if you're a comic I know you agree moon is the size of a closet you're not a fucking you're a scumbag just trying to make money on fucking comics if a comic opens up a room I want that room to be that much better cuz you're a comic if a comic opens opens your room well how many comics open a room a lot of Brad care a lot of Vegas club is supposed to be the shit Brad Garrett was the shit that's a big difference he wasn't a bad stand-up I'm talking about guys that were bad stand-ups and then one day go I'm gonna become a snake then they try to tell you shit when you get there you like they'll be a favor bro this is not what you're doing you have lined your fourth of July and Christmas come back then tonight I'm called Joey's here get the fuck out of my face if we were gonna buy a club it would be the ice house the ice house would be the cauliflowers i flappers floppers is a beautiful club just well it's hard to fucking get people to go to a club you know like think about everybody that goes to store everybody goes to the improv there's like there's only so many guys you know there's so many clubs that we could work out here you know like when I was preparing for the last Comedy Central special I was doing the ha ha Tuesday nights I was doing the improv I was doing Irvine occasionally I was doing all these different crimes like possibly ice house hopping all over the place like there's a lot of clubs here this is like as far as like a hotbed of places to work this is one of the best spots in the country have you been in the new Ice House yet we're talking about the nerd Neil I mean new hahaha there's a new haha yes oh the one across the street supposedly they just had a cold open on a January 1st and it's I heard it's beautiful months ago they were doing shows there you know they show that this didn't happen throws like a an invitation-only party that was I've been seeing him but I heard it was I heard it's like the Ice House I heard it's like the Ice House main room stays bigger though it's bigger than yeah it's like the Ice House only sits like 100-something this is like 200 something yeah but still small you know still maybe a little bit bigger than the or you know but not as big as the main room I did the main room the other night and then I did the o.r afterwards Theo are such a better right such a better room oh I suppose that's the way you're supposed to do comedy jammed in there stacked on top of each other low ceiling it's the most fun and the closest thing for your is the San Francisco punch the fuck yeah closest thing to are they just tried to offer me there but to do the car Cobb's again I said no cops is a great club but the punch line is so intimate I don't care about the money yeah it's worth paying or getting paid less to do that cool yeah there's just some rules to that if I opened up I think they're opening up a club with too many moving parts now I think they get ahead of themselves and it's like I always say you put all these smart guys together they do the dumbest thing in the fucking world you know I still love this that's what I do I want to do comedy right there in front of that wall anything else you wasted my time you want to serve food go serve it on your own time just give these motherfuckers stiff fucking drinks stiff drinks fucked up sit down okay you know 600 seats when you get 600 people in here really Kevin Hart's gonna play in your fucking dreams you dumb fuck well he wind up apron yeah the lobby it's a waste you need to 5202 the corner for a great room brick a tremendous sound system some hot dogs next door would do something special but after the show you'd have to fuck with the waitstaff and let them go in their sling drinks bro to shows you know that's what I would do as a comic the green would be paradise a that you know there's things that you do these people now opening up clubs thinking about 600 people on the show you know last night I saw something interesting again I was in the room last night and I came out my wife was watching the fucking that means what the fuck was out last night and who's in the fucking heaviest up there standing killing it but Margaret Cho dressed as the Korean guy with white powder on her face walking across things like Fidel Castro and I'm thinking about what they put her through 20 years ago and how they did their hair right there when they gave it an ABC show because that's a noun rush rush okay they are after the Tim Allen and Roseanne rush something happened and network said we gotta get a bunch of comics that's it that's the idea so they gave greg Giraldo a show they gave Tom Road to showing mb/sec Butler Brett Butler a show on ABC and they gave that poor long good show and the name is sulfur they told her not to be chinky they were saying all this shit to her you know b-boy Chinese they just insulted her insides then they canceled everybody and you know what half of these fucking punks today would fucking crawl under the tree I'm looking at Margaret's show last night woman I bet baggage shows happy that she didn't fucking quit a bailout of God drugs Margaret Cho said fuck you motherfuckers I'm just gonna get strong it was a comic she built up a huge falling on the RO whether they gay or not they sped books and she sells out that bitch is tatted from her head to a fucking call with fuck you and Korean lettuce to all these fucking Gentiles and 20 years later that chick was killing it last night on stage with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey the two hottest comedy chicks in the fucking world how you like me now bitch what they put that fucking chick through 20 years ago they embarrassed her they made a feel I should have told her lose weight do you remember the shit that she came out with years later they told that she was never gonna work again you do for going against the network well how'd she go against the network well she told them but they were telling it lose weight there's no fat Asians oh my god shit they would say the bargain choice she came out and said it was baggage out it took this cubed disgusting dick out with that fucking foreskin on it and said here you go America yup jobs for a week this ain't no fucking malfunction of a wardrobe this is just to tell you that you can't stop comedians bro we just get better don't you know that you dumped motherfucking club owners at you TV dumb fucking cunts we just get why you're giggling and the Hunts here next mind fuck we're taking that joke and breaking it down and getting on stage and getting better these fucking people David tell nobody goes to see David though he's funniest as he's ever been because that's all we do unless we're fucking cunts and go away but we don't go away we don't go away well worse than fucking roaches you know how proud I was last night for Margaret Cho do you have any fucking idea dressed up there with a hat on a white fucking thing on a phase thought that 20 years later she probably thought she was done what do you think when they can for you sure at the three seasons what the fuck do you think you're done who's gonna hire me look at that bitch she didn't quit and that's what these comedy club owners and that's what all these guys I have an opinion on comics always remember you fuck go away you worthless fucking faggots you go away you go away we keep going how long did rands do comedy - what the fucking cigar in his mouth these motherfuckers don't know nothing about nothing they don't know nothing about man that's why now I wake up and I go somebody's sucking my dick today some one of these TV guys gonna hear my name last week they had to drive by the Melrose improv and see my name there all we can go that fucking coke that fat motherfucker I just stayed here well you kept work I can't work I didn't give up but everybody doesn't keep working right now some people get tired I never gave a fuck about those cunts with their threats so you're not gonna I don't give a fuck dog I'm gonna get strong and once I got off the blow now they really gotta suck my asshole now it's 2 Live Crew now they gotta suck my dick and your asshole - well you know you killing me fuckers don't don't crackling breathe like that I know it reminds me of your old nose or when you before you had your operation I was very nervous throw it on the ground there [Laughter] yeah my old nose was useless Joey maybe you should get your nose carved out have you had it does your septum work I don't know can you usually breathe out you nose once I get up I got a brick spray bit of jiu-jitsu you gotta bring watch spray it's really always going to close guard I got a pop and go spray my nose steroids something about leverage with me or something then once I clean out is good ever since I had an ear infection a couple years ago I was swimming had the infection then I went in and I flew I got fucked up and I went to a doctor he stuck the fucking probe of my nose my nose has been all fucked up and they sent me their sprays but their sprays suck I live on fucking Afrin you get addicted to that stuff - the real issue with those phrases your your the inside of your nose gets addicted to that spray and won't open up unless you have it it's very common people get in when you're you know your body's responding and wants that shit it swells up it makes it worse it's terrible does your nose every rage rage out rage against the dying of the light oh it's not that guy steroids oh well they gave me style steroids at the house I was impulsive sprayed two times a day so they didn't know spray it's a shame but I'm writing addictive Janelle sprite here and yeah nasal spray addiction is it real Mayo Clinic yeah this cocaine closet right all right clean it right out though like if you do a bomb pool that we'd be able to breathe immediate oh my god cocaine is the best fuckin though the spray they gave me now the doctor gave me the prescription if I hit my nose two times for like five minutes I go into confusion because it feels like that okay it has that thing to it what they're saying is it's not a true addiction because a true addiction what happens is like you you get sick if you don't have it true addiction is a compulsive physiological need for in use of a habit-forming substance known to be physically psychologically or socially harmful the what the nasal spray happens is you put that stuff in and after a few days of using it your nose may become less responsive to the effects of the medication as a result you need to use more and more the medication to control congestion or your congestion may worsen if you stop using the medication that happens to people apparently that happens to people with xanax too like they say there's like some sort of a rubberband effect of xanax like if you ills annex calms your anxiety but when you start getting off of it like your anxiety like heightens and worsens to a place where it probably wouldn't even be if you were on it if you weren't on at the first place and I think that's what happens with these sprouts sprays do they get you coming and going Joey Diaz they get you coming and going these fucks spraying shit up your nose if you get your nose carved out though you know if you ever want to go and do it my guy retired my guy Feinberg and Encino he was the best he had like he was he was so fucking he was so patient meticulous when he would talk to him and take notes with him but he would talk about what people did wrong and what people did right and what here's the common errors and here's where they fuck up and you know and this he's B he'd been doing it for fucking years he was like in his 60s when you did my operation but he made my nose wider like if I look at photos of my nose before the operation after my nose was all suck dude and I did I just didn't talk as well I couldn't breathe out of my nose very well my voice sounded different and he stuck these fucking plastic things in there and cut everything out cut the turbinates out good but remove chunks of meat I used to take I felt I took photos all the videos I'm under the video me blowing my own with the Waterpik I have had photos of the boogers that I would blow out these bloody giant hunks there were thumbs I would blow I thought I showed it to Tom Segura once in the airport he almost threw up I go look at that dude it just came out of my nose you would like you ran away but that guy cleaned my nose out I have to Holland tunnels man I was like to breathe terrible my cardio got 20% better David you just rage it's guy goes I think with you it's a deviated septum my friend oh I guarantee you that's an issue doing that you goes I guarantee you'll lose weight cause more it goes well that's what Wanderlei Silva when Wanderlei Silva had his nose fixed he had all that facial surgery they took a piece out of his rib and reconstructed his nose and made his nose bigger I'll give you look at vandalize nose it's way bigger than it was before because he had a big chunk in there to open up his nose like vandal ain't trying to look better he's look trying to fuck you up like when he got his nose fixed it wasn't good he wanted to look cute but his nose was completely smashed in and flattened it was like no cartilage at all it was just smashed and flattened and if you look at like what his face looked like when he started fighting in like the late 90s as opposed to what he looked like in the early 2000s like his nose was just a pancake and so he had it fixed and stuck way the fuck out like way bigger than it was before and all just so he could breathe better and smash your fucking family so it's funny shit we taste them right now they should just call van little family okay truce just truce what the others are calling I can't it's a Nevada State Athletic gonna do is this we don't want you to come back during UFC tonight we're gonna tape you every week just doing a second that's it because they'll just talk about stuff cuz now he has a reward for everything that happens so he stuck up for Jon Jones last week right you know he sucks up for everybody and it's always at the end of the day that's at the end of a bunch of bang of the UFC right you know like what do you think of John generally he they just go to van wey he's like shooting deck and some ladies shoot him in the arm he had a problem it did you I see and that's it cuz it all the UFC dinner nobody else did it vandal you know very good good train good heart train very very good patina why thank you for Dana why thank you for help thank you for UFC yeah that guy um he fucked up man you can't run from a drug test and then if you ran from a drug test and then was talking about how the UFC doesn't pay its athletes and let's say and then they were UFC okay you made nine point seven million dollars fighting for us here's your record the UFC put his record out like here's your record here's how much money we paid you you made nine point seven million dollars I don't know what you think a lot of money is but a lot of people think nine million dollars is a lot of money like two years well several years probably five years he was fighting but the point is he didn't five years the only fought six times does the other thing like they're saying you you we work you so hard you were fighting once a year essentially but not only that on top of that like vandal II didn't have a winning record I've annually got beat by Chris Leben vandala got beat by Rampage Jackson dr. Malak he got beat by a lot of guys he's a great fighter and a fan favorite and personally like my all-time favorite guy to watch I think I think if I go back to like the pride days I love the pride days for two guys especially well three Minotauro in his prime for cro cop in his prime phaidor for sure fado was the motherfucker but Wanderlei was a destroyer he was a destroyer he was so aggressive and psychotic and you would watch a Wanderlei fight you always knew you were gonna see some fuckin crazy shit you know that's when they had stomps and soccer kicks and he just stomping dudes in the head holding out of the rope stomping temor in the face when he's down I mean van was amazing his fights were awesome to watch but you you know that hard hard career and then comes over to the UFC and now he's got like really strict drug testing and all this other shit and so when he took off from that drug test man I mean that was it she's just a colossal fuckup you better off testing positive you test positive they they they ban you for nine months that's it they fine you they ban you for nine months they tell you can't fight that guy and you know you have to go through a suspension but when you take off they had to send a message they're like this is for life like you can never fight again I personally think that's too much but the fear of it and the fact that he's gonna be out for who knows how many years while he fights it and if he wins a lot of people think he will win in court the Nevada State Athletic Commission doesn't have the jurisdiction to test him against his will you know in between contests cause he wasn't licensed for them like in preparation for a licensing the idea of random drug testing a lot of people have issues with that including like van Billy's attorney but the bottom line is they're gonna make you go to court you're gonna have to do battle and even if you win they'll let you fight again you still wasted all those years you're light and no one's gonna run from a drug test again because they're gonna know that the drug test like running for it is wait worse for you than taking it and failing it that's the message they're trying to send they're trying to clean up the sport there's only one way you got to take your test and if you fail what you have to be punished it's that simple otherwise you're not playing by the rules if you're not playing by the rules you can't fight for us you can't just run away you know I don't agree with the suspension I think a lifetime suspension is ridiculous especially since like vandal he's not gonna fucking he's not gonna become a composer or he's not gonna I mean you're taking away the guy's livelihood I mean he can teach and he can train guys I guess but Wanderlei still has fight in him he still wants to fight he had some good fights lined up that shel son in fight would have made him a fuckload of money that jay'll son and fight I don't know like what they're gonna pay him for that but how much that fight would be worth especially if he could beat Chael Sonnen and do it in Brazil that would be gigantic but he fucked up too man when he was on that show he got embarrassed like the Brazil was upset at him there was a lot of people in Brazil that are upset and he his performance and behavior on the show where he attacked Chael Sonnen they a lot of people thought he made them look bad and Chael Sonnen took him down real easy on the show you know Vandelay took a swing at jail and chill ducked and took him down it's like come on we seeing what's gonna happen on the show like you me and you're making us look like dog like you're starting to fight in the middle of a fucking a television broadcast talk all the shit you want but be there when the actual fight goes down so both the guys tested positive for shit it wasn't just I mean vandal II might not have tested positive but essentially did and she'll son who was tip he was positive for everything everything that existed everything other than testosterone he was on it was on all these different testosterone boosters and the EPO it's a Lance Armstrong shit to make more oxygen your blood you know they have to clean up the sport it's unfortunate that vandal he has to go out like that cuz the guy was you know so he can't find even Atlantic City like you know we are nowhere he can't fight anywhere not only Keene I thought not fighting we're Bellator was gonna hire him to do promotional shit for them and the UFC is like and you're in the contract with us like not only can you not work for you know us fighting but we won't let you work for the competition in any sort of a promotional way but that was also because van de leeuw talked a lot of shit you know he was talking a lot of shit about the UFC and who no fuck knows but it's sad I hope he I hope it all gets cleared up I mean I think the guy should have got suspended for a while but I don't know what the number is the way of the drug test was hey Jay defense came right to my house I wouldn't open the fucking door I wasn't even thought I was high fuck be not fuck last night at tonight's ago how is fucking high on weed or a coke everything I sent my wife somewhere where the fuck did I go my friends came out I was on probation but I did something I told my wife made my buddies would go to Aspen so she left that afternoon to our parents or some with the baby and I thought could stay at the house blasting and they caught me they go what are you leaving like oh I'm already have to fucking you know I'm right now the cars coming we'll even I think okay we thought you said five o'clock no no no one o'clock I'm leaving right now I got a I don't know about that Miss Lane again I like a fucking door we were talking the kitchen we had a highlight and go upstairs they kept knocking I think I can hear somebody in there nothing they allowed you're not allowed to break in they can only give this drug test they just come to your house but if he will have knocked I said I'm not giving him a drug test he would came back with a sheriff right right right they call the sheriff open the fucking door you know what's the most fucked up is drug test for companies where they test you for weed and you're not even like it's not even like why you're on the job like UPS something like along those lines like they'll test you to make sure you're not doing drugs while you work for them is if someone can tell you what to do with your time like when you leave like you could start drinking at Monday at five o'clock you could ask everybody at work hey you guys want to go do drugs let's go down to the bar and do liquid drugs and everybody's like yeah we're gonna go meet Joey for a cup of liquid drugs you know and everybody's fine with that because it's all alcohol it's all legal and but if you said hey you know you guys want to smoke some joints after this is over everybody be like what the fuck man you're gonna get fired from UPS finca taking a drug test you you're fucked and they will they could they could hit you with a random drug ransom and they could fire you bait and you could get drunk as fuck from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday night crash wake up head pounding driving to work hung over his fuck drinking Pedialyte and Gatorade and water and and you're fine nobody nobody could say worth the drug test you you pacifying collars as long as you're not actively drunk on the job you're fine so that's some goofy shit I can't hit me up from Boulder he went to get a job at Fisher huh they take your fucking hand out jack take your hair that's illegal that's a big prize to Vegas to it those casinos hair come on give us that ass so you can't smoke weed can't do nothing dawg what if you have a medical prescription there's a lot of places don't even go fuck even if you have nice big beers by the medical school how do we fuck about nothing I was thinking the same thing I was thinking about let's say a guy that's in a California prison not getting the right medication for whatever his thing is eventually that's gonna happen some guy in prison is gonna raise his hand and go to Eternity I don't know what he's gonna win but you lose your rights when you're a felon you lose your rights into what do you lose your right but I don't think you lose your right to proper medical attention so if you get that diagnosed with ADHD or something like that the doctor says cannabis is medication what do you think and it's a state law it's a state law this is a federal the federal law is the real issue somebody California isn't eventually go I'm not getting the right medication in prison because they know we're almost out of time so I gotta ask you about this because it's just came out what the whole john jones thing you know knowing your past and your your past experiences with coke what did you think about that when they're all went down I had heard rumors knuckle idea I just didn't say them to you because I want you you know drilling me that night we were in Vegas and we eat the mushrooms and we came back and John Jones said to the table I told Darwin when Jon Jones got there's rumors he's doing blow from here in LA two people told me and you don't be I don't care I never repeated it I'm not that type of person I just what did surprise me about manna it breaks my heart people are sitting at and don't do blow and are wondering how can a champion risk his family and everything cocaine has know nothing I had a baby inside the room with my wife in there I've been a federal probation and I'm snorting blow outside I'm behind the business though I would let the dog out that's why we do she'd be in the room breathing what are you doing I'm letting the dog that dog was the only dog that one every 15 fucking minutes drink it down and put it back in the snow and I'd do two lines and go back in the house that doesn't Larry know we that they were gonna throw me in jail knowing knowing they were gonna throw me a piss testify piss test knowing I would drink vinegar I told the story out here before what I went through that year and the halfway house drinking vinegar and put boucle around my dick you know cranberry juice and vinegar and Gatorade just letting it go when you're addicted like that nothing means I think you know here's a question here's a question is it possible that a guy could just enjoy a little coke every now and then yeah you say yes he's yeah well you you don't have an addiction thing you've done coke before you've never been a dude but he's found himself at dark places if not he'd do it everybody he knows how scary it is I see where I could see I could see where it could for certain people once you get scared with it yeah that you respect it but don't you get scared with alcohol too like if you get really drunk and fucked up I've been really drunk and fucked up before it was like wow you could die from this you know I've thrown up and garbage cans I mean I've been hammered before where I really think I wonder it like isn't that just as destructive as cocaine no because you're not spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars every night on alcohol usually you know if you usually drink a bottle of Jack and puke where cocaine there you'd be up till 10:00 in the morning still buying it you know oh because you keep going you keep on going because it's it's energy it's pretty much just like hey I'm awake I feel great I want to get shit done and I want to so that's the issue is that you keep going yeah so like a guy like John Jones who has a lot of money like the money's not an issue for him but to keep him going is an issue keeping going in bitches man because the bitches love cooked chicken bomb where was he going we had fun I feel very bad for Greg Jackson this camp because somebody hadn't no doubt of it yeah well people probably knew you know but they also knew he's the baddest motherfucker do what it was fighting right now nobody just goes by as a package it does it by themselves right I'd be doing it with somebody my heart goes out to but does it but do you think he could be fine with it I mean Bryan do you think he could be fine with it do you think that if you if you're a disciplined guy you know he's you you haven't had the problem that that maybe joey's had you know you've never been like full-on addicted like for long periods of time now so do you think that a guy like him was an athlete is a strong-minded dude is very disciplined I mean John Jones when he's training like when he trained for this fight for Daniel Cormier he was fucking discipline the word on the street the word from Albuquerque was his fucking guy's training hard twice a day doing everything he can to beat this model I got pop this up before so I wasn't he wasn't raining that hard he got popped for weeks before the fire oh that's good part he did get he wasn't training that hard he was still doing the cocaine which is my boggling to a guy like me but I understand it because I was addicted it just depends how much he does I know people that just do it oh come on I had a friend out was a tremendous athlete and one night in front of me he whipped out a package of the elbows died and I know what the fuck are you doing and he goes at the beginning other night I always do two bumps like a drink with the rest of these assholes I throw it away or I give it away yeah he could do two bumps and Drake like it was no tomorrow for two or three hours peeing at all because Oh a drink boy it's so different everybody has a different way of the heart in a different way of doing coke some people could do a little coke yeah but everything starts off easy in the drug world everything's a party I'm happy they caught him now I don't know what level of the addiction he was up to maybe he'd done it the first time none of us know what to eat thousand the truth hmm and it's also a thing of John so fucking good that maybe while he's doing it and he's still winning he's still beating guys he's so good he can do coke four weeks out you know because done coke three days before Doug flourish Taylor was fuckin you know Friday night New Jersey you're playing Sunday really we think Lawrence Taylor went home with drink Gatorade well how bad is it fuck you up if he did do it on Friday now she won't even listen fuck your heart your breathing it fuck's up laughing but once you get back in there you're fuckin back in there I know as a comedian if I did it two nights in a row it affected me as a comic I couldn't really control my words I could control a lot of things and I'm very good with a lot of things that my system for THC and edibles what's that good coke two days you could tell us our time you're talking about raging two days all night long all morning long I'm grabbing a half till for the water that was you know I can do two grams in the night before the morning go back to sleep I'm talking ahead no drinking I knew on Thursday that might I do that my stand-up was falling apart with fighting it's something different you want to be crazy but coming when I sold sports information I always did better with a hangover real I was unconscious I worked off technique technique I was unconscious everything had to be so you didn't overthink things I didn't overthink thing I closed them I stuck to the pitch I took those beats so maybe when you're unconscious you more I'm not saying that this poor kid did it before he fought I can't see it listen right here when the room we've been 24 years I've been doing stand-up I think okay no one on stage one time March 17 1992 was my second year doing comic I thought I could do coke like Richard Pryor and talk it doesn't work so did Michael Richards yeah doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way he'd do coke on stage you might kill one time ask Kennison if he killed at the end it was a nightmare and you have no emotion you have no emotion the cocaine cuts to your heart in the material so all you are is red bag give me your jokes right I say joke man my leg goes under I've seen guys that are cooked up on stage two and there are they are very robotic robotic it's over you're just you're working off technique and would stand up you can't work a lot of technique with jujitsu and me punch in yeah you know I can grab that on but under what stand up there's no technique the technique is my emotion the technique is my pain I have to feel that you all that energy once I have the bridge is broken what's I do blow once I do blow my brother the bridge breaks there's no disconnect I can still yell the jokes at you right but there's nothing so I don't see it I just hope he gets better you know I hope that uh it was a you know just something he was doing every couple weeks just to burn some energy it's amazing that he part of that time still kick everybody we don't know what he did we don't know how he party well we know he was doing coke four weeks out we could have just been with a girl that had listened you want a girl she got a tremendous piece of pussy on a fucking dime but you dig start again a bellybutton her ass all smelling flowers you know what maybe you didn't do coke maybe she put a coke rock and a pussy you licked it hmm you know baby you touched it there's so many fucking things but if I came to you said Joe Rogan I didn't do blow I just put it on the girls bellybutton right Joey Jesus I thought you twenty issues me with that one it was only metabolites they tested for so somewhere between two and four days before that it was a great test because usually the cocaine's got 72 hours mm-hmm this test got you till about eight or nine days we're running out of time when when can people see you again buffalo helium next week oh shit a
