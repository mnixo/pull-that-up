Jamie leaves the salon to get the booze Thank You Jamie real real pro get some ice too beautiful so a lot of fuckin shit going on man a lot of shit going on how about that Colby covington fellow huh bro oh dude everybody better shut the fuck up now he's for real he's for real anybody didn't think he's for real after that robbie lawler fight you gotta go Wow well the problem is is he talked so much shit which I find hilarious and you're tuned in to watch him lose yeah which is he's doing it right cuz - in all honesty we like him because we're balls deep in UFC and MMA but like my brother who's not that big of a fan it's like this is all he does like I know you gotta understand know what he's doing this guy is amazing and he's gonna do it for five rounds for 25 minutes and where's y'all it's to me it's fascinating it's fast it's Nadia but it's not entertaining for a general fan typically he's not knocking dudes out not a lot of submissions you know I'm saying so for the for the general fan like oh and Skyy talks all this shit but he's doing it right because talking all that shit you only see this guy you fucked up even John Jones posted you let everyone down you know it's like Robbie Lawler let everybody down you know I'm saying cuz he wants everybody what's Kobe to lose right Kobe's doing exactly everyone's playing into his game plan I love it well that's how Floyd Mayweather became so rich Floyd Mayweather did not become so rich because his fights are so exciting his fights in his early career were way more exciting he's a savage Oregon he could go to Soldier yes but he broke his hands a bunch of times correct and you know and also realized like this is not the way to have a long career and walk out of it with all your brains intact well think think how good John Fitch was he was a monster tore nice guy true professional beats on the very best was tough to beat didn't talk shit though so no one really cared so as soon as he had some issues remember he was like hey I don't like the way my face looks in that video game UFC was a cool your cut like what the fuck I'm 20 and oh man yeah I think they cut them just because of be either one of those is good this is all we have in this room we have a bunch of that um which the Buffalo Trace we have Buffalo Trace in the back I don't trust skinny bottles yeah it seems weird right yeah it's for girls SunTrust skinny girl skinny bottles bro Canadian whisky and maple syrup now can't do maple on keto bro oh you really straight keto oh yeah when did I say I sent you and Bryan attacks up your boy is up

into sugar I don't think so especially whiskey because whiskey and vodka are safe on ketogenic diet oh yeah it's it's 2:00 in the afternoon bro yeah 2:00 in the afternoon fight alcoholic now hey drinking I'm like a super shitty run light it's fun to drink a little bit before a show right yeah I'm messing around yeah don't wanna be tight don't want to be tight um tricky problem either the kobe covington thing is look what he did if you if you want to put it in perspective for a regular person robbie lawler is one of the biggest fucking savages to ever compete in the sport he's an animal and kobe shot him down he shut everything down he shut his entire game down and he did it with an unprecedented work rate he made he was punching one every two seconds nuts which is nuts I mean that is it for to do that over five fucking rounds against one of the greatest welterweights of all time Robbie Lawler and win every single fucking round some 10-8 round yeah I thought oh this isn't even close yeah I mean not even close I mean Robbie occasionally would swing and connect and then Kobe would immediately hit him three or four times more and then take him down or clinch with them and beat him up and it was amazing Kobe striking is not terrible either it's very pretty damn good very technical and the volume volume is incredible but here's my thing if if I'm fighting Kobe like if I'm car Moosman if I'm fighting Kobe I'm getting a guy like campaigns if I see my opponent running with campaigns I'm reaching out to another ultramarathon or figuring it out well kymaro can't run that's right he can't do roadwork his legs still duh yes oh yeah it's not getting any better his knees are mangled but he's doing something right well his cardio is off the charts too but it's just he does different things you can do a lot of different things to work you swimming and stuff sure swimming you can do a lot oh yeah the assault bike you know the that echo bike the rogue makes that is as good as Jacob's Ladder thing yeah yeah yeah yeah that Pathan I feel like it's lying to me I work out every morning on that thing I've never been thicker yeah but you eating like an animal still it says I burned a thousand calories probably all poor thousand dude I don't think so mental health food truck Diaries you need to stop lying I'm the only one eating so tell me how you got started lobster fucking sandwiches in seven yeah that's what I can't find it heavy weight right now that's what happens all right but if I'm a tomorrow yeah obviously cardio is not a problem for him but man Colby have you ever seen him tired advert no no I mean he had that one loss in the OC but that was particularly because he came to the fight injured took the fight on short notice but he's he's got an amazing style that style of wrestling and striking and as a person who's fascinated by tactics right like his tactics are incredible because he's he's got great discipline - never he's never bites down his mouthpiece and throws as hard as he can never everything is like a calculated the output is all the same it's just constant constant bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang he doesn't even really fire power shots like he's like oh no this is a marathon yeah like a weird sound it's just caught it's all the same pace it's all he's just constantly hitting you constantly moving forward constant volume and it seemed like Robbie was waiting for him to pause in front of him or get a little tired so he could fire shots off and the bobbin and Weavin that Robbie was doing like what was all that about yep I'm tired I guess so and all that bob and weave and oh yeah tiresome that's like damn right from the core yeah man that's rough on the core try bobbin and Weavin for a minute if you're at home just try doing this for a minute just a minute just a minute real time and Robbie's just trying to avoid getting beat up I mean this punch is just is relentless they never end and what's funny to about Colby his lover mer hate him is he doubles down cuz he got on the mic and his line about Matt Hughes oh my god dude I was watching it and I was where was I I was in oh nasty I was watching in the room with the Derek post in us on a mod my openers and when they said that they were aware of Matt Hughes no that's ridicul mic that's fantastic it's a cuz it is messed up but that's his character man he's a heel and he just doubled down so hard so cuz Matt Hughes is really close to Robbie Lawler he said you think what he said for those that it was fight he goes you think Robbie Lawler would take a lesson from his boy Matt Hughes and get off the train tracks when a train is coming he's all fair in love war yeah the most controversial ruthless shit that he could say and here's what else would so we're impressed by his tactics right you know what's even more impressive as a former fighter it's stressful enough fighting another grown man you end with a steel cage especially when they're really good it's fuckin stressful now imagine talking all that shit and you gotta deal with the consequences people hate you yeah he's a good dude talk to campaign he's a different guy great guy yeah so he's a normal dude outside but he has to deal with all that pressure and still perform didn't get on the mic I wonder if he's ever just in bed it's like damn these death threats can real old after that fight he has a real shot at being a world champion a real shot I know he was already the interim world champion those don't count after that fight they don't count and well you know how you know they don't count they stripped him and didn't even lose yeah it doesn't matter how does that make any sense he they stripped him because he didn't want to fight again quickly after a five-round fucking war with RDA and he needed surgery yeah but also they don't count either because your contract isn't you don't get when your champ your contract get bumped up to higher pay interim champs don't get bumped up right what it was what was the surgery for um it was something what you feel like in his face I like n sinus yeah some yes major yeah something like a deviated septum yeah yeah yeah it's uh he's a fucking of he's a phenomenal fighter but now think about this you take his style he doesn't go backwards wrestling cardio come Roseman doesn't go backwards wrestling cardio yeah the only thing I see I would imagine Camaros can be a slight favorite because of his power yeah one kind of distinguishing kind of factors Kumar has a lot more power right tomorrow he can knock you out neither one's a knockout artist right tomorrow could knock people out though it's not straight he can knock people out too but his approach is to throw everything at like 50 60 % he was slang in some early in that first round against Robbie they were exchanging if you had to connect it could control for either guy for either guy he was getting Robbie's respect and I think that was the strategy that you have you kind of have to wade through the fire with Robbie and beginning because he's coming hard you know he's coming he's coming hard now here's the question for you is what's more impressive what Colby did to Robbie Lawler or what kymaro's men did to tyron woodley it's a very good question well obviously tyron woodley was the champion and Robbie Lawler was several years removed from the title so you have to look at it that way right Tyron took the title from Robbie with one punch knockout and Robbie's had some some losses since then some Wars yeah some war since then the Ben Askren fight in particular it all beat Woodley when he was fuckin wood yes yes but according to many people would lose injured going to that fight he's had some pretty significant problems with his hand something was up with them yes he just seemed off and he's also I mean I don't know how much of a factor this is but he also released a record with Wiz Khalifa he was rapping he was doing his TMZ shows doing a lot and I love the fact that he's doing that because tyron woodley a smart man he realizes he's in his 30s and how much more time does he have is accounted very smart and his wrappings good man I'd listen to his mind either yes good yeah it's not cringy at all no it's fucking good you could you could see him being a successful rapper 100 would be successful in whatever he does that he finally did yeah anything he's smart he's ambitious it's been a thousand movies he grinds he has a fucking hard working man like he wants that title back right so he's on the grind right now and try to get that title back and the the beating that one put on him was fucking national impressive performance is net whatever if Woodley had one arm whatever but I didn't know that going in just just seeing what he did to Woodley I couldn't believe it yeah I couldn't believe he looked like he broke them yeah which was crazy cuz even Willy in the corner he didn't would and I don't know if you had wood Leon since he just didn't look like he was there like he wasn't present like it didn't look like your normal world champion Woodley what is Woodley scheduled for a fight right now I don't think so I think he's trying to heal up and have you know supposed to fight Robbie again yeah here's the other thing did you know you know remember Woodley had that whole kind of back and forth the Dana and all that and I remember forget who he's told this to but they asked him if you could do it all over again with the way you handled the UFC would you do it he goes no I was exhausting I wouldn't want to do that again what was exhausting fighting with UFC be kind of you know remember he was like anti Dana no it never works out for anyone does it well I get their perspective that they want respect and you know they want to be treated like a champion and you know I felt like my personal feeling was that he wasn't being represented correctly in terms of the way they were talking about his fights 100% I felt like he was fighting in especially me as a fan of tactics like he was fighting wonderboy for two fights and Wonderboys the most difficult guy in the fucking sport to look good against he's so difficult to look good against but the first fight was amazing it was great great fight and examine sir he was the one who was doing the damage wonderboy is one of the best strikers to ever fight in MMA he knocked wonderboy down he had Wonder Boy hurt and Wonder Boy never had him hurt but he fought an intelligent fight to deal with the tactics that wonderboy provides like you can't chase Wonder Boy you can't go after him he will fucking catch you with a counter strike so what he did is he made Wonder Boy lead he waited for his openings he stayed patient it wasn't a lot of action but when delivered he opened up agreed he landed a fucking haymaker in the first fight had him really badly hurt he did the same thing in the second fight had him really badly hurt in a couple spots he's also on the most active champion but you kind of be able to say that like if you're a fan of the sport like what I would say if I was in Dana White shoes and I was talking about that fight I would say if you're a fan of sport you've got to understand that there are certain fighters where it's very difficult to look good again so I understand that if you're a fan and you want blood you want chaos it didn't really quite live up to your expectations but that's not what this sport is all about what this sport is all about his two incredibly talented and well trained killers and they're going after each other and they're both trying to figure out the openings to win and Tyron was able to win and he was able to win against one of the most difficult guys in the division and you know that they didn't do that no they didn't but there's gonna be guys where he looks amazing against like fucking dare until he made Darren show is shut down until down Darren says it's that's a shame to me is the Dare until story right now his story's not over he's a young kid but the way he was handled and I know you know they've exploded guys in the spotlight and it does work out but that and that is professional sports that's UFC with Darin till you look at all the talent that he had and it's just we still got talent oh no he he's gonna be fine he's so big it's fuckin tough I think he's cutting away too much weight to make 170 I really do I mean he's that kid you stand next to me looks like all right I'm with you I've always been the guy goes man guys should go up weight classes and now when max Holloway went to 55 against us in parade then you know it was a good fight but it looks way better at 45 85 but Dustin Poirier going to 155 made his career he was 905 he was struggling goes to 55 maybe I know at 70 there's just a bunch of cases for it well dos Anjos at 70 those not won the title but he started off hottest yeah and he's running some problems but running like rock cold from 85 to 205 and I was shouting from the rooftops this the guy that maybe can compete with John Jones and they got in there and just looked slow lethargic just a different game he didn't look good like wide me and I think's gonna be great at 205 but yanukovych looked great you got to think about this was like a showcase fight for him and he's a big fuckin strong guy and we clicked and knocked him out for sure I mean look at Luke didn't look like himself he looks lower hesitant he's at injuries he's on the model bro yeah he's like real much yeah but he's spraying like perfume on and commercials like what he doing making Bank been busting nuts I guess making banking bus and nut says he's doing jelly but right now he's drinking through a straw yeah I know it's JIT yeah hey that's why you know fight was George spray Cologne and bust nuts well I might be what he's doing from now on but I think it is but when you're world champion in the back of his head it's probably that feeling of being a world champion when he beat Chris Chris Weidman probably the greatest feeling of his life but he's also had real problems with that chin they let him fight with that shin Sammy was kicking with it and shit I know before people don't know what we're talking about he had a massive staph infection horrible and he had to get skin grafts on the shin and it's still fucked up here's the thing about Luke done and I love Luke he knows that she's a friend of mine but he's had a great long ass career man like this is to me that's my sad story if Darren Tilden come champion that's a sad story Luke Rockhold spinach of world champion at Strikeforce in the UFC he smashed Machida he's beat some of the very best guys in the world he's a dying piece he's fine hit he's made his legacy yeah so to me the shame is that a guy like Darren till if he doesn't bounce back yeah maybe but I think Luke Rockhold really believes that he could get back into the Sun that kind of form that he was in when he was a world champion I just don't think you can ever make 185 again and 205 is a different animal there are enormous men that are dropping down to 205 and he looked like like he was carrying weight he was jacked yeah he looks a huge you looked slow yeah he looked real slow Harrison looked angry you gotta think you got 20 extra pounds on you but that's what he walks around that no I'm saying he walks around that well I think he might have put weight on to and to cut down at 205 so he could be a big 205 and that might have been part of the problem 205 kind of pop in these days and we were sad his struggle City about a year ago a lot of killers a lot of killers but no one that is a real promising threat to Jon Jones Santos put on a fucking show booth one leg out yeah and I knew his naked legs blew out I didn't and then when they told me tore his ACL MCL everything I like and he still competed like that I could tell early in the first he threw something early in the first you'd see his leg go I could you you said something about it right going on although I will say this as Santos is bad as fuck and then before that Anthea Smith both amazing fighters John's getting older John's getting lower and I think there's a guy in you know I think John's the greatest of all time hands down no argument but he I think they're starting to be a little chink in his armor maybe you think so yes well with Santos there was some dose of fucking savage man Santos a savage for sure and John fought him stand up for some strange reason I was surprised especially with Santos is fucked up like that John did that performance didn't blow me away by John I know means and Santos had one leg I didn't understand that performance yeah I don't know why he didn't take him down right I felt like John is one of the best wrestlers in the fuckin sport he put took down Daniel Cormier he submitted for I can lyoto machida I mean Vitor Belfort Jackson Ryan Bader he's amazing yeah he could take him down I wonder what was going on there and the guys got one knee I mean I can't even walk very sure the game plan was very strange but I saw that went well and here's where I was thinking went that is well john go undefeated probably I bet a good amount of money on that but there's a guy like like a I don't think you can see on the outside and beat John like a ray is like a guy who's super technical and long you're not gonna outsmart John on the outside it's not happening I think it's gonna come from a guy like Johnny Walker throws like a spinning heel kick trying someone good who's he fighting your boy who was just on the wrestler the the black dude Oh Corey Anderson they're talking shit each other that's in fact in New York whoo that's a good Cordia Corey has crazy cardio that's a great phrase you can't see what if Johnny Walker if you beat Corey ant you're ready to go you beat him we're going sizzler yes yes or if Corey beats him he's going says Corey their court Corey's already illegal well he is an elite guy but he's not being talked about in terms of a title shot it's not very frustrating to him yeah but that style is fucking hard to handle man he doesn't matter they're not in the business of that you put look at fucking look at Colby covington it's a similar style just constant pressure yeah you're right and you know he talks a lot of shit Kobe did yeah well Corey's a really nice guy and nice guys finish last on bullshit sometimes they win really yes no he can win for sure he's the dogs gonna take a lot of work though yep to get there like you like let's say you have a guy like let's say you have a guy who's like Conor McGregor he's gonna catapult to the front before a guy first now yes yes catapult you have season go rocket ship go isn't that crazy though that that's like part of the sport part of the sport is how much money can you generate because it's not just about how well you perform as a fighter and about how many people are interested in you fighting it's crazy it's crazy but that's the nature of the beast that's why I hope that having a guy like Corey on my podcast or you having them on your podcast lets people know what a great guy that says like this is a guy to root for he's a great guy I agree and he can fight his fucking ass off I agree but the casuals don't for whatever reason they don't gravitate towards it well if he wins they will well you just got become undeniable he slowly gets yes he's slowly getting there and he's got one of the best trainers in the fucking world you know Mark Henry is the shit the best you know and his camp is fucking fantastic it's got Marlin and Franky he'll get a title shot yeah I think so too and you know who's another nice guy fucking lunch you better pack a lunch if you're fighting Corey but here's where nice guys don't finish last if the guy they're fighting is down to play the game via DC John Jones he sees as nice as they come doesn't talk shit him for steep eight they're especially the first fight now but that sells just off their talents but if you can get a guy like Jose Aldo conor mcgregor jose a nice as they come I think at this fucking Irish tidal wave and I was like I'll watch that and then Jose Aldo and even though he's one of the greatest of all time at 45 everyone tuned in and then he kind of took a lot of fans with him even even though he lost he was a huge star yeah that could happen for Corey with John Jones yeah although John Chancellor may talk shit he's just a bad guy DC though him indeed him DC a hate each other dude Jon Jones DC for the heavyweight title I think that's the future you do if steep a wins in this in this fight that's next week next week I think that steep a fights John Jones's heavyweight and John Jones moves up to heavyweight and tries to win the title okay then DC fights John Jones for the heavyweight title when John's the champion if John can beat steep a or if steep a can beat DC and then steep a could beat John Jones and they have been depending on how the fight goes look the bottom line is DC not steep a senseless one round knocked him out cold for the title but was that a dominating fight he did not come out doesn't matter boom was not pulled if he can beat him again man and and say John Jones he's going yeah he does that Oh biggest fighting you see history yes heavyweight it would be enormous what is this pound for pound Daniel Cormier number two khabib North three John Jones come on settle down settle down whoever's doing that come on beat him twice he's undefeated he's beaten every fucking human being he's ever competed against in real life okay every single one there's one loss in his career it's a nonsense loss they're trying to reverse I'm 100% support reversing that laws or set it the very least make it a no contest John dominated that fight smashed him there's no fucking way that's a lost cause the UFC I'll just mark it as he's on defeating yes I would even knock your athletic commission ass Matt ham last night when watch the fight did you see Matt Hamill talk get the job shit let's have a rematch like what are you crazy bro you will lose your fucking vision - listen John just goes come on brah never fight isn't even a conversation about who's the light heavyweight goat he there's no conference oh it's a no what are we talking about no Don anytime talk pound for pound John's clearly it's like only one who was challenging for pound for pound was Mighty Mouse and Mighty Mouse you know the the caveat was that he never beat anybody like John Jones beat it wasn't the same caliber a fighter wasn't a DC and then when he lost to Henry so who know you go out and by the way super close fuckin decision loss close close sitting on two Mighty Mouse so it losses losses a loss it's like I see Demetrius Johnson and my team out and and and John Jones as being an argument for number one but after that there's no arguments and especially in light heavyweight there's no argument John Jones everybody else can go pound sand there's not it's not even close I think John goes to heavyweight everybody's fuck - although hinders dcadt heavyweight is so much more interesting than light heavyweight because Cece knocks do to help man right and John Jones if he goes up who knows if he will have the same cardio who knows if you have the same if he'll be as fast there's something about guys going up like look Luke Rockhold same same story he goes up to light-heavyweight he's got all this extra bulk on him now see I don't think John's gonna like 240 I think he's incoming at a fucking lean mean 225 230 doesn't cut any weight that's what ranked out anyways I'll just fucking does work yeah maybe he just comes in and looks just like John Jones at light heavyweight he just doesn't cut any weight and that's all I mean I don't know about now but he's back in the day when I was at Jacksons all he really did is go with heavy weights and ragdoll him brag Dom I'll tell you what when he fought OSP I talked to Jackson afterwards and Greg was saying I don't like the fact that he's been doing all this powerlifting and he goes and I feel like that played a part in this fight yet so Jack he did get giant but I didn't think I go I felt that it was OSP I feel like OSP rose to the occasion he's a dangerous guy he's a super athletic guys big he's got a powerful left kick you know and he's an awkward fighter OSP fights awkward and you fuck up and he catches you without all explosive and possible to take down typically the fucking high man and you know I don't know maybe we're just not giving these guys enough credit because I think because we think so high of John whenever it's close Mike caught John had an off night that's maybe these guys are really fucking good I think OSP rose to the occasion I have a lot of respect for OSP when I looked at that fight I was saying OSP fought a great fight and he fought with a fucking broken arm okay he fought the entire last round with a broken arm and never even said a thing about it he was fighting with a fucking broken forearm he's a beast he's a beast and that's why I think John didn't look so good in that fight I disagree that he didn't look good because of the weightlifting but I don't know him the way Greg Jackson he was the only caveat to that and I don't want to open this can of worms that was also the first time he's been under strict testing that's what the naysayers would say well that is the first time maybe little Pico wasn't around you know here's my defense of that being a John Jones dick-sucker even with Pete you can fuck and fill up anyone who he fights on whatever pd's you want he still beating them mm-hmm well whatever he's doing if with her he's taking things or not that you could give his frickin opponents as much as they want to they're not beating guy that's a tough argument though I'm saying cast us yeah I don't know if that's necessarily true you fill up Thiago Santos full of fucking Ana drawl 50 he might run right on that Brazilian acai fuck his head he might throw some fuck that doorbell for spitting who knows man well I still think John he just seats you smart too technical I don't know I don't either look but we land we don't have to don't have to know cuz that testing is strict yeah I think I legitimately believe that what he got was through tainted means and I don't even know if it was supplements you know the big theory was that he got cocaine that was laced with creatine I hope think it'll come with creatine apparently according to someone who I know who really knows their shit who was deep and is not an ex this is an expert he said this is very common that when you buy cheap creatine cheap creatine often has other shit in it because you're buying it from China and from other places that have unscrupulous mixing thing and I listen as one of the owners of on it I know that this we never had our stuff test positive for steroids but what we did have is when we looked at the early batches of alpha brain we had it independently tested you know when we first went RB and I first opened on it we didn't know what the fuck we were doing in terms of we hadn't run a supplement company before and there was a lot of learning to do and one of the things that we learned was that when you're buying stuff and then you're having stuff mixed the people that are mixing it if you don't get the very best people you're getting people that mix stuff that don't clean out their vats so you might get winstrol and they can anything in there which is I want we never got steroids in ours but probably because with the stuff we're buying as nootropics which are just nutrients that enhance brain function so the people that were selling stuff were selling similar things vitamins and alike so but we did get our stuff tainted in a sense with other nutrients that supposed to be in there so then we had to do some investigation and then we figured out what the problem was and we adjusted our methods and we changed the way we would change the people we work with and we we did a lot of different things but if you're buying cheap creatine that's what good that's what coke dealers YC buy cheap creatine are you saying the coke from a shady dude guys buying New Mexico coke I'm not saying yes million it might be listen I've smoked some weed from some fucking shady people preach and I'm a millionaire too pretty people bring me some weed if they're my friend my god bro smoke some weed you ain't lyin yeah I've ate some weird stuff yes yes yeah that's fair yeah I don't know if I buy investigate everything I eat no never Dave Chappelle gave me some edibles the other day I don't know where Dave Chappelle though if you ain't it I mean it bro in a bag he probably made himself pretty sure he ate mushrooms from a fan the other day that's so gangster that's so high yeah we went to see Once Upon a Time in America like you talk in the morning Dave rented out the entire movie theater we do this fucking sold-out show in the Tacoma Dome we break the all-time attendance record for

10:00 we fly to Salt Lake City and immediately everybody gets a IV vitamin drip well that day said I oh yeah yeah b12 shots these motherfuckers go rock special rock star style session Dave's got sunglasses on the entire time the whole crew is getting he has a posse with him he brings his own photographer it was madness legend I was like okay I see how you guys are doing oh we get by the way we get picked up at the airport in a tour bus takes a tour bus ten minutes in a tour bus to the airport from the airport to the hotel and you're flying privately and soon right why-why-why drive around an SUV we could driving a fucking tour but that's for fucking it's hilarious Wow so much fun how did this but this was what I was wondering so were you and Dave at the store and dave was like who asks who like you're both Titans Dave called up my well he called up his agent I want to do a show with Joe Rogan and then his agent calls up my agent and they call me and I go I'm in let's do it and then guys text out they're like yo what's going down no business is our business just met at the arena well look I love that guy so yes know each other you see yeah so he says you know when they say it I'm like yeah let's do it it sounds like an awesome idea and I'm free that weekend great idea it was only like five weeks out this show sells out 24 hours he doesn't have social media no but that was the thing is that since he doesn't have social media and I do it like magnifies everything because with all the fucking people that I have 7 million on Instagram and 5 million on Twitter and 2 million on Facebook it's like all of that shit and then the they mention it on the podcast we didn't forget everything we have you didn't have to it's like secret shows that sell out in like 30 second exactly well he does a lot of clubs and theaters and does whatever he wants he said he's a free bird you know I'm saying like he's free he just does whatever he wants he wears his own clothes - he does you know the great I love it man I could love it he's living wild man that you guys gonna do more together fuck yeah where I scheduling them I can't say anything cuz they're not so schedule we had a great goddamn time I - what drives me nuts was for any artists out there your guys's art nice I text you this you - then take this hi everyone you two are fucking legends man for you two to get together and do shows is insane and to use like shit that Muir Kalin use to promote the show stroke drove me not it's not dojo for the fans if you get a dope fucking artist to do something you and Dave Chappelle it's not for you I'm sure we will in the future any artist please may run off some t-shirts in Salt Lake City just a small batch for the fuck of it there's one I sent to Jamie it's jay-z and mmm in New York like two Titans coming together mmm man when I saw what you guys are posting I was like God motherfucker yeah you worry about that too much I don't know I don't I'm a fan that thinks that that's a history well we'll iron that out because we're gonna do a gang more of these so we'll iron all that shit out hey I'm sure Dave cares but he doesn't have social media not even funny social musical clothes no he doesn't even pay attention he's he's the the freest guy I've ever met in terms of not being locked into his phone he didn't even look at his phone on him let's me toes got a phone but he don't look at they didn't fuck with and he didn't get his phone calls you know it's like he face times people and shit he's not checking social media at all did you learn anything from him just being around him well that is interesting well I this is what I learned there's levels to everything and he's on this like super celebrity rock star level that's really weird it's really weird but he's so nice he's so like he's so fun to be around like part of why Dave is so funny is cuz he's fun like when you're around him it's not like he's serious and then he goes on stage and then he's funny ya know all day long all day long it's like leg slapping and looking in the eyes and fuckin cracking and high-fiving it's fun man he's a fun dude but he's also he's very wise he's wise in his approach like for instance he lives in the middle of Ohio and a fucking farm and that's by design because he does away from all the nice to get away from all the fucking noise man he wants you know he wants peace and quiet mixed in with these intermittent bouts of madness so he has these crazy Radio City Music Hall shows and similar to you though well you don't live in freakin no but LA but eventually I'm gonna move out of California how dare you yeah we get older no not that much time I think pretty soon no yeah you mean get a place but you're still gonna be here I'm gonna be storing shit I'm gonna eventually move yeah what yeah for good yeah a place here and I'm probably gonna still do shows out of this studio I'll fly in to do them like I'll probably wind up banking them like doing them in a week and then taking the rest of the month off Wow yeah I don't want to be what about the store there's two minutes well I love the store but you know I also love The Improv been doing a lot of improv shows and props great sounds great yeah ice house is amazing I'm still gonna do shows but I really think that there's something that's taxing about the volume of people here agree that bothers especially with kids when I and when I came back from Italy you know I was in Italy for 12 days when I came back like the fucking highway and we landed at like 10 o'clock at night just bumper-to-bumper on the screen five I was like this is stupid this is a stupid place to live because I travel so much I know I mean I could travel out of Denver you know I could live in Denver and travel out of there I'm just crowd as fuck to this bad month moving there it's a beast blowing up it's a lot yeah maybe Montana places to live that are more peaceful yeah but are you gonna be satisfied not doing sets every night at the store man there's no way mm-hmm like your happiness you know I'm saying like it's it's a weird balance because I hear you I hear you where the balance for your family and stuff but like I check off boxes when I go out at night and I can I seem like my I I don't I don't you're saying I don't hang out man I hang out to store when I see you there at the improv when I see my friends or this is me hanging out I check those boxes on that I don't hang out man yeah I need that yeah for my own sanity isn't it but I mean I feel like you can also get that when you tour you know you get that when you go on the weekends I think I'd have to do more clubs I can't just do theaters because I really feel like it's a numbers thing like in terms of almost like if you're doing cardio well you can't do hard cardio once a week inspect it expect to be in shape you won't be in shape do a bunch just do it many many times a week so if you're going to live somewhere other than LA I feel like you have to do at least five sets a week I think that's the magic number so I think you'd have to do a weekend where you're doing two shows a night Friday two shows a night Saturday need have to do a week night Thursday Friday so yeah Thursday Friday Saturday or Friday Saturday Sunday we can open your club Saturday is better than Thursday and Friday Saturday Sunday all sunday can suck my dick yeah Sunday man but that's the Lord's Day bro more of a night I never got to do Sunday enjoy Diaz I think you and your ideas Tony never do Sundays I did it once and I was depressed but also then I don't get a day off with my family yeah not good don't work Monday nights and then I don't work Sundays it's the only rule those are smart days yeah yeah I'm the same way with you Sunday and Monday is how I've been doing it lately yeah and you got to do that you gotta have those boundaries where you decide to take nights I mean occasionally I'll do a Monday night but most of times not most the time I take those off but I think there's a real benefit to not being overrun by the volume of people out here is that what you think that's why Dave one of the reasons he excels you guys are similar with that where you don't you're not really tuned in with like the masses meet me a tune in where you're not glued to your freaking no Twitter well so he's not in to go on the like red car but events and getting photo units do you hate that shit well I just feel like it's a circle jerk you know and everybody's just you know it's just weird the whole celebrity world is very weird it's very weird but I get how people love when you're famous and then you're around other famous people there's no only people that think you're normal you know they also understand what you're going through yeah yeah but it's it's like I ran into Jamie Foxx the other night at a steak house let's count again the R and nicest cans down the most town together but uh but when I see him it's like what's up buddy dude what's going on man and we talking and laughing and joking around I'm like he's he's never weirded I think he's so famous he's like he's probably never gets a chance to be a normal person ever unless he's around other famous people where you don't want to picture or autograph or you know all that movie you did yeah man yeah yeah I mean he he likes to just hang out and have fun I wish she'd get him back on the podcast he wants to do it we were talking about like a real long slow podcast that's time he's like pushing his sunglass or some shit oh yeah that's right he had a sunglass hit a great story no I don't somebody probably shackled out some fucking cheddar Oh to be fucked in the bullshit sunglasses yeah it was him in Germany Piven they were pushing sunglasses yeah it seemed alive no no I don't think I don't think no no nothing the company that's all that's know yeah yeah the things let's get it I think fizzled out but you gotta figure Jamie Foxx to push sunglasses you think you need money from your fucking sunglass sales they had to pay him fucking bang can I tell you ever tell you I ran to him in a gas station some guy pulls up in a fucking car that doesn't even look like it's from this planet some strange SUV some weird fucking I don't know what it's called but I looked at I was like what the fuck is when those apocalypse tank we are weird-looking thing that is it's I forget what it's based on it's based on like the frame of a Jeep Wrangler and they build this insane you know at $500,000 fucking SUV uzt and the window rolled down well Joe this is Jamie Foxx I'm like what are you doing Jane is this his friend was selling them his friends sell those probably gave it to Jamie to try for sure--they memory sold yeah almost like this is the craziest hardly ever seen it's so weird looking you know what it is they're big boxy right but yeah they have squeaky little lights yeah yeah yeah just a fox crazy SUV winos expensive jeep wranglers I got so far why I know this I don't know but it's a Chris Brown drives when the new is new video where he dances I always go over - yeah they're probably giving them away to people oh sure Rizvan eat ass yeah let me see what that bitch looks like yeah they're sick yeah that makes sense give it to Chris Brown you know that's it yeah that's it nothing so cool look at that thing it's not it's it's fucking Robocop like it's dope though you pulled up it's got the suicide doors in the back and the interior is gorgeous the engines made based off Jeep Wrangler I don't know what it is that's a dope ride man yeah but it's really incredible but I hear I want one I mean they're real expensive right fifty hundred eighty something oh oh that's not that bad not terrible million me too I was I thought at least 350 500 horsepower okay that's efficient 180 Wow isn't it funny that 500 horsepower used to be insanity I mean my brother talked about this on that my brother's a huge car you ever talking about this and I just got my Fri over 800 and that phrase I just got my firm over 800 so ridiculous power I'm so ridiculous here's the thing they're gonna come out while they the TDF in they have a TDF version of mine the only DF it's the this like the souped up version of mine it's the race version the only made 600 of them and that comes stock with like 817 horsepower but then they then throw I went cool story we're coming out with a 12 superfast v12 ten cents but they can't call the Tour de France SF caught TDF because Tour de France the in the bike boys on it did you see that shit where this guy had a super fast and he's apparently a very famous designer and he put his sneakers on the roof of this dope fucking Ferrari that he owns he owns this crazy green Ferrari superfast yes yes gorgeous and he put his sneakers which are green as well on the front and Ferrari sent him like a cease and desist and they threatened him this guy Philip plea n-- lashes out of for our over cease and desist letter but like look at the photo when an alligator jacket well of course he is surly I asked my wife and this guy's a fake look out dope that colorist I'm not usually in a green car that would that lizard grunting amazing Porsche makes the gt3 in it but that's so like a little metallic yeah there's a hot electric green yeah see there's any other pictures of his car but look at that he's got these dope sneakers and they're sitting on his Ferrari and Ferrari was angry they were like you're using our brand or something like that oh because I'm trying to think is he painted green then are those his shoes and it's with the Ferrari so they're like you know they said Ferraris trademarks and model cars are are associated in your pictures with a lifestyle totally inconsistent with Ferraris brand perception in connection with performers making sexual innuendos and using Ferrari cars as props in a manner which is per se distasteful this behavior tarnishes the reputation of Ferraris brands and causes ferrari further material damage in fact the undesirable connection between Ferraris trademarks on the one hand and filip planes line of shoes and the questionable manner in which they're promoted on the other hand is interfering negatively with the rights enjoyed by Ferraris selected licenses which are exclusively entitled to use Ferraris trademarks to produce and promote line of shoes Ferrari breath as nuns that's why I love FRA branded shoes fuck yeah they sell you know they sell more merch than cars they make their money off merch but about guy is a very successful designer his stuff is very expensive where re no you get that shit that's right your boy horrible no I'm just kidding dude no here's the thing he probably got allocated the super fast cuz you can't you know how Ferrari where she can't just walk in the store and buy one so you got allocated one so he probably owned other v12s it's a crazy like he's on Ferraris for ten years he said there you go so he gets allocated the new ones so he probably had access to the TDF then he got a super fast and then in painted green like an asshole with the cool colored green now he can't well he might have had it may paint to shit though I don't know I don't think Frey offers that green he'd right no no way really no he did that himself that's why fries like Jesus Christ dude be cool really yeah you don't think Ferrari offers that color I don't think so I would doubt it have you ever seen enough right he if they did my man he PI paid such a premium for that color cuz they don't make that color well the only one I've seen in the flesh is yours I've never seen one of those cars before yeah yeah well I seen one of them at a dealership I saw there's only 700 of them in the states I saw of gray like that battleship gray god it made my dick hard certain cars do man like I want so many cars I know it's crazy right yeah man it's a problem with cars I'll tell you that I love I absolutely love Ferrari I'm Afra I love Ferrari there's nothing like a Porsche mm I owe my fans of driving at least it Betty named I've had all the cars there's nothing as far as the driving experience but in the Porsche ya know I think I have to always have a Porsche the reason why I still have that 2007 gt3 RS the shark works worked on cars every time I get in there I get happy it just feels amazing it's just it one one that and also can feel and I want a goddamn manual transmitted to the floor sure is the last of the mohicans they still don't do it though for the gt3 RS and they still don't do it for the gt2 RS which they get in the gg3 touring the gt3 and the gt3 touring they'll they'll sell you with a manual transmission to get one of those to the new Corvette abandon the manual I know the fastest fuck know that I agree Comi i'm een you drive a Tesla but so what mmm but the Corvette to me it looks badass they completely ripped off Ferrari I mean that's a yes I mean come on some mid-engine car mid-engine cars yeah but I have a 65 Corvette with a giant Hurst shifter with a fuckin cue ball the cue ball shift that's the real guy that's America I know side pipes bitch I know I don't want one of those Corbett's though they look cool but I want dope man you wouldn't as er one comes out and it goes 0 to 16 3 milliseconds you know it's not all about 0 to 60 I'm not Vin Diesel I don't live my life one guess who else is in Vin Diesel Vin Diesel you right you were a fucker wear sunglasses at night yeah he does yeah he does you know he's gay he's quietly becoming a billionaire from The Fast and Furious franchise he owns it yeah so like yeah it is so like universal the rides not he's quite becoming a billionaires probably in a castle somewhere doing Caligula shit and fucking dude he's in the wife beater like barbecuing all the time he's barbecuing yeah and passive req I do too but in a beater if we're a wife beater my wife yells at me I go shirtless rightfully so if I have a wife beater I shall stop making fun of me that's it's so old what's he doing but fucking singing to be honest okay I'm gonna show up with this with Viral show Jodo drunk in love he starts it's the longest three minutes he made it himself and we can't play this oh I had the song we're gonna they can hear the but they can hear the adios unnecessary just the Dancing's on this but dude he's celebrating like his movie went I don't know platinum or some shit like that so he does drunken love he doesn't cover if him singing okay can you hear it listen I'm not team right you do not live your life one quarter mile at a time if you're doing this I'm on Team the rock all day every day he's feeling the lock don't get along they hate each other how does everything happen there I heard Rock was a big diva on set clock diva that's what I heard from who people would you hear that on the that we're on the set just that you know the rock sometimes shows up late and there's trailers and he wanted the biggest trailer and I'll sleep in diesel you know he's mr. fuckin fast and furious who knows who's right listen he just did Beyonce cover so I don't know sixteen rules let's kill it I'm fast enough yours have to follow on set what there's rules certain guys can't get hit a certain amount of times they have to win fights and certain ways you know the ronica tree go back to that that's not I'm just go back to it go they have to go to Racing School in Las Vegas that that makes sense that looks fast and furious yeah but you know the rocking of Vin Diesel couldn't be on set at the same time they hate each other so bad then just shoot different scenes and like like shoot it so it looked like someone was there they hate each other so much didn't the rock gotten a big thing with Tyrese - right right I was just flipping out because like all he has is fast and furious so that when they rock did a spin off he's like how dare you we're a family rock like no we're not well enough dumbass but remember when the rock was shitting on his music that was fantastic well it cuz Rock is so positive Tyrese Gibson reignites fast feud with Dwayne Johnson called spin-off hops and chars not a win you went crazy you went crazy this is all I've got and yes Will Smith for money that's what he's mad about why dear ass Will Smith for money I don't know if they aren't hard time making me sad yeah the video here's the thing people lose their mind man the actors really lose their mind they work rate cuz you pretend to be someone else all the time yes just the rock not good for you that guy you know what he does just goes to the gym the rock with two hours sleep a lot of steroids yeah I think Joe do you really you think he's getting big like that from cocaine again used to cocaine no I'm saying that Jon Jones they but I'm just saying like anyone it me me and Brett cries were talking about this think Brits can make a bit of it but when you see the rock you know it is working out two hours of sleep for sure he's doing that stuff man and he's grinding he's on private jets he is loaded on performance-enhancing drugs his body is pulsing as your boy too constitutes a with fun no Jason Statham and the rock refused to lose fights against one another Jason Statham come on bro Jason settle down yeah how about you both about you really fight and then that determines what happened yeah you weigh a hundred and seventy pounds used to be a limping swimmer you know that he's a bad motherfucker though Jason Statham but the rock is an enormous human well how are they the same height there that doesn't make any sense that is strange is he on a box that doesn't make any sense okay ijou egocentric demands are nothing new on how hope first of all we don't know if this is true and this is the Guardian which is kind of a nonsense website so let's just stop read it's interesting though and then you know it's but it's also probably true behind the movie series told the Wall Street Journal paywall that actors including Jason Statham between the rock Johnson and Vin Diesel have contracts demanding that limit the amount of punishment their characters taking fights they don't look like good you imagine telling your agent that like I'm down to do it ma'am I wrote through the script when he punches me in the face I'm not going down bro I'm not good you imagine doing that so crazy think of your group of friends were around you like dude what the fuck you doing what's up Jason Diesel's sisters reported to have been present on set asking for her brother was going to get his licks back in that could she bidden joking around my sister might say that too if she saw me in a movie get my ass kicked fuck him up we've been laughing together I'd slap her in the face get my legs back in we know it's fake bitch I'm also making a hundred million dollars you gonna you'd whip my ass every scene for that money it's funny when a movie franchise just gets bananas huge like that just so big and Vin Diesel's like yeah cool man but he's always doing a million things at once I have no easy is he just doing fast what else is he doing bro please go television show we're now yes he does yeah like a game show Fear Factor type television show he is always doing something he's also doing Jumanji he did a new Jumanji no time at the rock oh you don't like the rock would you save in the Vin Diesel there were all he does it no VIN deal goes I'm gonna fatten up yes I make a billion dollars you said Vin Diesel oh I'm sorry drunk unless he's fixed on the ride that Universal still rock is always doing a million different things at once always he's got ballers on HBO he's got that that TV show that he does which is like some crazy fuckin Fear Factor type deal he's got Jumanji he's always filming a million different movies here's the thing do that again to my point lot of steroids a lot before ants and drugs and I'm all about it I have no problem with this but let's tell the kids like it is like I thought Arnold was an I was like man whole thing get there one day if I keep in the gym I wish my dad and like ah ah it's never happening we gotta inject some shit in your ass forgot to Vin Diesel as in the Avengers what what he's Groot he's the voice of the gallic site takes him 30 minutes yeah I take some 30 minutes to do that yeah um you know what else that - that I did with Chappelle that opened my eyes do you never done one those things you have done Ivy ivy vine swear by him brother I sweated a bag and a half and I was ready to run through a wall I know some of your house yeah they'll come anywhere yeah they came to our hotel room yeah I get them at the crib all the time do you really like my girls pregnant again we have another one coming November and further nausea SH we we get IVs ice we all do to night and day it's amazing for like pumping you up no I'm very excited to get it we had a you had a show there and like I showed up wasted I think type of like the New Year's Eve UFC I had to get it done you felt so much better minutes 20 minutes I was good to go yeah it's crazy you know what's crazy means the UFC doesn't allow well you feel so good you can mask the use of performance-enhancing drug speaking of performance-enhancing drugs let's talk about the cyborg situation I knew you're getting good how about that he Dana go hard in the paint you know I like when he goes hard in the paint he's he only got listen say what you want about Dana and I I do like it like we always say can you imagine for another Commission - this another one did this but I do like when he does spit that because what he's saying is the truth like sometimes he's on one you're like what the fuck you talk about you screwing these guys over then sometimes like with a cyber thing when you send that to me like I agree with him a hundred percent you know I love when he does that well they fucked up and they really fucked up means cyborgs stay in cyborg steam whoever did it whether it's her boyfriend sure whoever it was that edited that video that lied and put words in his mouth is so fucking stupid you don't think that they're gonna do something about that you're out of your goddamn mind when they edited that video to say that whenever I'm talking public I'm not telling the truth which is not what he said at all and then they have it edit and cut right there well I'll say this right now Dana's too smart let's say he would let's say he thinks that you think he would say that in a public forum - cyborg when they're face to face like that and you don't think you realized there's cameras around no he's way too smart for that so a that I'm like well he's not that dumb B that video was you can tell it's so full of shit same thing happening with me and Nate Diaz had our confrontation I don't say any of that stuff someone made that all up yeah well but also they did was they were bringing back shit that happened five years ago like and Cyborg was saying she wanted an apology from me and I don't think it was that she wanted apology from me I think it was her boyfriend or someone on the team I apologized to her me and her no one around face to face and I took a photo with her afterwards there's a photo of meandher on my Instagram would you see he was just like Amy my guys were talking I'm fighting in the UFC she hadn't fought in the UFC before and I said hey I'm sorry about the jokes I promise no more jokes and I said I am actually a fan of yours and I want you to succeed in the UFC and I wish you the best of luck I got no hard feelings you know those you know those jokes kind of hurt my feelings and I'm sorry I go I promise no more jokes I gave her a hug and we took a picture together and that was when was that 2017 so here's the only time where I'm like god damn in his shirt her kids getting bullied at school because of the comic I didn't know she had a kid oh yeah yeah how many kids Joe she has one daughter I think in like fourth grade she goes because of the narrative that the UFC's painted right or wrong I get it from the UFC site doesn't mean it's right narrative that she's this heel she's this monster pd's right yeah but that's because she tested positive once we don't talk about Jon Jones he's a possible more than once first of all there's Jon Jones got tested positive for this tiny amount of something that probably came from a tainted supplement she tested positive for a serious steroid and something that you you're like a woman taking a steroid is different than a man taking you some way to take out female male which is tough to do but it is there's been people who have tested positive before where that's not their narrative Brock Lesnar yeah but it is Brock Lesnar's narrative it's also Alistair Overeem's narrative is it yes or is it TR TV to UFC doesn't tell you that though and they're not Marcus that's the fans do the marketing the fact that starboard was taking steroids then I oh they market her into this kind of heel roll dog where if you know her she's awesome do you think but no the marketer is destroyer what she is in her career this is very destroyed but also yeah in a good way look if you look at her fights you look at the fight with look when it gets dark is when you go back to the non testing days like the Gina Carano fight which it veins coming out of her face and she looked Gina Khurana this way my argument for doesn't mean interrupt you but Gina Carano ate the hottest chica to ever fight MMA be fought cyborg when she was juiced to the gills didn't pretty well the Proactiv already well but efficient about to Gina Carano eventually got beaten down and there's a video there's a picture rather of cyborg holding Gina's face and punching her and you see the black fingernails and and she's got this mean look in her face and she's punching Gina in the face I think it's one of James you ever seen that picture I've never seen it dude it's it's one of those pictures it was the mais no NASA standing photo of cyborg punch is it that one was French yeah no no no look at the black lady she grabbed her face like that end puncher well guys the end of the fight I mean she's already beating her down but I mean she's holding her face with those black fingernails and just crushing Gina's head she beat the shit out of her but Gina was a beast man and she hung in there as long as she could but the consensus was that cyborg was juiced up enough well in that one right you mark as Beauty and the Beast right that's just the way it is Gina's a gorgeous individual cyborg not so much when it comes to the the feminine I can't the looks department so you I get that marking up you in the Beast I was taught I had a Kyla Harrison on you know that is the BFL she's a two-time gold medalist judoka Kayla Harrison yeah monster and she wants she's in the PFL and she's in the tournament there and she's she wants to fight cyborg yeah well there's a lot of people that are fuck wanting to fight she definitely wants right undefeated gold medalist and I was talking to her about why does she why does she think that kind of cyborg has gone down this road in her career and then I pitched her on you know if I found the UFC in here maybe this might be completely fucking wrong I don't know but this is how I would do and this is what they're doing is what I think but if I'm the UFC as nice as a person cyborg is there's no other girl walking this plant that looks like cyborg really because maybe peds to your point well there's a light moment when you say maybe like most likely that's what I'm saying yeah and I'm trying to be cool I'm trying to be nice I know you try there's a lot of girls that look like that's longer like Paige Vanzant or Ronda Rousey or Miesha Tate so they're gonna push those girls more because that's what people can relate to more than a girl like cyborg and I don't think I'm saying anything no one has assumed already and this and I like cyborgs a nice person and I don't think cyborgs a bad person I think her management and the way they've handled things have completely fucked her and I think her going to battle with UFC was the worst thing and it's not hurt I don't think it's her either and I think she is a nice person and every phenomenal fine interacted with her look even that last fight and that was a thing with the Spencer fight like that people were saying that oh you guys it was biased commentary no it wasn't that girl survived that girls listen blog I'm using Tom Taylor was her eighth pro fight but still a 10-8 round cyborg beat the fuck out of renewed that fight was in close no no wasn't close but the narrative was how tough she was I'm like cyborgs beaten up bragged on this girl and she cut cyborgs face wide open one with one elbow yes gives a fuck beat up the rest of the fight there's the round here was that she was gonna run through that girl and she didn't that girl's toughest shit was that was a competitive fight well she doesn't have striking on the level of doesn't have power to keep cyborg offer she's done side working lit her up like your Christmas tree like though there was 1080 rounds and I was like oh that fight Simon close no it's not I feel you guys cuz it's the Jon Jones things when you go into a fight it's like when Jon doesn't destroy someone you're talking about the other guy yeah it was cyborg to he expected us to murder ah go Santos was way closer I mean that was a way closer fight Thiago Santos was at one point he went some rounds well as a split decision for sure yeah yeah someone judge thought the Tiago won the fight I don't agree with that jump but that's how close that fight was there was no one that thought that Spencer won that fight after it was over but it was amazing that she was able to endure the fucking beating the cyborg put on it was a tough girl not was saying no it was one of those fights where it really like no one's clamoring for that fight in the first place no I was asking for that fight not me other than her yeah I'm excited for the fight card next weekend in huh because the cards I don't know if you agree with this the cards up to this point being dogshit the main events have been good but not they've been well shit but I think there's so many the main events have been great other than that been awful cards Anaheim this guy's maybe Ken what else who else fought this past weekend I looked at the card I mean I don't know there's other fights in the undercard there were some good fights Jim Miller is Cle guida was wild jim miller Clay Guida was fucking wild but in terms of like tidal implications yeah this is the big one this weekend you got Yoel Romero next week where's Paula Coast Yoel Romero versus Paula Costa which is best body contest of all time first team all diamond yeah amazing fight - I mean Costa is just on a fucking rampage just going snitch is just like fellas yeah yeah fellas know the deal yo I was the Freak of all freaks you know I mean he is the freak OSes no punky there was nobody no both of them both of them were beasts that's an amazing fight yes deep ADC which to me is so interesting you know what - it wasn't interesting to me - I came on in a while a few months ago and you were talking about it and I'm like that is a really good fucking fight because if you go back and watch the first fight with Steve in DC DC wasn't dominating and then clipped them you know and steep a set time ste pays a motherfucker like that's a really good fight man well I don't like the long layoff first EP I like like when you get those the reason why I like it is he was coming off of that fucking crazy war with Francis in Ghana where he took some big shots particularly in the first round how impressive is that now that we know what Francis capable yeah Francis knocks everybody dead and steep is the only guy not to just to survive Francis but to beat him he figured it out like a champion got him to the ground you know neutralized all his weapons and beat him I think I think deceive or I think Francis first IPE would be different this time I think I think Francis made leaps and bound improvements to grab confidence it's not so Rockstar reckless lifestyle and his egos in check like you sit and talk to my girl fuck this guy's tune in man yeah I mean it's look and he knows what's at stake now with Daniel you know and Daniel knows - I mean Daniels treating it like he's about to fight the greatest heavyweight of all time you know that's his approach I mean that's what he said to me behind the scenes and but he just thinks he's better in every way and he thinks he's going to beat him again and steep a thinks he just got clipped with that one punch if he doesn't get clipped with that one punch she wins that fight you know what I'll take both arguments yeah you're right you're right let's see what happens it's such a great amazing amazing fight and then you got Pettis vs. Nate Diaz that's that one series yeah yeah well that's interesting look Nate doesn't want to cut any weight and pedis just knocked out wonder boy so he's like fuck it let's do this Pettis last fight was against the mighty Ferguson right wonderboy was it yeah knocked out wonder boy 20 Ferguson was before that all your person was at 55 that's right and pedis is first fighter at 70 I mean look man when you when you've been starving yourself to get to 45 and 55 and then finally fight at 170 and you knock wonderboy out with a Superman punch it's my weight class but the only question was Nate Diaz and I would assume Nate Diaz I'm sorry Anthony Pettis to the favor cuz Nate Diaz hadn't fought not hot fuckin I think he is the favorite I bet Nate's I bet he Pettis the favorite yeah let's check in terms of you think Diaz would be the favored net yeah thanks oh dude with the light kicks from Anthony Pettis well I think gambling well I think but I think Pettis the favorite okay maybe you might think Pettis is the favorite in terms of the way you view the fight yeah but when you think about favorites favorites depend upon who's betting for who and I think there's gonna be a shit ton of people betting on Nate Diaz hey Diaz has an army behind ya I didn't put money he's a huge star he's one of them least he's like the worst promoted superstar him and him as brother Matt thanks for the animation giants my favorite my - 125 Pettis and Nate's even money and Pettis is - 130 see what happens it's just another layoff yeah I agree it's gonna bet I bet the money you're probably right the money because Nate Diaz is so famous the monies can go his way well that's on the course pull the rest of the card up so will you see the roster card cuz it's a great card even on top of that what else we got boy Derek Brunson sighs yeah I mean it's a little dicey after those top three but I feel yeah but there's probably more in the ESPN card let's see what else you got with the ESPN card yeah oh my boy slurry hits and a Hagan telling us is a son Sal that's great for that man that he beats him your ass unseat to me when I talked about guys who were gatekeepers there I don't believe in the term gatekeeper were like oh you get to top 10 the guys in the twilight of his career to me gatekeepers you beat him you get title shot yeah a son sells that guy if you beat him you got to fight one or the champ Oh champ and that's where it's Santa Higgins right at what did you think about a Marlin Mariah submitting a son Sal I mean that was pretty crazy amazing but then how much did you learn from you know Marlon writes his last fight where he lost we got kind of got broke man I thought I wonder what was happening there I wonder if it's stress of the fight if that's what made him fatigued here's here's what y'all pay attention to is when Mark Henry is to me the best coach in MMA him or for us when he's in the corner and he he must have seen in trainer and something because he goes think about your mom don't give up think about your fucking mom what took you to come here when a coach has to pull out that fucking yellow card after the first round he's thinking yeah that that's why I'm like oh he's quitting practice before now mark text me if I'm wrong but I assume that he seen some sort of quit in him in practice when you gotta go think about your mom after the first round you go zero to 100 think about your mom's around that means he saw something that he's seen in practice before he went all fucked there it is no no no dude dude you remember tonight your fucking mom what took to get here and still didn't work the crazy thing is if you saw that first round you thought Marlon mirai's is the best fighter in the world yeah like my god so who doesn't even belong anybody was so screwed yeah Mike so who does fucked how good is he who's oh he's getting his legs destroyed he had an injury unstoppable belief in himself unstoppable he just believes in himself past reality he's arguing right now these pound-for-pound best in the world because gold medalist then to division champion yeah got some work to do though my God says hold my little bear yeah I beat a shitload of dudes they're tiny they're tiny you know like a little fucking diet coke yet you go to a kids party like yeah yeah that's a it's not a good argument in terms of him being the best of all time but in terms of being the one of the greatest combat sport athletes all times that sure Olympic gold medalist and then UFC champion in two different way clauses fuck but what the thing about that Kayla Harrison who's a two-time gold medalist if she were able to get a championship over in PFL come over the UFC two gold medals that's not sure but she will not be fighting the same caliber fighters that Henry cejudo fought no that's that's just where the females are at right now it's just where they're out unless she fights Valentina Shevchenko or Amanda Nunez those who trains with Amanda Madison retire by the time she gets the UFC Amanda Nunez Valentina Shevchenko or as good as any fucking male do later on the planet especially volunteer striking for Tina is so she's assassin she's so technical what's a man in units do not his hurt cyborg was a fight I still think they make the side work fight anyway absolutely don't you think Danny's gonna do what he said he would do it he said I'll do it fuckin commoner one fight contract if she wants to do it she could do but she does not want to fight a man at Nunez so Dean is smart all that shit that he said he knows she calls me up right now and she says she wants to fight Amanda Nunez I'll make the fight he goes but she's not gonna do it so he said if she calls me up I will make the fight putting the ball in her court nice don't worry that's not gonna happen cuz you lookin she's got to be devastated by that video whoever made that video I don't know who it is you don't know who it is I know it wasn't her no she didn't make that stupid you know what are you trying she doesn't tweet her boyfriend tweets for it's so exhaust it's just complaining it's not her - it's so dumb and then she'll post on like Sunday like hey everybody what's your

this up I hope not I got a bunch of Asian people that work for me I mess it up all the time do you think agent people do that with white people like you Portuguese I don't think so it's obvious I wish pretty obvious are you polish G Paul are you Swedish what are you never let's go you're white born in Hong Kong according to Wikipedia it's tough dude it's tough I got a Filipino that works for me and I get a Korean have you ever watched those fucking protests on TV we're at Hong Kong been going nuts down and then making changes I think it's been gone forever yeah it's hot seconds people I've been avoiding the news with the mass shootings I got nothing gets me in a depression like mass shootings now it's a bomber man it's a bummer and it's like you know I had Bernie Sanders on you sir that's what scares me even more we had them on you go Bernie what do you do with this no answers no one has an answer no one smartest fuck banning assault rifles and all the NRA people like good luck with that see but here's my thing I know you got a big thank you oh my god we're looking at a photo of Hong Kong right now and it is the most insane crowd of people that are filling the street you can take a sand of beach sand of people it's like the women's March times a million on steroids that women's marchers weakest fuck no this is serious shit what's there now what is the problem what there was anti extradition bill that people are oh because the extradite people to China to get prosecuted correct is that what it is yeah and they don't want that shit anti extra okay okay process series of ongoing demonstrations in China in Hong Kong rather against the fugitive offenders and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters legislation amendment feel proposed by the government of Hong Kong this legislation was proposed by the Security Bureau in 2019 in response to a murder that occurred in Taiwan the previous year which the suspect had fled to Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region Hong Kong is jurisdictionally distinct from mainland China and maintains a separate governing and legal system under the one country two systems' principle the regional government was unable to transfer the fugitive to Taiwanese authorities citing a lack of formal extradition arrangements between the two jurisdictions in Hong Kong pick your metals yeah if enacted the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite people who are wanted in countries or territories that Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements with including mainland China well the problem is that Hong Kong until a certain yeah well Hong Kong was was controlled by Britain right until a certain amount of time and then they gave it back to China and the people that live there are very unhappy with this shift from I think it was Great Britain got their best yeah talk about man yet the defecation is very it's so rigid I mean they're so authoritarian scary you're lucky counts on here you'd have a three-hour podcast you what did you say Hong Kong China let me break it down for you here's my thing back to the the mass shootings in the gun control with the semi-automatic weapons if they said hey man if we get rid of semi-automatic weapons there won't be any more mass shootings like this don't you think in general most people like yeah cool take a man okay that fun no are they that cool to shoot people would not do that there's the why do you need them doesn't it doesn't matter whether you need them that's a stupid joke listen it is stupid it's a real problem man the projects are dying left and right okay but you're looking at it the wrong way you got to look at yes in terms of the way they're looking at it they're not gonna say okay you take them because their ideas the government eventually wants all your guns and they're going to start with assault weapons and then work their way to all weapons what if they just are you looking at worst-case scenario what if it's just a salt because of the mass shootings because they don't think that they should be able to do that they think that the government does not have the ability to take away your guns but we have a problem the problem is crazy people shooting people the problem with automatic probably not guns shooting people right so we interesting you're gonna go after those people that have the guns that have never done anything well they you're gonna say well the Second Amendment protects my right to keep and bear arms because amendments written in the 1700s that hasn't changed true the thing is though is if you K hey we have a problem if we can get rid of these for now the future we're good to go what I'm saying is the thing most Americans would be like yeah you're right man we don't need them that bad that's that's mind-blowing to me it is people want and Ferraris are killing people left and fucking right dude you got to get off the road with this thing so many people are dying but get rid of the fucking Ferrari yeah but that's a simplistic perception of what's actually going on no one's gonna think about it that way they're gonna think mean the people that don't have guns are gonna think about it that way the people that are I'm against an amendment enthusiasts are gonna say this is a slippery slope don't give them any ground like Joe Buck has been saying we're gonna take your assault weapons this is one of the things that Joe Biden has said publicly and this is one of the reasons why the people that are pro Second Amendment are never going to vote for them yeah they think that if you give in in any way shape or form we're gonna take every slope and they're gonna take away pistols I mean California's already reduced the size of the magazines but that actually I think that was voted back like I think that was ruled to be unconstitutional they had like limited magazines like you don't have a magazine like six rounds or ten rounds or someone know was ten I think they're trying to make it lower but that dad has been reversed I'm pretty sure here's my thing with the mental health area as well America has a mental health problem there's a mental health problem all around the world we just have a gun problem that's not true the message is just here the mental health problem in the United States is extremely exacerbated by the use of Psych drugs there's way way way more problems too brother they don't have nearly as many prescribe drugs in Europe as they do are you sure yes SSRIs you talk to Bernie say no no I do I know I do not psychologists yeah you fight in your research it's this pharmaceutical Lobby in this country look obviously not everybody on psych drugs is out murdering people the problem is many many many layers right there's people that are abused there's people that grow up with a lot of violence there's people that grow up and the you know there's they're psychotic they they have psych drugs the psych drugs are disassociated some people just be bad apples though like does it always have to be a mental illness like all these shooters just happen to have mental illness all of them well someone just don't suck at life maybe some suck at life but almost all of them I mean in the high 90% or on psych medication oh yeah yes and as coming from someone who's who was murdered by his wife when she was on an SSRI and on cocaine like people when they're on those drugs it's a varying reaction and suicidal thoughts are very common as well as homicidal thoughts very common and also the the feeling that things aren't real the people that I've talked to that we're on SSRIs they got off of them one of the things that they all say is that nothing seemed real that's what you did everything like a simulation yes everything I'm doing Linc and those kids yeah yeah everything felt flat I think that's a big problem for sure a crazy person with a semi-automatic weapon is a real problem and you would want to take a semi-automatic weapon away from a crazy person the other but the problem is if there's a guy like you who has a semi-automatic weapon you have a ranch somewhere and he just like shooting coyotes and fucking fucking metal targets that are out in the distance and you don't harm anybody and you're a good person you are technically protected by the Second Amendment and why should you but okay but then what about your pistol should you take your pistol what about your shotgun what if you get a shotgun and you fucking keep real light on just automatically again to the with shotgun they're not gonna kill as many people it depends on whether or not that people are armed if the people are not armed then running around a mall you can kill a lot of fucking people with a shotgun that's me was that automatic yes maybe yeah maybe I mean here's what the scary thing to me you're one the smartest people I know Bernie Sanders a smart motherfucker this he lives in this world when you said what are we gonna do his aunts I was like that was as good as mine it's true dude you're right there's no one that's scared now it it's a good thing to be scared because there's no one out there has a shining light like one answer you like that's it the smartest minds in the world and then listen I'm like well I've thought of that well I can work for me dude the Joe Biden answers the dumbest answer we're gonna take away your guns you're gonna have a civil all guns you can't you can't take Lincoln it was insane take away assault guns and assault rifles you're not gonna do that they're not gonna give them well it's not constitutional and say they do do it Joe let's say they do do it there's too many out already right there's too many on the market is let's say you four hundred million guns in this car and how many people that there's 300 thousand people in this 300 million there's a hundred million more guns and there are people okay so you're not so if you stop the manufacture of automatic guns right now there's still a hundred thousand more than people out there and then you would have to go get them later you have to go door to door and certainly can't do that you can't that what everyone's thinking will happen it's not realistic like the whole dream shit how else you gonna get those guns from that's clearly not the answer is it that's never gonna happen no it's something no no one's can give you those guns so that's not the answer I don't know what the answer I don't either but the crazy thing is if you look at the mass shootings across the world at the most in other countries see like two or three know for us it's over 300 already this year I think it's 270 something and a mass shooting is three or more yeah the other thing to me that's interesting is I used to always think it was kids who are you know are in their basement on reddit or these losers and they they have nothing to live for pride true some of them some of most nine out of ten but then he got homeboy like over in uh where was it Ohio who had these chicks are coming out he's banging in a few girls had a bunch of girls that like man we saw signs he was always talking about mass shootings like he having something he had a rape list in high school oh yeah they all fit he's fucked up they all thought he was really fucked up but he was also Elizabeth Warren supporter who wrote posts about the need for gun control after different mass shootings I mean he was a real left-wing guy and this is something that then the media is ignoring because it doesn't fit the narrative because the narrative is they're all white male right-wing you know and he was left-wing he was left-wing like yeah he was a leftist I mean he he wrote leftist he him as his pronouns on his pate Wow yeah I mean he was but it has nothing to do with him he's a psychopath they're saying the kid that they caught and got it I don't want to talk about my students punch me i when did after this we'll move on something else but they're saying the kid that got in El Paso who did the one who didn't up dying what she did die but he was saying that it shows no remorse he's like fuck yeah I did it man like are you kidding me dude you killed kids he's like you're damn right I shot a baby how crazy is that yeah and he's gonna get a cushy fuckin you know Rome he's loving better than we you know most these fucking immigrants that come here and get detained it's it's insane man they should definitely kill him and they should definitely should torture man uh just just just uh just a quick it's a it's not a fair manner but having him suffer doesn't help anybody it really doesn't but having him around doesn't help anybody either no you're not gonna reform that here's the is the good thing though in his manifesto he went hopefully someone gets to me and shoots me so I don't have to go through the legal system that's way worse it'd be way better die real quick so at least he doesn't want this that's a good thing why is it all white dudes know we're a mess you know Charlotte be like crazy bro Charlemagne actually put that that it was all these white guys that white guys are the biggest threat in terms of terrorism in America and Instagram took his post how crazy that the more of a threat than Isis but he had flavor dose of all these different white guys who committed mass murders and as a white guy I'm like yeah yeah me too I wish it Charlemagne yeah yeah you right but they took his post down well how crazy is that then they put it back up they put it down right they did Sherman has empowerment well he made his case and he's correct he had literal photographs of all the different people that were white that have committed mass murders like shit named the last time the last time there was a black guy that committed a mass murder was those fucking guys in DC they were shooting people out of their car I don't at this DC sniper there was a son in a father yeah it was a guy in a younger guy whether it was a younger guy was his son that's a serial killer though yeah yeah not so much a mask it was a time one yeah he wasn't killing three but that was scary because people were just said like gas stations getting merked well you know this fuckin sniper in his van well no he had a car and he had a sniper's nest like he was shoot out of the trunk all that she had a hole in the trunk we put the barrel out of the trunk I mean carried yeah I mean you would just see people in the distance and just unload dude have you seen that it won't move on have you seen the documentary uh it's like terrorist John Isis John it's a documentary on HBO oh no I heard that's crazy jihadi John jihadi John yeah I heard it's Craig his fucking memory yeah it's crazy Joe see it oh it's fucking good dude it's crazy this was a like a normal dude grew up in England he was a refugee right from I think Syria or something like that somewhere comes England played foot shock or footballs they call it grew up normal had friends was just a normal dude and then just went free to happen to him they had these girls that went over from England to and they joined Isis and they're trying to get out and now they can yeah because they got over then the homies are run a train on you at 1:00 p.m. every day that's the way it goes yeah you fucking moron and the other dressed like Jabba the Hutt yeah dressed like a ninja I really thought it was well else do you have to be you gotta be pretty stupid like that fuck were you thinking you know dressed like a ninja and the homies gonna run a train on every day what you thinking we do with front front and centre with automatic rifle firing at Americans you morons I wonder what they thought when they thought they were fighting for good imagine if that's your daughter your daughter goes and joins Isis like see I was thinking about this the the Manson murders why I'm so until I have no idea I get problems but the man Thermage those girls were like 17 and 19 imagine when you're 17 but they were also homeless so you're dealing with people that are probably crazy crazy booze that was their family right this was like the first time they had ever had like real family and they didn't know the murder what the exactly they were gonna do till they got to the house then they're like all right I guess one girl dips out the other two are like all right let's do this it was once upon a time in Hollywood their depiction of it twist you saw it loved it I cannot get enough of the 60s I want a 68 Porsche right in that movie like amazing yeah I mean Brad Pitt was great in that movie Leonardo DiCaprio she went on Oscar they were both amazing how about them how about the way they depicted Bruce Lee that was fucked up was it was it was it I don't know like I and I'm sure Bruce Lee's dodging and jump all over us with the stuff Bruce Lee was a philosopher it was he a fighter was he really that much of a badass I don't know like I've heard I've heard he is I've heard from people like no he's never been really a lot of fights I've heard I've heard both so what I thought was great is they put like Quentin Tarantino put his perspective on it where it's like I've heard that narrative and I loved it because I've what I've seen both way heard where he wasn't that much of a badass like he doesn't have a crazy record yeah but it wasn't just that it he was a dummy in the movie and the problem was in real life there's no evidence that he was ever at like an egomaniac dummy who was very interesting guy and very insightful and I do and I believe it he was like a philosopher and he's brilliant but when it comes to the actual toughness we don't we don't know what we don't we don't know for sure but that that's one you've heard that narrative before right what narrow that like he's not an actual tough guy well what I had heard was that it at the time he was incredibly innovative in terms of martial arts but he didn't really fight and he had like a sparring match wants it a tournament yeah and he had some street fights but he didn't you know he wasn't like John Jones and there but then I've also heard that it was this badass and fought other dudes from dojos and he's amazing I'm somewhere in the middle I bet he's a big soval so what was not the problem though the problems they made him look like a buffoon there's no evidence it's a movie everyone's crying about a real person who was a real legacy in about come on Joe it's a fucking Quentin Tarantino movie and the way that they I don't get spoiled the ending with the ending - that's not real well that's true then they had a totally different ending like you're living to make-believe everything no no one's real in that except for like obviously the the ranch is real where they went Charles Manson who's barely in it the Manson Family yeah but everyone everyone's kind of dumb like even even Leonardo DiCaprio his characters a bit of a kid he's a bit of a dumbass yeah but that real guy might have been a dumbass and we don't know but we do know that Bruce Lee either yeah but there's a lot of evidence that Bruce Lee was this brilliant insightful guy and in that movie they made him a caricature of that and you have a problem with that I did I stood up I didn't laugh laugh I don't have a problem with it because it's it was so good cuz I thought I thought Bruce is gonna beat the fuck out of Brad Pitt and then when you see that when I went that twist is hilarious I don't expect it and I think of Bruce Lee is a badass which he is whether he's been in a million fights or not - wait what he's done for martial arts is is not present it's amazing what he did so take that twist for me in the mood I want from the families action oh my god the sisters started me his daughters pissed you beep if that's my dad yeah like fuck you and that movie so big like fuck you guys because one last time Bruce Lee got brought up besides Jesse at roots a fight selling a Bruce Lee t-shirt once I think I brought the fuck up the dude who played Bruce Lee was not quiet rented enough yeah sure been more shredded yeah Trevor see I like the twist because a it's not real be you thought Bruce Lee beat the fuck out of Mad Men no I did for sure I was like oh he's got to get fucked up my new brand also the way he Bruce Lee doing that jumping flying kick his signature kick that's probably how a toad yeah I'm talking about the guy who's been in fights I get that fuck a tit I think Bruce Lee's philosophy in real fights though was that keeping things simple like leg kicks and quick punches you're living reality joke you're living in the legacy of Bruce Lee which is probably true but in a Quentin Tarantino movie that was fucking great man I thought that movies brilliant I thought it was brilliant I did not like the Bruce Lee things because I thought it was it wasn't necessary was they made him look like a dork but everyone sucked his dick so to mix it up it's fantastic like Bruce Lee everyone you know he's the best and I agree he's the best so it's a movie that's supposed to be about a real guy that has a real legacy and they made him look like a buffoon it's the den v's though I know but they you know you're making the guy look like a fucking idiot yeah but anyone who wasn't really in it wasn't it at all not at all he's a brilliant philosopher and when it did for martial arts that is amazing but in the movies great that's what's great cuz we know he's great and you assume he's gonna beat up Brad Pitt you're a weird fucking guy I don't know why you like I think that's good I like the twist like if you were to beat Brad Pitt up I went all right well yeah moving on I didn't think that was gonna happen I thought Brad Pitt was gonna fuck him up I'll hide in it Brad Pitt knew how to fight yeah who's a bigger guy and he knew how to fight and the reality is a bigger guy who knows how to fight who really knows how to fight is gonna fuck up 130 pounds I know you're thinking about it too much do you think about things talk about weight you want to do though yeah you're like yeah I love the twist I love the twist his family's furious right yeah this is his daughter's pissed she I was looking into uh just people talking about what really happened I guess her this might come from a story from some both there was a real interaction which we trying to figure out hiss so hard came because this wrap this up it's already 4:30 is it fuck out of here um good night everybody wait what's going on ok I'm in Portland next week with Dirk Poston Chappelle
