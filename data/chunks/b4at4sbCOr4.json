having one in your studio firstly this one this is from the nineteen seventies it's a gold crown too Oh oh hi ball goes in and you scratch you don't win you stick my mother the time Volga Scarponi that ball and anywhere on the table all right well you have a nightmare it's not a victory you have a one ball that's wide open but two balls tied up at the 8th you don't play two in combination and then but all I'm through is go off with one ball right yeah I mean if you can possibly knock those balls free once you make the one ball you see last comic standing and doing no no's are they good I

they play to have the opposite of Memorial besides this one I'm very cool what this is your shot you came into one ball bitch just like it's my job yes yeah made eight ball go by your fuck still good luck kid you'll make drunk people I've talked to her convinced they're gonna pool it's quite fascinating ready reverse jump I'm totally ready one ball inside pocket okay so I'm going anywhere near the sidewalk my chest watch it seems like the universe's this is ever seemed like pools a good person that knows I play Bowl it's all it does it does they believe their shots seriously oh yeah I can do it too if I fall on there then we can ask you a question sorry did you go for the fog ball that way as opposed to this way because it would be due to Photoshop I have two shots I five months I was possible or five all here the problem playing the size would have hit it lighter yeah but I didn't come back properly because I have a bad angle I honestly if I did want to come back I would want to have an angle just about two inches that way so that I could stay on this side of the ball because that's how it scares me right there no it's not scary but the side pocket I couldn't I know well I'm not going to play now I'm playing because of the angle I'm planning to come down here and then shoot this ball in a side pocket because the angles not good the pool when you play a certain level it's all about maintaining the correct angle to go from one ball to the other ideally I would have liked to stop anywhere around right here so funny I would have stopped I wouldn't try to stop here yeah cuz I want that shot as opposed to the next well that's good too but I wanted to once I make the ball I want to wind up right right here and where it's out right now it's very hard to do that because where it's on right now the natural angle of shooting the ball in its going to make the ball go this way so now I have to adjust to that and I have to make the ball go this way and then out here so I have to hit it and I hit updated with low right hand English so that when it hits the table and hits the rail bounces off and gets good the other thing that I noticed is whenever I pray I bring with Tom English you do that but I've only broken that way I've never broken you broke you broke using the bottom it doesn't matter if you can stop the ball I like to use bottom but some people like these tops of plows to balls when you hear someone say they're good at pool you're like oh but how good are you I just hope I don't get left with an easy shot and I can't make that right that's one of those things where I find that like we're talking about like archery a little play yeah that's one shot did what people do archery you got a cat you do a bunch oh no I'm good I'm gonna get out of here buddy good funny man liver disease this whole other side of my body why did you know where your liver
