herbs and they move shit around and put things in weird places and when you read the translation like what thought fuck does this mean well they're figuring out how to translate it not just both word-for-word but figuring out how you would say that same sentence in English structure as well yeah so it's clear what what you know what you're translating it's fucking fascinating shit man it's fascinating and I also wonder after you know 50 or so years of everybody using English on the internet how many kids are gonna grow up just as English as their you know their new language and their original languages like the old-fashioned thing their parents did could you imagine if there was only one language could you imagine how much it would get done what can you say you know what's interesting though when you say that like imagine languages are gonna go away by technology very very very fast though languages Wow so what's gonna happen I think translate on what I know like you to sit there and have something translated to you in in real time you know it's gonna be boys detection and everything like that it's gonna make the study languages though people are still gonna want traditionalist so we'll still be they're playing with their old thing but what if a few generations go by right I think things are gonna change I found well you're a proponent of the isolation tank you actually have John Lily's tank don't you I actually my only other friend that ever had one that's that's like having Willie Mays fucking baseball bat you know it's cool I got his shower shoes to go with it oh I actually get out and walk in his shoes every time I go from I imagine when they figure out how to stimulate the mind to create certain states and they do it in conjunction with the tank which is really the way to do it because it eliminates all the sensory input from this world if they could figure out how to do that put some electrodes on your head and set you in that fucking tank and light you up like a Christmas tree and you just go into some other world then maybe people will stop talking I think dr. lily did that to me with 1cc ketamine injected you know yeah you told me about that yeah what a rush yeah what did he do exactly well when I got there actually they I was gonna go into the tank just you know straight and when I got a rinse off and everything before you go into town and the guy was prepping me he says you know usually when we do it we we go in with one cc injected in a muscularly you know ketamine you know would you like some and I hear part of my brain go no no drugs thanks and then I hear my mouth go oh absolutely I'd love some and and then I I felt like a complete third person in my own reality because he said no problem you know it's injected into muscularly is that a problem in my side of my brain with needles no my mouth however went no problem that'd be great when I found them yeah any and you know what and he walked away to go get me the stuff and I stood there for a minute and my brain was saying no way and and my other side of my brain went look you're a doctor Lily's house man you've come all this way there's no way you're saying no and he walked back in and I felt a little alcohol swab on my muscle and I heard my brain go no and then I heard my mouth go thank you very much and and then I I made the most naive sorry sorry I said how long does it take to kick in and I will never forget his face when he went oh you haven't done it before oh you should lay down about 45 seconds uh-huh and he like put me in the tank and when you do it what if you do something like that I have sleep apnea do you run the risk of like choking and not and not breathing I don't know I didn't have slept sleep apnea but the last thing I was thinking about was sleeping when he slipped me into that tank I thought I was there to watch the entire world come to an end and I had like a ringside seat it was pretty interesting so they shot you up with this ketamine you lie down the tank yeah you get into the tank and you float and for me it was the first experience ever float and then when they tackle first you first experience floating was with ketamine you know how do you say no to dr. lily you know I had watched the movie altered states dozens of times I'd own the laserdisc that's how so what happened what happened after you have to get cured 45 seconds in III thought I was freaking out and the funnier side of this was my good friend was in the in the other room and I was background panic noise while all this was going on and he didn't know about the ketamine entering into the equation and he was sitting there with dr. lily and his assistant at the time Craig and they had no concern of me like sounding like I'm drowning and finally he asked you know did is he on ketamine and and Crick said yes and he said would you go get me some and my friend was totally blown away didn't think that was gonna be the answer to the other to the problem and John put some ketamine into his leg and told my friend have a nice night and he went into his bedroom and my friend could see into the bedroom where the tank was next to a bed and he didn't touch the tank he just went in and laid down next to the bed and I actually stopped screaming at that point and my friend was looking in the bedroom he was screaming I was freaking out man so you're in the tank you panicked you start screaming John Lilly says I'll send me some of what he's having yeah and honestly for me I felt like uh well when I stopped screaming I remembered it was conscious I I mean it felt like somebody came into my trip and just said you know take a deep breath calm down and and I was like okay and and you know what I just channeled the energy and and it actually positive experience on Lilly joined you in your trip what if he'd joined you in that so I did it me and my girlfriend you know what in a sense yes I feel like he did I felt like there was a telepathic communication as much as this is gonna blow all of the credibility I just had about talking about yeah I actually felt like dr. lily and I communicated on a level that was more telepathic during the time I was under the drug do you think like the tank even true story don't want to believe it even work though if he took the same amount of pills and just laid him or something the tank that no I don't think a pill or I wouldn't think that your here's some the tanks huge right you know huge here's how I McKenna described ketamine he said that it was like you he believed that when you did psychedelics you somehow or another connected to the experience that everybody had had doing those psychedelics before you that's one of the reasons why the mushroom experience is so rich and diverse it says thousands and thousands and millions of people over the years have done mushrooms and you're connected to this one big gigantic growing experience he said doing ketamine he said ketamine is so much more rare that really it gave him the feeling like he was in an abandoned a warehouse or an office building with no furniture in it that's interesting yeah he said well very alone in my trip initially and then when I felt like there was another energy around me I it did feel different and it was weird I had a long conversation that was John Louie after and he really he was I I really like the old guy he was really a nice guy and then afterwards when I left whatever the next day is his assistant said you made a real impression on John he'd like you to have his tank just gave it to you yeah that's crazy you probably felt bad he probably did want you to sue him for fucking whacking him with ketamine and thrown her into a fucking bathtub he's like this dude might sue me I'm gonna work this I'm gonna work this I'm on the stroke it I'm gonna call mom say yo man you you are the shit and I want to give you my dick oh I you know Oliver Stone went tonight before me in his tank yeah yeah and yeah we both did it yeah we got to talk about it years later him and I sat down and chatted about our weekend at John's Wow what a fucking freaky dude well out with hair with Special K and throw him into a fucking tank of water dude oh this is the guy that the day of the dolphin was made about he's the guy that did all of the research books he's a bad motherfucker he was awesome he's got a great book where he actually shows he's got the deep self has directions and how to make it tank shows you how to make well that precursor the cenomar attack I got isn't it sad Mario's Samadhi Samadhi Samadhi yeah that's what I had to I had one of those as well now I got a float lab one the new crazy not yet fucking it's the craziest thing I think they're awesome you know and I think a lot of people have never really been able to meditate within themselves and when you get in this tank and there's no resistance on your body and you can actually you don't really hear and you don't really see and you feel the same temperature as the surroundings around you you really feel so boundless and it's truly flying through space man you flying ship it is a spaceship man that down Aires is a fucking portal to another world it really is it really is when are you learning how to relax once you learn how to relax and it takes a few times you have to do it a bunch of times and depending on your personality how good you are truly letting go but if you really learn how to let go man you go on trips in that time I used to I used to set an alarm at like 4 a.m. if I went to sleep before midnight and I just like walk cuz I had mine in my bedroom I'd walked right to my tank get back in it and like go back to sleep and like 4 or 5 6 o'clock I would always wake up before 7:00 feeling like man I just slept for so long and I felt great and my dreams would be so lucid so incredibly real and tangible and a holy shit I want to go write them down loose that's intense so you only walk a couple steps yeah barely woke up I barely went right back right back out yeah that's you've got it it's awesome mine's too far from my fucking bed in the walking I'd wake up going what the fuck you doing with your life Robyn okay number four o'clock in morning fucking work they go metatag and then I'll go on the internet check my Twitter and on the way yeah UFOs congress's you what's going on here I'll be an hour later I'm gonna get some breakfast but I'm fucking hungry away except in coffee did you see that shit that was on CNN but these all these former US Air Force employees are coming out about UFOs around nuclear-armed nuclear facilities that's fuckin trippy shit man I wonder if these guys are all just nuts I wonder if these guys are all coops or if they're like disinformation guys that work for the government and the government wants us to think there's fuckin really UFOs they can just just distract it's not a people and I can yeah and meanwhile Obama's passing on this legislation making it easier for people to wiretap your emails and get into your fucking Twitter account your Facebook pages and they're they're passing all this legislation right under everybody's nose I wonder if that's what it is I wonder if it's just a distraction tactic I truly believe it is I mean they appointed the UN appointed some chick to be the ambassador when the aliens come listen bitch you don't speak for me that real okay yes the UN just a point sit around and wait she is a I believe she's an astrophysicist and her job is to communicate with the aliens you don't talk for me hooker can I just say something I got a dog we have been on this planet evolving with dogs for thousands of years and we don't speak Doberman we don't speak German Shepard and how do we think that they're gonna show up and suddenly we're gonna be like sit right good alien well the idea anyone a snack is there gonna be so much more knowledge they're gonna be under able to understand what our language is they'll be able to decipher our language that's the the hope and the dream I think they're gonna show up and think food man you look soft and juicy you love these people if you look at what she does we'd be like cows you know if you look at with every single intelligent life form on this planet does they're gonna make sure that they exploit everything weaker than that that's what they're not the ethic of space it seems like it's the ethic of life on this on this planet is that survival of the fittest it's in when you're the fittest you get to fuck the ones that are not as fit that's just the way it is what human beings do to dolphins and sea world and what we do to killer whales we know the killer whales rescue human beings that fall off boats we know that there's never been a case in the wild of a killer whale a documented case killing a human the only times I've ever done other than see well that's the only times I've ever done it is in captivity and we know what dolphins do dolphins kill baby dolphin so they can force the female dolphin the fuck Dolphins are ruthless is that true yes fuck yeah that's true yeah they kill the baby held the baby how do they kill them that's what they kill them their face oh they kill them yeah that's one of the reasons yeah the dolphins rape the fuck out of each other too and one of the reasons why female dolphins are whores female dolphins are super slutty and the reason being is because they have to fuck as many male dolphins as possible so that when they have babies those male dolphins won't kill the babies so the male dolphin will go I could be - that might be mine damn they like her because they get the fucker wait so this is all from dr. mentorship and so the the the idea being that the mother does not breed while she's with the Navy so it takes like six years or something like that before she's going to breed again Oh before she breeds before she breeds again could just take care of the baby how long does dolphin live it's good question I don't know I don't know but you need to know a lot about their sex life dolphins a freaky freak sorry about fucking one of those Wow pretty if it only had a sheep's pussy but it was a dolphin put those two together yeah if you get pocket and it could drag you through the water the same yeah take you on trips you can better be able to hold your breath I need to design some new dolphin you can fuck that's right or maybe you could just climb on the back of a dolphin and just get a flashlight attached to the dolphin already feels good there's videos on the internet people fucking dolphins have you seen this now no possible huh their penis comes out and though the woman boots underneath I don't remember if you make in the show no I'm not now there's videos kind of videos of people fucking dogs every time actual sex Brian yes oh I need I need some clarification show you okay we need to we need to go deep on this one sorry we can't just leave people out there thinking that there's not many people are right now gone this is bullshit I will look myself Oh a lot of people that's a beautiful thing about the internet now instantly you can find out you can google and at least get the general consensus I mean you can't find out who killed Kennedy there's some shit you can't find out but you can google yes on 19 yeah help us win in California yeah products already short days away prop yeah it's yes on 19 com 34 days away and what are the most recent polls recent polls show us when and depends on whose poll you

what's his name Eddie Long so his name the new Big O angry preacher yeah what is this name dude that's double bad because you know brothers ain't supposed to be even thinking like yeah brothers do not get no oh man that's the proposition 8 passed in California a lot of gay people was really pissed off at black folks well black folks voted some ridiculous number hey Dennis percentage book should be mad at their Christian siblings who brought Christianity to all these poor people you know cuz that's really the problem okay well you're going fake moral a little bit far with your blame there fella whoa what is this guy's name Ed long due to be ed long that's like a spoon oh you're right due to this soft the size of the Dolphins dick it the best way you can I have sex with a male dolphin is to masturbate him Brian female yes it's true you couldn't write this fiction really couldn't man it's like you remember when that um there was a you know there's the best part homies got a pink tie oh

position of power that it turns out was actually banging boys shocking what if what if what if like the Catholic Church has been run by gays who are angry at the straight people this whole time right and they get to wear their dresses and have their fabulous cars and their drink out of their gold chalices and be covered in all these colors and live in total secrecy and then pick out the little gay kids right out of the straight audience all is that dating hate Madonna well what do you mean without the church's hate Madonna you know therefore your analysis does not hold ancient gay cult yeah Pope wearing a dress yeah of course okay what's up with that crazy fish head all of them at the Vatican and let me think I don't want to fuck women I want to have a live with men for the rest of my life pretty much again and you're not even lobster bait why not just Oh nocturnal emissions well you can't even dream about getting off well how about saltpeter that shit they give them to keep them from getting horny that's not true it's not real - nerd myth pretty much it's an urban myth but they still think actually the epitome is always hope eating food really I don't know whatever I can't say yeah I dream in my girlfriends and wake up feeling of failure drowsy well I don't think they really saw Peter in jail that's one of those urban legend type things but urban legend the whole idea is ridiculous the whole idea that anybody would ask you to not have sex like why would God give me a dick if I didn't want to use it God don't procreate go yeah God doesn't not only just want not want you to procreate doesn't want you to feel affection doesn't want you to love something I love how people that talk about you know there's no evolution there's just creationism they don't want to talk about in sexual relations between Adam and Eve and all their kids yeah what's with fuck that come from God show begin with a new boat hey I got new fresh fucking like crazy well that would be what it had to be wouldn't it if you go with the Christians and then they did all this in 6,000 years what's up you're my brother yeah that's that's my Christian brother don't eat that Apple which is bad no and you know that Union that was the first prohibition the prohibition of thou shalt not eat from the tree of knowledge and and who was the big cop right god they're right and how many people - two people he had the police and God according to Christian mythology couldn't handle prohibition yeah that God would make some shit that he didn't want you to eat I tell you don't eat it I'm telling you I will fuck your world up oh oh oh you ate that Apple that I told you not to eat well guess what you don't ever get a second chance you're fucked forever your whole species is fucked Joe do you ever wonder if that's do you wonder if that snake that one snake the original snake ever made it if he made it on Noah's Ark do you ever think about that like no what if that snake was the devil I know I was just like I was hoping that snake made it maybe that snake is all around us all the time yeah buddy the whole idea that you know they'll make fun of fucking Muslims or they don't make fun of Scientologists they don't make fun of you know like well they're they've got the wrong thing you either come to Jesus let's see I argue that everybody's an atheist because a Jew doesn't believe in a Christian God and a Christian God doesn't believe in Buddha and a Buddha doesn't believe in a Jewish God and none of them believe in Muhammad so it's really they're all atheists cuz they don't believe in anything but their little fantasy truthfully so they're all atheists to somebody else's shit to somebody else's shit they don't believe in their other God so BAM suddenly we're in alignment I just don't also believe with any of their gods it's amazing that there are so many different religions hundreds literally we were neat we were lost we needed direction we right someone woke up I know where the food is I know where you'll be warm I know how to heal you sick when you die and come with me right it's amazing that there's so many different religions but even though we know that they all say different shit everyone is willing to die believing that the one they believe is right even though there's so many examples of contradicting ideas for whatever fucking reason we compartmentalize that when we you know go down the road of being a Mormon or go down the road of being a Catholic or a Baptist we just we don't look at it just don't you say this is my team and screw your team and it's a very NFL mentality you know rah-rah my team boo your team it's all the same shit it is all the same shit when Anna I was in the Indiana for UFC anybody who fought somebody from Indiana even if they were American they would boo them Indiana local boys Hoosiers but think about Indiana is great don't get me wrong but idea the mentality is so fucked up that your your booing against other Americans because they're not from a similar place they're not within a certain distance of where you sleep so you're there you don't even like them right now who's going up against our guy like we need we don't just have Americans versus the rest of the world we'll go down to neighborhoods well Brett we'll break it down two neighborhoods will break down the Hatfields in the McCoys you know the problem with Indiana is there's nothing else to fucking do there and they're not known for much in Indiana and so that movie Hoosiers came out everyone was like Sports is now our big thing so now it's like seriously because Sports is a big thing right but they're so proud of that movie that because that's all they have living in a d7 thing called the Indianapolis 500 that was farming back to the Midwest is what we got to do we got a really far man bring it back to wheat bread made by him we need him man well I know look far made right now is in its 25th year and the problem with it is 25 years and they've gotten where because all these people they're trying to convince they've built their there their farms on corn and cotton are completely wrong and they're not gonna have any economic independence back until they get their hands on John Cougar Mellencamp came on to the screen and they booed him really he's a liberal oh fucking crazy they showed him I expected everybody to go apeshit you know in Ohio the farms are getting so bad that they're like closing farms left and right that a lot of the farms are turning into shopping centers where my mom lived just in five years used to be farms everywhere and now it's like commercial buildings and just they're losing all these farms because there's no money in it or something's not going on right right in the farming industry in Ohio well there's there's it's very difficult to run a farm and make a profit it's incredibly difficult it's so fucking hard especially when you're up against unfair trade practices and fucking fuels that come from 9,000 miles away how about seeds you know you don't even own your seeds when you're a farmer when you get a big deal and you know a hemp is the one thing that we need to really push that we don't have GML control of we have to stand up and ask for you know our civil rights back we have to demand them and back in fact I mean when we explain the seeds thing though what I was saying is when you buy seeds if you're a farmer you buy these seeds that have been made by this company months they don't yeah you don't own those seeds you go you got those seeds and when you plant your new plants and you grow like say if you grow peppers you can't take the seeds out of those peppers and grow more peppers because you don't own that right you don't own that right they will sue you and copyright it's incredible Monsanto has actually people that go around and test crops of people that they suspect are using a generation away from their last seed and it's really scary I mean and you know crazies that take the seeds and like make new new versions of that seed you can't no race of it oh is that eclis modified so they know what the genome of this particular print plant that they've created is right so if you have that shit in your field you have to pay them every year every year I have to pay for new seeds you can't though the way people always did it you grew tomatoes you took the seeds from the tomatoes your groomer Oh tomatoes they can't you can't do that now it's illegal but that is the nuttiest shit ever and that's the number one reason for genetically modifying food is to control the market and that's the number one reason also why marijuana will always remain illegal to a lot of people or they'll want to keep it illegal rather is because now can't control it now you know hemp is grown in every industrialized country other than a matter amazing how crazy is that Canada right up north right above us right there growing it they grow all of the seed products that are in Whole Foods and all that nutrition so all this is money that farmers could be making all this stealing from them these cunts yep the government is stealing from us feeling it by denying them the most cultured fucking best country it's got Indiana Proposition 9 takes over 1919 proposition 19 I was thinking gay it's wrong the when they when that shit goes into effect if and when it's gonna change the culture it's gonna that's it is the big change it's gonna be in people's behavior cuz you can talk all the paper you want but what what the most fascinating thing to me is what it does to people socially it changes the fuck out of human being right well you know some of the things that people are coming out against prop 1919 is saying is that it's going to lend itself to corporations and it's not true corporations are saying that who saying that well believe it or not we have a lot of people that are in the medical marijuana industry that don't want to see prop 19 pass because they're comfortable right now and they're profiteering and they don't want to see you know a status quo change and it's really sad because these are the people that have benefit the most when their local communities allow them to start selling to anybody over 21 without doctors no right but the doctors who've been making their living for all these years giving away prescriptions and charge 150 bucks a pop that's that source of income these guys have that's operatives were historically wealthy and they'll do fine actually practicing medicine I'm sure maybe but when you're set up for years and years and years just giving out medical marijuana prescriptions and you're comfortable with it and all sudden something's gonna come along to make your business go away and you're gonna have to come up with some whole new business well if you're a selfish douchebag I could see where you'd be like man I don't want isn't isn't that why the alcohol beverage industry is giving to the campaign against us you know isn't that why all these interested self-interested companies we don't expect it out of the medical marijuana dock another lie heard was that big tobacco money's behind this when it's such bullshit proposition 19 yes when you can look up and see where all the money goes forever it realistically though prop 19 was passed by somebody that as somebody I've known for over 15 years he's a really good person that really just wanted to do the right thing he wanted to put forward a more liberal print initiative but he had cash and he pulled the initiative and he found that more liberal initiatives were not polling well enough to actually pass so he actually pulled back pull back pull back on the verbage until he got an initiative that polled well enough to pass and what a lot of people don't realize is that this is not the means to the end this is just or this is a means to the end it's not the end it's just one small step in the evolution of getting our freedoms back and this prop 19 is going to be one step closer to having our rights back and what a lot of people are talking about which is pissing me off is that we got Meg Whitman buying her way into the governorship and we have Steve Cooley who has been the guy down here in LA for those of you who don't live in LA who has been closing down all the Los Angeles Bart clubs and if this guy gets the top cop position in the state of California and prop 19 loses all of these idiots and I'll say you are idiots that are going against prop 19 that are selling medical marijuana are gonna lose your businesses and lose your freedoms and the only thing that's gonna protect you right now is if everybody in the state gets the rights that you have been getting for the last 14 years since medical marijuana yeah let's concentrate on that cop what's the option yeah Steve Cooley is the guy that's running for attorney general and he's basically running as somebody that's against the death penalty and in California you might as well be running against somebody unopposed he's running against someone who's against the death penalty yes oh so he's running unopposed in that sense he is absolutely and when he gets in his agenda is to do in the state when he's already done in LA well why is he want to shut down medical pot stores ideologically out who knows who knows what he's invested in who knows what his realities from its whoever's out of his life you know who knows who really he's loyal to in that sense you know but there's something there's some campaign contributions or something there's something going on I would love to be able to follow the money forensic Lee and see exactly where people because in some ways there's got to be strength pulling them you know and it's not cheap to run a campaign in the state of California you need to get on the side to people a lot of money that's where they don't have a flush with money that much he is very very rich and what is she what was her position in eBay she had something to do with eBay she I thought I found it not founded she was the one that was brought in and like brought them from being a very small company to a very large company she helped organize them and she rode their growth curve okay so she made a ton of money off eBay and now she wants to be the governor and she's spending how much money to do this he's already spent over a hundred million dollars of her own money to become governor one hundred million dollars for a job that pays one two hundred thousand a year google it people how much is a pay its pays nothing and this is a scary app or it's like what do you think she's gonna accomplish with this 100 million dollar influence what is she doing this for its test amount - there you go you know it's building a big you know why do it - and you know this is you sure my volume - no this is the part that kind of bothers me is that this is more of what we've had for a long time it's just now we're looking at it and we're grossed out by it but don't think before newspapers in Internet carried the word that robber barons weren't running politics going back to the 30s and 40s and 50s and when I say they I don't mean to sound like some conspiracy nut I mean to sound like somebody that's realistic about the fact that alcohol got together after prohibition and went yo who's our competition all these kids are smoking this locoweed out us and then look at it this way okay there's a okay this meg whitman woman she is obviously very wealthy so it's gonna be very difficult to buy a person who's very wealthy and she's very wealthy so why would this very wealthy person want to stop medical marijuana in California because that is what she wants to do what would be her motivation because it would not be financial right she doesn't need the money she's spending a hundred million dollars can I tell the governor you don't think that alcohol companies for sure not giving her a hundred million dollars killing you have that much money Joe it isn't sittin in a locker at the edgy a bed it's sitting in investments and I'd love to know what our portfolios WestEd and because she has people that are actually standing there saying this is what I'll advise you to do and anybody that's advising somebody that has literally hundreds of millions of dollars vested way is gonna say listen this initiative is bad for your liquor investments it's bad for your pharmaceutical investments it's bad for you so you think it's morally a financial decision on her I think a lot of why we're dealing with prohibition and why we're dealing with people that are against it is because of the financial is they having the more wealthy they are the more people lean against them how for you in a sense do we have of you because here you are a guy that is made it in TV five years of news radio five plus years on fear factor you have a career you will have advisers around you saying listen Joe if you do stupid stuff it's gonna not get you the gig jobs it'll pay a lot of money and then I'm not gonna make money so where those persons gonna advise you to go be the activist that you've become are they gonna say bro really because I know that a lot of other actors have to stop and think man I won't get hired if I start getting all radical and that's what they really believe so they toe the line you are so rare cuz you haven't told the line you said fuck it I'd rather be happy and be myself and be some slave to a corporate you know dictation yeah well you don't have to do it that way those guys are pussies a lot of them are a nice person but how few Woody Harrelson's and Joe Rogan's do we have speaking up for the right reasons um well you know what a lot of people have families and they want to play it safe and they feel conservative and they get paranoid and they they don't trust in the greater good of humanity and the people's ability to see what they're saying they don't they don't have faith in their ability to express themselves so that people understand the point of view that they have and where they're coming from right I have confidence my ability to express myself and you do it for us all by the way that's important for everybody I think everybody should and would do it if you're if you're a rational thinking person why would you live your life pretending to be something other than who you are you know why would you not want people to know about something that's radically changed the way you look at the world why would you not want to well because fucking meg whitman says it's bad look at that bitch get the fuck out did she quit or get fired from eBay I don't know cause she's a woman who wants to be in control of things that's always freaky probably 75% of eBay's audience stone people in the middle of night buying shit she should know her audience I don't know she probably pulled a Sarah Palin when I got fired you know she's whacked away for more lucrative that's crazy man women they want to run should creep me down no I know it sounds gross sound wise because we're Clinton he doesn't she doesn't creep you out she is the creeps me the fuck out right but how to Lisa rice have Condoleezza Rice is running things don't you think he'd freak the fuck out creepy but there's a lot of Dick Cheney right there creepy - I'm not saying I want guys running shit but at least they've been doing that forever my other chick wants to hop in there and compete with the man I'm like what are you crazy bitch what are you doing you're not balanced you know no fucking yogi you're not gonna see through the maze you're you're fucking just as crazy as the men if not crazier because you have to because you're a woman and because they're gonna prove that they're tougher than the men there's me I there was a moment where Hillary Clinton was running for president where I was thinking you know what she's gonna win at what if she wins and she gets a new position where one of these crazy fucks from another country tests her because she's a woman I mean if zooming that political power is real and then the president really has any say that anybody in another country really does pay attention to him that it's not all this big gigantic Bilderberger meeting group assuming that a president is real could you imagine what Putin would do if he sat across from fucking Hillary Clinton or sour Palin at a it's some sort of negotiations horrible he would crush them isn't a crime a mock dumb he would disi would well be with most cultures put their most intellectually capable people in power and not there uh you know best idiots like well I mean it's just it's not that it's not that men should be running shit right it's not because I think I was capable the idea of the Alpha the one the idea of having a leader is fucking ridiculous I think it's some archaic shit that we have to figure a new way around so I'm not saying that men should be running shit anybody who's a woman that wants a run shit like that's kind of crazy like you don't even have a dick why are you trying to control everything what are you doing why are you trying to fucking grab the reins I know what are you do it I don't want to be President okay I'm not I don't want to be a leader I'm don't get me wrong I'm not saying that I am better than a woman who would be doing the job I'm saying when I see a woman who wants to be a leader I understand the man wanting to be a leader it makes sense to me even if I don't believe in it or agree with it I understand it when I see a woman that's what I'm doing I'm like look at that crazy bitch that's what I think I think you want to be the king of the world and you're a chick whoa you know there's but yet Iceland's not in Wars and they had a female leaders around the world I'm like there's a lot a lot of between bestow don't get me wrong but I don't think anybody should be a leader I think the whole idea I like that based on size it's based on some leftover fucking shit from back when we were a tribe of 200 monkey people and we needed a leader to protect us from the other monkey people wanted to rape our women and take our food I mean that's what it is the idea that one person could represent the whole country like a president I don't give a fuck if he has a cabinet I don't get the idea that there's a one guy that stands there and gentlemen the President of the United States you know even the voice even the figurehead even descended of royalty at shirt it's an avatar ideas ridiculous it's it's it's sober they created our whole structure in America to compete against what they were what they were fighting and then they became that and war and they became way worse right I love that I'm gonna hear so much shit from my female friends well thank you I think women should be running things Oh what does that mean man do it better maybe maybe men have been doing it wrong for so long maybe be good for a woman to give it a try you're definitely comfortable in your relationship meaning my guy women should be presidents you know right now I'm lucky what was his name to be president what are you talking about he's saying he's afraid to get his dick cut off when he goes home and he's obviously saying you're not no but what he's saying is you've misread well he's trying to pretend to be some of the women that take that are cunning the females I'm not bashing the male race that doesn't want to be President you know most of the male race doesn't want to be President you don't want to be President it's not a male thing it's a leader thing but what I'm saying is I understand the creepy fuck control freak men I understand that instinct but when I see a chick that wants to rock that right I know what's going on there Sarah Palin I guess one way Sarah Palin's just says dummy that got stuck into a nice position and she's trying to make some money I mean that's really right it is but after a while it's not bad anymore after a while it's like well you're the figurehead for the retard movement and you're just like them and you got a microphone on you spotlight on you and oh now you're a fucking problem because you never were supposed to get to this point and sign out you've artificially been inserted into the public consciousness with no merit and now all the retards go they rise up and start these fucking Tea Party rallies have you watched any of that shit they're crazy god damn thing Glenn Beck is just making gold underwear and gold socks and diamond covered fucking cars Nick I must be just scraping it in with rakes he's so obviously full of shit too it's like his game only works on the dumb it all but there's so many dumb people it's a very effective tactic him and her together man they scare the fuck out double dumb dumb Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin if they combine forces way to go Marty mr. president do they could they could run for president man that's real shit I hope the first presidents a black lady with a lisp that's totally a lesbian I hope it's like every single horrible thing that's wrong with it you know like you know banning gay marriage you know women presence I hope it's all combined into one like super president that just pisses off everybody I hope it's an alien an alien I hope it a lien wins in disguise of a human being and then tells everybody now that we'd like to now that I'm in place and I'm running shit bitches need to sit the fuck down we've been thinking about exterminating you fucks for about 50 years now I thought was really accurate well there's a giant life-form it's a giant life-form on a superorganism that's what the human race is the human race is on earth earth is a life-form it is a superorganism you know we don't think of planets that support life as a life-form but because it's an environment where life grows but I'm not so sure about that if you look at lava and the center and the magnetic core and you look at the the magneto sphere in the atmosphere and like this is like it's not just a place where life is it's almost like a system it's alive images yeah I don't know what's conscious man we're guessing and we assume that conscious means that it can talk like us and move like us but we don't know we don't there's a lot of evidence that there might be something going on inside trees some sort of fucking a reaction to trees and plants have to people well think of cellular intelligence you know and that's really where we've always thought oh it's in our brain and then there's this myth that we don't even use your own brain all of our brain and it's like really do you know how many of us are you stupid that you believe that your whole body's not actually shooting at all all marks right now and I think that our capability of intelligence is really really deep well that's that's a metaphor I think for wasted potential if people have this idea you know that we're only using 10% of our brains if we just really concentrate like that no one even knows what that means what does that mean you're only using 10% you bring what's going on with the other 90% useful we know how to know how the brain works when we blow holes in parts of the brain we shoot people and parts their head and I'm gonna go I can't see anymore I guess that's the part where you see out of we drill the hole here he's calm well I guess this is the part that makes them aggressive we'll just drill a hole in that bottom people get a little nutty they go look we would do what do you wanna do you wanna kill him you want to drill a fucking hole in his head and see if we can fix someone Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that went far yeah they would fix people by drilling holes in their head hollaback come back yeah do you know ever there's a whole group of humans that voluntarily put holes in their head and they believe that it alleviates pressure and gives them euphoria and that the pressure of the growing brain trapped inside the skull causes headaches and all sorts of problems and in Africa there's fucking cultures that have done this where they literally they caught the entire skull I posted it on Twitter see if you can find it I mean I don't know what you would look under there's that there's a term for it there's a term for it for stream hockey holes in where they call a shit I'm fucking up here because there's an actual term for it but people do it on purpose it's like it's a it's a see if you can find that but people are great voluntary holes yes TR EPA and ing its effing relieve pressure beneath the surface yeah and there's there's a video of these African dudes where they do it with no anesthesia and they do it with these fucking stone tools they like strip away your fucking scalp and cut out your bone oh you don't just do it once they do it as many as 20 times they don't like yeah and they fuck their brains oh good news sir no way that oh you'd have to wear their hats from I'm sure as their brain is exposed there's a like a canoe shaped cutout on the top of their fucking skull dr. John Clark was the first one to do it in 1664 and he taught the Africans how to do it that's what they're saying u.s. I'm sorry u.s. you American hmm well no she might have might have been just like religion we problem Christianity over to Africa just his first physician to perform it in the US and he did it as a levy ating pressure on someone yeah whoa it's like if you can think about it someone's out there doing it man you've seen those women in Surrey is that where is in Africa where they cut their lip and stick a plate in it have you seen that shit you don't talk you never seen the plates in the locals yeah yeah I didn't know the theory named it's the most insane thing it's not just weird the bigger the plate the more cows they're worth when they get married so like say if you want to marry my daughter okay and she's got a giant ass fucking plate and like bitch that was a 50 Cal plate you gotta come strong son right so dudes would have to give me a herd they have to give up a herd because she's what they carry around his giant plate in her lips what else did she say bang their teeth out too they have to bang their lower teeth out because the plate sits there and mmin air if you have the lower teeth so when the plate starts getting big they have to smash their teeth out yeah you made blowjobs feel like home life does Africa suck people are willing to do that you willing to put plates in your lips and cut holes in your heading where they stress the neck out so effort that's fucking crazy they must be so freaked out they got stuck in Africa they're like look we're gonna make this interesting all right hey we are stuck running from hyenas and getting eaten by crocodiles and shit and we're gonna have to stretch our necks out let's make our next real pack Wow well how about in those heads they found in Peru where they stretch their head out gigantic like a big alien head they they like did it too like a huge percentage of the population they put boards in their heads and tied them down and literally extended their head and you know what people were thinking well is is to emulate something is to emulate the gods all the Anunnaki people like see this is evidence they were doing this to try to emulate maybe not because look at these Africans are cutting the fucking holes in their lip and sticking plates in there the dudes cutting the holes in their heads and letting the air out you know that they're not emulating you know they're just practicing medicine they're fucking nuts bad people are nuts well they're still kind of numbers are controlling everyone he knows freaky the disease I had as a child I found out in the mid 80s they stopped treating aggressively that like more when I was in the 70s I was more victim of fucking chemotherapy and in elective surgeries or not elective surgeries but surgeries that weren't needed and radiation then I was of the actual disease because they were practicing that yeah you know it's fucked up too is the X and histiocytosis X meant that the ethology of the disease was unknown and when I first asked an adult you know where did my disease come from and they went we don't know and I was like who's we you and me or like we like so would mean actly is the disease history of like an overactive immune system it's histiocytosis X and it's an overactive insertion disease right like I would have too many white blood cells and they would like in a sense accumulate if you will and usually it was in like bone marrow in areas like that and it creates like blowout so like my spine it blew out my arm it blew out my hip it blew out would it get better if you got sick what do you mean sick got a cold now right no no no think no it all the time but it's funny is I don't really ever get sick either I either I have problems where like obviously it was over growing you know in marrows and stuff or I'm always healthy I went through prison five years I didn't get a cold whoa yeah and that's a crazy place let me tell you but start looking till whether it's how yeah I don't like touching doors and shit though I'm not a germaphobe but I actually I'm careful people are gross yeah people are nose-picking ball scratch and ass fucking wiping just disgusting fucking which is why I always recommend you using fish you from the bathroom when you open the door to any public record take mine open not if you got to pull it usually you do actually uses a piece there's ways you can protect yourself and if we had hemp we could be using hemp towel man you just have to clean it man why we have to vote YES on 19 the vote YES on 19 is very important and if you're one of those people out there that goes man pot heads are fucking annoying unfortunately there's a lot of pot heads are annoying you know most pot heads lots like most people yeah like most people a good percentage of people are annoying and the reason being is because we do not have a direction book on how to properly live a healthy life a healthy fun satisfying life you know we live our lives based on myths and bullshit TV shows and movies and we have this distorted perception of what this fucking world is all about so most people with this especially with the situation we have now the way our world is set up it's so easy for a moron just drift through and be taken care of every step of the way and yet have opinions and yet be able to vote George Bush jr. well Sarah Palin man that's way scarier than her than him Gary Cole nice he was a man Wow that's right I said it Gary fuck well call me Gary Cohen who could vote yeah angry is fuck I'd been angry too after his whole bad life yeah the saddest part of his life would not have been when he was in the hospital dead dying and his fucking crazy context wife takes a picture and sells it tonight over him like y'all strapped up with pipes and shit dying in bed and she's right next to him well it's like dead she did that yeah dead fucking rubber face just like didn't have any emotion in her eyes nothing like you up here he is he's dead and this is me next the dead guy that's horrible oh it's gross surprise that shit on like you know she had pretty sure wow I've never seen that did not know she did that yeah that's pretty I'm learning I'm learning well you got it saved even huh I think I should usually I do you know I can't thank you enough for coming out in support of prop 19 man well dude you know I enjoy the marijuana so of course I've got to support prop 19 you know a lot of people have been really confused on what this really does man and you know that's been a big problem for us because I was talking about what I'm saying most people will you look at pothead think you're annoying right really I'm finding him annoying right now because I can't believe all these people I was working around that we thought I was thought was working towards a common goal and now working against it and because a lot of people were against prop 19 that's what you find that a lot of people are against not probably prop 19 not for the right reasons either people financial reasons financial reasons or in some inaccuracy how much most hippies are though every time I every was hanging out with hippies they were trying to make money like making profits there's a lot of non hippies that are just commercially motivated there's a bunch of people that have just got in this industry in the last few years since you know SB @ 420 passed and allowed for clubs they're trying to make money and right now they think oh no you're gonna change this and we like this so please don't change this and that is really what we're up against you're right when it comes from the the enemy within if you will yeah there's a lot of people that aren't hippies they're opportunists they are I know a bunch of people that are in the idealism oh yeah the people that own like dispensaries they're doing a purely for profit some there's a lot of good ones yeah you know Harborside they're all good a lot of it'll provide something that's good marijuana is good but there's a lot of people that you wouldn't expect they're not like old dudes with gray hair and ponytails right they're young dudes look like brave fucking doing squats great well prop 19 is gonna make it so these people aren't having to get away with it it's they're gonna be able to service their neighbors who have a right to have pot and everybody in the state's gonna have a right to grow pot and that's gonna be a big big yeah so all these people that are selling it the shit's gonna go under because no one's gonna need to buy it just grow your own well he's gonna see the prices drop well thankfully you know radically radically and profits are gonna drop and right now you know it's the liquor companies it's the big drug cartels these are the people that might be more than willing to pay exactly what I'm paying right now just keep making it just as good I'll pay just as much always gonna be thousand dollar bottles of wine you know and there's gonna be people that do things with a high quality and grandma could grow better pot than me for instance and you'll want grandma's pot over mine and that's how we all look like Cheetos I wanted to see like Betsey Hiles they just throw enjoins out my window crazy it doesn't it doesn't really lend itself for quality with quantity because when you have large amounts of it you don't have in a sense is is good a quality right role right now in smaller batches now let's just talk about one thing for the non-smoking non marijuana smoking amongst us this is one of the things that really fascinated me the most when I first found out about marijuana when I first when I first when I was a kid I thought marijuana was bad for you it made you stupid all these different things but when I first started smoking weed the thing that fascinated me the most was that there are two completely different strains that have very different effects just not a different string okay let me break it down I say this right now there's a lot of confusion in this before I went to prison a friend of mine you wrote marijuana botany and he later wrote the book hashish been revised oz name's Robert Colonel Clark yeah he's forgotten more about cannabis and I've had an opportunity to learn and while I was in prison these scientists actually looked at the specimens of sativa and indica and sativa and indica were questions so if I walked up to you with seeds Joe it would actually be does this make clothing and paper and all this stuff or is it like India because there's if you look up the word become names indica means of or like India okay so when you go to India all of the cannabis that's grown there is indica because it's in India but when you go there you'll find tropical varieties down by Goa and northern varieties up by the area that's now Pakistan and Hindu Kush that is the entire range of cannabis and it's all indica the history lesson is interesting but II for everyone today who wants pot there's two different effects indica makes you sleepy and it makes you couch weed it makes you what a lot of people think of as a STONER sativa is a totally different experience and it makes you much more introspective and makes you start looking at fucking telescopes and space documentaries let's not strain what should we call it well it's an equatorial variety it's from near the equator cuz let me break this down there's two different effects though correct it is what I want beautiful yes we're not pot smokers to understand when he's deep historical it's not but but think of it like this right in the 60s and 70s all the pot that was coming into America was like Acapulco gold Michoacan Maui Wowi Jim Achan all of these strains were photography equator tropical they made you happy horny well-organized wanting to do things like protest and then the hippies went to Afghanistan they found this short fat leaved plant that they thought was indica and they started mixing it with all these tropical varieties like Maui Wowi and Thai stick and stuff and they shortened the time it takes to flower cannabis and they picked varieties that yielded the most amount of pot because it was the reason being is that the ones that were equatorial the ones that we're growing on the equator needed a longer cycle of Sun because it's right because they're in a 12 12 and those are the ones that have the different psychoactive effect the ones that come in contact more with the Sun are the ones that make you so much more with the Sun it's just the varieties that developed near the equator where there was a longer cycle our more innocent psycho and in a sense we own in America they have to be grown indoors yep and then what happened is the hippies in a sense started breeding this Afghan with all of their tropical varieties and through the 80s we kind of developed this one-hit-wonder pot that took away all that good energy and took away all that and now for me I always smoke haze I like super Silver Haze and I know people don't understand what you're saying haze me and sativa in a sense it does in the sense our terminology of sativa but sativa really means most useful okay but the way okay that's true but what's that's not well how it's used in dispensaries dispensaries indica and sativa is how it's used sativa is the heady more you know trippy space weed and indica is kau high energy this is my whole point in the beginning was I did not know there was two different types of pot I thought pot was pot and then all pot had a similar effect some pot may be stronger than other pot but it's basically all pot you're gonna smoke pot you leave to get really higher well but it's not the same it's not even remotely the same there are two different experiences and almost everyone is used to indicate because Indic is the easiest shit to grow and because the shit that you know you're getting if you're getting it from you know some dudes are coming down from you know there in Canada growing brick weed it grows the fastest and use the modes and now that we're getting through prohibition will see these varieties that take longer and yield less but have a profoundly different effect on our energy and our thinking and arm exactly so how is it wrong what I was saying well it's not City everybody's calling it sativa but sativa really means hemp its indo-european hemp variety right but we've decided we haven't named Western would put everyone universally in the pot community they're looking at two different things indica and sativa that's what they called it right that's as universally in the pot community they're all just the noise you make with your mouth and describe something absolutely we're not gonna call it even okay what's we-well people that's one oh right now we look we call the reality California's not even and couch weed would welcome it will call it names like you know Arrowhead or you know Avion or whatever we're calling that water at the time we don't really go give me a bottle of water when we're sitting in a five-star restaurant we say do you have a view on did you know I say ah bottled water what am i a fucking water connoisseur and now I just want water okay now trip on this the same way right now you walk up to a weed counter it's almost like the same thing because you can't make distinguishes like you do liquor and when you walk up to a bar you know the difference between wine and whiskey and if somebody you are to whiskey and they hand you wine you're gonna be like yo douchebag this isn't what I watched alright but what I go in that store I say hey where's your sativas oh we got jack cleaner we got trainwreck or give me some of that train wreck yeah and that's what we do but technically all drug varieties or indica no there's two types time do you go to indica when you go to India and you get indica and it's from you suck my dick there's two different experiences we're looking this down for people don't know look practical knowledge is very important what all he's saying is all nonsense there's two different experiences there's the couch weed and there's the weed that makes you think about the universe and want to be creative so that's sativa that's what they call it the indica shit is OG Kush you know I'm gonna take a nap and eat Cheetos all day that's a that though oh gee grows very much like a sativa just so you know it's long and leggy and grows tall and it's small buds and right hate to break that a different it's a more potent version of it you want to know what's weird my sip my haze my sativa you're calling it came a cat 23.78 seein my OG cushion to Caillou : came back at 20.6 there was a three point one difference in flames but aren't there a bunch of different things cannabinoids other than THC that make up the high it's not just THC well actually I think that there was a Doctorate by the way we should point the Todd knows a shit where's your book well there was a doctor at it in fact what does he know this lady knows bitch he's got a book how to grow medical marijuana out of your oh I'm right you know I came back it's on delay this is a book how to grow medical marijuana and it's not it's not in print right now right now to get it you go to amazon.com and maybe get a used copy yes probably do that right yeah my next book girl medicine is gonna come out and I'm gonna be talking about strain-specific growing yeah you could write a lot of books on growing wheat it's very complex isn't it it is and there's a lot of differences when people try to say I'll generalizes how you grow pot you can tell they've never grown pot because pot is very different to grow I mean go ahead this is a question I need answered because I do not understand it now there's a female plant and a male plant and you need the female plant is where the the medicine comes from where weed comes from right there so you and amantes in both right but but they become one or the other you have to get the males out explain what happens like how it pollinating elzar sex much like men in an irony you'll find folks that is normal with other plants by the way on some plants are either my dioecious or have both sexes on one plant cannabis actually can be both because it doesn't matter light and sometimes fuse on so well you get a male you got to get it out of there right males actually create their pollen sacks faster than the females actually develop their buds and in hemp for instance the males pollinate and then die off early and the roman catholic church miscategorized the male and female plants even though the female had the seeds and even though the male blew the pollen they didn't like that the male died off early so they called the male the female in the female to male whoa yeah they were heavy they were heavy into their dog muy you know can't can't can't can't rattle their cage that's late cannabis well how do you tell so if you grow it say if you grown a bunch of wheat plants you have to keep an eye on them bitches because if they all they're all males just like the certainly it's like a little too bright it's not all these what they do is they develop these little they develop these little male pollen sacks if you will and what they do is they come off the flower different they come off the plant and they kind of they hang like little ball sacks and they open up and then then the font and the pollen this is a male flower open the pot is carried to the if you've ever seen little red hairs on your pot those are the sex glands and they are what you'll not want to hire at all what the red the red hair doesn't get you higher at all the red hair doesn't have crystals on right you know they just have these like nah it's cool though so you get some weed what you want yeah so pretty well when that male pollen hits those pistols what it does is it causes that to fertilize and the seed grows in that little pod and if she doesn't get fertilized that pod just scoot swells and swells and swells and the resin develops deeper that's why we grow seedless cannabis because it's like tricking the female into like really producing a lot of resins and a lot of you know just she's wait and wait and waiting to be fertilized it never comes so it makes it more potent well you know potency I think is an interesting conversation there was a doctor at the Institute of Medicine who got up one day and he said I gave my patients 10 milligrams and THC and they had a known effect and then I gave him 10 milligrams THC him one milligram CBN and it doubled the effective dose and I shot my hand up and I said hey would that replicate in nature and he said I think it would and when I put my hand down my publisher said what did you two geeks just ask each other and I said basically he told me to breed hemp in with my drug varieties because CBN for instance is a chemical that's mostly found in hemp and as we have bread away from the characteristics of these equatorial varieties that are more hemp like we have actually bred more towards the drug varieties and we've lowered the chemical of cbn down while raising THC up with less of an effective rate so now we have THC levels over 20% that wouldn't that don't hit us as hard as I believe is if we had a little bit of CBN mixed in with it how many different kam annoys are there inside a marijuana plant well there are over 400 chemicals created by the cannabis plant and that's the definition of a cannabinoid and the reality is is that 60 of them known to be therapeutic you should it's okay we'll ignore it yes and and what's gonna happen is that as science understands these elements of it more then they'll be able to better direct what the different chemicals and also terpenes because terpenes are these volatile oils that are on the bud and what happens is there kind of steamed off when it's dried so if anybody's ever picked up a cannabis flower and it had good body and you squished it and had stud moisture and you could smell it was real strong those terpenes were intact and even that as a psychoactive effect it's very much in a synergistic psychoactive effect so it's really inside it's good over drying it bad Joey coz likes to take his weed and put it on the heater I put that shit on the heat no I do I put that shit on the windowsill and let it dry out yeah put on top of the TV but the reality is is because a lot of what he's getting is people that are hurrying to market and they sell pot that's not dry and not cured the best cannabis is actually not just dried but cured and then stored for about three months and then see oil set up and they're the smoothest yes and then there's a window of when those cannabinoids actually keep themselves which is between three months and nine months so afternoon after nine months you weed starts to degrade chemically decompose in a sense yes so old weeds whacked whatever what about if you cook different how about different what if you cook with it we feel like good old chocolate bar an old weed chocolate bar how long does that last if you have an old we chocolate are older than nine months and the dairy product and it would be moldy and you not the kind of those those old fucking Nestle's Quik bars that they made with weed ah you know a lot of why I don't eat cannabis that's provided to me by people is because I don't know the conditions in which it's made and they don't trust their you know the way they handled in and stuff and on yet not just measuring cuz you don't know how strong it's gonna be yeah interestingly enough you know in Holland um like hash bonbons and brownies are considered a hard drug totally verboten yeah you can be 16 and go into a Dutch coffee shop buy hash on your way to high school and you cool and they shan't buy brownies that you told me about first you the first person to tell me about 11 hydroxy that eating we eating weed when you eat weed it goes through your liver and kidneys and it actually turns a chemical process and it turns the psychoactive chemical THC into another chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite and that 11 hydroxy is 2 to 5 times more psychoactive than the canvas actually it's 3 to 5 times was the estimate I saw the University of Mississippi yeah and you don't get th CV I mean 11 hydroxy in your bloodstream when you smoke cannabis it's so it's such a different experience and yeah we're talking about it one night I don't remember what the context of the conversation was but it was probably I ate something that was just too fucking strong and you had to explain it it's it's so many people have had it they're like it's I'm on acid or something that's not it does not feel like pot and you're not used to it because when you smoke pot you're only used to dealing with THC my bloodstream and not to you
