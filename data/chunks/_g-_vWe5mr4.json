the gyro can experience the Ron Paul's of the world you know it's like to get to be a certain age where they're just they don't give a fuck like what are you gonna do you gonna shoot him he's fucking 85 years old whatever he is you know he's his last run for president has done now it's up to his son and his son apparently he's been using cheat sheets what's up with plagiarizing I gave the guy a lot of credit for that wonderful filibuster we did for the Fourth Amendment got the best publicity the Fourth Amendment's gotten in so long and then you go pull that on me make me look like an idiot people don't know what you're talking about apparently he had used some some words from some various speeches we're exactly the same exactly is it possible that he has writers and he doesn't know that's what his father said the newsletters were that got his father in so much trouble but remember rand rile whoever said nice things about also has is one of his main advisors that guy who did the southern avenger you know convey oh yeah the guy one of his advisors was the southern avenger and he wore a mask and had a confederate flag behind him it's like a youtube show or something and then when they said are you gonna fire this guy he goes something like well that's all in this past and you just guys what's up with this why are these people all crazy you talk about freedom in our constitution you're crazy that's adorable yeah maybe it's the southern avenger look at his photo if that guy's on your staff and somebody you could honestly say god i didn't know he was a southern avenger once they tell you don't you fire him five seconds later I think it's probably great thanks for taking my petit shoe of the Fourth Amendment and trashing it with your Southern Avenger guy what is the southern Avenger stance maybe I'm on his team I have never watched the southern event wanna bet clips paint him with a broad blush brush the Confederate flag does that seem so subtly I don't know what could he possibly waiting for he's confusing shit out of me already conservative libertarian independent what he's done he's destroyed conservative independent and libertarian in one tagline he's probably you know working for a group whose design who's trying to discredit all those things I'm surprised it doesn't have a TM at the end of it you know logo it's a better logo that a lot of people have yeah I mean what is he trying to do does this guy still after the wrestler doesn't he does is he still have a show no he works for Rand Paul until they didn't fire him in where's Brian he's supposed to look all that she's just gonna interrupt oh he's even temporary banishment but Rand Paul still has this guy working for I can't I can't comment on that do we know if the southern avenger said anything bad he's to speak at the same conference as Rand Paul hmm after neoconservative alter-ego was revealed hunter left a post on the as the Kentucky senators social media that's the guy that's a southerner Avenger yes I can see the looks I got an Avenger look at that photo over his right shoulder but the left shoulder that's disturbing is that guy no shirt on there's like a bunch of people and one guy has no shirt on that's a gay orgy about the half a southern gay orgy they just said we just have some shaking we're fixing the fuck the guy has no shirt on in a big chest tattoo but what if that chest tattoo is like some fucking conservative you don't know what's on his back statement yeah a big Confederate flag I'm sure the cover of the fucking is how come whenever you get someone who's saying some important things and a half way in a decent way they have to come you know people say to me all the time well we vote all the time too and of course the country's on it is based on voters voting for people how come when we get somebody who would like to change course in a direction most of us would like to see half of them is really fantastic and the other half of them is so crazy you'd never elect a person like that in a million years why can't we have somebody who has some common sense and doesn't sound like two words my friend simulation theory goes back and diversify risk management diversification tool yeah I wonder you know I think he's hedging his bets in case white people take over the world again you know in a very dominant sort of way we'll have the southern Avenger on staff he can advise you ever watch those extreme Preppers shows the Luas shows where dudes or fixing the preparing for the end of the world all the nigger people stockpile and water and creating escape routes and battering rams they're welding to the front opposite of the hoarders because they are the borders that are doing it for a good cause right yeah they believe that it's all gonna come crumbling down and those I think that there's an mentality and the same kind of mentality that is the type of person that wants to get in this rebellious position of power rebellious position of you know railing out against the government really they're very similar to these people that are prepping it's very similar to their extreme folks like those the only people that make it to the front of that crazy line they have to be a bit nutty it's not that the ideas aren't interesting to you or I when you look at a guy like Rand Paul the things that he says that you agree with or his dad the things that he says that you agree with but it's to get there right you've he's facing so much opposition there's so much bullshit along the way so much pressure so much so much back-and-forth debate so much frustration so much suppression of information by the time he gets to a position where the world is listening to him he's already broken he like broke every bone in his fucking soul just to get to the front of the line you know what's funny that people say to me all the time you know can you get a staff together to do what you do so you can do better yeah I want more history shows can we can we help you do this and I always say the same thing I said you can't help me cuz I can't watch y'all and I can't keep track of it that's what all these people do they you know what was it Paul said Ron Paul said well this guy who wrote he was doing my newsletter for me I was in Congress I didn't have time to do newsletter so he did it and he wrote all this stuff and I didn't know what's happening that's my fear is that you're gonna hire a bunch of people and they're gonna turn around go what did you do for me what did you we started the southern Avenger show free which ought to be a good promotional vehicle for your show dan no doubt yeah no doubt I think that there's it's a catch-22 do you do you give away some of your control or do you keep it you know we're you know everything's cool but the minute you give it away you got rogue people you know with your name running around graffitiing the site Banksy and Carlin were here somebody isolated the photograph pull it this is the photograph it's all such a wrestler wrestling yeah these are like old-school southern wrestlers dad I was probably right they probably but fucked each other as soon as this was over this guy's got this in the the he's got it framed on wall in the background of his fucking study so yay southern Avenger yay simulation theory when does it say he parted ways so there so he got rid of him finally yeah I guess the the hue and cry was a little too much for a sitting senator from Kentucky to have somebody named the Southern Avenger on his staff well he was a co-author of the 2011 book with Rand Paul the Tea Party maybe forgot blanked it out but you're right it's it is funny that the these people they have to be yeah we can't have a Fourth Amendment person who's not well I mean I guess you do you got guys like widen and Udall and some of these people but but when you get somebody who's a real lightning rod for this stuff you think finally we've been waiting for a guy like this forever they come with these poison pills that you just can't swallow
