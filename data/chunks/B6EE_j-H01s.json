had a fetish it must have sucked cause you had to feel people out he'd be like dinner and you'd go hey I'm gonna go to bathroom but or I could just piss on your face I'm just kidding I'm just kidding here that's so true so true it's so funny man I'm like you know the story about the the documentary Zoo it was based on those guys I gathered I did go and have sex with animals their zoo files it didn't know this wait I buy a zoo no no no it was just called zoo and it was about zoophilia if that's the correct way of pronouncing it it's pure were attracted to animals and they would go and they were they in Washington State it was legal real hot shit up until this movie until this documentary came out this guy died he had fucked to death by a horse oh my and then they did break yeah I've told you about this I know I got a guy the guy they brought him to the hospital he had bled out and then the the people that brought him in all got arrested and they said what the fuck's going on and somebody cracked and then they took him back to the barn you can't crack in that situation how did it go I don't know man he was he was trying to jump over this fence post or some yak whines you can't tell the truth you go to jail for fucking a horse that's a that's weird but you bring a dude to the hospital and his assholes bleeding and there's some kind of sperm all over the place didn't clean his ass I'm sure you know once that thing blasted the chicken hole the whole thing is just so crazy that there was hundreds of hours of footage of this stuff and they found each other on the internet you know what they find with a lot of people like that they have an inability to feel as deeply as a lot of other people so they do these days yet they have to go extreme that's what happened it's a term for like like like a banality like they have a sort of there's a pathology where you you essentially are numb to most of what goes on so they found the serial killer in England he was a doctor and he had when they they found out he was doing all kinds of terrible things in fact I think he was the guy they did they based Silence of the Lambs on the guy a people and they found that he had fucking like 25 pins in his testicles and a bunch of hat pins in his anus he was sticking them all the way and they were like you know when the psychiatrist found that it was because he couldn't feel anything and he had to do that just to feel something like he always walked around and so the only way to get kind of a rush was to stick hey hey he's a doctor ladies and gentlemen hey Doc I got a pain in my in my balls he was a doctor anyway Jesus Christ doctors don't need a doctor to get alpha brain oh yeah this is that the beauty of the organic commercial anyway go to Java and.net click on the link for the fleshlight enter in the code name brogan 15% off bitch also we're brought to you by omnicom that's onn IT makers of alpha brain the did I ever give you a shit yes did you enjoy that shit I don't really didn't really feel a big difference but then again I don't know why you know I only took two pills does just once you didn't try it for a while yeah just once you didn't feel anything hard to tell Ida loose a dream job that somebody broke into my car and I want to know if I take shrink tech will help my dreams because I my car got broken into and somebody took off with my car and ran outside I'm like fuck this I'm not gonna change this you think it could cause that dream yeah but then I was lazy in my dream I didn't want to taste like a dream car around I like I was like no I'm not motivated enough to chase a dream if you examine the statement the efficiency of your brain so your brain would work more efficiently than otherwise I would I would imagine that if I were to put you in a life-and-death situation or if I were to put you in a situation where that really counted your brain would work better or at least on on up more efficiently or at least more alertly than then would your brain if we were just sitting around right shit so you should play chess in Iraq that's exactly when you're playing you know how those guys play cards and when and they let a bull loose right ever seen that yes the guy who the guys on the table of ass rice is the winner winner Jesus Christ that makes my dick hurt just thinking that that is the craziest shit in the world but you know the reality of consciousness is that we have abs and lulz and we have moments where we can't remember things and we have where the fuck that I put my key moments yeah you have your days where your you know your whatever your connection whatever the full symbiotic connection of things that's going on to make sure that when you have an insulin overload apparently that's sugar that can cause sugar can cause too much sugar can cause that's sort of what they call clouding of the brain I never used to believe that sugar is bad for you until as I got older I started looking like normal I love sugar I love like durable delicious like chocolate cake and yeah that's once in a while but if you look at not sure rockin good for you at all it's like drinking it's like getting hammered there's a guy named Robert Lustig and another guy named Scott Connelly both doctors and another science writer named Gary towel who wrote a couple great books one is a good calories bad calories and another book that was follow-up to that book which is short a book called I think what makes us fat or why we get fat and through 20 years of research you know and men more and by the way Barry Sears who was us I think doctor over am a scientist over at MIT who was one of the pioneers in time-release drugs mm-hmm and he also wrote the zone well well if you look at all their research and these guys are on a clinical level and they're looking at they're looking at what happens to your body they're trying to measure things like inflammation and the body was very difficult to do but they're doing all these things what they what they found is that insulin which is this mother hormone is directly related to a lot of health issues and and so when you look at athletes you look at people trying to be healthy they they the idea is to eat foods that keep your insulin somewhat neutral because that that otherwise when you eat foods that oxidize as sugar glucose in your system right away you run into a host of that you can measure that there are a host of Mills problems and so a guy like Robert Lustig just came out with this this long hour-and-a-half speech that he gave somewhere and Gary Taubes conferred in the New York Times saying he said I think sugars a toxin I don't think in that way I think it's a toxin which is kind of a radical thing where you go well come on man you know so he said yeah so the so do you give to your child is doing your child wrong it's not just doesn't just rot the kids teeth it's doing the child harm and here are the here are the host of reasons for it and if you actually look at the literature then more importantly if you look at what athletes are doing and especially Olympic athletes or or they are state they stay away from sugar for the most part it's a smart move yeah stayin away from sugar does make your body feel different there are natural sugars that your body can use and so much abundance of glycogen you know yeah um anyway on accom oh and and I T yeah let's talk about sugar by the way listen to Bryan Callen is probably some pepper I know it's not good for you we have alpha brain which is the cognitive enhancing supplement and there's also shroom tech and shrimp tech comes in two forms comes in shrimp export which I don't recommend unless you like a real serious workout fiend would that have helped me in my dream though with it is that car and been able to catch that burger baby you would have had some extra endurance in your name if you were on subject imagine if it was some shit right take that could specifically charge your dreams in a certain direction you know shroom brain you know one of the things in alpha brain that they believe is making people have such vivid dreams is b6 yeah apparently vitamin b6 gives you some pretty fucking vivid dreams and that's an alpha brain as well you should call alpha tech maybe you're having vivid dreams doesn't that mean you're getting REM sleep which is the sleep you need not necessarily need REM sleep but there's I believe there's a deeper cycle than REM sleep I don't believe ramen is like the deepest cycle of sleep but but when your dream isn't that that's in REM sleep yeah as far as they can you know then I mean who knows you might dream in the deepest states as well they just can't figure it out and who knows I don't really understand how they can figure out exactly what the fuck is going on your hand I guess it's electoral signals or something yeah it's crazy shit when you really stop and think about it yeah you shut off for eight hours a night you just sort of accept it the juice just disappears some people some people not many but some people can recharge in four hours versus eight hours which is really weird and and and they think maybe that has that's correlated to testosterone to people with higher testosterone sometimes need less sleep that's why only sleep about an hour and I died really saying that Arnold was always saying that really yeah only sleep a few hours a night fucking all the time watch it is time to give someone big anymore as we say with all of our products at honored calm what else I'd leave out Oh new mood which is the 5-htp supplement 5htp and l-tryptophan there's a bunch of other stuff things in as well and it gives you a a nice little a nice little serotonin boost and the shrimp tech immune is the this is the new one as far as I understand it the way it works is that this it's a different mushroom and this mushroom gives your body the impression then it's under attack by like a bug you know like like a cold or shot like this your own system fires up for an attack that never comes that's close just boost your immune system up yeah it's called shroom tech immune anyway and as I say with all these things the ingredients are available on on accom go - oh and NIT and if you think it's caught it cost too much money if you have any sort of argument about pricing go buy it in the cheapest form steal the ingredient list and make it yourself you can do it and you probably save money and good luck to you I would be the most important thing is I don't want anybody buying anything that doesn't want to buy anything if you don't want to that's totally cool if you buy it and you don't like it you get 100% money back so it couldn't be any possibly fair like you don't even have to return the product if you don't like it if you try any of this stuff and it doesn't work just say it doesn't work I want my money back boom it's that simple I coulda bought a woman and I can't make it any easier it's trying to make it as neutral and there's honest as possible I enjoy all these supplements I use them they're awesome and go to Joe Rogan ech click on the link for alpha brain entering the

favorite topics they got missiles pointed right item bro that's my favorite topics tricked into blowing guys and so how many are we talking about how many sharks well at one point they were tagging them and what they found was they would follow them at their they would tag them and they were all coming into four and five foot deep water on it the Santa Monica Pier craze and all around there where some of the largest concentration of great was at any given time can be how about that now now largest concentration of great white on the country or in the war and that can't be in the world great white invasion okay they don't know what they're coming so close to the shore but that's a good sign but by - it's like a slaughterhouse they're homeless people they stalk seals here here's was looking incredible okay there are great whites and if you take a helicopter ride over Malibu there's a you can you to it right now just go great white Malibu and you'll see a helicopter shooting how I saw that thing and there was a like an 18-footer just swimming around yeah just about you know I don't know a quarter mile less than it was probably an eighth of a mile offshore you know let's call it 300 yards offshore that shit happens all day and by the way they they're eating seals all the time surfers are always in the water do they know you're in the water and they don't fucking bite you because it's got to be the perfect storm oh Jesus yet the fuck ever whatever it's got to be the perfect story it's oh it's called I see an 18-foot fish I'm gonna fight that takes hundred pound bites

well you know you know the story that inspired Jaws you know that was based on a river attack right in New Jersey it was based on one summer where these bull sharks were jacket people in a river it wasn't a great white then went went great white for Hollywood you know when Peter Benchley turned it into a yeah pretty sure that's what he was then they'll go they found them way far upriver man there was one of those monster quest shows when they had freshwater sharks one of them was the reality but that was a fun fucking show even though they never found any monsters actually never actually even piranhas piranhas don't eat you I always thought would you jump the water Pathology you you got to even if you're a living they swim away from you they don't eat you the only time a piranha will actually use when they're starving in little mud pools and you put your hand in there and they haven't eaten they've eaten everything else there and they're starving they'll bite your hand or six billion each other actually they they they even put a duck in there with a live duck with a bunch of piranhas piranhas ramble you know I used to have piranhas yeah yeah don't listen to that nonsense let me tell you something remember that they'll eat anything did you have in ronster you had though you had that ol fish on the other side you called it death yeah that's death row at two tanks I had a tank full of piranhas and a tank filled with cool golfers would just swim looking at there there you know and what they were gonna the future yeah their future they would kill fuck those goldfish shop is wild to see man yeah it's really wild to see they don't just eat fish bro nobody's anything there's videos of them I never fed them anything other than goldfish and that's just what they're natural that was natural for them to eat fish but I got tired of it's too creepy I mean it's like it is a part of the food chain and everything and it's life and it's natural and it's just the way it works out in local in the wild I mean animals eat animals and that's just the way it goes but there's something about just watching this slaughter you know every couple days in my house fucking morose and a Burmese python and I used to have a feat of rats and really you have to stun the rats you take them by the tail and you throw them against the wall oh dude it just felt bad after a while I was like I gotta kill this great you know rats are kind of cool yeah because you can't just let it in there those a rattle fight back right yeah that's nice a snake it's bit but here's the other thing here's the other thing snakes are fucking boring okay I love that they just sit there and I guess they slither there creep does that ever rat down pythons are fucking me mine got to be eight feet long and the thing was like you try to bite you every time you stick your hand yeah yeah that's it those are creeps those are monsters man they're monsters they get used to you touching them got a reptile yeah they never give a fuck now yeah yeah people are weird man with their connections rails you know that how about that bet guy who has swims with he's got a Costa Rican crocodile of 17 feet long and and raised from a baby and swims with it we're seeing that crazy that's the crazy shit in the world I've ever seen it's nuts that's a guy's coaster we can croc about Sonia 17 feet and he's a saltwater crocodiles yeah those are the big ones those are the brackish water they fucking cry now I don't believe you could do that Costa Rican crocodiles and I've done the research they are they are way more timid than most crocodiles announce a Nile crocodile you couldn't do it there's no fucking way because they will that you are as tasty to a Nile crocodile as any food sources Costa Rica is so beautiful even the crocodiles are exactly that's not actually a little shy they're shy crocodiles yeah what where where is good luck with a fucking Nile crocodile good luck raising that thing it's amazing that there's animals like that that essentially served I mean they must have survived that big asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs the you katawa yeah must have them they had to have a very hard time right they're older than that right I don't see like they're like virtually unchanged for like more than a hundred that they found this one skeleton of this huge crocodile where the skull itself was six feet long yeah I heard about that one and it was it was basically if you look at the anatomy of the of the animal it was it was no different than a real crocodile just a giant one yeah well they named back ten animals we've added or had to eat - yeah an ambush predator look at this wall just I just did a radio show this wall just was on the show in that in that fucking Fort Lauderdale right and the guy's been to Africa 35 times documentary filmmaker and he said he goes dude I was in Rwanda and I watched it giraffe drinking and a croc come out grab Matt's raft by the head pull it into the fucking water drown it and twist its head off and then its friends came in and ate the rest of that fucking giraffe so nobody's safe okay and by the way you know well saying safe baby elephants when they stick their tusks in the water they grab that they'd grab that I mean they're they're drunk I'll grab that trunk and drown it okay they'll eat elephants whatever's in the fucking water so Jesus oh and by the way but I mentioned that the ones in Tanzania weigh in at over 2,000 pounds I got a vis a vie do that it's a one of those iconic ones where one crocodile jumps out of this waterhole and grabs it was a big animal I think it was a water buffalo or but wildebeest probably a will yes well they're down 50 pound Willoughby's they grab around the fucking midsection and whip this thing around it was a children's toy you go you get you get caught you about your brought on the water that's it it it happens in a flash part of the the world that's going on in the same time as us that's going on right now I mean we're just not there there's a spot where if you step in the water in the wrong spot a monster that lived a hundred million years ago is gonna eat you realities of how some people live your fucking worst nightmare and somehow I'm lucky yeah I never lose perspective oh yeah look at history look at history you know the fact that we live in a society where I don't have to worry about a Mongol horde coming over that hill no yeah I know not yet belong do so bomb was in office I'll tell you what yes get down so pusseh fide we're gonna nobody have guns no more you're gonna make it hard to have guns then they're gonna take over by the way um did you hear about this end I'm sorry I'm I was gonna ask you if you know how big blue whale's tongue is it's fucking huge the size of an elephant god damn what a whoo his heart's the size of a car his dick is Giganta I wonder how big is taking these pictures they're enormous pictures of the lowest I will I have their 95 feet long and they weigh 200 tons I believe we can't wait for the documentary a guy's voice whale cock wait what we guys from it yeah what we I don't remember that I said tell me oh that Obama thing the NDAA that just passed they just signed it on New Year's Eve he sent assigned it that was a the bill that makes essentially it makes America a battleground officially classifies it as a battleground so the military can come in and stop civil unrest and they can detain people indefinitely they don't have to have warrant a name that kind of thing it got through yeah already been the hell Bhama just signed they just got there it's done touchdown terrifying it's terrifying there first of all the use of military is you know it's supposed to be strict for hitted listen we don't we don't consider that our people are the enemy that's your daily facto difference between the FBI and CIA yeah the FBI deals with domestic issues the CIA is supposed to deal with foreign issues and by the way you're never allowed to spy on your own citizens there's a very very specific reason for that very strong separation between a foreign power service a foreign service and a domestic service yeah when you get to the point where you're just all automatically opening up to the idea that you can't trust anybody that everybody must be able to be scanned and stopped and searched and while we were talking before the podcast I above a book that that I'm reading now and I've read some of his other books Leon URIs is considered one of the great writers Leon URIs what's a nice person URIs and Leon URIs wrote right rights historical novels and if you ever want to learn history you know whenever you say somebody we should learn the history of Ireland the problem with that is that how do you you know I love young people get like text after I do these things are tweets and they say hey can you give me a reading list or whatever and the problem with educating yourself today is it's very hard to know what to read it's also very hard if I say well you should educate yourself on history what does that mean do I pick up a book on history I mean Jesus who wants to sit slog through that no if you want to learn about history you wanna learn about a history of the Middle East you wanna learn history of Ireland you want to learn history of the founding of the State of Israel which I'm reading now a book called Exodus if you want to learn about Ireland read a book called Trinity if you want to learn about the Arab world the Middle East read the Hajj Leon yarissa is a guy who was a foreign correspondent who spent a great deal of time all over the world and happens to be a fucking brilliant writer he wrote most of his books in the 70s in the 80s and I think even the 60s but he's considered a great writer and and what the point I'm making is that when you when you talk about how a society and its laws and its government can sneak up on you if you read Exodus about about what happened to the Jews in Poland and in Germany you're talking about a group of people who lived there for seven hundred years and many of them were very well established in all fields whether it was science academia the arts and thing like that so when all this anti-semitic behavior started occurring under Hitler's regime and it started really in like 33 where stores are being broken in articles being read about blaming the Jews for everything people were being dragged out on the street and beaten up if you if you do my charity of the Jewish people who were established in those societies were like look my my I go back generations I'm a German I'm as much a Jew as I am a German and by the way I am I've written several books and I I my roots are in this side if you ever told any of them that well your government's gonna come round up all of you all of you and I'm gonna give you some numbers in a second and they're going to kill everybody you know and worse they're gonna gas torture and starve them all in a systematic way in the concentration camps that was a true apocalypse and if you don't know anything about the Holocaust er or the world war 2 then you're amiss because it's it's it's the worst event in recorded history but it's also very important time to study because you don't understand and can't fathom the the depth of human evil until you see that because here's what it was it wasn't madmen it was very rational cool minded men with shaved cheeks who sat in a room dressed in medals and in suits who came up with something called the final solution which was to kill every single Jew in the world and they almost did it and in Poland alone out of 3.1 million Jews who'd been there for 700 years mostly in ghettos but who had deep roots and huge contributions to society to that society and Germany at the end of World War two and this is just five six years there were fifty thousand left all of whom were wretches all of whom were starving all of whom were coming out of the concentration camps like Birkenau outfits a Treblinka and all these things so when you if you if you really think that you're safe or if you really think that anybody giving anybody power over you is a good idea it's a good idea you're you're you're fuckin wrong and you should pick up a history book and what makes this country very very special and what makes this country and you have to fight for is government by the people for the people and that's very easy to forget and even George Washington said you got to be careful because people will invent laws to take their own power away from them that's what George Washington said and it is very human and if you if you look at like if you look at anybody in power I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat you you this is why I'm a Ron Paul supporter because if you look at anybody in power when you're in power you you have an impulse to try to solve a problem you want to solve a problem and the only way to do that government does what it passes laws and it grows and it taxes those are too taxing and passing laws are too coercive measures that's what they do it's just and you do need some laws you do need some taxation let's be honest but when you have a central authority like that the big question for anyone is who is going to govern the governor governor who is watching the governor that's the central question of political science who is going to because it has to be them can have someone who beyond repair the answer is who the people that's the answer right and they're choking dead out a daily basis choking that out slowly you in this is the biggest enemy and you have to be on guard at that all the time and by the way it always is under good auspices it's always any society might my god even the Nazis for God's sake even the Nazis that monstrous machine defined what they were doing along what they would consider moral grounds Hitler was trying to quote-unquote solve up solve the Jewish problem etc and and it's a Moslem Enda that got or that that had little Ukrainians and poles cheering on those firing squads as they were killing Jews that's what happens you can poison an entire mindset so it's amazing that it's within our grasp historically like we can see things so you can have photos and video because things like this have happened this is this is what they're worse than you can imagine yeah they're as you read Exodus and I studied Nazi Germany was my area focus in in college but but if you read that book and and he brings it down to such a personal level it is beyond thinkable and it's the unspeakable and it's like it's almost like it was the first event of that magnitude a horrific event of that magnitude where you know air travel had just become like a sort of a big player in the way the world functions because people could fly over you and drop shit on you things changed very quickly they accelerated very quickly and it's just amazing that it's all within our capability of recording it and watching it all right but here's the big difference - back then nobody was watching it nobody was seeing what was going on in the Russian countryside you know stop Hitler said I want to get rid of this - hisses Stalin Hitler said I want to make part of the Russian countryside habitable for Germans and so what he said is we have to just get rid of all the all the the Bolsheviks let's just kill everybody who's there kids just just empty the villages of people so what they would do is they would have these soldiers come in and they would dig these huge mass pits and shoot everybody into the pits Oh Mon that's how bad it was and so at the end of World War two there were 50 million people dead how do you get that many people to do that how much how does that happen what is that that's a very good question let me put it this way in in and I believe these are the numbers but by the 1943 and birkin BER canal which was about a mile away from Oxford so it's I'm saying Ashford's and Auschwitz let's call it Auschwitz they were probably killing close to 40,000 people a day and the way they would do it is this what they found was that when they brought people in and it was this at a peak there's this a constant steady stream yes yes that's why they were able to kill six million Jews and and look and let me explain something to you and it's important if it's a done those numbers for a second because their overwhelming number three for kill and these are children type of children and these are women and these are infants and they all have names and they all had they all had families and they all connection they were all as human as you and I and it's very it's very natural for us to kind of say well that was a long time ago and they may have looked at life differently no they had all the same dreams they had all the same hopes they had all the same love they all had all the same bonds and it's overwhelming and too much for your heart to bear if you really think about what human beings have done to other especially the Holocaust it's why the Holocaust that that word that word the Holocaust which I believe means the great fire or a derivation of that that's why that word is used only for that specific event in history because they did get burned they did get put in ovens and they did get that they're all trace of them was washed away because as the Russians and the Americans closed in on those camps they had to get rid of all the evidence so they blew up all those gas chambers they they burned the bodies they crushed the skulls and they would use other Jews to do it they would make you do it so you'd be 14 unloading bodies out of a fucking think about this maybe it's as crazy as it gets right it says worse than it depraved as it as it possibly gets but the way you get people to go about it is two things one is deception one is and and human beings have always done it and I'm gonna I'll explain why we're now living in a world where it's harder to do but but what you do is just misinformation propaganda you say hey guess who's causing all your financial problems a group called the Jews or a group called the Chinese or a group called the blacks and they're and by the way they also kill their own kids and they're subhuman and you take young men who have no education or have been educated specifically and they're full of fire and what they go to war for is to protect what they consider their way of life see I don't think people go to war for hatred I think people go to war because they're in love with their way of life and they're trying to protect their families they're trying to protect their way of life and that's how you create a real soldier and a dedicated Patriot you create a sense of misinformation in young men who are 18 and 19 are not asking questions they're trying to be a hero and if it means having to kill all those bad guys over there and even their kids and their women well the kids know women are kind of subhuman you always do always create a subhuman context for the other for the enemy and that's that's what but the good news the good news in 2011 is that is becoming harder and harder to do because of the Internet and we're all getting closer and closer together and it's easier to kind of empathize with somebody when you see them suffering when video tape doesn't lie and when you can when you can hear their voices and you can hear and they create political and bodies and groups they say you know look we bleed and we cry just like you do no and and and that's that's what I had to think has a lot to do with breaking down these natural tribal tendencies of human beings have because human beings are tribal we are tribal even if you belong to one martial arts school it's so natural for you to go yeah we're better though those guys over there kind of yeah they're fucking they may do that subject so we do the original pure yeah you ride that an insurer rival and look at teams well then the nationalism involved in my team versus your team right I mean you know these big rivalries so but the good news is that I believe that and I may be naive but I don't think so that pulling off something as horrific as what happened in the Holocaust would be very difficult very difficult today and almost probably impossible because too many of us would go this is outrageous I don't think it would get as up as bad as the Holocaust but I think it's happening right now what happened in Rwanda yeah yeah right yeah sure and and that was mango that was the yeah yeah and in those places again are pretty remote and still haven't but most of Africa I can't remember the number but there are an ordinance in Africa and during the violence in Kenya recently people started videotaping soldiers raping women and they started tweeting and texting where the concentration of violence was happening so people were able to avoid that so what's happening is just like in Mexico with the drug cartels people are being empowered by social media and when they see a house where drug activities going on they can just tweet it anonymously in the cops go and find it so they don't have to worry about retribution so a lot of these things a lot of the social media is a really good thing because it's creating it's truly democratizing power it's really spacing power out and and in some ways it makes for it makes for a better place to live could you imagine if you had a move to Africa did you have imagined of something happened like America doesn't like Bryan Callen anymore you gotta get out of the country I've been to Africa twice you know what if you had I know what if you have to live there I'm sure there's a nice place there are very nice place of Africa but for the most part you probably want to be in the United States well if you had to live in the Congo could you imagine if don't that would suck that was cheap and just had another fucking earthquake by the way 7.0 like three days ago where was this and I think right off aside Toki I like in the water like 7.0 all the shit makes me wonder what I do I need guns so I need to start storing water there was an earthquake in Ohio and they found out whether it's like some controversy that that it might be because they're drilling for wells and that they actually had to shut it down because there was some recent activity from this drilling like they've noticed that the the activity has been higher than normal and so they shut it down and then like just a little bit time later there was a 4.3 earthquake in Youngstown Ohio that's possible they said they can do that they said they can start some sort of minor movements with with like some hardcore drilling it kind of makes sense if you drill I got a fault you know it seems like yeah but that that are good like now they're gonna be earthquakes all the time in Ohio would you imagine if they did if they just the greedy Fox if they just drilled a hole the wrong spot and now it's like okay the worst fault line ever and you can't really blame them cuz no one there's no real science behind it's really difficult for able to prove whether we know what what caused maybe all these earthquakes were gonna happen anyway and they broke we actually have a thousand wells that we've done in Ohio and in Pennsylvania and we've never had a problem before a drill a thousand gigantic holes a thousand that's ten 100 you know you really got that fault line good guys just think about that a hundred huge aquifers under those states yeah this country but apparently there's a massive aqua fire that they say is gonna push a lot of industry in that direction like properties going what do you mean by aqua fire I mean under under stream on the water there's a massive natural reservoir really yeah oh shit yeah where does it itch the earth has all these creepy fucking layers underneath us you know we're just living on this crust we don't like to think that man I know they're just right under you you know whatever it is water from what the Colorado River I mean this is where the LA doesn't have water yeah we don't know there's no water we had to divert water from the Colorado River and and yeah valleys just do realize a fuck out like that's what Chinatown's about with the on valley we've had all these farmers in this way of life and they were like the powers that be came in ago we need to move we need to grow fucking orange groves and by the way let's start the movie industry here because the weather is predictable oh we need water oh fuck the Owens Valley redirect the river over this way and they all these farmers were like my fucking sheep or die I have any water and then they went fucking nuts but they were like sorry we have the money wow what a creep move they stole their fucking River yeah they dried out a whole fucking Valley they stole their water it's not amazing you could do that you could decide our yeah I could decide well you people that affects me that's that's when guys hit power like smoking a cigar going let's just let's just divert the river so what do you mean sir the Colorado River one of the biggest rivers no and they're in the country yeah well that's how they created that Salton Sea right guys didn't know what it is something alumni might be talking out of my ass result of just you know figuring out a way to get water to land so you could grow food yeah la is really a ridiculous place to live it's a fucking desert it's so stupid the water could get taken away at any time and we're yeah but every degrees and breathes you all the time it was 93 when I got today was 85 degrees out it was 93 when I was driving Jesus it's insane I like it it's beautiful I love in January I love the heat man it's a lot better than fucking freezing your ass Hawk I'll tell you what it's a lot better than black ice and dealing with Sierra dude winter times driving is scared I remember going to high school up in New England and I would met the nostril that deep my nostril the mucus my those would freeze walking from one oh yeah I'm to breakfast I'll be back next Thursday Jeff I've been on the highway before and watched it rain and watch the rain just sort of start sticking to your windshield you like what the fuck is going on here the rain was like just beginning to turn into ice like Christmas it was just beginning to become icy rain and then the entire road became a skating rink today it's just slide into a ditch everybody wait have you been oh yeah well I was in New Mexico in the summertime and I got caught in the hailstorm like huge hailstones well New Mexico's gold that's got they got legit hail they got hail that they put on YouTube it's crazy yeah yeah I golf balls and the whole city had it and everybody's cars was all jacked up and everybody the same thing I did was like oh they gave me $1,200 to fix it I'm just keeping the money and buying some Xbox games and stuff so everybody's cars had were fucked up and in like four years the dogs got jacked it was got dogs got fucked up you there's one video that I watched this kid put a video up of it's starting and he didn't know how bad it was gonna get because it was so crazy I was like oh my god this fucking this is this tail is so bad we had to film it so he's looking filming in his backyard and it's coming down man you're watching it but then as he's filming it it just turns into the preposterous it turns into the end of time it turns into a fucking shotgun of ice is coming out of the sky every second I mean his fucking pool is exploding exploded splashes yes yes oh my god you can't believe it it's the most horrific fuck could be the thought that you could be on your way home from somewhere you're walking yeah I bet you got headphones on know what's happened you get hit with the first ice pellet that's that's what I was talking about that's the random shit to Dresden I don't want to die randomly I'm like for example how about this I told you the story where the couple is driving down the fucking highway and they hit a bear 60 miles an hour there goes flying into the other Lane and kills the people come over this way they're like bear God my fucking bear Wow oh my that's annoying can't bear proof your windshield okay yeah have a nice Hollywood I saw do you do a thing on his car for a deer though when I lived in Colorado he had this bad ass fucking battering ram Riley grill hit a pickup truck and he was a hunter don't that easier kill more people than any other kill a lot of people man you got to be really careful they're crazy they just you know they have nutty instincts to just leap out in front of cars and I don't think they quite understand something can move as fast as a car because in nature they I think they get a lot more of a warning that's hard to judge cuz the cars on one level so when it's coming at you on a highway you can't tell faster because it operates on the same plane oh because it's not jumping up the way it runs our predator runs they stay on one level they're not jumping up and down where is it gazelles jumping up and down right you can that you can you can measure how fast they're going but when physics wise when something is operating along the same plane it's much harder to judge their speed that's why when you're in a highway and cars coming at you you can't tell what's going 90 or 6000 saying at the same level now is it an efficiency thing for ya or some more MORE apparently more just evolution wise it's it's so the animal it's a tiny thing can't tell how fast is Catoe races do the assessment it doesn't run according it just runs right right but the cat looks like it's farther away from you then if it was just all so hard to see that it's also staying it's a yeah stay low there's a cool video of guess South America's Jaguars right it's a Jaguar eating a giant rat like Fame capybara yeah that's that video of oh my they're not polygamists and these dudes filmed it its enormous it's a rat like the size of a big fucking dog and this Jaguar is sitting there just completely frozen like not moving at all and the video takes like it takes four minutes of the Jaguar doing nothing until he launches himself on this thing you know jaguars which are very big cats will eat a human right quick one to one hand one cat you don't want to be around is the Jaguar more than anything else including a tiger you don't fuck around well you know when people take ayahuasca that's that the DMT beverage that they take in South America one of the big visions that people have as Jaguars they have a lot of Jaguar visions did you know my buddy works for like the Secret Service you know and you know they get calls all the time because like sometimes they'll get there for foreign service guys who go in and know they'll fucking take like they try to mix in with the locals and they'll take drugs and then they'll just end up in the middle of the fucking Amazon or the Congo and they have to they have to get a search team to go find them because they took some fucking drug and there are several stories like that or how about this how about this the guy during the Haiti of Zab it was like not during this earthquake but there was another disaster back in the 90s when people were trying to emigrate to the States right and the guy they had one dude some young dude who is like basically at the embassy who there's a long life people trying to emigrate to the US and none of them were getting in right so you basically just go deny deny deny and this is what they had this one young guy was like a shit assignment there right and it's hot as a fan and he started you just like they people kept lining up and he just kept going he kept going denied fucking tonight finally started going stir-crazy right and and he had this little what's that Star Wars well who's a Star Wars character both a fit well before was that Boba Fett okay so we have a little Boba Fett tall there and so he started going he just start going crazy and the guy would come up and go hold on sorry Boba Fett says denied I'm sorry he's like the beaver that's like Mel Gibson's movie ok well so he starts going Boba Fett says no right all of a sudden the people started giving him boba fett offerings okay so like like a week later Boba Fett has a fucking pile of everything from food to cigarettes like a whole mountain like right here okay then then a black market starts developing over Boba Fett dolls Boba Fett costumes and people start coming out with Boba Fett costumes and dolls and stuff trying to get in because they thought that was kind of who you had to talk to they figured this guy was they figure this guy's obviously talking above a fat and this guy and he's a Bubba Fett fanatic so we should show allegiance to Boba Fett so people were coming in dressed like Bo vet in the USMC had to be like all right we got to fucking stop this take that fucking doll out of here right fucking now and this one because the guy was like yes yeah thank you thank you very much and this Boba Fett says no I'm sorry and the guy be dressed like Boba Fett like what the fuck it's amazing that that guy got so far that just shows you that was a story that was a story that this guy was his foreign foreign service guy told me about that's oh by the way my other buddy is but he came to visit me I can't say his name but he's a CIA guy or something like that I don't know what he does but I know he's been in Iraq for ten years in Afghanistan he was telling me about that fucking what would be a waste that goes on how about this how about this in in Iraq they they it's a desert right they spent a hundred thousand dollars importing sand for volleyball courts so they had to date they brought one hundred thousand dollars for the sand in for the volleyball courts as opposed to just getting the sand in Iraq I'm sure you could find fucking sand somewhere in Iraq now let's import it from the States because everybody's got their fucking mouths at the government trough and when you've got a war going on there's so much money to be made and everybody does it and it's just a confluence of fucking events in everybody everybody who goes there you have a project you have money and you want to build a big dam or a power a big power plant right it doesn't matter if the fucking Iraqis need it or not what matters say you burn your money you get judged by your burn rate okay and as you you you you have a certain a lot of budget and you have to get a fucking huge power plant whether it's needed there or not the point is to get it done because then you get a promotion or or your project is a success and that shit was going on and continue to go on in Iraq for the past 10 fucking years the waste is so outrageous it's ridiculous and by the way you know the Iraqis you know do you know how much oil we've gotten from the Iraqis how much oil revenue none it's all gone a new Iraqi conference this whole thing cost us a fucking fortune and let me go on let me go on Maliki is creating his own Secret Service police forces that direct report directly to him does that sound familiar so we fucking take the country apart and now we're creating with leaving behind Saddam light see you later max right guys well you know he's consolidating power keeping the Sunnis out so the Sunnis like fuck you we're gonna lose all art we're gonna lose all the resources you guys are sitting all the resources in the south we're gonna bomb the fucking shit out of you guys until you come back to the bargaining table hey civil war in Iraq it's fuckin a Trajan it's Civil War that happened like that yeah but but you know who was calling all that shit a lot of people including this fucking idiot and I'm an actor and I said how are you gonna stop the Sunnis and the Shia's from getting into a war after all the shit breaks down and how do you stop the Shia who are a majority from aligning themselves with Iran our number one enemy huh that's weird wasn't Iraq kind of a playing sort of a countervailing force to Iran I'm an actor and I was asking that question I'm an actor you know what I read one newspaper a day that's all I don't know anything and these fucking guys couldn't figure that out so why is it so why do you think that our foreign policy is so self-destruct him I asked him that question and and obviously there's a lot of people are making a profit but it almost seems like you're burning the farm down you had a great answer he had a great answer because I said how much of this is like a group of men a cabal of evil men or how much of this is centrally planned or people have different interest and he said dude he goes it's not like that he said what it is is there's just a whole bunch of that and I'll give you another example of what's happening now I said what is there's a whole bunch of interests working a whole bunch of money to me and everybody has a different opinion and some opinions win the day and others don't right and so the State Department has their own agenda the executive has their agenda and everybody has their own agenda but ultimately enough shit starts to be kind of like talked about where you start creating an enemy you start saying this might be a good idea for the following reasons and pretty soon there's so much there's so many sort of there's so many groups of people that have a vested interest in going in and usually it's an intellectual interest usually it's like I think we can bring democracy to the Middle East and that's a very grandiose idea and grandiose plan oh and by the way because it's gonna make the world safer at the end of the day there's a lot of idealistic people involved in this well not just money people and all of a sudden all this shit starts to come together and and before you know it you're fuckin on your way to war you know and the way he described it made a lot of sense it's just it's like a tidal wave it's like starts as a snowball before you know you got a fucking massive tsunami on your hands of just momentum and there's just so many interest in there's so much movement in one direction that what are you gonna do then call it off no you got weapons of mass destruction he's used in before let's go let's go let's go take out the fourth largest army in the world because it's not safe and you know let's let's let's make the world a better place and you get a bunch of people like that who do it and then of course you get a lot of people behind the scenes going we can make a lot of fucking money Boeing Lockheed Raytheon saying dude they're gonna need a lot of weapon systems they're not gonna need them but we can sell them to them it's an amazing thing to that once that money starts coming in and coming in in just billion dollar contract after billion dollar contract I mean the amount of money as defense contractors Halliburton to clean up people all the different people it mean the amount of money is insane try asking them to cut it off how about this not only 11 billion dollars we have an 11 billion dollar arms deal with Iraq right now ok and it's about to go through but here's the thing can't give it on the arms because Maliki is not not agreeing to the terms he we set for him which was you have to share power with the Sunnis because we don't want a civil war there and we have a lot of American interest already in Iraq in Iraq ok there's a lot of American companies making money now here's the thing you you tell a politician to veto that 11 million dollar arms deal you know how many people that employs you how many people that that that you know many constituents are fuckin are voting based on the fact that they a job because of Leven bill you're gonna take 11 billion dollars out of the American economy good luck good fucking luck and that's what happens is that amazing amazin amazing money but the the money to make shit that kills people necessarily yeah oh we need 11 billion dollars we're gonna give you 11 million dollars oh by the way we're gonna get that to you Malachy so you can say you can create your own army of Shia to keep the Sunnis down and that's called a civil war without the military-industrial complex how much less war would there be I don't know the answer I don't know it's an interesting lie I don't think it's war that you would stop but I do think if you take I only think I do think with with with I think the private sector makes a lot of money off of the decisions made in government and and so there's a profit to be made from war and if that's the case it does raise an important question if war becomes big business let me give you another example Iran Iran has a nuclear program at least we're trying to stop right we did sell bunker-buster bombs to Israel about three years ago now now what are bunker buster bombs bunker buster bombs and these particular ones we sold to Israel are bombs that can penetrate deep into the earth and take out an arsenal so if you have an a nuclear facility that is churning out weapons these bunker bombs supposed to go into the earth and blow that fucking facility to smithereens okay now we don't want to do it but maybe Israel will will drop those bombs on on because they know where the Iran is making these weapons mmm do you think that the Americans are sitting back and using the Israelis as a proxy to see if those fucking bunker buster bombs work there seems to be a lot of noise headed Iran's way it seems to me there seems to be something brewing in Iran they have taken a very aggressive stance with the with the the Gulf with with blocking off oil routes now and the US Navy is saying this is unacceptable there's a whole bunch of noise going on and it seems to me things are moving in in in a direction that is not in Iran's favor and let's see what happens next but a lot of money a lot of money Israel you know we probably gave those those weapons Israel without no pay but we want to see if they work you know Wesley Clark the guy ran for president yeah predicted all this shit yeah predicted every single stuff he lives it every day it's amazing he sees the fucking waste then sees how much money and what kind of a lobbying power Raytheon and Boeing and Lockheed are you don't think they have massive lobbying efforts there's just too much money at stake use incredible they they and they can find a way to justify it is legal yeah you know how has been done employment I'll employ ten thousand people in your state because I'll take my thing but we got to build this we got to build these very important you know fucking c-130 listen this is these are all this is all shocking shit it's all big bummer into the world shit how do you fix it is their way is your way to fix Ron Paul would say I'll just I'll tell you what Ron Paul would say Ron Paul would say the only way to fix it is to make the government the government that everybody feeds off of and that has a lot of power to make these decisions you make the government smaller you take away some of government's power and that's the scent of you and there's and there's I just watched a speech by Ronald Reagan he made it I think 1969 and it's called a time to choose and if he made that speech today Ron Paul Ron Paul could make that speech today and and it would it wouldn't be any different at all he talks about how 37 cents of your dollar is God's the government before you even wake up in the morning 37 percent of your day is working for the government and the government keeps gonna be getting better he talks about the war on poverty and if he see he did a little arithmetic he goes if we take the money that we spent on poverty and it takes a list of how many poor people there are he said everybody should be getting forty six hundred dollars a year but it turns out we're getting six hundred dollars how that happened is some money being lost along the way it was all the stuff that wrong people that let's just go let's explore that right okay here's the deal what if you you make the government smaller what do you how do you how much do you keep and then what happens all those people that used to be government employees that have a career in government employees is that this is the biggest problem and by the way I mean some of those folks are hardworking folks and you know they do a great service to the country and some of those folks are useless and there's a lot of people that are little leeches unto a sister for me for me yes and for me it doesn't that being Republican Democrat conservative liberal has nothing to do that for me what I look at it as anything big at whether it's a big corporation or the government which has no accountability and is that big I don't understand how you can make that that power run efficiently I do see how it can grow and it keeps growing and that's the threat like you just said you just brought up the biggest question what happens how do you make government smaller it has so many vested interests and not only that it's not just government computerize it right that's a private industry is involved in in this you're right technology yeah computers is the right answer instead of having some asshole in a fucking suit that represents your state you know go up in front of everybody and no miss state everyone's position instead of having that you can have the attribute actually let me say let me say one other thing yes you're not alone you're not alone in your thinking and what the conversation we're having is being had all over the country absolutely both Democrat and Republican circles they and that this whole wall street the Occupy Wall Street movement is is is in some ways voicing some of those frustrations I'll give you a piece of good news in my opinion okay and a piece of good news that that we've never experienced before you hear a lot of people talking about inequality of income okay and there is however there is we are we are experiencing and I'm stealing this from a Wall Street Journal article so I'm paraphrasing this but there is an equality of consumption that we've never experienced before and let me give let me tell you what I mean by that take somebody who's very wealthy very wealthy you have a lot more money than I do I do pretty well but you got a moment you're lonely your life in my life are very are very similar the only difference might be might be that you drive a faster car but we sit in the same traffic you drive a Porsche I Drive a Prius but we basically sit in the same traffic but the interior of my car not that much different I got GPS I got a great stereo I got everything I need that you wear the same clothing I do I guess you could wear our Armani and Versace you never would and the rest of that is fluff we eat the same amount of food and if you look at most people I'm talking about the middle class in this country including people who are struggling for money and stuff most people the average amount for a wedding spent in this country is somewhere around $26,000 a year I mean $26,000 that's a lot of money so what we are doing what we have now is an economy where very rich people invent something say it's an application or a computer or something that we all we all use ok but they don't make any money unless they can generate mass consumption of that product so that most of us own a computer most of us own a cell phone and that cell phone has all kinds of applications most of us have a TV that brings that that allows us to watch pretty much anything we want high def TVs cost $700 it's amazing the technology that you have in your phone let's take that the old Wall Street the first Wall Street Michael Douglas he pulls out he pulls out a Motorola phone that weighs 2 pounds and cost three thousand nine hundred ninety five dollars back then okay then it was it was a brick and it weighed two pounds and that was for the elite it was a little more than that actually ok he's about five fouls but that was for the elite back then that was what Michael Douglas pulls out a cell phone are we go holy shit he carries his own phone nowadays the difference between I'll tell you the Steven jobs and I use the same fucking phone Warren Buffett and I used the same phone the only difference in Warren Buffett and me the only difference is he flies privately but I can fly anywhere I want for under $1000 anywhere in the world if I if I if I get on the internet fast enough so we have an equality of consumption in this country unlike any time in the history of the world and that's good fucking news most people I'm talking about most people at least have enough to eat they have an ability to contact each other they have an ability to entertain themselves almost the way they want how do people own Xboxes I believe it was last year 60 million were sold or something crazy Xboxes so think about the f7 yeah so we have access and we have access to information and inspiration how many people listen to your podcast you don't have a lot of money but they get inspired that you turn them on the things that they can afford you you know this is what's this is what the good news is about yes we may have inequality of income but we have equality of consumption like we've never seen before and that's fucking that's a big deal and nobody talks about that well this definitely isn't the worst time in human history that's that fuck shut the grate the thing I think what what really is killing people is the unrealized potential of the human race that drives people nuts people that really truly are patriotic people that really truly do have respect and and and admiration for the human spirit they believe that there's a much higher level that our society and our culture can achieve and I do too it's not that I'm that I'm unpatriotic it's just that I think goddamn we could do a lot fucking better than this we don't have to be the crooks of the world it's not necessary we can we're going to die someday we are temporary beings the way we're doing this is ridiculous the fact that we've allowed these people to continue to operate like this is ridiculous they're not looking out for our needs we shouldn't be playing policemen all over the world we shouldn't have a hundred fucking military bases all over the world it's ridiculous our military industrial complex as somehow another co-opted the entire government and they're forcing people into some shit that the people don't want even the patriotic people don't there's very few people think it's a good idea that we stick around in Afghanistan I mean Afghanistan doesn't even need us we overthrew the government Iraq we took off and left them in chaos obviously right everything's fucking falling apart over there and guess what Afghanistan doesn't have a government right I mean they're not even a real country never happen it's ridiculous the idea that we can't leave it on we don't want that to happen over here my buddy the other guys the CIA guy said to me he said he said when he's been a lot of time in Afghanistan he said they were talking to a dude on the border of Pakistan and of Afghanistan was zero ston that lawless area the guy didn't know what Pakistan was he'd never he was on he lives on the mountain he was like what do you talk about I don't that's not my reality I and you want you want a guy in Kandahar to have loyalty that somebody to the government in Kabul there's never been a tradition of that never know what are you talking about they're just warlords and by the way I'm trust government like you think Karzai and his group are are looking out for all the Hazaras and the sheiks up in the north the fuck you how about Karzai's brother who was a CIA drug Chloe a drug runner yeah drug runners slash getting checks for UCS what they're having a tough time getting people to not grow poppies for heroin we'd rather grow cotton and soybean because it's a lot more profitable it's it's it's these are these are a lot of middle reasons when I was out there I was out there and those fucking soldiers those soldiers were building hospitals and and schools and those guys are brave and I fucking am proud what every time I see those guys okay and a lot of them died and I'm that fucking egregiously egregiously wounded is that a word doesn't matter so silver I won so but the bottom line is I'm not I'm not that's what that's what kills me is that effort and that fucking that these are real heroes what they're giving you men walk away yes and then we go out there and and anybody who can tell anybody you talk to anybody who really knows about the country including those soldiers who've been there a long time ago what the fuck are we doing man right you can't build us is gonna build a nation Afghanistan you're gonna build a nation where there never was one what are you talking about it's insane all you're doing is taking money and moving it to people with bigger guns and what is the deal with al-qaeda in in Afghanistan isn't there's like almost none left okay no I'll cater and by the way you think the Afghan is but there is a Taliban yeah but tell you know what Taliban means Nepali means student really yes so you're a student so Taliban so you tell me you're telling bun Italia bomb means yes I master yeah you're here you're really doing student yes Italian you know your and your student so you know then that why because the the notion came out of those schools in Peshawar and Saudi Arabia most of all most of those schools all of those schools in Peshawar and it came out it we're financed by Rabia our number one ally in the Middle East okay they were financed by that why the Saudis are wahhabis that is a puritanical sect of Sunni Islam okay obsessed with purity okay so let's start there that's what happened and you have to go all the way back to when the Soviets actually invaded Afghanistan and we were financing the Mujahideen and everything else with the help of the ISI which is the is it true you would be the great guy to ask about this because I watched in a documentary where they were saying that the the whole term for jihad was originally a war on your own vices yes that it was subvert it by the CIA ha the root word of jihad an Arabic a struggle struggle and struggle jihad meant she had meant two things I like how you say that's very sad well she had that's very authentic is so authentic I love you and the idea behind you had of course was there was the was the battle that always wages between the flesh and the spirit my own heart and then when the CIA was training the Mujahideen and supplying them with arms they somehow or another subvert it to get them immediately whether who did it no I mean who got them to change it to holy war what happened was when when you had people who were fighting first of all what the Soviets did to Afghanistan was pretty horrific right cut out cut down all the trees bombed all kinds of villages and you had these you created fanatics you created men who basically had lost their village gotten and their young men and the Soviets were looking for natural gas is that what they were looking for no Soviets were just looking for a buffer they were looking for they were I believe they were looking essentially for a a buffer zone between Pakistan and and themselves okay that makes sense it was all just all due to the Cold War when and and they were afraid they were gonna lose control of Afghanistan we're doing Gus I never really had nobody ever wanted to be in Afghanistan you didn't want to be living in the Khyber Pass it's too forbidding there wasn't all there they say there's minerals there good luck nobody fucking wants in minerals that we don't have we get where we have plenty of minerals from Africa in places are much easier and nobody wants to go into Afghanistan it's always been a group of on well that's actually not totally true because the one there's a lot of people that arise nobody had the resources of problems yeah but nobody wanted to get involved it's just what he means back to back then in the 79 when they oh I see it was just fucking too difficult they didn't understand that nobody ever anticipated the worth of the minerals though look good for cell phones you know like lithium-ion 4 batteries is one of the the best mining areas in the world I don't hope for all these dominoes all over all these different scientific journals yeah I mean they found over a trillion dollars were the minerals and everyone else too we'll see if anybody is willing to put the money into that it's such a fucking pain in the ass to it I can't understand why you would say that there's there's a trillion dollars laying in the ground you but you're telling me that it's not gonna be big businesses going to pull that out of there a trillion dollar oil do the trillion dollars can change the fucking world a trillion dollars can put a company and could have a seat edible position of power you should research it before we talk any further I don't know I because because it's indisputable they've found a gigantic or of minerals that they had always suspected but it's much much larger than fine I don't believe that we went into Afghanistan I think we went out of concern because they were harboring okay I think that's what we you know they it was very hard to get it politically right you can't get the American public you can't say the American public so I think everybody wants it to be either/or you know all we went into there because we're corrupt and we're trying to take to all their poppies because it's a billion stars with the helmet no it's it's not either/or it's a damn soup of shit and by the way it doesn't hurt that they could make money off the poppies it doesn't hurt because it really knows where the minerals doesn't we should try to predict them that's examiner old friend you get in there there's opportunity right but isn't it funny how everybody wants to have a black or white issue it's either a crazy conspiracy theory or you know this is just the unfortunate nature of reality that's movies because we want we want there so he's enough stupid it's so amazing we all like this way slap here real life is way slap here you know when you talk to I think was Tony Snow before he died said they were saying well what are you guys gonna do about this situation he said guys when we're in the Oval Office and you've got a bunch of people there with all the top brass in the military and the CIA and then you've got you know the State Department we do exactly what you think we do try sitting in a room with 10 was tried try sealing room with 30 people and come up with one one idea try to come up with one thing everybody agrees on you don't everybody's banding ideas back and forth people are disagreeing with each other people are pissed off because they you over you talked over me so ever nobody can get the president's ear and that's what happens and then the president has to go into a room with three of his advisers and they have to fucking go we got seven options that we've been presented now why do you think that in that case why do you think that Obama is like it's such a wishy-washy dude why do you think he's the guy that is willing to pass the NDAA bill he's the guy that is I I think my feeling and I I don't know but my feeling is in the mistake Obama made and I think the the opportunity he wasted was not not I think he's an academic first of all and I think he's by nature a very very he's a guy he's of he's an intellectual and he lists books of both sides and I think he's by nature fairly indecisive maybe because he's an intellectual and I think really I think so I'm just I'm just I think he's compromised and I think it's clearly compromised I think he doesn't have the I don't think he I I don't know there's nothing I I don't necessarily agree that he's that smart and also I don't think that he has the backbone I don't think I think he's an effective leader I think that but there's usually more convicted he should have stronger conviction well he does have strong convictions towards the people who got him in power and that's what you got to look at you guys look people spent a lot of money to get that guy into the position that he's in and he's working for them now it's as clear as day yeah well listen let's look at that I mean a president spends two years doing his policy and then he spends the next two years trying to get reelected it's just basically trying to keep everybody reasonable you know it's like come on folks let's just be reasonable with how hard we fuck these people I mean that's really where the president's job is they get in and the the best they can do is say I really don't agree with this but I have to sign it but that's what he did with the NDAA he voted against a rock and I always appreciate that you said yeah but meanwhile here we are here we are a lot of it's tough for a president fuck yeah it's tough coming I don't know it's really do you think the problems how much say do you think he really has how much say do you I mean is it possible for him to go against those people is it even possible can't a thing without Congress right so right he has li has executive power it used to be that way but you don't have to declare war anymore you just start going over places and next thing you know shit happens I mean was war ever declared and these are a couple conflicts that we were involved in where Congress did not step in and declare war in Vietnam yeah there you go yeah I mean that's it's not we don't necessarily know there's emergency executive powers you know and that's another creepy thing is like when you find out how many fucking bills and laws are passed just under what is that do you really need them I believe that is the what I say is that you need Clint Eastwood laws and this is what a Clint Eastwood laws if you couldn't imagine cleany to arrest in somebody for it then it should be Lehman since law it's fuckin Clint Eastwood it's only assholes douchebags meth-heads guy who needs a punch someone you have to shut it but you gas laws but you get into really complicated issues with for example anti-piracy laws how far you go with that stuff right yeah so so you know you and I love raging debate on my website about this yeah because we because the website because the web is the last frontier of free speech a free everything and it's not regulated now a might a good intellectual property being stolen by countries like China Wow what do you do do you pass a bunch of laws would that help the problem I don't think what well we would have to we would have to step up and say somehow or another we're gonna you know we're gonna boycott that I mean they wouldn't you could we couldn't boycott the whole country that would be ridiculous you couldn't do that you couldn't make a few people that won't won't play nice internationally responsible for the whole country and what the fuck would you do that well you know we got to do is somehow or another get it into people's minds when they're really really young really young that the world is so much better if you're cool to people well way then once they get there I mean it's reading that met now we have another word no we haven't never will but here's the thing but that's not necessarily true because we've never had access to human beings the way we have access now in the Internet and I think that human beings are - two things happen one you develop in a terrible environment and you you develop all these defense mechanisms at genes that are only activated under extreme stress and you develop like a whole culture of people that are in a bad situation on a regular basis and are wired for that shit that's terrible okay you you also develop a bunch of people who don't get love on a regular basis they don't know how to give love they don't have a real true sense of community of real problems if you don't educate people on how to be a percept that once you do and once you can you can slowly change things you can change the way children are raised you can change the way relationships between your neighbors are formed and you can slowly spread this out to the point where it can have a real effect you can essentially be a new operating system for people well for the most part I've got two thoughts in that one is if you read Tim Ferriss book the 4-hour workweek not for our body to the 4-hour workweek listen man I ain't got no time I'm trying to get some for our buyer he's a really he's really a great author isn't he I really love that he's Crower I love that I love the other one and he said and he said something and it goes - to the internet and stealing and things look he said when you give people when you wouldn't like with you doing here with the brain thing you say if you don't like it don't send it back get will give you your money back when you do something like from a business plan and he talks about it he says just tell people you'll give them either you can give people you can tell people you'll give them double their money back and people go well that people will abuse it I'll go broke guess what about two percent of the people out there always abuse it always and the rest of them don't and the bottom line is it's like stealing music okay once you started getting out there the piracy of stealing most people and I don't steal fucking music okay some people do but I was like I'm an artist I'm about to come out with my one-hour special I'm like I don't want people stealing them it'd be nice if they paid for it I guess I feel guilty I feel guilty because I listen to some somebody a great song and all the effort that went into it I don't want to see that and actually most people most people don't steal music most people go to iTunes except my age is 12 to 25 because they have no money yeah yeah sure but even that man even then if you look at the statistics even then listen shitty I'm a shitty business person because I don't think about business I try to think about it I want to think about business as little as possible and if anybody has ever said to me like hey if I could get you your DVD on torrent or I could should buy it should I buy it I'm like you know what man you should do whatever feels right to you that's what you should do okay if you don't want to pay for it don't pay for it if you feel like it's okay to take it just go ahead I mean it's not look I'm gonna I'm gonna put stuff out there and I'm gonna put it out there with the honest intention of trying to entertain people I'm gonna say this is what the fee is and if you pay it you pay it you know what Louie CK did is the perfect thing where you've released it himself total direct connection between the artist put it out for 5 bucks which is awesome you know it's a perfect price and you know what I think that's the future I'm talking about Exodus I download it for $7 but even Louis they pirated his thing even though he said you know he asked people not to steal it don't put it up on torrents with your boat but they're always going to it but you know what man some people don't have 5 bucks ok and I know it sounds stupid but this is my point you if you're in less you're starving because of all this you can't fix hate on it the correct thing to fix a Thomas get out your point of view and you know I look I've been in a position before what I was broke and unfortunately for me there was no internet at the time you know I didn't have the opportunity to just download music but of course I would have when I had no money I mean would I be like you know I would love to listen to this you know what I would say I'm gonna buy this fucking thing someday when I have some money but right now I'm gonna download the shit out anyway they're still making money yeah they're not starving and by the way it's beautiful that all that shit gets out there I want everybody to download every fuckin Led Zeppelin album that's ever made and if it's you know a dollar that you can't afford to get fuckin a whole lot of love go find it somewhere man but you loose it listen to it on YouTube just like things you can take where you can take a song off YouTube they'll convert it into an mp3 for you now credit card companies have it's said even sealing know the credit card companies will always have what they factor in a certain fraud quotient in your business plan right so and I think it's almost oh it's really interesting because actually like two point two or something that's almost always the same percentage two point two percent of the population is gonna defraud you and you're gonna lose money and they just factor that in that's amazing that's the same percentage that you were talking about earlier with double your money back guarantee you know with the alpha brain supplement yeah if you did do that I bet you're right I better be the same - yes no it's just - yeah so out of a hundred suck maybe that's the number maybe that is the knower because I've always said it's like fifty percent well they say it's I don't it's like sociopaths right one in a hundred people is a sociopath or something crazy something that you like that yeah that's that's a disturbing figure man 100 people doesn't care if you're fucked up or not one in a hundred people just have no feeling s cares for other people's cares stick and rods in their asshole and well those are very very likely revolvers and sex sex slash by the way now that I just remember it you mean you were talking about that guy who got fucked to death by the horse he might have been one of those he had piercings all over his balls there you go there you go you fucking nailed it I totally forgot about that yeah the guy had like a memory he had a gang of piercings if you're doing extreme things like that you've lost the ability to feel and you've gotta think about you got a jacket for me the flashlight is fantastic get it on Joe Rogan isn't it crazy with that recent arson is here in Los Angeles say that it doesn't happen more often that that but like that one out of a hundred just doesn't start fucking I mean I guess it does in some ways but not to that extent know what the reality is what Brian was talking about earlier is that Brian Cowen was talking about earlier is that this is a pretty good time to live you know we could fix it on the negative shit this is a pretty good time to live and it's 2012 you know this big change that everyone's gonna look back on you know like the the idea that the Mayans were correct and the time wave zero novelty Theory aware of what that is time wave zero novelty theory was a mathematic algorithm created by Terence Mckenna the great psychedelic bard and author and botanist and he went on a mushroom trip in the jungle and came up with this idea they they each in because he had studied the II Ching and he came up with this idea that the II Ching was a map of time and then he was going to construct a mathematic algorithm based on the II Ching that would literally track progress and human innovation that you could track it like a wave that it was a mathematical program yeah that's how high hey dot how about that and people sit around and think about the fucking they have original thoughts they're so in a game and it came to a point of what he called ultimate novelty which means something novelty meaning innovation novelty being some new thing that had not existed before or some new branch of some new thing and that a period of a point of ultimate novelty will be achieved December 21st 2012 now here's what's fucked up about that that is the exact same day to the day as the end of the Mayan calendar so he came up independently on his own with this crazy mathematical algorithm that I don't even know if it's real it sounds ridiculous but if you believe the guy he says that he did not know the end of the Mayan calendar until much later that he had been working on this mathematical program for like thirty years bringing in mathematicians to work on it and apparently there's some debate over whether or not he had fudged numbers or I don't I'm Way too dumb when it comes to math to understand any of it but the idea has always fascinated me of even if it's on a date 20 December 24 2012 universe on a date but the idea of it the idea that it's inevitable that all you really must have it's gonna happen and if you look at how fast shit has happened to get to the point where at today and just a few hundred three hundred four and a five million years ago the way we were living is just unrecognizable the hard surfaces on the road things flying in the sky and the light worthless didn't you even now you know his name because he made up this whole bullshit you know like he knew the Mayan calendar from the whole time you know what I mean what the guy that you're saying that either he knew about it or he didn't know about it well no they hadn't even know he actually knew about be sure he actually had come up with it uh I'm pretty sure it's been proven that he had either come up with it before they had deciphered the Mayan calendar or it was that he definitely hadn't studied it it wasn't mainstream news enough it was it was enough there I would give him the benefit of the doubt and plus the dude was like super honest like if you listen to Terence Mckenna lectures really fascinating individual had a God interesting fascinating things to say but brilliant brilliant guy doesn't matter easiest math here is kill me but he's on a math theorist see that's the crazy thing is that he wasn't he just had this crazy idea that came to him on mushrooms and this is the most ridiculous aspect of it was he asked the mushrooms why me why are you giving it to me and they said because out of the you know thousands of years that we've been in this field no one's ever come up to us who had the e ching in their head before so what it was was to him was he happened to be in a place where he had studied some incredibly ancient Chinese divination system it's a real mystery with the e Cheng is because it's a method of like fortune-telling and it seems to be like incredibly effective like statistically numerically effective it's really weird like people try to figure out what it is about the e Ching but it works more than it doesn't work and what does that even mean I don't know I don't understand it but it's based on hexagrams it's based on these patterns and mechanic coming into this field eating these mushrooms tripping his fucking balls out had this ridiculous idea that what the eating really was with the Chinese at some point in history we wait a long fucking time ago had figured out a map of time well you know like like the guy won it feels metal right when he figured the answer out there was an equation the Russian dude yeah they don't even know so the code is just the equation just the question was already theoretical right there right the question is what if it may not be a question but let's just say it is a question when man and mathematicians have been contemplating the answer for the past 200 years the god comes out the answer and the answer I think was I think was like 357 pages long but the funny thing about that is that at the end of the three on fifty pages all the great mathematicians went gift guy he got it he fucking theok I missed that dammit he bigger than that like think about your mindset what you see you were able to read the answer that was 307 days long ago ah fuck and as a group the group of great mathematicians that award the medal go motherfucker for one person that is an incredible achievement right and you know what the answer is it but also the fact that you can prove mathematically the answer is right that's pretty cool that's pretty cool right I mean ya know whether you but I want to be real clear that I'm not supporting this McKenna Theory fucking believe or anything I am absolutely not but much money did your and my husband 12 he's dead Brian I haven't like how much do you think I don't know hate after that I don't know well one of the main you know you can look it that way but I think he made a lot more money off of lectures on psychedelics than he ever did on this time wave zero thing when you look at the fact that guy worked on it for over thirty years it seems to be some weird labor of love and obsession that he had I don't know if it's correct I don't know if it makes any sense at all I don't know if it's total horseshit I just think it's fascinating that a person would spend so much time making a correlation between the each hang and a thirteen cycle 28-day lunar calendar that is apparently it's like more accurate than the calendar that we employ today and that you could use the II Ching as a calendar and the each English somehow another some map of waves and that that novelty and and and positive things it comes in it never it's never a steady rise to the top with technology and we've talked about this before we're probably going to live if you live long enough for the next thirty years we're probably gonna live through things that are going to take our entire paradigm of reality and what we see is reality and certainly the world we live in and and and destroy the the entire the boundaries is all the boundaries yeah yeah it's I mean it's we'll have to reinvent what I think that the questions of being a human being will always remain I think there are questions that we ask ourselves as human beings what is fulfillment who am i what am I doing here none of the questions that those are questions that you can't that's a responsibility you can't run away from it's why I love like sonic odd those guys cuz you read those fuckers and that these dudes were cetera I'm thinking 25 30 500 years ago and they came up with questions that will you still have to answer and most of us most when you read that shit do you go you go you used what happens to you as you go oh I'm living in a fucking I'm living in a glass house or a box of cards like most of my belief system most of how I live my life a lot of times you know when you read it you go there's not a lot of scaffolding for that there's not a lot of you know there's not a lot of like I can't really justify it along true moral or truthful terms and that's what Socrates and Seneca would do he would just ask you questions like that there's really interesting you know you kind of you gotta that's why reading the dialogues is such a mindfuck because all it is is just a series of questions and you go fuck well I believe this and I have some standing and now you're asking me a question I don't really have the answer to I was listening to this talk about the Library of Alexandria and how it was burned down not once but twice once by followers of the Koran and they you know they apparently they looked at it Muslim yeah the Muslim said that apparently they looked at and said anything here that disputes the Quran is heretic anything that supports the Koran is unnecessary burn the whole fucking thing down it's like a billion volumes and it was essentially the same people that built the goddamn fucking pyramids you know I mean what kind of information was lost I mean how like when you talk about the e Ching you from a can't forget about whether or not it's really a map of time and I make but but when it what is it it is really obviously something incredibly complicated you know and there's this series of hexagrams and the there's obviously something to it it's not a random thing there's something studied about it as a book called how the Irish saved civilization have you heard of it no yeah by Kaplan is I think his name's company is great wait mister I never a couple of his books and well D when during the Dark Ages after when when Alexander was burned down and and a lot of a lot of during the Crusades the Christian Crusades and also during during the the when the Ottoman Empire came in took over and things a lot of this knowledge was lost but the people that actually were the only be like a right back then in Europe were primarily the Irish the Irish clergy the priests and they would write down they they would they they copied these books they were painstakingly copied Eliza books and carried them around with them and then carry them in their oral traditions as well and so a lot of that information like like the Greeks and all the things that we base our political system on was carried through at least in the thesis of this book was carried through by these by these Irish scribes by this Irish by the Irish clergy who during the Dark Ages kept a tradition of this alive in books and kept their own libraries hidden this is amazing when you look back at like really really ancient academics like you know when when people would go to Egypt and a lot of the Greeks would travel to Egypt to study you know that there was at one point time there was obviously some gigantic pool of information there was a much more advanced aside and then we give credit to that's for sure that's amazing isn't it some asshole Barnes it all down they lost everything yeah but but it's it's probably more advanced today when you assume yes in many ways because we are privy to more information because we are becoming you know it's like I would liken it to how how martial arts has changed exponentially because everybody is sharing information I agree with you 100% until we start talking about the pyramids and then I just go we'll explain that head-to-head as they do there I go that's a matter now - at least 2500 BC maybe even early insane that that's a good point - most amazing physical accomplishment that human beings have ever done in the industrial [Music] time because that would never be that would nobody would ever do that today and the reason that's not shame then did you hear about that guy that got arrested in Italy because they thought that he was building some sort of a military thing and they were gonna they were gonna storm his house with guns until he let them in he had a modest home in the countryside and then inside his house was a giant fucking construction that went into the hills in the mountains it was a beautiful cathedral incredible artwork I mean this place was massive and stunning and stunning that's right it was him and just a few friends and they summer I know they've been working on this for twenty thirty years that's and everybody was like what is this a Razzie asshole doing digging a hole dude you have to look at it because it's it is art for the sake of art he didn't want anyone to know about it he and it's beautifully as rooms that are like Egyptian rooms with like hieroglyphs and and yes it's online just look up Italian home mountains look up Navajo and would you call it artwork would you call it a cathedral temple temple Italian home temple well what I mean is that the craft of stone making an end when when one when when they take a tapestry and two generations of artists would work on it so you one generation you'd work on it for his lifetime then dying in the next generation then that day his apprentice would come and finish it and all those things when you look at st. Peter's Cathedral that was a so that was a group of people they were so divinely inspired the notion that they were just making what you said art for for art's sake isn't it Oh mom come over here and let me just real quick come on grand look at this real quick put this down if you look up folks look up eight eighth wonder of the world on the the UK or the mail online stunning temples he really carved out below ground by paranormal eccentric look at these fucking photos man I mean you can't even wrap your head around this shit this is this this guy made this in in a countryside it's insane I mean this guy built all this shit in the countryside man look at this look at the ceiling it's incredible it's you would say that but he did it today yeah this is Risa look at this I mean this is incredible shit look at the floor on this place look at the artwork on the pillar I mean it is some of the most stunning shit and I don't like that stuff like I was over these people's house they're they're very nice folks but they have this ridiculous mural like a painted mural on the wall it's like bad art and look so a boat and shit and fucking so fishermen what do you do is your walk it's a restaurant by my help I just hired their daughter look at this dude Brian well I'm sorry one more take a look at this I want to show this is the hallway that leads into it whoo that they carve that into the mountain yeah the carpet in the mountain yeah it's amazing it folks you got it so the folks that are just listening the artwork on the wall is spectacular the floor the marble on the floor is just immaculate it's amazing and look at this is the outside of the house yep just a regular house just a weird regular house yup and they were they were moving so much dirt out of there that everybody was like and they did it for a long-ass fucking time they occupy 300,000 cubic feet that's an act of faith you know that's an active think of this Big Ben the clock is 15,000 cubic feet under this guy's house he had 300,000 cubic feet think of how big this fucking thing is that this guy built inside the countryside underneath his house that's incredible it's amazing 57 year old former insurance broker from northern Italy who inspired by a childhood vision began digging into the rock there it is it all began this 60s when he was 10 god damn yeah there's some motherfuckers out there dude I mean that why isn't this a movie but look at me go Micajah went blind from painting the Sistine Chapel oh yeah by the way I credit my credited Leonardo da Vinci with that the other day we were super high me and Everlast we're talking so folks folks corrected man Twitter thank you very much I appreciate it for some reason when I get high I forget that Leonardo da Vinci and banks key their contemporaries though yes they were but I forget that they're you know I forget that the Michelangelo was a different guy yes you know leaders Vinci and Michelangelo my stupid head I like one person now in fact if you read the agony and the ecstasy by Irving stone but short kind of skinny with a pug nose and that the Vinci was a stud he's a stud beginning and da Vinci did da Vinci was the one who was the real inventor - Michelangelo was a badass artist but da Vinci was a convention in space planes and shit that's right yeah well what a freak show that guy in the Sistine fucking chaplain went blind each good sub one the greatest thing the greatest fuckin the greatest line for Michelangelo when he when he and to define what you are as a person in art was when he looked at the fucking at this huge piece of marble and he's about to carve the Statue of David and his girlfriend at the time is one love said to him what how are you gonna do this and he said it's already in there I just have to get all the stuff out of the way and it's a great metaphor for art or a human being like you start a piece of shit and if you can delete enough stuff you you can you know just through hard work and carving and stuff you can become a better person it's so important that people do things and that you do things and other people enjoy correct action is huge whatever it is whether you're a fucking a Datsun repairman and you're like all Frank you're the best and failure is more important yes that's to become a better person it's impassive yeah good fighters but but what I'm saying is like doing something that people enjoy really is like the fucking key to happiness in life is like doing something that makes other people happy in some way it really is the key to happiness in life it's one that so few people ever figure out and that's one of the reasons why people are so fucked up is because so many people have this selfish it's all about me attitude and you don't understand that you will never be happy not only that you won't be prosperous either you won't be because you are a part of a gigantic system and you are in a symbiotic relationship with every human being that you come in contact with so when you fuck them over you fuck up your whole system you spread out negative energy you put out bad ripples and it comes back nice enough you see it with fighters sometimes you see fighters start come in with like a lot of guys who are real angry in there and they come from broken homes and they're just fucking sour guys do they learn and they learn and to get better they have to confront that anger and they have to learn to control it and a lot of times by the time they're done they come out of it really well adjusted just when the best guys the best of the best are martial artists you know Anderson Silva he's a martial artist you know he's a martial George st. Pierre's and martial artists no doubt about it he is a hundred percent martial artist in the way he behaves around people the way he conducts himself he conducts himself as an exemplary member of society who can fuck you up that's what he does you never get the feel hanging out with George that he can kick your ass yeah you never get the feeling of course he can you know he can suck a lot you know psychologically realistically you know you can kick your ass but you never feel that around him because he's always so humble and so friendly and so nice we were talking about that you know some people have very a lot of trouble managing success it's a character issue it's whether or not you accept bullshit lies or you know whether or not you look at yourself realistically and get better and stay on top you've got to confront that in your everything all day every day and you have to have a completely open mind that's why a lot of fighters choke or they freeze up and stuff and it's just human yeah you've got to be able to assess your objectivity your your objective strengths and weaknesses at a moment's notice and you've got to be able to do it completely accurately you can't be burdened down by some ego that has you convinced that you're right and you're doing it together and avoid all the oh you also have to be doing it to some extent to to achieve in it's it's a fine line because you don't want to do things for other people you're doing it to surprise yourself but your motivation has to be pure because if your motivation is not you will pay a price for it sure right you do what you do it for art man you know when I don't this is how I approach everything I write okay I you know I say well you know I really got to get together and fucking do some writing today I'm don't be ladies bitch and then I sit down and I start writing and I never say okay here I'm gonna write things for people I'm gonna write I got a whatever it is I got a conduit up I gotta let that bitch I'm trying to be funny I just try to write what I think is interesting well that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed writing blogs before I started writing my book I saw I was writing a lot of blogs and they're still all up at Joe Rogan dotnet somewhere you could find them we need to make that shit easier to do on its butt though yeah cuz the blogs and the videos are all together in the same pile yeah I think it's other shags you have blog you have it as a blog or most people don't even know what a tag is dude most people just want something real clean and click on here's the shit you wrote click well I get that done eventually but my point is that I would never write anything on purpose trying to be funny I would just sit down and just look man the world is funny this is just stupid shit that's going on all day every day if you can't see some funny in the world but it's also that's some funny especially when you're writing blogs it's always balanced out with the shit that's not funny that makes the funny stuff even funnier it's like it's it's gotta be whatever the fuck is coming out of there and then I just extract the jokes from that this stuff that's actually funny I extract it from that the ironic point you always looked at your comedies to me has always been you know I've always been I've always been more absurd but you you look at the truth of situations and then you just fucking you just you carve it out and shine a light on it I try to put a lot of observe in there as well yes I found out along the way that first of all not being observed can be a trap you know take it seriously yeah I don't want you to take me seriously man I don't have time for that okay so please don't you know but that that becomes a trap and I've seen some comics fall into it especially when they develop a following you know they have this this group of people that don't fuckin listen you're following yeah cuz you start getting you start believing the hype you get older and people like I go yes but yes but appreciate it yeah but it's a responsibility it's a resource it's a responsibility they're your friends out there Lawrence you just gotta respect it just don't let it don't ya find you because then you will start trying to be a certain way they think it's all about when it happens to you that you develop a following anyway media fellow develop following when you're 17 years old and you're on a Disney sitcom and you don't really understand yourself or do you develop yourself when you're you know when you're 30 and then our smarts example back in the day when your teacher would taught you martial arts tea at a karate teacher he was the master he would never fight his sparring days were over he's too deadly to spar with millions are like they're your teacher they fucking roll with you every fucking day yeah that's the difference between you know got real fighters and guys who are well now the real issue is striking versus jujitsu you know because you can't do that every day with striking it's just too difficult I mean if you if you have a great group of people where you you guarantee you know a man let's just go light you know and you really do not try to kill each other that's awesome but that's not normal I'm almost like the gentleman that we were talking about earlier today the very successful gentleman we won't mention his name who doesn't know how to spar he just tries to kill guys in the gym and you know they tell him listen man you're not gonna get any fucking I'm partners you're too crazy yeah you know and that's that that's a guy that's he's missing the whole point yeah and you know you missed the whole camaraderie of being a teammate with someone part of it you you know you build each other up you know you you know you you could hit your teammate but you don't that's what I think that it's like an extension of you those guys those teams team they just they become close super close yeah cuz they're sittin bleeding and bunion dying together exactly and they can trust each other when they're sparring that's really important man you know even though you support hard it's nothing I mean dudes are getting hit no doubt about look you don't get as good at boxing as Nate Diaz does unless you've got a guy like that Melendez in your camp you know I'm saying like these guys are going at each other all the time and they're doing it the right way and they're both getting good as fuck and same thing with Nick you know you know he's so goddamn good and you know what Nick is doing he's constantly boxing with Andre Ward he boxes with Andre waters Olympic gold medalist and wears a hell of a brilliant brilliant boxer and that guy never gets hurt so he boxes yes nice not matter Nick Diaz his professional boxing level he is yes first of all he's a super athlete he can put a pace on those dudes they can't handle he's easy for me he's my favorite he's a super endurance athlete I mean look at him he's obviously in great shape I mean it's not it's not that but what you don't understand is his cardio is like double whether normal humans is like literally double so weird yeah and because he has them and that's a weapon he can use that weapon because most guys aren't willing to work that hard though he does triathlons all the time man he'd fucking swam back from Alcatraz twice price in the fucking yeah in the shark-infested water I mean the reason why they put Alcatraz there they will put a prison who the fuck's gonna swim that they thought it couldn't be done and this crazy assholes a cage fighter has done it twice just for the fuck of it n that's not even when he does he's not like an ultra endurance swimmer in the ocean no he's a cage fighter but his mind is so strong because of that because he has so much fuckin endurance he can just take on his mate if he gotta say something if every round was like a 20-minute round you could never beat Nick Diaz you could never beat him because after 15 minutes you'd be half in and pomp you'd be waiting for that stool and he'd be like what bitch you'll be still pop pop pop any with those 50% fuck k does you know why cuz he's smart cuz that's a psychological war that's going on right there and if you can get a guy frosted and call him a bitch and get up in his face and get him thinking about your emotions that's the intelligent thing to do if you were an intelligent fighter he would add that I know it's beautiful to be a George st. Pierre and to you know to bow like you're a martial artist and it's never be talking shit in the middle of a fight do it completely respectfully and he gets it done masterfully but in my opinion I like watching a guy like Nick Diaz get in there go hot bitch what bitch what you gonna bitch well I'm a bitch moving his head he's all whores moon his head moving his move his head back into a talking mad shit to truly hate does until he fights him and then he's cool with them you know he'll have to be knocked out Frank Shamrock could get he goes come on man get up you're a legend and he helped him help them up pick them up his hand and walk he has same thing made his brother Nate after he beat up Cerrone this weekend you know he said you know this man it's all good you know it's just hype and bullshit and they hugged and it was cool you know and Cerrone gave it up to him period who's a better fighter that's it no excuses he kicked my ass and they just let it go it's beautiful you know I like that I like when dudes can let it go but it's a smart thing to get guys upset you yeah but they're punching I bet it seems it's brilliant it's like they're punching it looks like he's moving in slow motion listen he's not trying to hurt you yeah oh you know why because don't throw your punches at a hundred percent throw your punches at fifteen they don't land 82 percent of them they still hurt and he wasn't even throwing him at 80 percent I mean I would say I would say baby like he would threw a lot of punches that were around 50 percent of his full power what he could really if you really wanted to haul off and blast you in the face he could knock people the fuck out but him and his brother figured out this really effective style of like volume technical that's a really good question and I would be out of school if I said that but I don't think so they have a boxing coach there's a Mexican gentleman that's in the ring with them all the time I should credit him because I need to find makes me it makes me want to go become a like I'll never it's over for me but if he's you just see those guys they make it look so easy there's their submission game they're fucking punching me I love those games they're so fun man you know Nick Diaz it's just I love his not oh sorry sorry Richard Perez Richard Perez I should have known he's one of those guys that I his name's at the tip of my tongue but they've been with him for a long time he said every one of their fights and he's their boxing coach and he always you know they always credit Richard Perez afterwards and you know what he's got them so slick their head movement their counters their angles man dude don't we fight that I mean how much how many how many they practice boxing every day oh yeah they're boxing a lot mean they're very boxing centered and why not be because look first of all everyone knows that jiu-jitsu is nasty so you don't really want to take him down necessarily and wind up in their guard Nate Diaz fucks guys up from his guard and so does Nick they both catch guys so what are you gonna do you know you have to stand up with them if you want to stand up with them they're both long and they both through all these volume punches and those tap tap tap tap tap but that pap-pap and they're so fucking accurate man so what he broke the Compu strike record Nate Diaz what happens to only four it happens I think was 82% I believe it was that's nuts man that's nuts dude he boxed him up man he was his boxing was brilliant and in the last two fights and the Takanori Gomi fight and in this fight he just turned this crazy corner and I think it came out of the loss to Rory MacDonald that Rory MacDonald kid is a fucking beast you know that the young man from Canada you know yes Rory MacDonald he's he's only had a few UFC fights he had a real close fight with Carlos Condit and he got stopped in the third round but he was winning the first two rounds and really a quick demolition of Mike Pyle I was like really blown away by that I did I expect it Mike Pyle is gonna be very difficult for him and he caught him early and you know you catch any boxer no he's a full-on MMA fighter but he's a young kid he's been training MMA only for his whole life in the beginning to end well Nate had a fight with him and Nate lost the decision didn't get hurt he never got beat up he got thrown around a little bit the guy took him down a few times like suplex and stuff but you know and one of the things about the Diaz brothers they're amazing defense you know they're they're always they're so used to fighting against brutal guys in training that they're really good at surviving you know and so he realized that he probably should be at 155 pounds it was like a better wake 1/7 he was fighting 170 and he's even build-up to get there he didn't go up to like 185 190 and then cut his way down he was you know who's essentially you know weighing in like much much closer to the 55 pound women but the last two fights he had at lightweight was Takanori Gomi and this last one against Cerrone and both of them was just answering oh no he's a beast you know I think what happened was I think you know Nate got pissed off and himself after that that fight with Roy McDonald and he said you know what fuck I'm kicking it up a notch and decided you know 155 was where I was supposed to be and they're just really wow it's beautiful it's a beautiful man it's this is war man it's psychological war you know like show up but every three point contest and go who's coming in second that's it you know you're gonna think about Larry Bird when you're fucking shooting that shot now because you can't be in the zone cuz no one no one's fucked with you and you could have your own positive thoughts no you got Larry Bird's freckly little white ass cracker face going who's coming inside you know you know I said to me when I saw him getting the thing I went that guy's not tired he's not tired no he doesn't get tired he's just like his brother and they they go on you know they do some fucking extreme endurance work man and they keep their conditioning at a really high level and if you do that you could put a pace on a dude they can't fuck with and then on top of that if you have really good striking you know then it's like man you getting striking like that is so difficult that takes four cities and balls you have to have balls you have to go in there with guys who can take your fucking face yeah and you get hit and hurt you got to learn defense you got to learn how to roll with punches you gotta you got to learn who not to spar with or some dudes it's not worth it some days you could sperm every now and then like especially if you're feeling fresh or something yeah Hugh box with just strict boxers like Andre Ward you start to try to fight him just as a boxer you know MMA guys a lot of different though a lot of guys especially in the early days of MMA like I've had like long conversations with dude about this dudes about this who's you know started out in like the early 90s they didn't know any better and they would just go full blast in the gym all the time and then somewhere along the line people started telling them like hey man you shouldn't do this like you guys should be sparring with technique and this is how you do that and this is how you save yourself for the yeah because nobody's ever using the jab yeah exactly everybody was like haymaker central and then you get in there that's one of the reasons why GOG Anderson shines you know you get in there with a guy like Anderson like Chris Leben just charged out I'm just went to try to maul him which was you know if you're gonna give him a good strategy which is a good strategy to stay on the outside I let him pick you apart or you chase that motherfucker down I would've told Chris to do the same thing he just wasn't ready for that level yet yeah in that technical level that Anderson is achieved you know he has all the techniques he doesn't have just haymakers he came from uh-oh technical muy Thai background you know so his technique is beautiful I was watching a Thiago Alves down on American Top Team he trained with him right yeah trained with that his best friend I guess and coach Muay Thai coach who's a stud himself just like this real good-looking dude who's like and and and I got I was I was so it was so exciting because Tiago was is a big Death Valley fan so he came up to me he's like this is a show that you're on for me yes is I did that I'm a huge fan you may you crack me up is so funny and terrible accident not at all but he's so funny I get such a laugh we he took me around and we had a blast but he gave me a private more Thai class and then and then he roll with me in jujitsu and if you ever want to feel like a hen wolf that's that's it was ridiculous he's so strong he kicked the bag at one point just lightly I was hold men who show me around the house like a low kick it the power is retarded with that guy you know the beautiful thing about him is when he throws things he doesn't everything is like tight and tuck oh he's he's got some of the best defense as far as like MMA strikers he's got some of the best he you know it is man he's I can tell and I spend enough time with him he's fucking smart yeah that guy's yeah he's doing everything very technical art as matured a lot he's 28 now and he was just very open about what what a what a crazy fucker he was when he's younger spending money going crazy did you see his last fight against papaya bitty no I tore the guy who's beautiful was beautiful because this guy's are a monster man this pappi I bet he looks like the last guy you'd ever want to fight you look at him he's just ridiculously shredded he's a judo black belt he can strike he's like a very similar to no no no the Bellator to lombard very similar to that Bellator champion Hector Lombard really similar just build and ridiculous power punches really fast and Tiago just stayed in the pocket man just caught him with a little shot a little shot leg kicks and the dude was swinging at Tiago man that dude was a scary guy but it was a beautiful display of technique and patience and being a veteran and overcoming yeah he's had six I've seen yeah and that pappi a better guy I feel like he could beat anybody I feel like if he just if you fuck up and let that got punch you in the face like if somehow or another you Zig when you should have zagged you get caught which happens to guys well you saw the Jon Fitch fight this weekend yeah got knocked out with one punch well you know there's a follow-up punch but essentially the one punch was the one that really did it yeah Johny Hendricks caught him and he tried to come back from it you know he tried to well with those with those little gloves your margin for error really Slim's down yeah and that's where that's where learning technique and if you look at boxers when they teach you you're spending more time avoiding than throwing punches anything throw hands but but moving out of the way and then and then hitting or just being able to slip punches that tell this there's a lack of like real high-level technical boxing and a lot of a lot of areas take forever takes forever and it's really hard to learn everything yeah it's one of the reasons why a lot of people think you should be awesome at one thing before you ever get into MMA because you you know it's like the Rory McDonald's of the world are very rare and this is this young kid who's starting out he's got great wrestling his wrestling is out stands kickboxing is nasty is Jiu Jitsu solid as fuck he's really got no weaknesses but you know he's one of those 22 year old kids that can actually about this yeah came up with it from from the get-go you know for the most part most guys that came out with one discipline or another and the the best thing they could hope for was to be really good at something but they're really good at wrestling so they take God down are really good at striking you just learn how to sprawl like Mirko Cro Cop and he never really became anything other than a striker he has a couple submission victories yeah they're mostly after he except the Randleman fight mostly after he was fucking a guy up well the the question is can anybody beat Jon bones Jones and does he got a heavy weight sure anybody you know what nobody ever expected that Jon bones Jones was ever gonna exist you know before he existed nobody would have suspected that some really young kid could come in here who was a excellent amateur wrestler with you know a few years of karate and Taekwondo or something under his belt and maybe not even a few years I should say like you know months of it but just you know practice some kicks and you had to do and then you get him with some ace trainers like Mike Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson and they mold this kid into some fucking prodigy I would I would have never said that could have happened before that some kid could have been in the game only like three years and just dominate guys like Shogun dominate guys like Machida you know he put Machida to sleep with a standing guillotine once last time anybody put on the high-level champion to sleep with a standing you know buddy and then dropped him like it was mortal kombat like he just beheaded him and shit it was like fatality he's you know what he is man he is the king of the new-school that's what he is John Jones is the king of the new-school there's no one who can fuck with him what about was new guys there's a level there's a high level there's a higher level than has ever existed before and John Jones is a peak it that way yes it's jr. Toussaint but no but there's another way of coming and another way of coming as those Rory MacDonald dudes you know and John Jones started out as a wrestler and learned all that striking and slowly become better at striking Rory MacDonald is great at everything he's great at everything his fucking head movement is nasty his striking is clean his technique is perfect you got knockout power it's fucking 22 years old a smart he's a little savage those guys are coming up and there's there's a 14 year old right now that'll probably fuck him up and now the guy that is hitting pads in Vegas right now you ever see those two little kids yeah the little mohawk gets do those young kids can do everything and what they're like little kids I don't know how they old but they're super dedicated they love the sport you know and they get a lot of attention so they do it a lot and their parents love it and come on man that those kind of guys that's the next wave so as crazy as hoist Gracie was in 1993 John Jones is in 2012 and as crazy as Alistair Overeem is in 2012 you're gonna have some new dude that's gonna be 10 years from now or whatever and he's gonna have some mad distance between them well there's it'll be a it'll be a sport as itself because right now it's a sport that's piecemealed from a bunch of other different sports with no clear formula that's right eventually they're gonna get a pretty clear formula eventually there's gonna be there's gonna be it seems MMA as a as its own fighting system is gonna it's gonna sole it a most likely you know most likely boxing like yeah but part of the fun is the ebb and flow and the battle while it's happening all sudden karate is what everybody needs to know nobody could touch Machida oh shit who would've ever thought it was karate after all these years if he just halves the sprawling then it's karate and then you know a guy like John Jones comes around like oh no no it's length its distance and intelligence and a wrestling background that's what's important and the willingness to believe in yourself and just throw a wild shit and the fact that nobody can hit you cuz you're a mile away from the heavy connects other what about what about him and Junior dos Santos will they fight maybe eventually I think John Jones was somewhat Sunday be a heavyweight because he's so young I think he's only 24 let's see what weight does he walk around that that's a good question you know I should ask him I think he's above 215 220 I think he gets pretty heavy and then he drops the weight you know and eats healthy and I think he's got a big family and I think it's he's got big you know he's young kid he's gonna fill out I think one professional I think you be amazing as a heavyweight - he's big enough he's got skinny legs yeah and those could get bigger and by the way he'd be even more ridiculous then could you imagine if all sudden he had super legs underneath them we did a fucking squats deadlifts just triangle everyone speed did you imagine that of those and his triangle in people I mean he can do anything that's he's a guy he shouldn't I believe he's six for a believer really tall he's really tall but his reach is what's ridiculous yeah but we pull that up Brian find out how tall John John and by the way what is Anderson Silva Ozzy I think you 6 - that'd be it maybe six like to see that fight yeah but you know the the issue is a wrestling issue you know I mean he's Anderson yeah Anderson is like he's a amazing amazing fighter but when you're taking out a guy who's physically much bigger than you right Anderson is will we ask any or these two how tall he is six foot four yeah he's got a six foot four but he has a reach that's bigger than some 7-foot tall people he's got a crazy reach yeah I mean I just said that and that's real his Reach is the longest of anyone in the UFC including Semmy Schilt who used to fight for the UFC so his ability to touch you with his hands is like right up there with Stefan Struve Stefan skyscrapers true has a I believe he has a shorter wingspan than John Jones does so he's just got he's got everything going for him he's got intelligence he's got confidence he's he's got the the courage to get in there and fucking Throwdown against the best fighters in the world even though he's only been doing it for three years and he's got the athleticism to pull it off and he listens to everything and like you listened Dilek interviews with him the dude is on YouTube all the time like watching wrestling matches and learning moves and putting them in his head he's a fucking he's loving that he's the best yeah I'll tell me that that Anderson's I said what Sampson like he said he's a martial arts nerd he loves martial arts like watches stuff both guys well you don't get as good as Andersen unless you're completely obsessed with it yeah you know there's the story of Anderson's fight with Tony fricking do you know that story Andersen fought Tony frickle and he had this crazy upward elbow that he wanted to try like some shitty song and on Bach movie and his coaches were like we get the fuck out of here with his elbow like he kept practicing this really nutty elbow that like would never come up it was like a kung fu move you know it was looks like some stuff that you saw in a movie that you would never see in an MMA fight where you know it's much more dangerous but um he made his wife hold the pillow for him and he would practice this upward elbow it made his wife like hold pads and he would practice this shit over and over again he had to do it away from his coaches and so then he was like in in the the actual kg like told his fucking coach I'm gonna do that up with L by the way we shot the fuck up and get out of there with this crazy upward elbow and blam he catches frickin with his upward elbow and puts him to sleep not just put him asleep but stiff-armed him he went down like stiff legs stiff arm nothing was working and he blast him with an elbow and then Anderson just walks away like he's a ninja it was the most ridiculous shit ever but that's what it is he like he learned a technique that was outside of his discipline he's just such a bad motherfucker what he's got is just like John Jones he's very intelligent and his timing is amazing and his confidence intelligence finding confidence and character and with Anderson - Anderson is a guy who's been proven I mean John Jones has never been in a fight where he got dominated for four rounds and then pulled it off in the fifth you know there's there's something invaluable about what Anderson has accomplished and what Anderson showed in that she'll summon fight was that he's not just the hammer that you know he can he can take it dude you can't break him useless face yeah yeah he's looking for he's looking for a way to win man if you slip he's gonna find it and guess what yeah he's only done minute to go but yeah I mean he just did what he had to do and once I'm in there injured you know oh yeah added a yellow ribbon he looks just out of it well that's why he let him take him down you know I was like you know I could stand up with this guy or I could just fucking really fight off this I'll fight to take out yeah if you can't take him down but just something that's the best double in this sport his running charging double dude he just takes motherfuckers down even if Anderson was like fully healthy I don't know if he could stop that guy from taking him down a lot of people don't know see there the thing about Chael Sonnen dude is Chael Sonnen one who's right and right now he's right he's one of the best on the planet dude that wrestling is insane his top position but his boxing is fucking good when he caught Anderson with that straight left and wobbled him look I don't give a fuck what you say that's got to put some thoughts into a guy's head you got to go charges at you throws fucking clean crisp punch can take a shot and his wrestling's ridiculous and now after the Brian Stann fight oh he's strangling people too now he started submitting people Jesus Christ and you got a choke you want to talk about a guy talking shit fucking with your head greatest he's the best every grain of white said he's the best since Muhammad Ali I you know Muhammad Ali was in a different world cuz he was he had a different flavor to him was like a ridiculousness - yeah which jail sort of has a little bit of a ridiculous to him but goddamn that - it's funny he's hilarious and he's so prolific he's always coming up with new ridiculous shit you say no comic yeah I wish they didn't hate him so much of Brazil cuz he said a lot of crazy shit I know I know I know I know and you know what he problem him whatever I shouldn't say probably shouldn't on that but now he can you know if he went there I mean it would probably suck for him everywhere he goes people be screaming and yelling at him if he was balls and a ballsy enough to actually they're gonna fight is he gonna find out who knows he says no he said that he's got an announcement and he said my next move after Mark Munoz what he said was I don't know but if I was George st. Pierre or John Jones I'd take a real deep gulp right about now Simon said that so he's insinuating that he won't want to fight John Jones or George st. Pierre and yeah go right up yeah he's a hilarious showman and since George just had knee surgery and he had patellar tendon graft knee surgery which is particularly difficult to come back from not difficult but time-consuming because you have a year well you have yeah you you know it's it's a little more I mean every doctor has their own philosophy and doctors have their own specialty but some doctors don't like to do it that way because they believe that it compromises the strength of the patellar tendon and it makes the knee a little bit Wiggly er I have both I had this one done my left knee was done patellar tendon graft my right knee was done with a cadaver and the right knee came out way better maybe it was a better doctor that's very possible but the guy that I did in New York was a top-notch guy that did like New York Knicks and did basketball teams and Shady was supposed to be really good but it took a long time before that knee felt writing again this is what my right knee felt great in like a few months like four or five months my right knee was fine my left knee well they know what the surgery is very different they take a chunk out of your bone and they slice your tendon they take a strip of that tendon and a chunk out of your shin bone so they pull it off intact and one thing and then they open you up and screw that in place and that becomes your new ACL so weird yeah and he tours yeah yeah yeah you Tory he tore training he heard it and then he had a pull out of the Nick Diaz fight or the Carlos Condit fight whichever fight it was at that point I'm believe was Carlos Condit yeah it was Karl Scottie he pulled out of that fight and then I really would have loved to see that Nick Diaz yeah well he kept trying to train I guess and that's really what fucks you up now I have a little back injury this little muscle pole it's where my floating rib head is it's like we're connects to like where your scapula is it's been a fucking pain in my ass for like a couple of months and the reason being because it was hurting me and I said I'll just go and roll light and that's what you do like when you have an injury you have to it's like driving your car with a flat tire like yeah just go slow like you gotta be super smart in combat sports when you have an injury and George hurt his knee he had to pull out the fight and then he tried training again too soon and then he blew it and then it exploded on them you know you know it just lost the ACL that's what happens a lot of time so you have like small you do damage to the knee the knee will be compromised in a week and then you heard it again that's exactly what happened to me in fact on my first knee surgery and for our body that's why it says the Soviets those Soviet coaches as well as guys don't that they the way they get you conditioned for an Olympic condition they make you walk really fast for 15 minutes and every day you have to cover more ground so walking is your aerobic exercise and if you walk speed walk for 15 minutes as fast as you can you'll get in the best shape of your life especially if you do it uphill that's hilarious that's a great idea go get on that fucking way if you get on a treadmill and put it at four miles an hour fifteen percent agrees incline at fifty fifteen the highest incline just try that shit sometime try walking for four miles an hour and for a fir 15 minutes Tim Ferriss had a great article on his website about in intelligence and efficiency over overtraining that's right and how important is to build up real inderal actually do it under train what they found is that Dan Gable and those American wrestlers overtraining yeah what happens is you get injuries later on but they have unstoppable mental stress because of it their ability to dominate competition the ability that they're you know no one has more mental strength in combats than wrestlers there there are another level man I went readiness I went to Dan gamers camp for two weeks I remember and I realizing this this is what it takes to train in college I don't want to fucking be a college wrestler this is just I don't want to get up and sprint for an hour in the morning I was like this is this I was 17 I was like fuck this I did it then I came back my senior year and did pretty fucking well just because I yeah it was one of the reasons why I quit wrestling over Taekwondo when I was in high schools doing wrestling and Taekwondo and wrestling made me so fucking tired I remember have the first day after practice we ran stadium stairs or something like that the first day after practice I couldn't walk I was like walking in the hallways I would have to like stop for a second and like massage my upper thighs and then walk again which is match you guys matches would go over time and next three minutes you thought you were gonna fucking die I'll never forget that that is a young man when you when you wrestle like you know and I wrestle pretty you know it was my support you never let that fear of going walking on that mat against somebody you don't know when you're 14 15 16 17 18 it does change you it really does force yeah I think even any sport and he's just playing basketball anything we have to step up when you're alone for Korean sports when you're alone it's a lonely place on that mat it is definitely I think more troubling or more taxing and more testing of your character yeah and then you go to Iowa to this intensive wrestling cabin if Dan's gable and you're around all these you ready to dedicate every member that writes on wrestling why is that since you don't have a fucking mustache you know yeah it's like when you know one of the first times I ever saw Matt Hughes fight I remember thinking like you know and this back when used to these two let him wear wrestling shoes okay good luck good luck stop good like stop in that shot was wearing wrestling shoes I'm so fuckin job now go tell me he was the strongest guy he'd ever wrestle he said Matt Hughes was the strongest person I'd ever oh I believe it you know Matt Hughes tapped out fuckin Brock Lesnar when they were training together no yeah dude he's a black belt level Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist he just you know what I mean he learned everything from like Jeremy Horn and from MMA classes and you know catch wrestling you knows a lot of wrestling submissions to it the one he put Ricardo Almeida with he put him out remember that Ricardo he got him in that the it was the Schultz headlock and he just fucking cranked it down to the beautiful put him out you know and L made him even know he didn't even know he's in danger he didn't even freak out yeah yeah he's ridiculous so I remember watching when he first started fighting and he have sayings like man these guys are common man I always knew they were a lot around I always knew from my time in wrestling there was always guys that would would go to States and you know watch like the the best guys in the States go out of the division champions so fast and so and just so flexible we had a kid in our we had a kid in our or when I was a sophomore when I was a sophomore in high school we had one kid that was in like national level it's uh who smoked cigarettes too by the way yeah mark calling and he was a great fucking Gallagher really intense passionate dude and I remember one time believe the coach's name was Hurwitz I believe that was it was Hurwitz and the other guy was fuck the Irish fuck I can't remember his name I'll send you but you know he this mark calling guy would have this fucking crazy practice and everybody would be dying in hands on their knees and Colin would run across the fucking room and slide down on his knees and go come on let's go xed and just wanted to wanted to keep wrestling learn and keep going want to keep drilling and the coach pointed out him and he goes there's guys like that in every weight class he goes get you better get that in your head there's guys like that in every weight class and I remember realizing myself you know being 14 years old or whatever I was you know it was either 14 or 15 and I was looking at him when I was going my god like this yeah you got to know you got to know that there's dudes out there that are willing to take it like that yeah they're willing to go that far coach Murphy that was the Irish guy and Murphy was always trying to get me to play football my bitch are you crazy I'm a small person it was a dude on our wrestling team that was also playing football his name was Bob Baker he was 300 fucking pounds in high school and I wrestled 130 for this fucking giant dude somehow no the squash on top of me fuck that man oh my god yeah so afraid I just seen these huge guys run at me I was like I'm so dangerous I made of paper it's such as such a dangerous sport I mean people love it and everything now but charging in the guy's my 14 year old nephew is 185 pounds any six-foot-one any squats 285 4 reps okay's 14 he's a giant Jesus he plays football I watched that I watched him play JV he's only 14 and I watched I watched those kids hit each other and I was like oh nobody's heads built for this I told his dad I go look he's a mom get him out of there get him out of there get him into fighting he plays guitar let him play guitar they don't even know how bad the damage is until these guys die yeah remember that guy that fell off of his back was gross truck he had here an old man's brain yeah he had an old man's like rotten brain it showed like you know all this degeneration 23 or something I think he was 25 but yeah close enough I mean it's insane these guys have been doing running I have a friend who was a lineman and he said back in the day when he was to play in college he they didn't allow you to use your hands so you couldn't push guys you would slam head-to-head with guys is that true does that mean always well would it what is is there anything different than what you couldn't because he was telling me that well no no the pig would spike guys in the chest out there the big difference is that now in football you can't have a helmet the helmet contact you can't do it deliberately so if you hit somebody you tackle somebody a lot of guys used to run at you and they'd hit you with their helmet okay and you always allowed to use your hands and push guys where you will have fun like I'm still a block down the line you can use your hands but yeah you typically help your hands this way but you what are the rules can you grab a guy no come on she would always ask your office you offense you cannot do that you can fund offense hanyan you can no holding off on defense defense you can grab and move you can pull people out of the way so on defensive a dude's coming at you you can judo his ass yes really you can grab his clothes and fucking hip toss yeah but it's really hard to do because those guys know what the fuck they're doing yeah no shit right yeah that's one of the craziest things when you see some nutty running back one of those fucking freaks one of those incredible specimens and I remember this one drew Peterson dudes we're trying to get ahold of them any spinning it keeps spinning Adrian Peterson no they try to give a home it just spins out of their hands Adrian Peterson sprinting with a shirt off there's like a there's a commercial and just take a look at the physicality is a guy who's so fast he runs I think 27 miles an hour's on that train what is the human athlete gonna look like a hundred years from now because a lot of things going on like like Venus and Serena Williams okay they're gonna have sex and they're gonna make a baby and I can only hope they have sex with some Olympic athlete motherfucker and we see what's possible well everybody keeps doing that and to the point where there just becomes you know the the number one seed on the planet Earth and just see what is possible with this human form I gotta come to that because we're gonna have two things you're gonna have training methods of course in nutrition nanobots and ships Matic engine right yes science is gonna step in take care of everything that main jobim gene manipulation myostatin inhibitors all those things if we think that you know that the stock market crash is a wake-up call way to the genetic crash course we're gonna have fucking women that are ten feet tall squashing men on the head dad did you imagine if some woman became a like a mad crazy man hater and they genetically engineered a way for her to be like a jack of the Giants giant it's huge what do you then do you gonna fuck her with every day she's gonna use you like a dildo just grab you by your little asshole and stuff you inside a pussy did you imagine feels like some if you could just decide I want to be a 10 foot tall woman because men have been fuck with me I'm just gonna walk around kicking guys in the balls the idea is can you stop that technology from getting to that point and can you keep it out of the hands of a person who would use it for a terrible thing probably not probably not right you think everything we've all look at this I mean there's laptops that were we know we sit and use just your phone your phone has like so much more power than anything that existed 1960 right but will there come a time where we have to stop people from becoming 10 foot tall attack of the giant women stomping on dudes and shit I mean what could you imagine if they're the manipulation of actual physical life if it actually gets to a point where you can design what you want to look like and like you can say mom dad I've decided to be one of the blue people from Avatar and you just decided the Pentagon is definitely trying to figure out ways to create super soldiers whether it's the cloning or tissue regeneration yeah but I mean whatever forget about super soldiers how about things that don't even exist you can make things that you could become a dragon you know I want to be a dragon but that's what craig venter craig venter in the guy who created that synthetic biology Craig Venters team that the implications are in which one is this is this the guy who created it's made out of metal or see the reddish so basically pathetic form of bacteria that was that was basically this genetic blueprint was created on a computer it's synthetic biology and and the idea is that anything you can conceive of a human being can make do you know that scientists have been able to grow sperm in a laboratory dish yes I do your time is up son I know our time on this planet as men we will no longer be useful just that biology is gonna be an antiquated and antiquated machine well sir our mother was not being controlled by technology it's gonna be some mad rush to see who can dominate whatever aspect of this new reality comes up yeah because if there's no morality and there's no humans that are in control of it clearly it's gonna get to a point where it's gonna it's gonna be wild wild west for genetic manipulation yeah but also the idea is if you're gonna live that long what does that say about your earning power you're gonna make a lot of fucking money for a long time you know you know that apples got you know we're not gonna be able to we're not gonna need to charge our phones anymore that's what sells but yeah the patch it's gonna blow up on your dirt have patent for fuel cells and every two weeks you'll take a trust out my contacts in cars for two weeks what I'm going to really it's gonna be that that crazy yep why don't you just hold your pee and we'll wrap this bitch up there's no la-based comic angelo bowers no he had died today I was you know I mean hung out the comi store a lot and stuff like that I don't know the exact details but I think he might have been in a car with another friend of ours who we talked about earlier in the podcast Josh Adam Meyers and maybe a drunk driver hit him but I don't know that real I would say arrested pista Fred James - I don't I don't know that dude but fat well maybe I'm a damn enemy for not sure but fat James I knew very well you remember fat James I'm comedy store I should do know he looks like a like introduced clay but squished in fat jolly guy hey nice guy yeah he passed away unfortunately but uh he was a great dude so rest in peace fat James thank you to Bryan Callen for coming by brother thank you for having me you're always like whenever I think you know you're just like Joey Diaz a Bert Kreischer when I ordered Duncan Trussell whatever think you're out of interesting shit to talk about you with a wave of new things and I swear man when you were talking about the Holocaust I've always been aware of the Holocaust of course but there's something about the way you were describing it that it was put it was shining like some extra light on how fucking crazy and barbaric it was really like you were you were saying it so eloquently it really made me like really tune into how chaotic insane and disgusting and horrific it really was yeah it really was and and important to keep in mind also the lesson of the Holocaust is that it can happen again in some form or another human beings when you give people power over you over you yeah you you they'll take advantage and it sounds melodramatic but something like the NDAA actually does that it's it's not what the Constitution is a first step it's not how it's founded the scrunchie they knew that the people who founded this country knew that shit could go wrong so they had a bunch of things in place and one of the things that Benjamin Franklin said and should never forget this that he who would sacrifice liberty for security deserves neither that's a good way to end this podcast I love I said it again he who would sacrifice liberty for security deserves neither out they knew back then man someone's gonna play a shell game on you man they're gonna tell you this some bad people out there we need to look at your email to protect you from them that's right those fucks get your own porn thank you to Liberty Liberty liberty and justice for all one of the most important things that people forget about Liberty goddamn Constitution all right it's a bill of rights it's in the the idea that this country was founded on they got away from a system that sucked and they said let's make one for the fucking
