oh dude how about steep a sternum pound on over him dude over even thinking about that this whole time like how fucking hard did he get him with those three shots shots fuckin perfect perfect please like I was stacking him earlier and you get fucking in the guy in the head where's our mother triangle my kid hits steep a shots have been fucking but also Overeem's not as that you know his motherboard message board has been hit a bunch of times yeah well that's why after the fight I said I don't want to do interviews with fighters after they got knocked out again I appreciate my yeah she'd never appreciate that when he said that when he said that as I was watching I was like I don't fucking talk when he said the guy tapped I was like fuck imagine if he tapped like are we gonna see it tap like I had no idea you don't you don't know if you miss something during the actual calling of a fight because it's happening live and it's so chaotic and is right after Alistair dropped him then he went for the guillotine then also they're on their feet again it happened so fast when he said it he was so adamant that's good I know what about the truck in the back though Joe there's although we aren't they going Joe he didn't tap do you really want to show though they don't know they don't know live he watched the fight wanna find out maybe did ya find out it's entertaining it's totally possible that if he didn't have that someone saw it in the truck they would have said it but they didn't say it but they're like we're gonna we'll play it for you and I said okay we're gonna play it and so they had a cued up they played it and then he was still insisting I'm like okay well maybe it's the other hand but I was thinking man does not look good and then like but I'm like but it has to be solved it has to be resolved you know when a guy says the guy tack you have to show it but I wish we didn't interview him at all I wish you know I think you guys to have a chance to he was completely unconscious it took him a while just get back at his feet and to have a conversation with him about strategy about where went wrong since is crazy is he making insane he's never know more time but he doesn't have to like it alright but Mike I switch it to add arch this is a serious shit got a guy get losing its submitted this sucks I wish or the one yeah even another sports like den FL for God's concussion you're he's not doing interviews man he's not right in the head the guy breaks his leg doctors Andy they're not interviewing them yeah fuck see Guinness you don't kind of fucking frame a mine that guy's in Starr nuts so you're a hunter stat right Joe I love that well you know it's something I had suggested a long time ago back when we interviewed Mirko Cro Cop after Gonzaga knocked him out I was looking in his eyes but that night you guys interviewed him right after the fight and I was like we can't do that anymore and I said it to them and we just kept doing it what if it's good for ratings like if they get knocked out guaranteed interview they can't be good though I'm not doing it they let me show them on the ground anymore they pan away on the camp they tell you yes or no George I don't care no I'm not doing any more you're gonna do not I'm not doing sir when guys getting shut the fuck guys get knocked the fuck out so if someone really wants to talk to them they're gonna have to talk to him I'm not I'm not talking about we're gonna jump in that bitch I feel it's time for me to interview you Joe I'll take it from here thank you sir I know you hate this part I got a raise I'm doing out of respect for the game yeah I don't think we need to announce that I think the UFC agrees there's just better for the sport what made Alistair look bad and I think if you gave him a few hours or even a day to talk about it he probably would realize that that never happened it is just his brain was scrambled well even steep a when you're talking he's like hey hit me with a kick no sir that was a press well he said the guy yeah he did get kicked hard in the body they did and I mean he could have been mentioning that but he probably didn't realize what knocked him down was concussed too yeah most likely [Music]
