I don't want to I don't want to believe shit if it if it doesn't hurt me I it shouldn't be such a big deal I want to know right now on this podcast who is running this country there's a bunch of different factions that you call the government history science education energy everything has always been controlled by the government since day one look at the time illegal aliens in the work face as recommended by the Commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan if you look into the experiments to prove that the earth is spinning all of them failed look into it what are you just having this if you look into it in you and you have proof that it is round instead of going oh some scientists figure it out somebody figured it out somebody figured out but you figure it out you try to figure it out though no because when they look into it it's common sense and when you look into it ladies and gentlemen black helicopters have been spotted 221 holy shit yeah yes the goal way get the tape measure what's the fucking tape measure wow what a cheap piece of shit what a cheap piece of shit to 2224 birth for ones one pound less one fucking pound you fucking do sixteen Tom gets it

me right for four hours and so that's not the way to be you can't do that so I can't be a good persons other half because I'm always the work has always attracted me more than coming home to someone Wow like I I can't stand the idea of someone of living with a person I can do it on the bus cause it's dasa poet and work you know going down the road but I never would want to like wake up and she's there it's every day here we are together just not wired that way so so he's the main figurehead right he's the main guy like right up with Miscavige right and then John Travolta is somewhere in that I think John was given what a designation called kakan where they want kakan not can't become yeah calm okay a che kha n cacao okay okay he's given this designation of cacao which there's a policy that basically says you can kill another human being if you work a con you're gonna look the other way and he was given that he was given that my imagine thousands of emails come out with them talking about we'll have the kids ready six seven and eight in the hot tub at this time and there didn't see anything like that oh it gets really weird it say that it was news emails there's a freaking thousands of them but it said we'll get the kids in the hot tub yes I never saw that can you see if you could find that Jimmy that seems like like what's so confusing now the libs you confuse everything and nobody knows what bathroom to use and I guys at a night club the other night here's the ladies room right here and the men's room was right next one's a pile of shit in the middle with a tampon stuck in and a fake mustache hold up immediate head rush really just puff it well how about pot smoker bro well I don't want to heal that there's no filter on that what are you busy but often it's mind blowing when you learn that some infinities are bigger than others Joe Rogan just leaned two feet away from the microphone and the properties of each of those regions whether they're conducive to forming galaxies and stars and planets and people may be different so we could say logically in that picture that the reason the universe looks like the way it does is because we're here to measure it we should leave it at that okay we should close with that that is the mind blower go ahead and blow it and you know what Iron Man has that blue thing in his chest yeah I don't think women are evil I like our women are like Iron Man they're magic right but by ripping out that blue thing you're ripping out their ability to have children and be mothers and everything and then you put in a piece of shit into Iron Man's Chest that's what feminists and like this woman are their shit chests and they're malfunctioning robots you know like kill him Milo wants genocide killed so do you think that they're imitating what they think are patriarchal societies they're doing their version of it and that what they're doing with this the whole matriarchal posturing yeah it's like Clark Kent I want to write an article uh I'm writing no you're not writing it you go Clark simmer down dude I look at the things that I went through as a gift because I have gotten a gift of feeling retired during my career mm-hmm who else gets that some people retire for five years lose their freaking mind end up in the bar and come back and try to fight again ten years later with a weakened body a massive abuse why am i why though why are they doing that they're not doing it because they're physically capable they're doing it because they never dealt with their life away from fighting fighting was their life fighting is who they are fighting is their persona so take away fighting what are they there in the bar drinking away what they're not instead of drinking putting the booze down and knowing what you are without fighting being happy with that chapter your life and being able to live who you are I've gotten to feel that and now I can fight with a peace of mind knowing how good I am without fighting and how great I am with it too and that's that's what this thing's about all these fights all these me attacking those challenges coming back and winning and getting my belt back that could only happen because I let go of control the things I couldn't control yeah first man I think about that kind of stuff like if a plane crash I already know I'm playing the head you not eat a Vietnamese guy well because that's easy it's a starter move if you attack somebody bigger if you eat somebody bigger in front of other people it's gonna alarm people but you gotta eat a small person so stature is important I think if you gum down a viet people are gonna be that upset at you these people are gonna be super upset what are you talking about somebody's dad there's sacrify more understanding of things dude is this a character you're playing no but if you eat a black dude you eat a black lady and her family's there they're gonna be pissed so you think it's Vietnamese person we let you slide I think they'd be much more forgiving over a couple of day period I think your relatives you don't think so honestly one thing no I don't think so I definitely think they'd be super pissed at you especially modernized ones but what is interesting is like Vietnam is one of the few places where Americans can go back to Vietnam and they don't seem to hold any grudge at all exhibit a exhibit a man honestly do you realize 87% Gallup poll came out last year it's at 87 percent of the people on the planet are unhappy with what their life is all about uninhabited and 10% in addition to that 87 to 97 hey what they do well so that leaves 3% of the planet enjoy what they do you're one of 3% fuck I'm one of the 100 millionth of a percent I'm so happy I don't know whether the shit or go blind yes so we look there's no trash can it's like silk and gold and this beautiful palace and stuff so I just like take my panties off and just like roll them up and shove them behind the toilet song Vladimir Putin that was mine I went I want it back mm it was 10 years ago that's crap Wow yeah so and then I just go back out there and it's like Berlusconi was like hitting on me and and and like trying to pick me up and he's like hey can I be your boyfriend tonight I'm just like what but he's saying it through a translator so [Laughter] there's a there was a war on drugs we started war on drugs turns out we're bringing it in then there's a war on terrorism turns out we created al-qaeda do you understand why I'm crazy I'm crazy because of that shit like if that's real to you man you don't think it's real with fish I'd fish I thought you guys are fooled by the fisheye lens come on man is that what the fuck is going on with I don't know I don't think there's a conspiracy in the conspiracy and then they'll cut the Jim Hong Wong or Jim kim jeong-hoon cold asleep I'm not saying they're actors I'm just saying there's something fishy about the whole North Korea thing kangaroo that's what it is that's my guess that's a fuckin they found a giant kangaroo and when they figured it out the goat dude it's a kangaroo fuck you you got appreciate the hustle by Alex Jones is like a spare seat there you'd have the wow I can't believe you said that but exactly there's giant weather modification systems and there's weather wars between different governments I want to know how he got I want to know the story if he he got in is there video out there how did he get in we are allowing this to happen it's like we want it to happen it's like it's a CIA MKULTRA experiment always wondered how they're getting away with it it's so out in the open how come there is it more psychic vampires stealing the energy from the kids we're taking these people on we're bringing God back in even some are that wasn't very religious like Trump has gotten religion learning about this because let me tell you something Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this and he's gonna roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready now do the Rothschilds even exist that could be a conspiracy I can I say one thing the Rothschilds are a hoax I just know all this crap well you get crazy and still ran people won't listen to me because I got too much data and you imagine what this is like you think did they drop they would have dropped the ball big-time like Ernest Byner in 1987 for the brows it would have dropped the ball if you're not if you don't have paid shills online strategically pushing the agenda wait a minute America's only control the vay I I think you have the pedophiles getting control okay do you know that if you go to youtube and you punch in Nikola Tesla hoax fraud nothing comes up put in Albert Einstein hoax fraud endless videos it's a la Rosa free videos and there's a full-out war inside the government of guys that like to eat steaks drink beer and having women versus a bunch of pot-bellied pedophiles whoa I don't know what to believe man I don't know if the Rothschilds are real I don't know reptilians are real I don't know that Satanism Israel I don't know shit well using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're gonna merge with machines transcend and break away from the failed species of this man well power that's not okay let's that's but no one has the time to do resign enough to micromanage the entire world to the two digit right it's just there's so much I guess good let people take care of this Illuminati got keys control experiment there's too much shit going on I gotta ask you this one thing for sure is cuz I read this and I was like what here we go you saw someone shape-shift Oh God is that real where you fuckin with people that's true really that's true cuz I wouldn't you told me I enjoyed Coffman like moments I was like okay it's true I would tell you off great but I won't say it publicly right but I mean is anybody been skeptical but yeah everyone's great oh yeah and what's your response to that you don't know what I know right well you know you know though I can't I don't know I can't tell you some of the shit that I know but that jury is still out so what what are the negative benefit or the negative effects of this this is an explosive area of conversation and puts my life in dangerous so I reserve the right not to answer a question whoa I didn't expect that it puts your life in danger talking about portobello mushrooms he's looking at me silently I will respectfully move on thank you yeah I mean business there's never encouraged fine suits no pocket squares occasionally you find a token pocket square but you can tell their heart's not in it the wife stuck it in there because she saw someone on TV that had a minute razzle-dazzle about them and they thought oh I quite fancy my old man well then they sort stick it in the old man's be embarrassed about in throws to squeeze out of the way suits are a thing the death of the suit it was the death of the suit was the prosaic attitude toward I'm going alone yeah I won't put a tie on and I don't want to stick out that's how I feel but that's what's happened we've been brainwashed to not dress like gentlemen but I see a guy like you and I say that's appealing like look how you're dressed and you're in a conservative suit this is that nice like I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted but you chose assert that has a certain look to it yeah I have spent some time asking around with this Joe but a bit like that the same reason that we've spent time asking around with the old pocket square it's I remember thinking how much I found the suit repugnant and I became angry that the suit been robbed from and so I had to create an alibi a way in to understand why is that I'd like a suit and you have many puzzles in front of you that you could solve but you choose not to you know that those are the things that weigh on your conscience it's like you know I should really do this but you don't it's like so I had this idea a long time ago because the world is a pretty dreadful place I thought well what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew they should do you know because the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is a as an existential catastrophe and a tragedy how much is our own corruption contributing to that that's a really worthwhile question things you leave undone because you're angry you're resentful you're lazy you have inertia well you consult your conscience and it says well you know that place over there I could use a little work it's the same as working on yourself and so you clean that up because you can and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better off because you've practiced a bit and and so you're little stronger and then then something else manifests itself and says well maybe you like take a crack at fixing me up - so you decided to do that and then that gets a little bit more pristine you know and soon and it's it's humbled because you're not exceeding your domain of competence you know it's like don't be fixing up the economy eighteen-year-olds you don't know anything about the economy it's a massive complex machine beyond anyone's understanding and you mess with it at your peril so and can you even clean up your own room No well you should think about that you should think about that because if you can't even clean up your own room who the hell are you to give advice to the world and in the morning this this hooker she just tells me like how much how much I owe her right and I'm like that's fucking outrageous there's no fucking away I was like sighs like basically I don't care if your fucking pimp wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me I'm not paying that fucking much I'd forget it was so long ago but but yeah I was outraged was initiated before him it just it just wasn't in that case exactly I remember clearly I was like you want damage and I said I said I'll give you this much and that's how much you get weird and we came out right like you know I gotta go film and walking through the lobby Knoxville's down there having breakfast this hooker comes walking by knocks alone she says that's not Stevo that's cheap oh that would be the scientific approach I don't know what it is great mystery let's just wait and see versus I'm gonna postulate a lost civilization nothing wrong with that crap it's a free country and scientists do this all the time as you've mentioned there's a there's a rather humorous thing which I have to say actually I might even ask Jamie to pull up the the couple of images I mean this is embarrassing actually I remember telling my parents that I wanted to change my name to - Damian Munroe Chris D'Elia - Damian Munroe cuz Damian was is the devil right hey and then Marilyn Monroe was like pure in my head I was like you have both I would ask my parents I would ask my person I always sat like this at the dinner table and I asked them I was like I was like can you call me crazy legs I remember thinking like oh like that would be cool like if my family called me crazy like hey it's Damian Crazy Legs yeah and then they were like and my dad was like no and I was like but just like maybe just at least at the dinner table I remember saying that and you'd be like I'm not fucking calling you crazy legs you need you Kris you were talking about Tiger Woods on your podcast I was listening to it on the way over here and I totally agree with you we were saying like when Tigers world fell apart like how the fuck do you know like woody did you talk to him like you don't know him you know that was I mean that's just a bunch of hype like for him it's like a double dump though you know I mean the thing happens personally with his personal life and it happens publicly where everybody gets to see it and then on top of that his body's falling apart at the same time no matter what he did yeah no matter what church every fucking week he was going to fuck up his back in his knees and they and it did but then they're trying to equate it to you know whatever I think what he did was none of my business it's none of my fucking business I don't want to know about it I hate knowing about you know I feel bad if somebody if the marriage falls apart I feel bad they get busted for doing a job you know I mean it happens if you fucked up and it's your fault you should get punched but like the cops are handling it they arrested him the courts will handle it I need to talk to I need to pile on and start wagging my fucking hypocrite and a finger at him yeah like it's it's so immediate that you become this you become other you become an outsider like in the next morning when he went back I rang the doorbell I rang the doorbell it's your own house and I had lived in that house from the day I was born whoa so you felt like you had to ring the doorbell but this is not my world anymore yeah Wow grace was like why don't you ring the doorbell and it was like there's there's no other there's there is nothing else like it this is not our home this is not so we go and you know we're packing all of our things it was just it was awful just a I had been in those four months I had been so terrified of because I know knowing what was coming like just imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life that they're just you're just going to like you're not gonna like how your parents met and fell in love or like your grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories and what did the house looks I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just all the time like an every it was just it's overwhelming it's so when you say something like well you know we should be attacking Islamism as if it's something that is outside of Islam that's simply false Islamism is Islam right or the one the Prime Minister of Turkey and I can quote many other Islamic experts said Islam is Islam the term moderate Islam Islam ISM and all these other qualifiers are nonsensical now the reason why that upsets me is because it grants people a false sense of security and hope you know Islam is wonderful but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism well from day one 1400 years ago Islam was Islamism now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element that doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice a spiritual part but there is no set of doctrines in a separate book called radicalized Islamism it all comes from the same text it comes from the Quran it comes from the Hadees and it comes from the seer of the biography of Muhammad so so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem as though they're not frontally attacking a religion while laudable while nice I get that reflux it's false I know if I talked about my dad with you but um he was my wrestling coach in high school he was also my science biology and environmental studies teacher really she was my teacher oh what a drag went to school your dad being the T doesn't fucking but I learned a lot because he was no joke he didn't any punches from a he you know he drove me as hard if not harder than his other students you didn't show any favoritism but one of the things that was always his thing on the mat and I'm kind of paraphrasing but basically you you either win or you learn mm-hmm especially in that high school college setting you're you're learning about yourself if you if you went out there and you got your ass handed to you then you just got beat and didn't learn anything well yeah you're a fucking loser you take the moment reflect on it build on what you did wrong and you now you're actually in a way you've won if now you know more about yourself you know about more your your limitations or what you need to improve and expand your talents or your limitations so I guess whenever I'm doing a thing I'm always looking at it from a learning perspective so there aren't necessarily mistakes unless they're fatal and then you wouldn't know anyway so whatever cuz you see him in a club and he sees he sees some girls and you like cars like BMWs and crazy he'd take the girls out and go get a BMW there was another guy standing on the wall green jacket like green little jumpsuit nobody's talking to him guess who was who jay-z because it wasn't too long after that accident that he had right and then he goes uh I I got a song dad dad you look you'll be good on I got this song I know you could kill I was like me song goofy face I call Robert I said listen I need you to play a Mexican he says dude here's the deal sure why not fuck it sure of course yeah Mexican whatever I did an Adam Sandler film I don't know the the the last one he did the Sandy Wexler and you know you go up on the set you know and Adam starring this film and I'm not you know I mean a nice to star in films and it's it's so it's a weird feeling for me like I'm happy to be on the set I love Adam he's an old dear friend and I'm super happy for him but I was starring in films right you only mean and everywhere I go people say why aren't you starring in films like what what's up and you know I can't answer it you only mean poor choices the weasel shit dried up you know the movies didn't perform as well I didn't listen to my agents I wasn't like doing drugs it wasn't like I got all fucked up I just one movie didn't do so good then the next movie didn't do so good and then they eventually just stopped coming and he told us about when he shit in his backyard and somebody thought a bear and then she would clean up they were all French poodles when you shit outside it's not gonna be a decent shit yeah it's gonna be like explosive and she's looking at the wall walks up close to it and looks around and runs it I'm watching all this I can't breathe oh my god was done I took a shit in favours backyard after a five-hour drive from Colton or some weird town did he not talk to you after that for I took a shit and then he ran over it with his car you can see the brown shit because I told the truth a lot of the guys I remember I was telling you guys at one time my freshman you had and take a shift for a week and a half I used to I was addicted to stake them as America cheese and all right a French fries I play freshmen ball and we're playing Pattinson Eastside it's just a jungle over school like you got to be careful you going there and we went there to play the Christmas tournament but what kind of bar are we talking right back hello basketball I hadn't taken this shit for like ten days I got something I took acid something fucked my stomach I didn't tell nobody and those days I was really scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody way home we got on the bus and while we will wait that my stomach started hurting I said Jesus Christ I don't often I shit myself a fart well let me just take a chance and I blew this fart Joe Rogan that was so bad right we want a bus and people started running you know those school buses people started running to the windows right to swing down the bus windows but here's what get better I fought it again and the teachers were going oh my god he's changing flavors the cheerleaders are crying that's how bad there's a building it's still there on Franklin in Hollywood where Charles Manson used to live and run his Wars out of which I didn't know he was doing he was a pimp yeah a pimp and girls two people were staying at the Roosevelt now so Color Me badd right perfect you know no and it's a hard one to learn because anything that's got an orgasm at the end of it you know there's a degree of pleasure to be had but it takes it takes a while to recognize on what this is the emotional cost on me the spiritual cost on other people their faculties preventing me from becoming a father from becoming a husband from settling from becoming rooted from becoming actually whole from becoming a man from becoming connected it takes a while to spot that I think a lot of people don't get the opportunity to break out that pattern I would never have spotted it had a not first been a heroin addict and don't hold a minute you're doing that thing again same with Fame and celebrity well toxic well toxic exciting and brilliant and loads of lovely people in there and I still like you know I might make another film I don't know what happened but like it's because I'd had the template and the experiences of are this is addiction you're expecting this thing to make you feel better Harvey is an executive guy it is so nasty so gross but okay now on the other hand on the other hand I was like you know Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms of like getting shit done and getting deals closed and how this does this happen it would kind of be nice to be like you want a Netflix special just go fuck inside that's all I have to do it suck that guy's yeah come over here you nasty fuck ha ha there's our special right you know what if you type in Astra the tr-3b asteroids here are 3b and I'll walk over that guy walk over there for a second so much one good they'll be able to see it put it up on the screen so what what this is well I don't really want to tell you what it is what I want you to watch it is this it's okay I'll find it for you just takes me a second there's a bunch of bullshit this is the craft by the way else in if you spelled alright Astro that's why sorry Astra was wrong that's true not Astro yeah i typing out oh he's gotta get we gotta get me sure he's the right one so the hundred mile race that I was doing a months before Moab at about I mean 12 miles roughly to the finish line my vision started blurring like in the periphery and over the course of the next couple miles closed in until it was pure white I couldn't see anything pretty much I would say like 98% blind what I could see my feet like right in front of my feet but it was just whiteout when people heard about this like they're like problem with like clickbait journalism the headlines look like I was it's like sexual misconduct stuff and like I don't want to be like but like let me just stop you right here if you say like one more time my fucking heads gonna explode haha dude I get comments like that it's brutal isaburo is it as bad as alright I'm gonna I just want you to slow it down I'm gonna use it every now and then with this coffee you over here breaking like the like meter and I I'm not stupid and I saw I said to myself stop stuttering now stop stuttering now I said that dozens hundreds of times over and over and over and fortunately the storms went past and held onto the tree and soaking wet I came out of the tree and walked back to where I was living and then the next day I got up I didn't see anybody and I was walking on on this path and a sidewalk and there's a lady that I really liked a lot and but she was always attracted the super self-assured jocks and things like that she was actually very kind and sweet but I didn't want to stare at her in their eyes because I would stutter and it's humiliating for us so the more humiliating us stutterers feel the more we stutter and so it's a really slippery slope and so I would avoid eye contact and so for the first time she walked towards him he says good morning Paul how are you she was always so nice to me and I was terrified because I didn't Barriss myself and I looked at her straight in the eyes and I said I'm doing fine how are you and I stopped stuttering in one day and this speaks to now what was been medically proven is that we can reset the neurology of the human brain through neurogenesis I believe that experience allowed me to map new neurological pathways that allows me to l acute in a way that I could not l acute before used to hang out a lot with Dennis and you know hadn't seen him for years was at a restaurant Chicago not too long ago and and somebody said oh you guys are friends with Dennis right yeah yeah oh he's upstairs oh really we go upstairs dennis is crying oh my god I

he left okay I just figured he's gone it's just the way he is right he wouldn't even say goodbye just gone I get up the next morning I turn the television Dennis Rodman's in North Korea okay I by the way I spent an hour and a half with him he didn't say anything about going to North Korea right as I turn the television it's like very controversial Dennis Rodman's in North Korea so I text my buddy and I say have you seen the news know what I say turn on the television and he said what channel I said it doesn't matter and two minutes goes by holy fuck because he went through the same thing you

put their own stamp on it or why are they there so this guy comes in and he goes we're gonna rebrand you he goes I want everyone to think of your name and instantly think of the brand and I'm already you know brown yeah okay so here's what he said so I hate to say this because this will become a meme online that I with the rest of my but it's an absolutely true story so the guy says to me he goes listen I'll imagine a billboard that says Dan Carlin he fucks chickens and I said excuse me he goes yeah I mean so that anytime anybody thought of you they would think okay he's the chicken fucker and I'm going with him really he really said that yes and I said how something him I said I said two things dude I said the first thing is I gotta live in this town right so really you want that to be the first thing people think okay the second thing is I got to have a career after this stupid idea of yours fails right no you don't understand we're building a mental image you'll be a household name I said yes I'll be the household name the guy who fucks chickens I said no he was after my father I said dude do you want to step outside right now I don't my wife laughed at me because I'm already an old man when I'm said she goes that would have been great I said no this this guy was as old as I was but I mean I was so incensed and so angry that this guy would would be so cavalier with your future yeah what is about that look right that like cover you know pin-up girl that's what's called 1950s pin-up girl type of look what is it about that feeling maybe it makes fat chicks look good how dare you Doug Stanhope do you not realize it was a different day and age oh look I didn't smoke blunts til I hung out with Charlie Murphy he was one of the hardest deaths that I ever had to deal with really yeah cuz I wish I'd contacted him more I wish we got together more we were always on the road and an offstage maybe one of the funniest guys of all time he took me to dinner and like he was telling stories he was he told the story that I texted you to ask him when you had him on I'm supposed to ask you about Johnny Gill who thought he could beat Oscar De La Hoya oh yeah it was Tom Segura he said that Johnny Gill Johnny Gill we're looking at the screen and it's awesome - Latoya he's like you think I could fuck you up I was like yeah of course he's like I know right looks like yeah man nobody would ruin your life he was like Johnny Gill thinks he could fuck him up I was like what that's back when I was still you know frightening to us was made me really angry the Oscar was whipping somebody's ass and I'm sitting next to a balladeer you know I respect you you get singing on them don't point to no fighting and go I could whip her I don't want to hit it really said that beat him in
