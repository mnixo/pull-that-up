three two one boom and we're live what's up Trevor how are you brother damn good how are you man I'm good man you're a coffee snob coffee addict ah what's the difference when you become a snob like when you go once you're getting Starbucks mmm maybe when you can tell the difference between all the kinds coffee Ken oh yeah right if you get all this is an Ethiopia and this is this I guess they're all Ethiopian right thanks Jinnah Lee I learned that from Peter Giuliani does his name Juliano or Giuliani I had a real coffee expert on here once to drop the science on me cheers sir geez yeah he dropped some coffee science on us a shout out to black rifle coffee um yeah that's good stuff so what's up man how are you went to the you did the full comi store I did want look last night I figured like you know there's a chance he's gonna be there let me look it up take my buddies yeah yeah we're there all the time that's like no say it's like the gym you know that's where that's where we train you know and you can see it and it's rad to see it's fun to see that kind of training going on with that kind of creative art that you need other people to respond to yeah it's a weird art like that yeah you really can't do it in a vacuum no I mean then you're just talking to yourself have you been economy shows before a few um actually I went to your show oh that was insanely a girl in from right right right at Temecula right yeah I think is the Pachanga it was chinking that's a good fucking casino yeah it gets a bad rap that's like people I think it's just because it comes off as silly Pechanga cuz the name probably it's a good spot so last night was fun man and we almost had like a mini podcast in the back bar of the promis'd I'm like damn we got to remember all this cool shit we talked about it you know I was trying to think like all the different things that we talked about that we have to remember but one of them is shout-out to our buddy Andy Andy stump who basically we were talking last night about one of the things that happened there was a there was an event while you were serving where a helicopter was shot down and then you were the report you were the replacement group yeah so I was augmenting the group that ended up replacing the guys who passed away during extortion 17 and that was a huge event right enormous huge loss to Special Operations community as a whole you know I was listening to Andy's podcast with cam Haynes it's out right now that's cleared hot and he was saying that they were flying towards fires and or actually this is a different story this is a different story but he was saying that it got hit by an RPG at night which is rare yeah like apparently those things are not easy to aim no there I mean it's just a it's a rocket-propelled grenade it's you know shoulder fired and you just point a name so the thing isn't that accurate hmm so you have do they have a scope on them a rudimentary one and depending on which one you're using yeah it's just kind of sort of just getting a sight picture a Kentucky windage II oh okay and so that was uh that was the thing that Andy could have been in that group absolutely could have which is very tough for guys that aren't there that could have been there to know that that's a possibility with so many dudes that spent so much time together like him with those guys yeah one of the things that we talked about last night was the difference in perception between what war is actually like versus what civilians think wars like and how much of that stuff is sort of polluted by media by movies and television shows were they paint this picture of it and the only people that know what it's like are you you guys you're the only ones who know the people that were actually there yeah and it's I think it's cool what you're doing and what guys like Jack we're doing where they're allowing guys to paint that picture for everybody to see how it really can be from everybody's individual perspective because all of us get a different sliver of what's going on you know we all see a slightly different reality when we're there yeah each person is different but I think it's important that everybody gets to relate that to the u.s. especially because of how long this has been going on you know it's been 20 years of sustained fighting for a small amount of Americans that's really insane if you stop and think about it because remember when we used to think about world war 2 or Vietnam like Vietnam dragged on forever was nothing compared to this it wasn't 20 years yeah it's it's wild it is really crazy because it seems perpetual it seems like there are guys that are serving now with their fathers Jesus Christ it's a real thing Wow yeah right that makes sense fuck yeah you know when we're talking about last night I was saying what it like does is it frustrating to you and you see media depictions of it and you seen films about war like that like when you see something that's really whoa fully and accurate yeah it's only really frustrating when you can see that there that whomever put that together to doing it for their own profit and gain mm-hmm like their misconstruing something to push an agenda whatever it is if it's political economic who cares right that's just unfortunate especially when they're portraying things that are going on now yeah with dudes that are really alive still bright that's that's tough to see yeah um I'm friends with marcus luttrell and he's gonna come on and talk soon and that's got to be the weirdest one you watching Marky Mark play you in a movie you know no disrespecting Mark Wahlberg was a great actor yeah he's a beast he's a he's a pretty inspirational dude I mean I like Mark Wahlberg a lot but to see that guy from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch like you've seen him yeah like you've seen he's seen you and whitey tighties what's going on the Calvin Klein's ads and now you're playing me like that is get from watch that's gotta be so weird super weird just like some guy and probably saying a bunch of shit you never really said oh yeah and the other guy is what Bradley Cooper was his buddy in the movie who was the other guy oh yeah was it and that's right that's gotta be totally star so bizarre this horrific event in your life that probably I mean I don't want speak for Marcus but it's gotta still be in his head every day absolutely all day long stuff doesn't go away yeah you know you you we all individually think yeah you know maybe it does kind of fade but that's only because you're not the one who lived it exactly with everything yeah with everything with everything yeah we're very insensitive to the way other people feel about traumatic events or chaos or things that we can't understand yeah it's part of who you are no I don't think there's a thing that you can't understand more than war if you haven't experienced it I mean I I I haven't obviously I obviously haven't experienced it but when I think about it I'm like I don't even know if I should be thinking about like what it's like I have zero knowledge yeah but it's almost it's it's very similar to like hunting is right if you're not part of it your distorted view of whatever is going on is so odd because you're essentially fantasizing and trying to build this image up in your head of oh that's what that must be like mm-hmm with no ability to actually say that that's really how that's like because you haven't touched it I would imagine hunting is not nearly as intense no no but it's it's something else did so many people just don't they get it wrong yet to do and they get it wrong like being up on stage mm-hmm you know or performing in front of thousands millions of people yeah people don't understand what that's like unless you're up there right doing the thing right yeah but the thing about war that's more it's more crazy than any of those things it's crazier than any of those things yeah is that you're taking 17 18 year old kids and subjecting to that while they're there really still just figuring out life like really in the beginning stages of figuring out life like not even allowed to drink yeah that is really crazy you can't drink but you could shoot people thanks for voting no alcohol for you get your ass over there get on in there it's that's a weird one right good luck doc yeah but the thing is if you made it the same age I'll give you first of all don't make voting 18 no it's terrible idea all these fucking people they're saying voting should be 60 fuck you wasn't Nancy Pelosi said that I think she's at 16 but when I was 16 I was a chimp I really was I was one of the dumbest fucking human beings on the planet if you allowed me to have any say whatsoever into how the world is processed just think of this shit you thought was cool oh yeah oh no well I thought a lot of the same shit with school that's what's really sad comic books I wasn't allowed noises and loud cars I was into like most of the shiny shit yeah shiny shit like this chimp fucking most of the things I'm not an int I wasn't into yoga or Jiu Jitsu back then other than that or or hunting or bow hunting other than that pretty fucking similar but just dummy shit I'm still dumb as shit but really really dumb as shit back then extra dumb extra dumb sixteen-year-old DOM is fucking ridiculous Jung and dumb yeah you don't even have the experience not only that you've only been getting boners for three years so you're back there life right yes everything turns you on yeah dude you remember those days those were so confusing to go from being like an 11 year old to 12 year old to be the 13 or 14 year old like what is happening in my pants the fuck is this keep going from Legos and Lincoln Logs - exactly she looks good girls are experiencing it too and so it's like this weird like you're playing like an adult play relationships you can't get it right yeah if the idea that those people can vote it's like fuck you that's so ridiculous yes they shouldn't be able to do heroin yet it shouldn't be able to drink they definitely shouldn't be able to absolutely but you could send them to war oh yeah it's just you can go to war on a waiver yeah 17 well that's what Andy did you signed up when he was 17 and 3 9/11 more power to him yeah that's wild how old were you when you enlisted 19 yeah that's what was you insane what's really crazy is you're a fucking super talented artist so show these people is Trevor made this this is uh he says Red Cloud's son yeah Jack red could see that can people see that that's fucking great man you're really talented so you went in school for art I did so I went to the Chicago Art Institute for a year before I joined the Navy and my entire family has a lot of art background my mom studied at college my dad does bronzes and he actually does a sports cartoon for the LA Times oh wow yeah so it's been something I've seen growing up and I was playing music a lot and doing art and picked art because that was what I was most passionate about that was what 2006 and about three months into college and like fuck this place no part of this what was it I just didn't feel like I was doing anything with with with so much shit going on you know six oh okay yeah yeah on and like both my granddad served and great granddad served and we've had a lot of military history so I think that subconsciously I felt a little bit of an impetus to do that mmm like hey you know maybe I should just give it a go and if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do the hardest thing I can figure out thought about it I'm like yeah mom and dad so I'm dropping out of school I'm gonna go be a Navy SEAL and I can only imagine the other side of that phone like what the fuck is going on how high is he so you made a phone call from college oh yeah Wow where were you going to school Chicago Art Institute and your family lives in LA oh Jesus yeah in Wesley Wow yeah I have to handle it um pretty well yeah way quieter than I expected I think they thought that I would just like wash it out of my system before I really did it and so uh I think there were a little extra surprise when I told him like a week or so later that I put a leave of absence in like yeah yeah I'm I'm really not coming back to school well I'm gonna come home and train for this fuck yeah yeah I can only imagine and my my friend cam Haines his son is a ranger now that's right he just recently deployed here and it's for him it's uh is really crazy struggle you know in in his head it's like for one he's proud of his son yeah and and honored and and you know there's that expression if not my son who's yeah and but on the other hand it's like wow his son is deploying he's going overseas and he's involved in operations it's for real for real for real for real you know and I coming from a family that we have had a lot of family members have seen combat like it's for real for real you know and they got it and I saw that and once I graduated I could really see that I could see how it was affecting them and it's tough to see but I really wanted to do that thing and you know you was just a kid like yeah I thought I understood what I was getting into and how that was gonna affect my family and you don't I mean I barely now get it like I barely now see and how old you know 32 yeah could only imagine yeah I mean that we're only talking about 13 years ago yeah you know that so what we're talking about was the difference between the way the media depicts it and the way it is is there anybody that's got it right is there any movie that you watch you know that's pretty goddamn close I don't know they're all they're all close ish you know but a lot of them are very Hollywood iist mmm they have to be maybe I get it right you know I understand they're telling a story right you know unless they're doing a documentary it's just a story but I kind I can say that Saving Private Ryan was super close mm-hmm obviously I wasn't for that but my dad's dad said he had to step out of the theater when he went to go see that oh because he could smell diesel he remembered it it was that strong of a memory for him yeah stalk was he at Normandy no he he did comment landings in the South Pacific with Marine Corps that fucking opening scene when they get on the beach it's it's it's tough fucking nuts man the idea that that was the only way that they could handle that situation that they had to do it that way yeah imagine being one of those guys and us to get off those boats that was there that was the good better best scenario yeah yeah this is this is how it has to happen how many people died that day thousands I'm not positive on that but it was thousands of people perished that day there was something that someone did to commemorate the anniversary of the event and they did something that represented every body of everyone who died did it like on the beach like with a number of hair goes 425,000 allied and German troops were killed wounded or went missing during the Battle of Normandy 209 allied casualties Jesus Christ it's fucking insane that's fucking insane I mean I remember my granddad has and I knew he told me these things before I joined about storming a beach in the South Pacific and everybody left right front and back at him dying going up the sand you know so but that those are the kinds of things that it's tough too yeah that's fucking insane that's the thing it's a is it all over the sand and it represents all the different people that died and it's just everywhere everywhere you look so that if you were a person who really had this abstract idea that this war went down there that gives you a visual representation of what it must have looked like yeah you can kind of almost get it in your head like it makes it more visceral yeah just look and see got many fucking bodies and that was the best-case scenario for these guys yeah that's the best-case scenario that's why they did it that way yelling it's terrifying god damn you know and it's it's stuff like that or like a month before I went to Afghanistan it's about a month is when an extortion 17 happen I'm like fuck I'm going there to replace those guys it makes it really really like some-something sound home really well and some things don't and for me that did what was your first deployment like so my first one was with a team out in Hawaii where we were doing submersible work so I drove like a 22 foot mini sub for five years really oh yeah and we were doing some like waterborne activities and how deep does it go that's classified oh really but yeah oh I can go really deep yeah but it's it's a wet submarine so run run scuba it's all like you're you're in the water not just underwater oh really yeah so you're wearing scuba gear while you're piloting the building so the water gets in there yep whoa look uh you can probably pull up a picture of it brother that's a mindfuck on top of a mindfuck SDV just being in a scuba is crazy but being a scuba gear inside of a fucking submarine with the door shut oh Christ so how much hair you got in there enough that's not a boat oh so it's like a convertible it no no so behind those dudes yeah those doors there's lighters so you shut them so cuz it can drive relatively fast where like if you had them open like shit it'd be like oh that looks like something from a fucking James Bond movie this doesn't it is like something FOMA fucking James Bond movie like we train in the daytime it is bananas it is wild to drive that thing I can only imagine cuz you're landing on the back of a submarine it's 22 feet long ish I I mean that's what I recall fuckin'-a that we could cool it was fake it's like if I saw that in the movie but they don't have one of those that's bullshit it does doesn't it it's like a human torpedo yeah that's what it looks like it looks like a fucking missile it is fucking it's pretty cool Wow so that is wild there's a ton of those things that other countries have like they've been using submersibles since the first world war no you know the first invent submarines okay no I think I think the Revolutionary War there was a guy that like paddles ass around in a in like a I've seen the girl or it's like an old Cheryl yeah it's like crazy-looking Wow I'm just gonna imagine the first gangster to fucking climb into a metal dick and slide in the oceans we got this even the guys that went the deepest did it like in the 30s or 40s and no one's been able to do that again why didn't see my query yeah really and they had a window there's like four inches across I think you sprags when they got to the bottom just calculations at that time you actually get down there and then you think like back to your question how much hair do we got oh my god I guess we have enough oh my god yeah that to me freaks me out about more than anything in the water as a submarine the idea of being in one of them tubes and sliding around and not being able to see using sonar and you think like what's in the water there's some big-ass animals in the water bigger sound big-ass animals all they do is bump you incredible stress for Archer I've seen whales and sharks and dolphins and all sorts of crazy shit down there what kind of crazy shit man we were on the bottom once and we saw this like scorpion crab looking thing like walking around on the ground it was like this tall like we're so you're making the like like a Great Dane yeah real good like a crab a crab like Great Dane underwater underwater is ridicu I don't know what it was but it was terrifying is it that's is that an undocumented animal I'm sure it's documented there's a bunch of those weird like spider crab looking things that walk around fuck well they don't know what everything is in the Osher constantly pulling up new shit like look at this thing it's like the size of a car like well what's really weird is those really really old ones at the bottom that people had they only come up when they get like a tsunami washes I'm sure have you ever seen those websites dedicated like the stuff that was in the Thailand tsunami I go way down the rabbit hole on some of that crap those things don't even look real well and they've pulled like I think they recently got a whale that had a spear tip in it from like two hundred years ago a hundred and fifty years ago like so it's a currently living whale yeah whoa yeah so a hundred and fifty years ago during the Moby Dick day someone harpooned it yeah and it lived um I think that I have heard this recently yeah Wow these animals are crazy I mean those Greenland sharks lived to be like 300 or something no shit yeah that's what they is not what they think that well that's one of the theories about the Loch Ness monster that it might be some sort of a landlocked Greenland shark yeah yeah or just people full of shit I'm going with number two I'm going with number two like how you feel about Sasquatch that's how I feel about that shit laughs there's enough scary shit out there yeah we don't need to make up a Loch Ness monster it doesn't make any sense no I just think that people see things in the water and then they exaggerate the size of them and the next thing you know they're telling a story there's probably some shit in there like some eels I'm sure or maybe a sturgeon or something like that sturgeon are huge the size of this desks are so big and if you saw one from a distance at night you would assume that that was a monster or an alligator gar alligator gar yeah oh here it is scroll down please so I could see the title but they all survives harpoon attack 130 years ago to become the world's oldest mammal look at that harpoon go ahead well I'm glad I wasn't full shit embedded in his neck Wow is that not insane it was caught off Alaska so how'd they catch it this is biologists claim the fine helps prove the bowhead is the oldest living mammal on earth says a 13 centimeter arrow shaped fragment dates back to around 1880 Wow meaning the 50 ton whale had been coasting around with us freezing our Arctic waters since the Victorian times that's nuts man wild and since they never took calves the estimated the bowhead was several years old when it was first shot and about 130 when it died last month also it died god damn and probably died cuz they caught it I mean they can't be good for it yeah it's just weird how many different things they used to do with the whales these two turn with the lamps they still the lamp oil and shut they used to eat him yeah they still do in I think parts of the frozen north Faroe Islands do ya was it say Jamie fired from a heavy shoulder gun the harpoon was attached to a small metal cylinder filled with explosives and fitted with a timed fuse so it explodes seconds after shot into the whale Jesus Christ that's so dark the weapons manufacture to a New England Factory about 1880 and said it was rendered obsolete by a less bulky guarding gun a few years later so they'd shoot into it and said even though the device probably exploded the bowhead was protected by a 1 foot thick layer of blubber and thick bones used to protect used to break through the ice one foot thick to breathe out of the surface imagine that fucking thing can break through a foot thick of ice that's insane that's in South Stan I was ice fishing on four inches of ice just munching out on that yeah and it's breaking through with its head for such bitches oh yeah compared to whales and you got to think they only invented that explosive arrow tip after a couple you know Moby Dick misadventures yeah oh you got dragged under oh yeah yeah row out there yeah yeah just like poke it we got you yeah how did they kill it before they had big boats they must have had to have a shit ton of boats and surrounded and everybody throw one in there and just keep doing it I'll take I'll take none of that it's just it's a there's certain animals that you just feel real bad when they die and whales are one of them they're just too smart they're too smart they're too big and they're too majestic and how much do you need a lamp is there other ways to make a lamp or lipstick these are for like lipstick read in the daytime relax well apparently shark's liver is something that a lot of makeup and moisturizers and stuff have in it no shit yeah they did they did this DNA test on certain makeups and they found out that shark liver for whatever reasons like this excellent moisturizer how good do you think that makes vegetarians feel like yeah you're just wiping some shark liver all over your face big deal yeah vegan makeup sucks when I was looking for the some of the animals from the tsunamis and I found that in a wild sorry I hadn't heard yet oh yeah sea creatures still arriving in the US on plastic debris from the Japanese tsunami eight years ago whoa perfect marine biologist don't know how long different species can survive adrift in the open ocean some may become invasive when they reach new shores Wow it's something like 300 different kinds of animals have made it over to the shore that's like a it's like a Starbucks organic take out on cuttings yeah I think that's like a you know one of those pictures they use all the time yeah so the tsunami washed boats plastic docks oh I know that they did in San Francisco they would find stuff that was like Japanese riding on it like some stuff that it drifted across but the fucking weird animals the weird animals that they found on the bottom of the ocean they're weird heartless looking fucks yet like half of them are blind and see-through yeah yeah and they they're luminescent like they they have color light that comes out of their body what is this one bioluminescent yeah all the weird stuff they found anyway yeah so when you were under that thing like did you come in contact with any animals did anything bump the the now I think this was the closest we ever came was some dolphins were close and then do they get curious they do that so you can hear him you can hear him oh and you're under there I think oh yeah and whales - we were in Maui doing some training and we heard some some whales as they were migrating you have seen them Maui a bunch anywheres close yeah we did a boat thing where you go out and try to find the way fucking cool it's wild man did you don't realize how big they are until you're right next to them yeah you're up next to it you're like oh that's a school bus yeah with a brain yeah and a smart school bus yeah and then orcas those are the freakiest those are just giant dolphins yeah but they eat dolphins yeah I want no I want no part of that either they're really nice to people though that's what's really interesting to me about orcas is that in captivity it's the only place that they've like documented that they've actually hurt people kill people in the ocean they actually help people sometimes like people fall in the water they like help them up onto the boat like I don't know why they would do that like why do they like us what the fuck dolphins up maybe they're so smart but the ones out there like don't take me don't take me no I'm just gonna help you out like pick another right maybe they're so smart that they're like listen these motherfuckers have guns they have planes and they can shoot guns out of planes you have thumbs yeah let's just help them back on the boat yes be their friend yeah this some the fact that we're still here in 2020 and they have SeaWorld whether they make those fucking things do tricks for fish oh man that shit is dark it's super dark it's dark that might as well be slavery I it's like a different animal I mean a different kind of human is that of an intelligent creature that you're yet keeping in a fucking swimming pool I feel so bad for all of them in not just like not just the aquariums but like zoos too it kills me like you go somewhere and you know like oh there's polar bear that's really cool they painted the whole place like it's snow yeah meanwhile it's fuck 65 yeah come on yeah I understand they're doing a lot of good work in the back end but yeah do we really need to put them on display like I know it's weird like a gift shop I went to this wolf connection recently which is like a wolf sanctuary out in your Palmdale and these people are doing great work they're really nice people they're taking care of these wolves and it's mostly black people get wolves and try to keep them as pets and they realize they can't they can't control like a hoarder wolf 4/8 wolf type of animals some of them but most of them like a 7/8 wolf like okay wolf and a lot of them one of them was like all wolfy like a couple of them are all wolf but you feel bad when you're out there cuz you want those fucking things to be free yeah like you see him and you're like I love the fact that you're taking care of him I love the fact that you care but but I wish they were just out there running around like you don't belong in here yeah and long somewhere in Montana and they castrate them they fix them because they don't want to making babies isn't it isn't it weird how we kind of whitewash that statement yeah it's it's a fixed animal yeah yes you get up no you cuz balls off yeah just say it say what you did and everybody does that and it's it's a weird thing man like I went to a vet once with my old dog Johnny Cash and when I brought him in the the vet goes she touches his balls she was wise he still have these I go cuz that they make testosterone and that's what keeps him healthy like what are you talking about he was born with those I'm never a reason I'm not gonna let him fuck the dogs and heat and make babies he's with me all the time he's not gonna disappear yeah it's not like he's gonna fucking get out make a bunch of babies like this is a well cared for dog in a nice yard like he's good trust me yeah he doesn't have to get his balls chopped off and my vet that I had a vet it was a good friend wound up dying in a drunk driving accident fucking asshole slammed in luck but he told me he goes it's not necessary he goes and it does affect the dog's energy level it does affect the dog's hormonal growth like whether if you do it when a dog's really young they never grow to full maturity they sort of stay like a puppy for a long time yeah and I had a dog like that that we got it was a rescue dog lashing wasn't a rescue dog we got from a pet store and he had been castrated really young pastor so you did rescue it yes I guess I did yeah it wasn't my idea with my wife got him but he was a bitch he was just hated every other dog hated you know he growl growl at kids and he just was always insecure cuz like he never grew up with testosterone like when he was little he was a boner yeah I mean when I'm we got him was like six months old he was early clip and it's really just us as humans being lazy as an animal owner yeah right right not you don't want to control it you don't want to Train it was just castrated so it can't make this is already did yeah and we won't make it that that's a standard spay and neuter your pets Bob Barker says yeah yeah I mean you don't have to spay and neuter your pet like females is different because they will bleed all over your house and they go in heat and it's a different animal I mean I understand it but still but still like yeah come on right right yeah it's your choice to own that thing right or to partner with it really unless it's a cab oh yeah cuz that motherfucker will spray all of your house if you have a male cat you better kind of balls off I had a male cat that did it anyway he was a wild cat mm-hmm I caught used feral and he would piss all over my fucking house man here just lift his tail up and spray like right in front of you you little fuck that's when I had to get him fixed I had him get him fixed he was like I guess he was probably six or seven months old when I finally had to get him fixed and I could pet him but I could only pet him if I move towards him slowly like we we had a weird relationship me and that cat I mean it's it's basically a lion it's just it's only five pounds yeah it would fuck you up oh dude try to like he was feral I mean it was really fair like when I got him he was a baby and my friend actually found him her and her boyfriend were staying at this apartment and below the apartment there was like this opening and like that was like a you know a little crawl space area and this cat had a bunch of kittens so her and her boyfriend rescued these kittens and then she started giving them away to people and I'm a sucker so I'm like I'll take one of these I got a home and it was like spitting at me and fuck I had to lock myself in a room with this cat for like two or three days I just brought books I put a litter box in there oh man I brought books and I put a bed in there and just me and this fucking cat in this guest room of my house we're gonna be hung out together for days dude was crazy like I'd pet him a bit he would purse so loud when I pet him he was so happy and then as soon as I let him go he'd like yes try to fucking climb up the curtains I'm like oh my god this is never gonna work out I was like what have I got myself into what I just only tear and then my other cat was outside and she was like dad what the fuck are you doing in there with this cat this is crazy cuz I couldn't couldn't have her home but once that helped when I let her in after like a day or two and she would come right up to me to start purring I patter and the cat was like oh okay he's not eating her hmm he was not gonna eat me either and but by the time he was getting older and developing you know he was getting ready to breed he just starts spraying all over my house so I had to capture him and bring him to the vet sure that was entertaining dude it was a battle I mean a fucking battle just me and him locked down in this bathroom and I was trying I wound up throwing a robe over him wrapping him up in towels then stuffing him in a hamper and then taping the top of the hamper oh my god and then bringing him to my friend dr. Craig and go bro I could fuck a wild cat that I need to stay and he just looked like what are you talking about has balls removed this has to end yeah it's weird what we do with the animals man but it's but you can't really let let feral cats wild cats in particular outdoor cats are responsible for billions of deaths billion yeah have you seen the numbers it's crazy like small birds small birds and rodents it's in the billions I mean is this and that's just in North America they don't call mousers for nothing yeah it's a stunning number yeah but you can learn from those little fuckers like like you want good spot and stalk tactics if you're a bow hunter ah check why should we cat moves like the way they like have their front paws they don't even put it down yet like you know he's looking he's looking he's looking nose and they have it get from the jump get lower nobody has to teach you a shirt I mean from the jump they have these instincts free and net and that's a housecat yeah a housecat on a mountain lion it's on a tiger that's a housecat have you ever counted the mountain why didn't we talk about those we did talk about it so I saw one when I was all the videos one of my favorite videos play that Jaime this video is this fucking deer go into a drinking I go just have a little drink of water here look at the eyes behind the eyes that's a wrap boom like a fucking super athlete through mouth first yeah into the throat yeah I got you bitch and then the claws just grab ahold so they can get a good clamp down on the throat big cats are scary dude there's a bug that's what I'm telling you to hone ranch they have a camera trap over a waterhole and in that one pond they found 16 different cats 16 different poundage predatory cats yeah they're everywhere eating a deer day or whatever they do yeah probably one a week for sure oh yeah you know that's why California's how many deer California this is the fact this but it's very hard to find deer out here they should be everywhere right if you think about the fact it's no one's hunting them like we're all the deer coyotes and mountain lions well that's where all the Dan it's a trickle-down thing right like there used to be grizzly bears there used to be a lot of other predators yeah it would push those things around because they keep those numbers down like they're kind of cats aren't gonna breed like that if there's if there's koreas or wolves that are also feeding on the same food source yeah but there's none of that so the cats are like let's fucking do this yeah it's so weird it's weird that people don't recognize that's not good to keep them in high numbers around people yeah you know they wind up killing them but they don't it's all done under cover of darkness it's all done by state you know Dean is irregular but then they don't sell the tags for that so they don't make any money off of it which they could yeah they crank back into conservation well it's it's the craziest thing to say that the people they like there's no way mountain lions supposedly is one of the best tasting meats you can eat I've heard these they say it's like a superior pork and this is not just from one person Greentree told me that Adam Greentree told me that Steve Rinella told me that fucking everybody tells me that they say it's delicious I've heard yeah Ryan Callahan said they did like uh slow I think he slow cooked a mountain-lion quarter on the trigger we said it was spectacular what a cool thing to tell ya like house guests oh yeah yes we're gonna have some still cook mountain lion yeah that's a weird one though you kill a mountain lion you better not put that shit on social media oh my god yeah yeah people already get upset about like pigs and those are tearing up the Bears or taking words oh yeah bear and also because they don't understand that you eat bear and the bear delicious yeah and that you have to kill them it's like that's an animal that you actually have to kill I had berries in my freezer yeah me too it's good yeah they're good yeah yeah it's and that was your first hunt right what was yeah that was a hilarious phone call well you had only been doing archery for how long zero I had been doing archery for a grand total of no time really oh yeah so you learned on the fly so um Andy gives me a ring and he's like hey man somebody dropped out of this hunt do you want to go Mike yeah no questions asked okay he goes all right here's some shit you got to do it's like you have to book a ticket to Kansas and like when he goes next Wednesday so essentially I like I think was like a week or two I flew out to meet dud and Andy and Chad Mendes was out there oh they were doing a turkey hunt and I was just there to like watch and observe and learn how to shoot the bow from dead so you flew out mm-hmm never shot a bow before never touched one never touched a bow before just watch John motherfucking Dudley the Yoda is coaching you Oh in Kansas yep in a bar in a barn yeah wow dude that guy's so selfless with his time I have told so many people I've never met somebody at that kind of station in life that gives away more of their time now he's crazy he's incredible he's a real evangelist for archery yeah you know thank you John yeah no he's awesome he's uh like he's changed the way so many people approach archery to like oh yeah from a technical standpoint he's changing the game yeah hundred percent it's such a this another thing we're talking about last night too that it's such a therapeutic thing for veterans yeah it's so because you know it's such an intense activity and it's such an over what there's such a deep learning curve there's so much to get from it it's a forever sport yeah you will never be perfect at archery yeah never and if you think you ever will be just look at duds social media channels and that fucker shoots every damn day no and every day he's like oh yeah I could be better and you can always make a bad shot absolutely you get on everybody can screw up yeah yeah archery is a weird thing but the success that you do get from it it's so like I've I've hunted with a rifle before and it's very satisfying it's great to eat that meat I had to it's great I mean it really is the best meat in the world and any way you can get it is great you know through ethical means yes but the difference between the way it feels when I'm cooking an elk steak that's from a bow hunt versus something that I shot with a rifle it's not even comparable yeah it's it's something special too because you're so close to those animals to like yeah what's a bomber shot with about a hundred yards I've never even attempted something like that but that's what I mean like that would be ridiculous that's an offhand shot with a rifle barely yeah you could probably do it with irons pretty reasonably run or a decent rifle shot yeah yeah if you could lie on the side people are shooting shit at a thousand yards like yeah it's something special when you close in on an animal and you can hear it eating right right yeah you hear it breathing you can hear your heartbeat in your ears and you see its ears twitch yeah the draw the bow gets drawn back and your doing the and you're like like doing the okay so your first hunt you go on an archery black bear hunt yeah so you had zero Tom Dudley out does he fit you the four weeks yeah so well he had me go to Bob's place to froms okay so hats off to Bob from performance for measuring me for that's in San Diego and he knew that I was going in there um to get measured for dead so like I let him know ahead of time so he took a lot of time out of the day to help me fit and feel like this is what this is gonna be like and you know more than happy to help it was great I show up dead opens up a case and he's like here it is arrows built boats built Wow oh my god super cool teaches me how to shoot and then he's hike all right dude you got four weeks every day and I'm gonna need to see videos the first whole week that's such a crash course to go from just shooting a bow to four weeks later you doing a fair chase wild bear hunt yeah that's so crazy and you know what a hundred percent it was duds doing but I hit both of those bears right in the Boilermaker mmm I saw that I saw that yeah I saw the video of it and when you when you were eating those bears how weird that feel it was it was incredible alright so I didn't grow up in a family that hunted not out of moral or ethical we just you know I grew up in LA so what am I gonna hunt house cats right it's not a lot here yep pigeons so it felt really cool and for me I immediately fell in love with the entire process the amount of practice it takes how difficult it is what it's like to share that meat with other people mmm that big one right I've been giving away so much meat and I'm more than happy to I really enjoy it yeah I do too I try to explain that to people like some of my best enjoyable moments when I get like a text message from someone like my friend Michael yo I gave him a bunch of me dude this is fucking delicious or my friend Tom Papa will send me photos of these uh like Elk Grove City cooks yeah it's nice it's phenomenal yeah so to be able to do that that feeling is so hard to describe to somebody with something that start to finish you're responsible for the entire thing yeah yeah being a provider it's a very underappreciated thing like being able to provide for people yeah and give them something that's like it's it's very intimate when you give someone like a package of meat from something that you shot yourself like hey this is coming you from Montana like cook it up well yeah thank you you let me pictures it feels so cool to do it yeah but that's not why I'm I'm just happy that they look at me like this tastes so good yeah no yeah you should do it too it's something that cool about cooking for people too if you could do that I love love doing that how'd you - it's like cooking for people I can't cook a meal like I do a lot of cooking in my house most of it I think probably my Roy would agree but uh cooking for like a group of friends and like laying out especially if it's like cooking something that you've killed yourself it's amazing yep I've done it a ton of times you went carnivore for a while right you did that carnivore diet about two years ago how long did you do it for um so you were early adopter almost nine weeks yeah yeah when did you what made you bail out of it variety not really variety so I started doing some what what is essentially middle ish longer distances like marathon length mm-hmm and I was starting to come back into doing strengths stuff like a lot of dead lifting and some power activities mm-hmm and I just really I wasn't feeling all there like I felt like I could get almost to fifth gear but it just wasn't in it right well you needed carbs yeah like a little and I'm talking like apples or something yeah so I essentially started putting a little bit of carbs in and I still only eat like maybe a hundred grams of carbs a day mmm which is on the bottom end of very little and what kind of carbs you take you man alright for the most part so when I'm at home eating how I want to eat it's mostly white race because easy to digest super easy to digest yeah yeah and like whatever is in the vegetables in a meeting which are mostly root vegetables mm-hmm do you know who Jack better is I do yeah is that so Zac who holds the world record for the fastest 24 hour run is uh he's mostly meat based it's mostly what he eats it's really interesting because he freaks the plant-based people out they get so upset like how what he's eating their portion - yeah you don't eat it it's like you're supposed to be getting all these diseases and how you're supposed to be dad it's supposed to be sick it's it's such a dumb idea that meat is what's causing all these people to be sick meanwhile 97% of people eat meat like it's some 95 and the healthy the healthiest genetic populations are mostly animal protein based well there's a few that are not there's a few of these Blue Zones like and I think it's your Belinda there's uh this is a Seventh day Adventists that live out there that only vegetables that sounds right I think that's where the vegan vegetarian process over started happening right thing about those people though is they're also like really active and fit and they don't drink you know they're so they're their whole lifestyle is very healthy so there's not just that there's not ingredients vegetable base oh yeah man I had this guy Aubrey de Grey on and he's a biologist that's working on life extension and one of the things that we talked about where it's sort of underappreciated is community friendship and a lack of stress and people that even when the encounter stress they don't give a fuck like that there's a real there's a real benefit to not giving a fuck and I think you have bitchu ate it too right like you create these habits of well that stresses me out I flick that guy oh man oh man oh man you're just piling it up on you know the shelves in your head as opposed to like I'm relatively even queue about a lot of things yeah but it took a long time for me to have the app whatever that doesn't affect me uh-huh yeah it's it's a learned skill fuck yeah you gotta practice it - yeah you have to be on top of it all the time yeah you really do I mean I would imagine dealing with anti-war people there's got to be one of the more difficult things to to leave alone like people that I mean I don't know if you've encountered rude people that insult you for your service or that kind of shit I haven't had that specifically online not really really that's amazing maybe it's maybe it's just because I try actively trying to avoid that kind of stuff yeah because there's there's just no benefit there right like that that person isn't trying to have a discussion we're kind of tell me how it is yeah it doesn't matter and they're trying to rile you up damn right yeah and that's gonna make them feel good to round me up yeah I'm already riled up like I don't need that that's fine I've seen people go at it with people online like I've seen Dakota Dakota Meyer so you can go out it with people online and I just want to tell him like bro just get out get out of there everybody's brave online yeah like it's so easy to tell somebody like hey you're a pussy when you're not three fever you're talking to a guy who killed somebody with a rock yeah you know precisely yeah just shut the fuck up just seriously yeah you have no idea what you're talking about call that guy a pussy is one of the dumbest things a person could say on this earth in your life he's uh he's such an interesting guy and one of the things that we talked about was that I do my best to try to get guys on that are veterans that have these stories just to try to let just gives people just lease another little piece to the puzzle this never-ending puzzle of what these people are experiencing what people argue and him and all these different people Andy and Andy and Jocko and everybody else that I've had on that served and I was saying last night I'm like I appreciate it like you know it's a thank you from all of us for letting those stories get out and having the kind of open discussion that it allows right so at least I can do the fuckin great format for it I appreciate you guys so much yeah it's and it's um I don't think I don't think he gets talked about enough I don't think these stories get out and I mean Jocko obviously has them on his podcast quite a bit where he discusses different operations and different things that went down and what it's like and loss and you know yeah and Andy does as well and there's a there's a shit ton of podcast now from veterans which is nice but it's just one of those it's it's a necessary part of our culture on our society in order to keep us safe and for whatever reason it doesn't get respected the way it should it's been part of human history since you know we could throw rocks at each other yeah and one of the things that drives me crazy more than anything was we were doing this benefit when the UFC did a bunch we've done a bunch of fight for the troops events yeah on bases and we did it for the intrepid center for excellence that treats people with traumatic brain injury and we were raising money for them and it was so hard for me during the broadcast to not just start swearing and screaming like how the fuck are we not raising the money how is this not a thing how is this a thing you have to ask for money from people to donate yeah like wow you know I want to find out where the budget is more important than taking care of the veterans when they come home what what's more important who you know who's getting who's getting all that money where's that money going to where's it being allocated and wasted where it's not being spent on these guys coming back home dealing with traumatic injuries from serving their country and it's not as if there's a ton of us right there fucking art like there's not that many guys right overall and yeah grants Keeler pop compared to the what 350 plus million people in the United States is it that many now we'll be trying to figure it out what's the current population is it 350 I feel like it was 320 just like a couple of cents this gets done this year so did not count Mexicans so there's no idea there's no I did and this is distributed asterisks like like in like in baseball my Mexican friends out there I don't mean any disrespect I'm with you sneak in do what you got to do don't get me wrong live your life but the reality is there's a lot more you motherfuckers here there's a lot more you motherfuckers here than there they're gonna count especially illegals they don't they're just guessing yeah the only illegal Mexicans are here they gotta be guessing so yes and the Mexicans probably look at the numbers like 12 what do you think it is oh yeah that's it 8 million in the whole country oh yeah I might might be a little less there's 20 million people and the great Angeles area and there's probably another 8 Meg about 8 million Mexicans like I mean Mexican citizens that are here Eagle yeah yeah probably more there's a lot I mean you're guessing I'm guess I'm just guessing I'm just guessing and again don't get testy if you're Mexican I'm not this is no disrespect I would fucking sneak over here tell you that right now if I was living in Guadalajara yeah fuck yeah rather be a landscaper a cow can drink beer at 8 o'clock fine I'm good games over kick back relax no I'm not being shot at by the cartel yes I'm in yeah I'll take it scariest thing I got to deal with is like filling my truck up got it yeah exactly yeah dude I mean I I know quite a few people that have made it over here yeah through hook or by crook it's gotta be weird to be in Mexico and just look over there like damn over there I could do whatever the fuck I want hey I'm on this side of the river I gotta hang out this is so crazy take it it's weird when there's like a fucking of just a spot and if you get to that other spot things are better dude and some of its really crazy like I recently watched a movie called queen of the desert was that which is about a woman early early 1900s she was in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq ended up being friends with Lawrence of Arabia and she essentially helped carve out what is now Iraq Syria Lebanon just like you know you got to think after World War one they picked up a map the Middle East and they're like mmm mmm rack yeah okay they're just made lines on a map yeah now they tried to like put some of the people groups that we're all like oh yeah here's where the sounds are here's you know they tried to put all the people groups in the right spot but a lot of those nations they kind of created at the end of that conflict what's the weirdest place that you hear it is right there Queen of the desert Nicole Kidman James Franco Robert Pattinson Oh Werner Herzog movie who's he's he's the director of my all-time favorite comedy Grizzly Man it's a accidental comedy have you seen that movie no you haven't seen Grizzly Man I don't think do this one if I can one of the best movies I've ever see is it it's fucking great it's about Timothy Treadwell guy and it's like I'm out here saving these bears like bitch ain't saving shit that's an 18-pound enormous wild dog you're not saving that thing he's he's gonna eventually eat you and it was suicide by bear me up that guy was so weird that that movie is really funny man it's really fun I'll have to pull it up I'm gonna watch it yeah dude spark could join up and watch that movie you you'll be like what the fuck is this guy doing that thing's looking at him right now like look at this snack it just doesn't know that it could eat them that's all it is she's figuring it out yeah it just doesn't know what it is now how weird is that I'm sure you've seen it bears in places that have probably not seen humans yeah like the younger ones then look at you like yeah what is that weird thing over there well you said you said that you ran into one right we ran into a yeah like a jet-black grizzly bear that's so weird this black one oh yeah I've never seen a black one pull a picture of a jet-black grizzly bear they're a thing oh yeah they're there the really light blonde sometimes oh yeah they're terrifying looking I can imagine it's like a werewolf yeah bigger than a werewolf easily they're so big man Grizzlies are so big bigger than a horse I was telling you that I only saw one once in the wild that looked at me and it was a small one it was only like a 6-foot bear yeah but the way that motherfucker looked at me just looked at me like just thinking do I bust a move it was just hungry and trying to figure out what it what it's gonna eat looking through your soul it just lets you know what was when you lock eyes with that like right away it lets you know like okay this is what it's like to be a deer I'm part of the food sister like that all that thing is doing is looking for someone slipping yeah who's slipping out here who's a deer limping what's up here about to give birth to a calf yep oh shit let me get close to that fawn let me pull that moose calf out yeah they bears up there II 50% of all the calves and fawns that's insane yeah 50% so vedere has two babies a bear eats one and then oh my god yeah crazy and they eat black bears yeah see they you know they're bears yeah I was telling you that that my friend Jonathan up there John and my friend John and Jen the rivets mm-hmm they have this place up in Alberta and their son Jonathan was there when a bear a male bear killed a cub and then the female the mother chased him off the dead cub after he killed it and then she ate it she ate her own cub I mean just meet at that point well hungry sir but no hesitation she just ate it dude they're terrifying they're terrifying but that's a weird animal that people associate with cuddliness and warmness and there's been little teddy bear dude how could you kill a bear and they are fucking tough and terrifying yeah I shot a big boar this last spring and when we got up to that thing he had scars all over his face and bruises when we skinned him I'm like dude this fucker was just an he just fought another bear yeah they went to war yeah like a war they're terrifying did you find a photo of a black grizzly bear it's very hard for Google to understand what I'm looking for looking for I just wants to give me black bear Oh American black bear look looks like a grizzly bear but hmm okay I mean I'm fine but they do maybe color phase grizzly bear was just a black bear yeah did you see that black bear that they shot in New Jersey that 700 pounds last week what yeah yeah 700 pounds yeah the world record bottom I might not have been last week but the last week was in the in the stories they were talking about this guy they've established it's a world record world record black bear taken with a bow in new jersey new jersey apparently is the highest population of black bears in the entire country in the entire of North America well there's nothing to Jack with them yeah well it's not that it's it is that definitely that but it's also like they're so silly with hunting they're they're so with their weird with their restrictions and they've now change it the government stepped and I'm gonna stop a bear hunt that's good let them breed you fucking need more of this yeah you need let them breed everywhere you dummy that's what that's what we need is like a 700 pound raccoon look at the pumpkin head on that motherfucker oh my god 700 pounds he shot it with a bow juice there's photos of them Jamie where it's him standing next to the thing that's a long time ago it's enormous that's a big the biggest black bear ever it's the biggest black bear anybody's ever shot with a bow good for you dude that's a that's a crazy place New Jersey because it's really close to New York but it's also a really rural a lot of New Jersey's like forests and woods a lot of the Northeast is em hmm a kid got killed a couple years back at Rutgers by a bear him and his buddies went how scary would that be yeah I know you're in college yeah I'm just gonna go with my friends when I go for a little hike love nature oh no the size of that fuck holy shit litter is like a it's like a grizzly commit on that thing yeah 700 pounds is so large I've never been seen I've seen one that's 500 that boar that I shot we think was somewhere in the mid low threes and he was a huge there it is there's a photo of it yeah it's like a grizzly yeah that's so big man what are like the main differences like the face size yeah face size and shape the words behave Greece has like a big hump on their shoulders and they're pissed off at the universe yeah like when you always when you see them apparently and I said like I said I've only seen one live in the in the woods and it was about six feet so it wasn't that big for it was a probably a baby really yeah only a couple years old but my friend John says that what happens is like the black bears come in real slow and gentle and they're looking around and they want to make sure there's no Grizzlies around the Grizzlies come and they just start knocking shit down making they make all the noise in the fucking world they don't give a shit that bear that we saw it was tracking us while we were tracking that black bear did exactly that the second I looked over because he like made a tiny tiny but in the tiniest bit of noise and we were you know tracking this other bear so we're listening real close and I hear this thing and I look over and it does exactly that see as we see it stomps on the ground and just starts knocking shit over and or pounds off making a shit ton of noise dude how big was it it was buzzing big probably like you know six seven it was not a huge but it's great thing about the cruiser bear had attitude dude the thing was pissed off we saw it wasn't even it was just pissed we saw it yeah they don't eat you know they don't eat if they don't get aggressive like they have to he's gotta be the king and also he's probably trying to eat your bear right oh he did he did eat it oh yeah that's it yeah we left it we abandon the search because that's not worth the guy more power to it like Ashley I've hunted with him now a couple times he's like yeah um I think that you got that bear we went back until dud and he's like you really think you got it real good and that's when we ended up seeing the bear it was when him back the second time too and he's like I don't know man like yeah this isn't worth it you have your 7mm with four rounds and I have my bow yeah let's not play this game in a bunch of deadfall with a grizzly bear yeah make sure you definitely kill it how fast are you dog I saw a video once of a bear charging this guy yeah and he literally shoots it at the tip of the rifle oh my god the head is where you are and he shoots it like this boom it brains it goes face-plants and slides in towards him so I asked Ashley like what are we gonna do if we run into this thing and he goes well it'll probably Bluff charge us and then it'll really char just maybe oh my how so well when do we shoot it and he goes well if the ears are pinned back that means it's for real don't miss like oh my fucking Lord Jesus Christ yeah but that's part of the whole like hunting experience and you know providing the meat and doing the whole thing it's part of the thing yeah it's damn terrifying but it's part of the processor you're like no we really are just you know walking jelly donuts they're out here hunting other things yeah yeah we're walking water balloons I just have sharp sticks like yeah real cool especially when you see a grizzly bear oh god it's just it's with the the cool thing about it is I mean you definitely don't want them to not be there same with wolves and with mountain lions it's hard for people to understand like the cool thing is it there's part of it being that country yeah that's part of what's exciting about it ABB's when you're in Montana part of what's exciting is you might run into a grizzly bear it might see a wolf I don't know you know it's like woo woo to say it but it does feel like your genetics are lit off yes you know when you see that stuff for like I was I was mushroom dogs with a buddy of mine up in Alaska last month and Oh normal shit these mushrooms he's he's wild he and I were in buzz together so he has like a real sled for him yeah he races whoa he's a cool dude why Jeff it frozen Trident wow that's crazy um we've heard dogs out while mushing wolves howling and it lights off your genetics like you're out there mush and dogs in the snow and you hear these howls and you're like okay I've heard wolves in BC it's wild freedom in the distance never heard of them up close but in the distance here yeah it's weird sound I want to hear it real loud you know I'd love to hear it real loud up close yeah it's Darryl they're all amazing grizzly bears mountain lions all those apex predators yeah so your first one was in BC your first hunt was in BC with Dudley yeah how far was the shot 22 yards how that's nice yeah that's good to keep it tight yeah I mean it took us a couple days and then I stocked up on one I actually ended up taking a shot from my knees no because there was like a gap in the in the bush that the bear was on the other side of yeah bear did not know I was there did you guys cook the bear that night um I think we might have had some that night I think we had some like fajitas or something that night oh wow bear for Heda yeah Dudley shot I don't know if it was the same year but he told me that they shot some bears that were eating onions and that was that year was it yeah and he cooked it with wild onions we went up and picked a crap ton of onions I don't know it's a whole hill covered in like wild onions they're like this size I think there was something that he was saying that someone actually planted them there at one point done then they became wild huh that makes sense yeah like a homesteader so what the experience of you going up there and doing a spot in stock which is one of the hardest kind of hunts to do mm-hmm like and while you were doing this like what the fuck is happening like four weeks ago I never even had a bow now Here I am with a in the wood with a couple hundred pound predatory animal yeah on the other end of a sharp stick yeah it was a it was super intense and I loved every second of it like it was lighting off all the pieces of shit that I felt that was going on when I was team guy and it was lighting off things that I didn't think we're getting lit off in my brain you know like way deep down the consequences and the experience all of it you know you're you can hear your heartbeat it's fucking wild yeah and for a bear to be the first thing I'm taking with a bow I'm like I cannot Jack this up yeah there is no missing here there's some severe consequences yeah let alone I would feel like dog shit if I write moon did this thing because I chose to practice as much as I did which was a shit ton and still screw it up right you know I was elated when I heard that thing and ashes that guy man let's let's wait a little bit and like make sure it expires did you hear the death moan no no because we went into the bush like 15 20 minutes after to let it expire he's like I yeah let's go track this thing he pushes through the bushes he's like never mind it's right there that died quick I went right through the heart like double lung and heart so it didn't even there's nothing there oh wow it made it when I shot it because it was exhaling already oh so there was nothing for it to moan the death was weird I heard the board this year do it it's weird oh man yeah it makes you realize how real it is yeah cuz it's a that predators have a different response to being hit then a prey animal does yeah they don't they don't run off yeah I'm too freaked out right they're not trying to get away no they're trying to attack whatever bit them trying to maneuver yeah they're maneuvering on you yeah they're rolling and trying to get to the arrow trying to figure out what's happening then and then they're like fighting it off as they die yeah when you first ate it so you shoot it and then there you are eating it did you guys eat in camp yeah yeah they're at bear camp what were you like holy shit what am I doing here this is wild pretty much and then knowing I still have another bear attack yeah well they have to choose minis that can up there right that control there's so many pairs yeah B C's crazy like that and then they've outlawed the grizzly season yes I'm strange reason the people that I know that live up there like my friend Mike awkward she lives up there it's like he'll tell you like there's so many Grizzlies up there it's scary and the fact that they can't hunt them now it's like these people in the city that have no idea what it's like they've never been to the bush yeah and then you know they think big brown cuddly yeah they believe these are amazing majestic animals yeah that eat their own babies they are there that and anything else and say it's a garbage disposal yeah cleanup crew so that was your first hunt yeah so how hooked were you all in immediate like beyond immediately hooked and how many hunts you're planning a year now as many as I can reasonably think that I can eat the meat and do did you shot one of the biggest moves I've ever seen in my life and the fact you did that like what a year and a half into bow hunting yeah I ended up shooting that moose with a rifle oh did you we were both hunting and we were so the story ends up being kind of neat because of the size of that damn thing it's the only reason it had to be with a rifle because it was so big that so we called him in and called him in and called him in for like 40 minutes and the guide actually again he's like you know I can hear it can hear it and moose make the fucking weirdest noise Oh Mike yeah okay I can hear that and we got to the edge of a little lake it was about 200 yards wide but it was like a quarter mile long with a bog all the way around the whole thing we get down to this lake he's calling he's doing it like the horny female mmm-hmm and this fucker comes out of the bush like three or four hundred yards away from us on the other side of the lake Ashley's got is buying us up and he goes Jesus Christ that's biggest miss I've ever seen wait Thanks okay yeah and I see him and he gets to the edge of the lake and we called him for like a half an hour they just kept waving his antlers at us doing the yeah bitch come over here right bitch come over here also it's probably met a person or two by then that size yeah he was huge and they think he was about ten so he kept doing that kept doing that kept doing that and I'm like dude I really want to get him with a bow can we please try and get him to swim across because there's no way we're gonna be able to get around right for him and me to get a shot just wasn't gonna happen in that bog and we never would have seen that guy again it had already been three and a half days of hunting I had only seen one animal and he's like hey man you can use the rifle if you want to do it and credit to the amount of training that we go through I grab that thing and I'm like alright dude well if that moves hops in the water I'm handing you this damn rifle and I'm gonna shoot it with a bow but if he turns broadside and tries to walk around the lake it's gonna take till nighttime which it was getting towards Twilight I'm gonna hammer him and that thing turned broadside to walk around the lake and I hammered him yeah that's the move you have to its distribute I really wanted the meat oh yeah I badly I he could have had no pot like he could had the tiniest little paddle wouldn't a cared he was just bonus and everybody there was like I can't believe you only been hunting for a year you asshole it's pretty crazy well let me go to Thompson was it Thompson underscore para-sports I met so I changed Trevor Thompson Oh you trained when did you change it how recently oh it's like you know I'm just gonna flatten this out and then does all the old followers follow with you yeah how'd you do that how do you do that just change the name you just edit your name mm-hmm yeah it's tough to find out if it's available in zonas and then you keep all the same yep oh wow that is I didn't know that so do you have a photo of that thing up there right I believe see Jamie's into you jut Dudley definitely has deadly Jeffers does this beautiful grid so mmm so these aren't really individual photos what's up he's got this cool oh you're doing this that crazy fan how do you do that sky upload moles yeah yeah though there's an app that does that you gotta keep the great got upload three every time now though oh it gets a little silly well that's pretty cool meow looks really good so if you scroll down Jamie I wanted me cutting up that moose me like the tomahawk steaks you see that do you have like an artist's Instagram page this is not like a okay keep going yep I over here Oh keep going just a little bit right there so hit that one and then scroll over and there is wow that thing is so big how much do you think that thing weighed so they they guessed he was like 1500 1500 cuz I pulled so I butchered the whole thing and I pulled about 500 pounds of meat off of him sure god damn you guys wants to eat that the entire time we were there we killed fuck we killed about 3 mils 3 formas wow so we had a lot of moose in camp fucking delicious though oh my god it's so delicious the most incredible meat Jamie go back to the the photo grid and scroll back up hold on scroll down again would it would I want to see keep going keep going keep going yeah that's the start of it there alright we'll go back up then there was something that I can't damn I don't remember I wanted to ask you a question about something no no forget it it's too hard when someone scrolling you legit no back up yeah I forget what it was so when you went when you guys were there like how deep in the woods were you um miles and miles from the nearest real road did you guys get in with Rangers or did you yeah so I can they called sidekicks right yeah and so how they get how'd you get all the meat out on those thing man that was an adventure so we get we get around the lake which totally solidified me being happy about shooting him with a rifle because it took us almost an hour to get around the lake to where he was dead and that was us just hoofing it like hard not worried about anything that's out there and we got him gutted and then we ended up leaving him overnight because it was about to be dark and it was cold out real cold came back the next day cut him in half went and got a canoe canoed each half across the lake individually Wow and then drug him up the hill with the help of a ATV and Dudley and dusty and Ashley it was like a 14-hour day of recovering that moose and John's Miss Jesus Christ it was insane there's such big animals you don't it's hard to understand how big they are until you get one quartered and it's still 150 to 200 pounds yeah when you see it on the ground that's an you realize like whoa I could crawl inside the thing like a tauntaun and did you get a commercial freezer so you could ya keep popping up 14 cubic footer okay yeah big-ass one oh yeah yeah just to fill the money is it so that's mostly what you eat is just moose right now moose elk whitetail javelina I have all sorts of stuff in there do you feel different when you eat that kind of food absolutely I've never felt better in my life there's something to that right it's not just psychological it's not just voodoo you know if it's the you are which you eat type of thing mm-hmm that is an athlete that is the product of other athletes that have survived being eaten killed and destroyed by weather and you get to kill it and eat it and it's so fresh and if you're choosing to eat really well along with it like white rice and and root vegetables or however you're doing it man do you feel good eating that it's an athlete that's how I always refer to it I say it's like eating a giant LeBron James like a super athlete yeah super athlete yeah like if if an animal was a predator of human beings looking for the best human beings to eat it would probably want to eat like giant NFL players or a UFC fighter or you know what I mean did one eat brock lesnar like look at that fucking looks delicious look at him look look is neck maybe that's how that crazy bears looking at you so hard probably who you look good get a snack out of that motherfucker yeah it's um it's hard to describe people it's hard to describe to people what it feels like to just dip your foot into the food chain for a little bit and come back with something and then to think about it all the time like Andy said it best he's like it's like I have a pin in every September there's like there's a pin on September I like get ready for September yes here it comes and when that when that month comes around for us the big ones elk hunting and when that comes around you're in the mountains it's hard to contain your excitement you're like holy shit it's happening again yeah there's all these different emotions like make sure you do it right make sure you play the wind right make sure you don't get busted gear check yeah make sure you your arrows are shooting well make sure you're you're thinking about your release perfectly you're doing it all and you're using a silverback right yeah that's the only thing I've ever hunted with they're great dude yeah they're legit yeah I shot everything over the last two years I've shot with a silverback yeah a reason that day right well it's just the best way it's it eliminates a whole idea of like not punching the trigger and not thinking about it yeah you don't have to think about it doesn't exist just pull you just go through your sequence you know like we're talking about last night you just do your steps say your mantra do you have a mantra that you say when you draw back your bow not really but I I do I do walk myself through the steps how I've described them to myself after duds described him mm-hmm you know like okay the hands at the stop sign get a nice relaxed I'm a little slight bend in the elbow you don't lock your shoulder down okay pull back pull the tension feel attention there's a wall mm-hmm right yeah I was telling you about this guy Joel Turner who does this it's um it's I think his website he changed it used to be iron mine hunting and now it's like shot IQ and he just he's a guy who trained people we trained SWAT team members and a big part of being able to keep your shit together when things get Western is that you have to be able to keep your system in in a conscious state don't don't let instincts happen and everything just go wild you wanna I always forget this is it open loop or closed loop I think a closed closed loop is when you're thinking about it and you have control over it versus an open loop is when it's like swinging a baseball bat does that make sense sounds right I don't want to make sure that I'm right see if you can google that but they teach us the same stuff in the teams yeah like she taught combat shooting in the past it closed-loop thinking versus open loop Percy's the immediate result and upon achieving the resort wanders off to find something else eventually closed loop Percy's not only the result with the effect all this is different now but like I've taught combat rifle and pistol go to a shot iq.com you've caught you say that I've taught that combat rifle and pistol along with other people and it is exactly like that that's the kind of stuff we teach what do you teach like what is the the process of keeping your shit together it's different for every weapon system mm-hmm but it's the exact same it's like you just said with a bow or I just said with a boat you talked yourself through the steps out loud and it doesn't let all the outside bullshit get in the way of pulling the trigger the right way right yeah that if you can actually have a communication line with yourself while it's happening yeah it keeps you in the present moment you're utilizing the equipment it's not in charge of you yes yes it's weird how all that fucking goes wild on yeah oh my god you see people do some lousy shit oh yeah they lose control they lose control it's hard to keep control you know to be able to maintain the discipline to keep that mantra in your head and not just go on instinct is very important it's hard to expect people to do that though you know like I say that when I've helped people learn how to base jump like you need to be focused on what you're doing because you're in charge of all the actions like this isn't happening to you you've chosen to let this happen right it's the same thing with shooting a gun drawing a bow they're all very similar we're like you were saying like doing a kick right yeah and not letting rogue elements become part of the process mm yeah it's some it's a weird thing that your mind does where your mind just wants to spaz out like it's yeah it's it's a weird reaction to stress an adrenalin and all these different things different factors are you trying to calculate all at once go full-on bananas people is there shit I tell them only imagine what it's like in combat yeah that's a different level beyond yeah it is so what are you telling them to think of when you're telling them like we teach in combat pistols and you teach them how to utilize a pistol what do you what what is the process of like I try and break stuff down as simple as possible so that it's easy steps for people to talk through to create a habit so that you're using it as a subconscious effort right like I want you to be able to draw and fire that pistol or shoulder and fire the rifle in a way that you're almost not thinking through once you become very proficient at the shooting so that your brain can stay open to all the other pertinent shit that's going on all the scary crap that's happening out there right so it becomes an automatic movement you want it to be like that you want it to be an automatic movement and there's guys out there with a shit ton more combat time and a shit ton more teaching experience that say the exact same thing and they say it because it works because there's not time to screw around with having to think through the process it's similar to how you're drawing a bone hunting right give time to really think through it all not with an animal walking out in front you know you have to already had that stuff it's gotta be doubled in yeah yeah super dialed so with pistol and rifle it's the same way like I'm gonna break that down so simple and we can only handle so much information so I'll break it down real simple and then feed you more pieces individually as they come up now how much in the military how much time do they spend instructing or coaching Pia on how to how to think during intense and stressful situations so they system but they started to do more of that when I was in buds so it's a fairly recent thing relatively recent and I know they do more now and what they're trying to do is get people to make sure that they can understand what they're doing and perform under the pressure right and a lot of a lot of the training and a lot of the selection weeds out people that can't put stress and information into the same lane of traffic hmm right all right okay so that's what a lot of what buds is yeah yeah a lot of buds and sqt and then further on and the teams like everyday you're earning your tridon is what they say you can always lose it so what they're what they're saying is like it's all processed but they've been there weeding people out that can't handle that sort of shit mm-hmm and so does this something that they've written books on are there manuals on this and or is this just something that's understood and known I don't remember there being a Sun this for me when I was in like a psychological stuff mm-hmm we did have some guys come in and talk to us and then what kind of advice would they give you Oh God you know I don't particularly remember exactly what the advice was like word for word but I do remember it being like follow your training you know we're training you the right way and it's not the do as you're told yes do what you know how to do right and you'll do it well and is a lot of being able to perform in combat in these situations that are insanely stressful and to be able to manage information and stress at the same time he's a lot of that just learned by experience I think so what was it like for you being overseas or the process yeah well I was one of the youngest guys there because I was augmenting meaning I was an extra person I've volunteered to go ask to go so I was open ears open eyes and for four months like these dudes that are over there have been had been doing it for a long time at that point because I was there in 2011 and 12 and it's all a process that is fatally consequential and I knew that so you're like I'm just gonna shut up and fucking listen or shut up and watch that's wise it's fucking terrifying is why it's not necessarily being wise like you just I don't want to die yeah like if that dude's stepping over there for a reason you know he's not leaning against that wall for a reason he's doing this for a reason he's got his gear set up like that for it's not for fun you know they're not over there airsofting it's fucking for real so you ask questions and the best thing that I've been able to get from the teams which was super evident there as you learn how to learn you know you learn how to be a student a good one because if you're not there's a good chance you could die a lot of guys have died overseas and a lot of guys have died in training it's still doing the right thing yeah we were talking last night about a guy who died in training yeah we were saying the guy who drowned they never found his body yeah Matt leathers so that anniversary was actually in the 19th 7 years I think people need to understand how difficult that training is that people get lost doing that all the time yeah or are lost are lost we had diving injuries at the team and there was no negligence you know we weren't we weren't doing things incorrectly it's just stuff that's we're doing very dangerous shit yeah very dangerous from skydiving with gear to diving really deep for a long time - shooting exercises now you compound that and put them all together and do it overseas with somebody else out there that's hunting you how do they mitigate when you go overseas the effect of being over there too long because I would I would imagine that the stress of constant combat first so this is my ignorance of it but this is what I would think was that what ferns first it's probably like you get better at being calm and more accustomed to it but after a while the pressure eventually starts to crack you that it did just many many many months over there dealing with it you have to you have to decompress you do and they have like decompression windows at the end of deployments how much would it like what a typical deployment how long does it last so I was over there for four months and they do everything from or they've done everything from three months to thirteen plus for a Special Operations guys and the reason being they do the shorter ones is because of the operation tempo you're doing so much and you're doing it so quickly and they want you to be fresh and they want you to be good at it because they don't want that stress to happen all right what is that like this this stress like what how does it affect people because I mean I would assume it affects everyone differently okay the but the process of being in harm's way consistently for a long-term I I joke about it making everybody professionally paranoid mmm like you're always like I'm not always wound up but I'm always on some sort of alert for things yeah you know I'm always like I'm always thinking about stuff I'm always keyed on to like I doing why's he doing it right in a way that I don't I I don't know why that's there I mean I know why but I don't know what part of my brain is saying what the fuck is that guy doing is that hard to let go and civilian life or is it just there forever no I think it's there well I think it's there forever I can't I don't know it's still there jersey Jacko's video he does a he did a video recently where he's like people were saying why you looking over your shoulder Jocko he goes I'm being tactical cuz I'm checking my flanks yeah he's like what why he was in the dark and he goes so the enemy can't see me how come I don't smile I don't want them to see my teeth that guy yeah is hilarious he's the best he is I love that got it through he's so great he's such an important person too because he's both articulate and savage he's both a brilliant guy who is wise and humble and but also a fucking gorilla yeah he's a legit savage yeah I had the chance to roll a little bit with him oh don't do that don't do that it was with Andy and Ed uh-huh and was that when he broke Doug's neck yeah yeah tariffs I broke a bone in his next John thought he had throat cancer he did once the doctors tell anybody like yeah what happened to you oh my god it's fucking Furillo I put me in a guillotine snap my neck big white gorilla was nothing he actually did a guillotine I think he actually was he had his knuckle in in John's throat doing something I think I want to say John that sounds right I think John did that I didn't full guard that didn't know how to tap exactly this was like going yeah I think John had him in full guard I might be fucking this up and Jocko put his knuckles into John's neck and was like using a neck crank and compressing his neck from like either the guard or maybe even side control and then had a knuckle in the throat and you remember he popped a bone it was from the guard yeah I think I was about like from me to you to this going on he broke a bone in his neck no he's a gorilla yeah big hairless gorilla yeah you can't know how much do you weigh 165 you can't roll with that guys it's no don't do that what was it like but I can run away from him yes way from DT doesn't run at all no it's terrifying no just March after it was that it was like I was wrestling around with a sweaty piece of mahogany yeah big guys that are skilled that's so humiliating yeah a big guy that's skillful I've and I've had that happen once in the past like the I think I'm cool and then you find out you're not because I'm not a big dude right like a bloody mind played played I think oh line at Stanford I came home from a deployment and I'm like I got a little blitzed I was like screwing around like at the time I was like 175 and he picked me up from under the arms and he's like you're real strong for your size and puts me down I'm like a god I feel so emasculated real strong for your sides is it too fucking weird and he was like he's like 300 pounds yeah you know like six five I'm I got crap those are huge humans that's giant how often did you used to I don't you don't so you just did that one time with him did it the one time with him well that's ridiculous he's a fucking multiple year black belt hey thanks Andy yeah and he's crazy me and he's obsessed he does Jiu Jitsu five days a week that's when we were teaching to skydive oh Jesus Christ everybody's trying to die he's trying to get his neck broken you guys are skydiving why is it that so many team guys wind up getting into skydiving BASE jumping parachutes what is that funny shit is that what it is is it there's a thing I mean I don't want to speak for you but some men up the the highs and the thrills of that stuff of BASE jumping and look what is it that's so attractive about that I don't know as much of if it's the thrill as the thrill combined with the enormous amount of mental effort and cognitive load that's going on mmm and focus because you know the consequences fuck yeah mmm like if you're on the edge of a cliff in a wingsuit there's so much shit that can go wrong between the second you push off that thing and you can't turn around to this 60-ish seconds that it takes to get to the ground boom that has killed a lot of people a lot of people a lot of people yeah how many times you wingsuit jump a couple hundred bases and I have about 700 BASE jumps is that a good thing for veterans when they come back as well just to give them something that allows them to feel that edge again I would never suggest somebody learn to base jump really fuck no I don't even call it a sport I call it a life choice so you only want people to do it that are drawn to it yeah if you're a person is so willing to do that thing that you will do anything it takes to make it happen and go around me to learn how to do okay that okay but I'm not gonna be like it's a great choice for you yeah oh don't go to therapy you should jump off a cliff how much can therapy help veterans I always feel like you either have the ability to handle shit or you don't and then they can help you if you have the ability to handle shit I agree does that make is that it does that's a it's our arrogant assumption on my part from no experience but the way I'm thinking of it it's like the amount of wrestling that must be done in your mind going from combat deployment to regular society and seeing the the petty bullshit that people think of as being like life or death or real real issues it needs screaming and fighting and you're like you fucking babies ya know and you see that a lot with guys that come back is they're just like the fuck is wrong with you yeah is this really worth it right and but I do think that therapy of some type archery technical shooting BASE jumping jiu-jitsu there are things that you can take up that I think help guys unpack at eyes but like undo all of the shit that's in their head mmm you don't have to go to a therapist and talk doesn't happen that's not necessarily the best thing for everybody there's a weird thing about the mind right where it has to be active yeah you have to give your mind tasks oh yeah yike even meditating isn't being task less right right you're right you're focusing on focusing yes there's something there there's something going on yeah that gray matter is doing some work you got to get the engine turning yeah it's and also it's like for people that have experienced combat deployments and then they come back to regular life it's almost like your body's accustomed to a certain level of stress and now it's not there anymore so it might start creating it on its own or looking for it when it's not there oh yeah and and I think Andy's joked about it I have no idea I haven't been tested or has he if I know but you know so many of us are like adrenal fatigue because we're just wound the fuck up at fifth gear for years right is that real adrenal fatigue I think so yeah you know I mean a lot of guys are very just like me about so much right and I don't think that that's because they don't care I think it's because their their hormones are out of whack that makes sense well there's also a lot of guys whose hormones are out of whack you know from IEDs and from oh man letting down doors I I've been dumped enough where like I felt my teeth you know I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be able to feel your teeth yeah Jesus Christ well so many guys who get back have hormone issues too because that pituitary gland damage from chronic brain trauma I'm not surprised yeah and that stuff that really needs to be addressed and that's the kind of stuff like you were saying for the charity for the traumatic brain injury mm-hmm that's shit that needs to get looked at yeah we need to be doing preventative work yes ahead of time yes and then monitoring people making sure that they're okay because that stuff is degenerative and people need to know that that's out there and it can be helped is it hard sometimes for veterans to ask for help I think so because they just feel like maybe asking shows a weakness or maybe they just it's just too difficult to reach out I think I think it's the too difficult to reach out and I don't want to be the problem or there must be guys that are worse than me I think it's usually that it's not necessarily the the fully inflated ego of I'm just gonna be a hard-ass but less which it there is you know that's out there but I think it's a lot of guys that are like now there's probably somebody worse than me right so if you come home and you're not traumatically injured right we you know legs blown off or arm blown off you feel like you're lucky so you feel maybe like you shouldn't be asking for help other people need help more like I don't need that seat at the table let me go find somebody else for it that the lack of support when veterans return is really disturbing like the idea that there's so much emphasis put into training there's so much emphasis put into arming and and making sure that everybody's geared up you're a multi-million dollar machine yeah but then when you get back they don't have a use for you anymore your use tire fuck now it's getting better and a lot of the outside groups do a really good job but it's tough to realize that there's outside groups that are doing that job yes a lot of its guys like what's the Fed doing right right thanks guys it's almost like there's no pressure on them to resolve some of these issues or to help when you come back is there any coaching do they give you any sort of advice um I didn't end up going to any of that and they always tell you hey if you need to talk to somebody there are people to talk to you and other people that you talk to are they psychologists or they combat veterans as well or psychologists mmm which i think is a good thing it's a good thing to talk to psychologists I think so are any of those guys veterans themselves they're from my recollection they're all in the military they're all in the military but are they all did they experience action I'm not sure I don't want to say out like offhand without knowing for certain I didn't end up talking to any of them so I don't know do you like is this something that you discuss with team leaders or like guys have been who have deployed and they've returned is this like a common thing where you go hey you know what's it like when you get back is it how hard is it to transition to normal everyday life and keep your shit together and what are the tools that use to try to maintain I think unfortunately that's the stuff that's getting talked about now just now yeah yeah and more recently because so many I mean it makes sense are you gonna like like with fighters right do they ask each other how do you recover after a fight no it's how do you prep for it make sure you win right because that's all we care about when we're looking at front-end male front-end an action front end action front end action how do I train how do I mitigate all the risk how do I make sure that my buddy isn't the one that's killed because I fuck up right right yeah so if that's what we're concerned about nobody gives to crap what's going on the back end because you're just gonna rinse wash repeat that cycle right till you're done do you see Hurt Locker i I've seen parts of it what did you think about it it's a little dramatic is it a little fake little fake damn it seems good full fake little fake well there but the idea that someone could be addicted to the action when they want to return even when they think they're done and they're drawn to go back again yeah I think there's action junkies not necessarily combat junkies mm-hmm but like stress junkies yeah I mean I see it in BASE jumping too oh I'm sure you know and you see it in skydiving people that are just addicted to the feeling of the entire experience not the adrenaline because I don't I don't get a huge adrenaline dump from BASE jumping you keep it calm pretty calm because if the adrenaline dump is happening you're probably fucked yeah yeah because you're gonna do you're gonna be swinging the baseball bat around that's what Alex Honnold said about free solo climbing yeah it's like it's very mellow it is he's like when if I'm if my heart is beating fast I'm already fucked yep you're you are so far down the Train of you jacked this up yeah it's the same thing with BASE jumping or with being overseas right where it's like if you're at the point where you're freaking out something's gone terribly wrong yeah do they give you techniques to calm yourself when you are freaking out is there like dude we've done some breathing techniques like the like three seconds in hold seven seconds out type of thing do that three or four times in a row like they have I remember getting taught that in buds specifically for the underwater swim stuff which can terrify that shit out of people hold your breath swim 50 meters that's a long way it's a long ways 50 meters a long way yeah people like oh that's not that far bitch a long way go do it yeah like you think about a pool what's the average pool 25 yards across yeah so let's go up and back twice oh one there and back there and back and the way we do it is we stand on the edge of the pool jump in do a front flip and then swing without touching that first hit first push off you push off the other side yeah what's your already 25 meters down no way you're gonna need that yeah yeah there's so much so much of so much mental management involved in that that's why when guys like Jaco come along and they can take that understanding of leadership and mental management and and then teach it to other people yeah teach it to corporations and teach it to groups and yeah to law enforcement and people that need that sort of understanding that's coming from a guy like cam with the immense amount of experience that he has in a couple different genres that allow him to then teach that in a way that is comprehendible and super efficient yeah yeah it seems to me that that would be one of the most important parts of that of that job of how to handle deployment how to handle coming back and the mental aspect of it yeah do you learn it from other guys like I thinks I think it's just a I honestly think a lot of it is that process weeds out so many dudes that would be the the ticking time bomb or the guy that can't handle it right fit by the time we're training for this stuff and it's super stressful everybody's pretty much on on their shit mm-hmm you know and then there's like little stuff that you learn while you're doing shooting that you can transfer to all of it the breathing techniques right and then by and large we are so well trained and know that we're so well trained that you're just doing your damn job like just do your job and do it the best you can because I'm not thinking about me necessarily as much as I'm thinking about everybody else also that's fascinating too that the training is so ruthless and brutal that it weeds out people can handle shit it fucking works they've been doing it basically the same way since the 60s but hasn't there been some chitchat about alleviating the standards to let women pass through I've heard of it I've heard that they want to put females through the program but not to change the standards how many women have gone through buds zero don't say that women are gonna feel like you're a sexist you should lie I'm not sure can i gray area if how many women have tried me I did you not see GI Jane cuz she went made through well yeah but she's doing that belt brown special um really no women have ever made it through both night well and that's that's a two-part equation there is one there they weren't allowed to the entire time I was in like there are females in that when they start allowing them so I am not sure but I think that they're trying to make that a thing now trying I wonder how many women have attempted to go through buds Jamie see if you can Google how many women have attempted to go through buds ladies listening to this please don't get uncomfortable we're not shitting on you I'm just trying to figure it out yeah first woman made it through in December oh there you go what was it screaming scream screaming say that's a pre-screening process oh so she only made it through the screening how far how long does that take I don't know because we don't do the same stuff that they're doing for that they're probably making sure she can make it through the program oh so they want to make sure that's physically she can probably a pre screen screen well Jesus pre-screen they do that they do that for officers to do they really yeah they want those well think about it mm-hmm bloods it's shitty enough now you're in charge of a bunch of fucking idiots right you're gonna get shit on pretty bad right so they want to make sure those dudes are on their game mmm yeah yeah so where's the pressure to make women do this is it coming from women that want to do it or is it coming from politicians that want a sort of show that they have a diverse lineup politicians hundred percent because here's the deal I've met more than enough females that are Apache pilots fighter pilots badass EOD chicks which is explosive ordnance like Hurt Locker right mm-hmm there's some bad women in the military yes they want no part of that job I haven't met one that's like I wish I could be a Navy SEAL and that's not that's not shitting on them they just don't want that job why is that alright you'd have to ask but the thing about navy seals is that it's like recognized that these are the best of the best these are the most savage human beings that we can create yeah the most efficient the most effective the ones that can handle the most and ones that can get the job done when the shit is as hairy as it gets yeah and but why change the program just to diversify the lineup there's a thing that they want to show right they want to show that they're not sexist this it's Equal Opportunity that and the people that want to prove it are the ones that aren't in the ring yeah that's the problem right you're not getting this from the the actual team itself they're not saying you know we need is chicks you're not getting pretty on this place up yeah you know I think it'd be great if we could just have like some women running around you guys are pretty ugly yeah it's probably gonna be really weird when a woman actually does make it through I'm sure you know I'm sure it's the same like I feel for those women yeah cuz they're gonna take a lot of shit oh my god yeah but doesn't everybody take shit yeah so like it's extra shit extra shit yeah for sure especially if you're the first woman damn right they're gonna be like oh well you didn't do it the same as everybody else which who knows right so when you do return mm-hm how you how long did you serve for nine years nine years and when you made the decision to get out mm-hmm what was what was that decision based on so I never really wanted to do the Navy as a full-time career my entire life you know do 20 years and get out and collect the pension the war was starting to at the time slow down ish for op tempo like how quickly guys are going overseas and the amount of action they're seeing the way I saw it was it's like training for a fight that you never do hmm I didn't want that to be my life and I was 28 you know I'm like you know what let me make some phone calls and see how guys are feeling about stuff overseas and because I was on the jump team at the time right so I had like I didn't quite have my finger on the pulse of what was happening at the team so I made some calls and those guys I came in if there's nothing really tying you down like a like a kid or you know huge amount of dad or you know a lifelong dream of this being your Navy SEAL for 20 years you know you want to do other stuff with your life might be a good time to do it dude and I'm happy I did you know I I got out with all my fingers and toes and I'm glad that I was able to leave on really good terms and feel really happy about what I did because I feel like we were making a difference when you say that like what what made you feel like you were making a difference the things I know that we got to participate in the places we were and the guys that we were moved from the battlespace captured or killed or fucking shitheads that we're using women and children as targets and we're causing terror when you say terrorist people have this disassociated view of that now right yeah just thrown across the newspapers they were causing terror I don't think people can you know the coronavirus stuff is coming out now or when a bomb goes off somewhere or there's a mass shooting imagine if that's your entire life yeah if you're walking around town and that's what's going on every damn day it's not your fault it's just some guy that's deciding that's their their job in life is to ruin yours and we were removing them so I feel like we were doing a good thing and what did you do when you came back when he got off when you were done so I took some time off and did a ton of skydiving and BASE jumping because I love those things I was teaching a little bit of combat shooting and then basically about a year and a half after I got out of military and he calls me up and he's like hey dude you want to go on a bear hunt so that's so it was like really fresh out really fresh so when I met you in San Diego you probably had only been out for a little morning here mmm yeah and that's when you were just learning or had you already gone that bear hunt by then yeah cuz that was summer I think we can't we went in the front yep and I think that was summer in Dodds from San Diego yeah super fresh which is probably why I was like all sorts of piss and vinegar I'm sure is it so you're happy with your decision to get out but is it does it feel strange does it feel like you yeah and I miss I missed some of the the structure and I miss being able to ask people to do things and be certain they're gonna do them right you're dealing with a different caliber human being on a regular basis consistently right is that believing that's kind of like a lost seals they find each other and hang out with each other oh yeah outside of it you should have seen this out here earlier I'm sure bullshitting like gorillas yeah I'm sure I'm sure yeah what do you want to do now so right now I'm actually working for Evan at black rifle Oh are you really taking pictures yeah oh no shit yeah so I'm a photographer for black rifle oh that's cool it's super fun I love those guys dude I love those dudes their facility and Salt Lake is fucking dope too dude that crazy giant roaster thing that they've got that bought that and pieced it together yeah did Evan tell you the whole story about how they know that it got a little weird weird you know they might have had to threaten to people people trying to rip him off but it's um this crazy old-school roaster like yeah they do all the roasting in house what's a called a Diedrich or something I think I'm glad I think that's dope yeah it's it's fucking really it's a giant it's bigger than this room it's like a dump truck and side down yeah yeah that's how they roast coffee it's so cool it's such a crazy story to how he outfitted his Humvee so that he could roast while he was being deployed just so ridiculous to be that in a coffee you asked if I was a coffee snob Evan Hafer okay stop yeah evan is a real coffee snob but I mean that's his living now gives a shit about it you know he cares it's so cool yeah we went there he made us all these different coffees and like this is an Ethiopian this and this is yeah calls from Ethiopia and no cream everyone's drinking everything black oh you used to drink in black coffee good luck finding creamer there I know weird when they open up they're gonna open up a bunch of brick-and-mortar coffee shops they are they just partnered with Bass Pro oh did they really did oh that's huge you're gonna be the company will be selling coffee at Bass Pro Wow like immediately so it'll be inside of all the bass pros I think I left them out but I think it's like in the triple digit range and then are they gonna do some brick-and-mortar places outside of that as well I believe so and they've already done they've already done one in Texas dude if they can get people to stop putting cream and coffee that would be fucking miracle that would be a that would literally be a miracle it would actually be a miracle yeah cuz most people just put cream in automat I do think it's a mindless action copy open it up and pour the cream exactly this when I go to Starbucks I get my coffee I open the lid I pour a little bit of it in the garbage can so you get some cream in there fuckin a half filled with coffee like yeah 50-pound yeah when they say room for cream I go yeah but like give me real room no they give you like a pens word yeah that's not enough room for cream man you're just gonna spill anyways this is ridiculous but when you drink their coffee we drink like Starbucks coffee and then you drink black rifle coffee black you go okay well this he actually can drink black it tastes good yeah and every day like I go I live in Salt Lake City now and I'm down there hanging out with Evan all the time and he's constantly roasting beans and cup and coffee and Nick he's trying to better the experience for the user and what's really cool is that guy has found a passion outside of being a you know like a badass green beret or whatever you know military like he's found an identity outside of that and driven so hard towards it and he he gives so many shits about the user base and the consumer he really does well it's also the culture that that company is sort of created it's you know very supportive of veteran causes first responder causes military police all that stuff they give a ton charity yeah they really care and he tries to hire so many vets all the time yeah and I believe Dave you could because there buy a bag give a bag I think they've given over thirty thousand pounds of coffee for free to guys overseas how badass is that it's amazing yeah it's a really good company now and good people yeah they care about their employees and they care about their customers and Evan's a coffee snob yeah and the coffee's legit cuz there's a lot of places like all these mass-produced places so if you go like there's a friend of mine who works for the UFC who's a real coffee nerd who owns his own coffee company and he was explaining to me that the stuff that they buy if you're a Starbucks or you're one of these you're just buying bulk yeah and there's stuff that his company buys you're buying like really small batches of coffee well there's not enough available for all these people do Evan is in Guatemala right now at a coffee farm well physically they're inspecting coffee the guy gives a shit I said such a strange thing to be focused on a little bit like a little little cherry fruit looking thing yeah that's weird you have to put on a wrister and yeah have you ever had that Kopi Luwak coffee I have okay so someone had a bag of it and I came here I was there like yeah so this is some of that stuff and we're not really sure if we want to try it I'm like fuck it I've eaten scorpions let's make this happen yeah turn it into coffee yeah it's just washed off after it's gone through its but it tastes just like coffee it's but it's a weird kind of coffee right it's better it's a smoothness to it I don't particularly recall you know I just I don't remember it being like extra fancy yeah it's okay is that it right there Jamie that's what it looks like when it comes out there asshole it's a civet so if you people don't know what we're talking about there's a kind of coffee called Kopi Luwak there's an animal that looks like a rat but it's actually a I believe it's in the cat family like it deranged rat it's but it's I think it's a I think it's a feline like look at its claws yeah yeah see it's Clausing it's weird-looking I think it's a civet but I think that's in the cat family and it eats these berries that are the coffee beans and it shits out the beans and then people clean the shit it out beans because it the stomach acids break on the outside of the beam whose poor job is that yeah I'm a shit cleaner yeah I'm clean out cat shit see I think it's a kind of a cat see see if that's true is a civet in the cat family like a cat that eats berries man fucking weird go just just put up civet civet in the category what does it say I figured I'd just be able to click it right there oh come on you're like hyperlink me Kapadia cat family just but I don't think Wikipedia maybe they're nocturnal to say oh the SARS virus say some sort of feel like I wouldn't that um maybe the taxonomy is that what it is yeah I mean yeah I'm just a Ferrer day okay us small to medium-sized mammals thank you like for Nia over under scientific classification okay was it sale I'll retry your search scientific yeah just say is a civet in the cat family is a city like a moron but don't be going through all them scientific journals in the cat fan drink it down Barney stop civet call the civet cat there we go any number of long body short leg carnivores the family vivir Verde civets found okay this is how you get confirmation bias yes question find the answer somewhere that's right that's a good point someone might have just written this is this rather cat-like in appearance hmm oh they're weird it's not a cat really are they related to are not cats they're commonly called civet cats they're not cats in fact they're more closely related to mongooses than the arctic cats fuckers are mean don't they attack Cobras Annette fuck Cobras up there's a bunch of great videos online Cobras can't fuck with them they don't know what to do with a mongoose mother's just trail around think I get skinny little honey badger occasionally they get jacked though I've seen his mom brings Cobra fights online and the Cobra gets the Mongoose you see the Mong so sit down like oh no hey he got me it's out app and that's how it goes down that's the Sabbath with a banded mongoose single monk okay so that's a big band it ended we got a freaky looking motherfucker he is that looks like a Tasmanian tiger yeah that was little beat it so while my friend Forrest Forrest gallant is a gallant our gallant a I would go with that he gonna go on that yeah he is actually going on a mission oh my god so look for the thylacine there's been enough sightings of it in certain places in the world and he's I don't know how much I can say about this so I don't want to give up the location but they have an area where there's a guy who apparently had a captive one and it died what has the thylacine skull and they're gonna examine this skull and they've see them on a regular basis did I see them enough to think that there's a actual breeding population how cool would it be to be a guy that unextinguishable Kyah a lot like a crazy-looking yeah I guess kya yeah that mongoose is a freaky animal too like there's so many little weird freaky mammals like Wolverines and I've never seen a Wolverine in the wild that's that's a wild little animal badgers and Wolverines Wolverines are like I had a Wolverine described to me by dusty duds friend up there he's like Wolverines they're like grizzly bears that got born into that body that's why they're so pissed off dare you make me the size yeah they're not scared shit dude would you be if you were that angry just a weird little animal I mean is what do they weigh like 50 pounds maybe I don't know they see red all the time they scare bears off a kill so they scare bears off it kills they scare wolves off of kills they must have just like insanely thick fur and it's not very bright they're not smart yeah I mean would you be that smart if you're scaring a bear off a kill I don't know if it's a shit an intelligence things just a fearlessness yeah it's you know when nature has this very strange but logical sort of chain of events that take place right between like small tiny animals to the animals and eat them to the animals that eat them like this whole huge ecosystem when you see it laid out and then you see individual players like that mongoose by themselves like what part do you have and his crazy play yeah you know what did you get assigned because it doesn't make sense well for something like a grizzly bear to exist like there's got to be a need for it yeah like for something to be this fucking enormous predatory bear thing that's you know 11 feet long 1,800 pounds what is that swims runs the horse right like why do you need to be there like what's oh because there's too many these fucking mammals yeah like if you don't have something like that that cleans up they're gonna breathe like whitetail dude in the south and then there will be literally no vegetables there will be no plans everything we get eaten yep yeah white towels in the south or white tails around where Dudley lives I'm like dude you gotta drive three miles around or everybody no they just bounce especially in the during the rut out of control oh it's crazy up there dude his place is great though his place is amazing yeah have you hunted this place yet no dude I've been there I spent some time to everything have you gotta get a tag you try to get a tag for whitetail season with that guy out of control well he's the master like he's he'll he'll sit in the same spot for a month I just waiting for like one buck dude that guy if insane people people think like I have patience and a watch watch Duds social media like stream during whitetail season right watch and feed his instrument live feed yeah oh my god yeah he just sits in a tree stamp all day out here again yeah I just saw buck yeah he's got like a one target buck that he's after for like a month I don't have that kind of time I don't have that kind of patience like that whitetail patience is a different mean obviously Dudley does everything right but that whitetail patience to be that guy that sits in that fucking ladder stand-in okay well do you want to kill crow yeah sure yeah in November it's freezing in Iowa and that's why he lives there he moved to a spot so that you can hunt deer and bought a giant farm so he can hunt deer and then sits out there all the time so he's hunting deer I mean if you love it go to where it is like I moved from San Diego because I was sick of the traffic and sick of how California was you moved from San Diego to Salt Lake because of that yeah besides San Diego ain't shit compared to up here traffic oh my god this is like like triple yeah this is like Singapore or something this place is nuts hey at least there's not everybody on scooters there's a lot of people on scooters you never seen this motherfucker whippin down the street I was driving yesterday on the way home and he was next to me on the sidewalk on as fast as I was particularly oh man I have a fast one here's a really famous one but dude I was thinking if Jamie if you wipe on that thing like you're going down hard yeah it's a daily risk but calculated I'm not going that far yeah I have a nice little path no one's in my way you don't wear a helmet though huh well again I'm not going very far reckless motherfuckers going 30 miles an hour no helmet okay go 25 dude if you wipe at 25 miles an hour that's fast I've wiped on a bicycle standing upright and yeah fucking hurt yeah gonna hurt but you're fine I'm not gonna wear a super-tight helmet like a dork did you ever take the hit you know I don't know if you're gonna recover from a hit from concrete yeah you might be a different guy you might be google searching all the wrong no I meant that in the way like some people wear a helmet but they don't put it on correctly that's I have a helmet you have to wear it tight you have to have it on strapped tight like it has to be good so your brain doesn't rattle around like yeah best-case scenario where acai chol helmet so that yes I'm not doing that you can't be like a peewee footballer where you got like a helmet that's six sizes too you should wear a motorcycle helmet and football shoulder Prague and then a hand pads Deontay Wilder is outfit on to go do you know what he's talking about with Deontay Wilder is out he got knocked out by Tyson Fury and he blamed some of it on the fact that his legs were worn out because he was carrying around this crazy outfit I saw weighed 40 pounds I think I saw a meme with that I didn't know what it was about I'm like the hell first I thought it was a ridiculous yes but I saw yeah I'm like why is Skeletor fighting like what's going on here at first I thought it was ridiculous that he would say that but then I thought about it and when we were talking about it yesterday Michael Yale was saying that he had to wear that thing for 40 minutes well I was like oh really okay that's different so if he really did have that thing on for 30 minutes or whatever it was that's a lot of weight to be carrying for that long that seems kind of ridiculous that they let him do that why is he wearing that because ones look dope I also walked out very slow of course it doesn't have that whole song to play 40 fuckin verses like Tyson carried out you know carried out yeah see I didn't even watch that I fast-forward through all that bullshit like Bernie zero calories I don't want to hear any fucking national anthems either one thing I'm happy that the UFC doesn't do that they play the English national anthem the American that would come we know where we are do that she at the beginning of the night yeah I start the flights off yeah one time - at the beginning very first fight before the first fight let's play the national anthem fine beautiful perfect let's do it don't do it right before the main event you cock tease well my guys in the ring dancing around getting ready and now they have to wait for three minutes I think that company also said they've made other outfits for other fighters who have then gone and to knock people out so that that excuse wasn't great either well he's looking for an excuse well the bottom line is Tyson Fury beat the shit out of him yes if he had won right he would have been like if he doesn't mind it's because my outfit right I scared him right well he did say that like putting on that mask makes him transform he has this thought that mice are on that is a crazy day it's like a mix of Sauron and Skeletor from yeah like he-man it's pretty fucking dope it's too bad it's so heavy oh my god I wonder if he does it again imagine if he wears it again next time you know what fuck it fuck fuck my excuse never saw the old one look at this one Oh pacify it using it in training - that one looks better yeah I like the white that's a lot lighter though that looks like you actually walk around in it what it doesn't have the lights lights or touch I guess LEDs make something Mercedes isn't getting on a throne it's so amazing girls were carrying them girls we carry I think so yeah Oh Mike that's a risky move I wonder if they have him wear heels what were the girls wearing I don't bikinis a member did you see the fight no dude it was amazing cuz I heard it was it was amazing I just didn't say shock the world yeah nobody thought that was happening Tyson Fury just ran after him and started beating the fuck out of him and everyone's like what where did this go running like he fought completely different than every fight he's ever fought he just chased him down chased him down got in his face but he still used good boxing that's what's cool yeah like I'm gonna change my shit up so much that you're campement me watch this shit how much martial arts did they go over in the team very little do you think that's good yeah you don't need to I I think I was actually talking to somebody about this recently I think it's better for guys that have to put hands on people that aren't given as many options as we are to end the fight before that with some other means right mm-hmm like police officers right I think that those guys really need that kind of training yes because they can put hands on people they're there to serve and protect other citizens yeah I ain't serving and protecting any of our citizens right none of us are right we have a totally different job right I mean it's just reality yeah guys get into it because it's it's definitely helpful but I don't think it's in the scheme of things that are necessary to do the job well because there's so many variables already that you need to control adding that to it is just kind of probably watered down the training for the other things well I add all the cognitive load of becoming good enough at jujitsu so that it's second like totally second hand yeah totally a subconscious action why why get that much out of the way of time to train to shoot well you were a crazy gymnast right don't you have like crazy gymnastic skills no not particularly not particularly don't lie you can do some things you want some things yeah that kind of ability that physical ability to move your body that kind of dexterity would translate perfectly to jujitsu you know like some of the best jujitsu guys they come from breakdancing that makes sense yeah rich Martinez my friend boogie he's a tenth planet San Diego and he's he just actually just had a submission match against Jake Shields who was like a really super respected veteran and tapped him and Richie started out and same as his brother Geo they started out as break dancers and when they first came to the school Eddie was like dude there's something going on with breakdancing like if you think about the ability that you have to maneuver your body stand on one hand spin around the circle's like do one hand handstands and you know like the physicality combined with knowing where your body is in space exactly like I understand that I'm like sort of cockeyed sideways on my left elbow yeah yeah yeah but gymnastics is very similar a lot of gymnasts can translate the RET and George st. Pierre actually to improve his overall game started getting into gymnastics and he said it had a significant impact dude that Guy'd be terrifying to watch dude gymnastics yeah but just his ability to use his body he's like well if I could do all these things that other guys do like back handsprings and flips and all these different things like that would be very beneficial just just to understand how to use your body it's like a a more advanced form of plyometrics in a lot of way yeah for sure yeah how did you get into that doing gymnastics weird gymnastic stuff pure aren't curiosity really yeah so you didn't like take it wasn't something you took up in high school or college no I was a cross-country and track and field guy did like long jump triple jump and then cross-country races and then I've always enjoyed rock climbing and did a little bit of surfing and I've tried my hand at all of goofy sports and from there I'm like well what's the best way to get really good physically you know so start learning how to do some of the gymnastic stuff and a few of those things like I have no damn clue how those guys end up doing an Iron Cross or write a planche and I'm about as good as like a you know a seven-year-old girl that's pretty good some girls are fucking impressive you know what I mean like my daughter does that shit it's just such a crazy thing to see someone utilize their body like that it's impressive yeah the amount of proprioceptive knowledge that's going on there my employee yeah I mean there's so much coordination and you're going head over heels you're literally like flying through the air yeah more than once yeah yeah yeah but I've done I've done some like Windtunnel flying that's kind of err gymnastics Windtunnel flying what's that like it's a tube there oh did you get in and it was like one of those things where you where yeah yeah I've seen that how fun is that it's the fucking best really oh man it's so fun so is it like skydiving would you don't die yeah it's got having no stress right you should come to it I would love to isn't there a place in Universal yeah yeah you should go to San Diego the one there's real good Oh better it's worth it worth the drive next time I have a gig down there is this it and say yeah yeah go holes my San Diego but this is it they're actually that person's upside down hmm seems like you could just build one of those you could you know for like a cool five mil that's how much across I I've been told it's like five to ten or something ro look at that that's insane it's so fun so that's all a fan yep and so you're wearing a mask so your lips don't fly off very much wow that's incredible it's so cool man and so you when you're going straight up and down like when you're when you're flat so if you're parallel to the ground yep then you can float well yep then when you go straight up and down then the wind can't really carry your weight so you drop which is why you start turning mmm going in circles cuz you're generating lift ah that makes sense so this is an unusually large one this is not let's say no this is this is like an average-sized one so the one in universals like this no that one's a I believe that the one there is a an oval and is slightly smaller oh the one in San Diego's about Taizo does that something that actually has a purpose in terms of training guys oh yeah we act we used it on the jump team a ton and then they use it yeah this is it I fly there you go dude if you are a superball you should have that shit in your backyard well the Prince doesn't do bye does he oh yeah I'm sure he does yeah he's got like Falcons and Ferraris and shit yeah of course he's got a wind tunnel what am i I mean how often you think he uses it I don't know I I had I had some buddies that used to be there and they used it every day really oh yeah what are these guys doing they're teaching people how to do this oh yeah that's basic I did that once it's very basic but like it's how different is like what that flying up version versus this like level of I guess because it seems like it's a lot it's a lot like hundreds of hours of time flying really oh yeah it's a lot of time to learn how to like do what they're doing right there yeah I would imagine you try that you face first right into the fucking wall feel like an idiot yeah there's a lot of I think I'm looking at this I'm like I'm not buying this there's a lot of wind tunnel linebacker shit going on yeah oh yeah but it's a it's a really cool thing and it's a lot like gymnastics or dancing but in the sky it's really cool now you're into all this stuff and you did try some jujitsu with Jocko are you interested in doing that absolutely why don't you do it which Salt Lake's a great place page of showers a great place there's there's a lot of jujitsu in Salt Lake I'm absolutely going to and I like I was literally talking to Andy about this Chacho because we went out with Henry Aikens and John Cavanaugh Oh perfect so we were bullshitting with them and they were you know they were poking me and it was like the last straw like all right all right okay yes yeah a guy like you would get addicted to it immediately just I am sure I will yeah Andy's all in as part of the terror though like hobby creep I got crap yep hobby creepy another one that's a great way to put it man I got that from Sean Evangelista from like Andy's buddy yeah and thirty seconds out he's like I can't learn how to bow hunt like what his hobby creep I don't need another expensive hobby man yeah I already have enough bow hunting's the ultimate hobby creep duh it's helped me so much though it is hobby creep for sure and it does take up a lot of my time but man I do you love it I just love being able to use my range here and just shoot it's so relaxing yeah I wish more people would have the opportunity to do archery it's brain scrubbing yeah you know because you're focusing on that task so completely that it just kind of cleans out the old system it's it's meditation it's just like it's moving meditation that's a funny way to put it because it's exactly the term that a lot of people use for martial arts it's what it is yeah a lot of people use that term moving meditation for martial arts a lot of people use it for running too which is another thing that you really got into all right yeah I've actually I'm doing a couple mountain races very like sky running races this summer don't hang out with campaigns no I don't know if I'd understand doing like ultras that motherfucker will have you doing stupid shit 10 10 to 20 miles it's about where I'm at he doesn't mile he doesn't marathon a day yeah I'm good no thanks it works an eight-hour job doesn't marathon a day just released a video that the campaign's story and you watch it you go wait a minute huh how are you doing this what is he powered by a nuclear reactor dude he's a freak he doesn't even get hurt that's what I don't understand like since I've been friends with him he's been hurt a couple of times like you he had a like a injury to his foot he thought was a stress fracture by the way kept running never stopped running the entire time think my foots broken I'm just bang out twice ten miles today I'll do a short one today but he gets up at 2:30 in the morning okay 2:30 in the morning sometimes and he'll run 18 20 miles and then he'll go to work and then during lunchtime he'll hammer around another eight and you got to fit in you know a little bit of archery yeah and then afterwards he goes and shoots four hours and then he goes to this crazy fucking pimped out mancave that he's got and he lifts weights at night there he is I mean I just don't there's certain people that I mean I get it though like we were operating in a similar way when I was in the SEAL Teams like like your whole life is centered around these things mm-hmm like I'm just gonna be really good at all of it well his whole life was centered around bow hunting believe it or not all the other stuff that he does is really to get himself in shape for bow hunting and then to challenge himself so that he understands that his body is in perfect tune and he could do it it's dude hanging out with him in the mountains so goddamn humbling cuz he runs up these mountains like it's nothing here I'm dying and I've been running yes I've been doing it but I still I tried to keep up with that motherfucker I'm like Jesus Christ you just gotta like pull one of the minor tricks and like stick a little rock on my back this is not gonna help ignore it you won't even notice it's it's it's weird when someone is that dedicated to something and you're friends with them it's weird and a little terrifying right but it's also really cool is that isn't that rockin up using energy so does he still do think that's an old one yes 2013 I don't think he used that rock anymore he had 130 pound rock that he would put in his backpack and carry everywhere dude that's a lot of weight so he's a ridiculous person that's alone oh if someone gave him a rock as a present recently and he fucking put it on his shoulder and took it with him up to the top of the mountain off okay he was like thanks for the rock like gave him a big fucking rock like a 75 pound rock but he didn't even bother putting in a bag he's carrying around up the mountain on his shoulder and switches to make it difficult at a gorilla to make it more suck yeah he's fucking strange person I mean I get it I mean I've done a lot of ruck runs and stuff yes for kind of fun it's raining it's humbling being friends with that guy though he's so inspirational I mean like I don't know I mean he is I know I don't know anybody who's more driven than them it's crazy so even Goggins like when Goggins and him were running like Goggins us to keep up with camp like and Goggins is the fucking man I mean he is the endurance King you know it's cool to be around people like that because it makes you question whether you're doing enough right or something like just a little bitch like exactly I thought I wasn't but I'm definitely a little bit I've answered that question hanging out with cam a bunch times like well definitely a little bitch it's just he's got this weird drive to constantly push his limits like here's this is him right my fucking dog we put a toy hammer my dog's got a toy camera and so he's got this toy hammer in his mouth and as a quote my wife wrote this down she wrote what are we hammering and how long we supposed to keep doing this and then I sent it to cam any sense of via text message says tell Marshall we keep hammering until we're dead even your dog's not pushing it enough that's so funny but the fucking that is the most campaigns answer ever tell Marshall we keep hammering until we're dead and nobody's serious oh yeah and he got up at 2:30 that morning to run a fucking marathon before he went to work on snow ha ha ha remember that message he's like no this is what we do even if there's a ha ha means it he means every fucking word of it when people say they do a lot you know oh man he gets a lot done like does he really yeah are you really burning at both ends do you understand what this motherfuckers doing he's running a goddamn marathon every day they tell you like there's certain physiologist tell you well when you run a marathon you need six months to recover do you really are you sure maybe you just need 12 hours yeah maybe maybe I don't know what the fuck you're talking about man I'm not sure everybody really has this dialed in like what's possible well think about where we come from like we're we're the result of successful hunter-gatherers yeah for hundreds of thousands of years right now so we should be really good at this shit we should be the best of it ya know instead we're water balloons and jelly doughnuts well yeah well it's when you find out what's really possible from the human body when you see people that accomplish an incredible feats of endurance did you see that former Marine who was I guess you're never a former Marine 62 year old dude who like beer and dad not a former yeah he won the world record for holding a plank he held a plank for 62 held a plank for eight hours and I think it was like 13 minutes something preposterous the lights yeah look for a phone he's like on the doing a plank look at this guy he does not look former US Marine again there's no such thing well no just I mean look at that hit our plank record yeah look at him he's a personal trainer he's fucking what the shredded bit look at him holding that that guy looks terrifying eight hours and 15 minutes and 15 seconds that's crazy but that's one of those things look at him playing on his phone that's one of those things that would you think look at the fucking faint well that into keep that for eight hours is you like a lot of people have a hard time planking for a minute at all and it should set the record in 2013 but then he lost it head-to-head with another guy but now he's back stand I broke the record that was fucking bananas and holding onto his phone is hilarious I guess maybe needs a timer in front of him maybe that's what it is or just kept I mean eight hours wouldn't you just get bored you definitely get bored but the amount of mental fortitude that you have to have to be able to do that and hold that position for eight hours and 15 minutes what did he say he was doing it for Jamie there was like something in that video for mental health awareness yeah you're crazy bro you should be doing it for mental health awareness for people to be aware of your mental health yeah people be aware of how fucking crazy you are have that guys coming after you that is like dude he ain't gonna stop no no there's people that their mind is just fucking story tube hooked up a p2 that's something how patients are you well I'm eight hours in a planked patient yeah oh it doesn't a p2 but what happens to just take a shit hey hey when what he ate before he did this or if ii ate during it can you eat like a banana while you're planking there can maybe like it sag yeah running where you're doing like liquid diet stuff yeah some gel that was the toughest part about the real long dives that we did like every time stuff went into the 9 10 hour range it's like you're not eating anything right right you come out and you're haggard no I can imagine man that's got to be fucking hard just look when I do the UFC and I don't really eat for like six or seven hours it's hard it fucks with you yeah your your brain is just let your brains like hey man though this is not working well we need some extra stuff somes yes and what's missing and she eat something occasionally I'll get a hotdog or something when I'm doing those but that's just that that's just sitting there talking yeah which you know what's incredible how much burns off energy is playing chess they did these they have these world-class chess players in these World Championship events and they found that they were burning thousands of calories just sitting there playing chess because they were all losing weight and they're trying to figure out why these guys losing weight like what's happening over the course of this tournament you know winner but their brain is firing leave that 6,000 calories Robert Sapolsky our guy the Stanford professor who we've had on the podcast who studies stress in primates at Stanford University says that a chess player can burn up to 6,000 calories a day while playing in a tournament three times when an average person consumes it a day yeah so they've they've figured this out fairly recently because of a lot of these guys are losing shit loads of weight that's why yeah your brain I wonder like I don't think commentary burns off anything near what a chess player burns up but I wonder what it does you you are thinking all day while you're watching the fights I wonder how much I'm burning cuz do when I get out of there I eat like a fucking wolf can you take your woops trap usually yes I do but your heart rate isn't going up yeah well also the whoops trap is measuring yeah it's measuring your heart rate and it's also I mean it's based on your activity yeah I don't I don't think it's gonna know like mental like because I don't think their heart rate is jacked if they're they're burning 6,000 calories a day just sitting yeah that's gonna get measured calories burned off of your physical act yes right now it's an additional thing well that's also like different exercises that are physically taxing and also mentally taxing yeah they have to be consuming more calories oh yeah like like I was saying about the dives mm-hmm like I've done dives that are 6 to 12 hours long and you get out of the water and you like I'm sitting there I'm think like I'm using my brain a lot yeah but it's also cool to fuck and I've come out of the water a couple times and lost eight plus pounds Wow in the water in the water so that's nuts it yeah where's it going out so I'll becoming a part of the ocean I guess I don't know right minam yeah you're pissing out a lot of liquid losing water to the ocean while you're in the water oh yeah you could get dehydrated while immersed in water yep this is that polar that company that polar straps is like it's a popular one too they tracked a chess champion 21 years old in October he burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess which is about the same amount as Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis really whines that's an hour of working I've done I've that's about what I do like it an hour of an elliptical is about 560 600 but I wouldn't feel like Federer just hopping around all that plyos yeah that's true he's hyper efficient right like Bernard Hopkins when used to box yeah you know it was super efficient no elevate sustained elevated blood pressure don't wonder if chess is the pinnacle of things that you do that aren't physical in terms of movement but are incredibly calorie taxing one of that's the number me that's a very complex game oh my god I would die and maybe like oh brain surgery go barely moving but you're like concentrating so hard for hours and hours at times yeah yeah well there's certain things you do though after it's over you're just fucking exhausted and starving to death like when I do two shows a night after it's over I'm so hungry and that has to be something like due to our 10 hour 15 minute sets because you're thinking and you're managing it while you're doing it is a giant audience there you got to be fucking on yeah yeah that's uh but I think the UFC makes me more hungry but it's also like six hours seven hours in a day and you're probably moving around a lot yeah hunting does it borrow when you're when you're going through the mountains and the intensity of hunting and then the concentration and all those things and it's incredibly calorie consuming it all comes up right at they like you finish a day hunting out there like spotting and stalking and even if you don't kill something right you don't get an animal you come back at the end of the day and all of a sudden like holy shit I'm really hungry in yeah oh my god I'm weak what was i doing all day and then when you wake up in the morning it literally is like you trained like the day before you like 100% and it just fried when you get to like a six seven day hunt when you get to like day six day seven bro you have put in some fucking work dude that fourth day that moose hunt I'm like okay here we go again cuz you're getting up like it's like elk hunting you're getting a pre-dawn and getting out there that is something that's so missing from videos there's something about hunting videos like people just don't understand how miserable it can be it's not just that like they understand why you're happy like why are you happy at the end yeah you just killed an animal like if you had any idea how hard this is and then how difficult it is to execute a good shot no nervous I was it yeah Jack this up yeah and then when it's over in the animals down it's more of a relief and the success is not it's everything all together it's like an alleviation of pressure success happiness but it's you don't the the the longer and harder the hunt is the more you appreciate that though oh yes all and how much you're putting in and I've heard that from guys where they're like you have you punched your ticket the first day you're gonna you're just gonna feel like huh they can all eat shit I punched my ticket every chance I can I've heard that are you everywhere I'm like look I'm not I'm not buying into that nonsense like there's Steve Rinella on one of his shows he had this elk and it was like the first day of the hunt and it was a great elk it's about to shoot it and he's like I'm not ready to end my hunt I want to keep hunting and then he wanted I'm not getting it now because that's how it works karma bitch yeah well it's like he explained that he had just gotten back from another episode cuz even he's filming and then the episode previously just last week he'd shot an elk okay so he was like had meat in the freezer and he's doing it for this show so he just didn't want to like shoot it right there and then and also that's probably the pressure of you have to have a narrative for the television show you know the narrative can't be I got my shit together and now he's dead do you ever think you'd be interested in filming stuff and putting content on because I know you're a photographer or you're in the ticket pictures not really I I like taking pictures of other people doing that stuff like oh yeah it's fun for me to go out and do these hunts with Andy and dud because I get to take pictures mm-hmm I really enjoy photographing how people go through processes and I really enjoyed taking pictures it's it's been a really meditative process for me and a creative thing for me to do coming from art school now I have an outlet for that mm-hmm and I really like being able to do it I don't think I would want to videotape or take pictures of myself doing it but participating in the circle and being part of that process and able to document it you know from my point of view I enjoy that's what I know you're not interested in someone filming you while you go out and do it I don't think so I'm I wouldn't say no right but I'm not gonna that's not something I'm seeking out right now that is a thing that a lot of people get into when they get into hunting especially if they have a good social media profile like you do like they start thinking like maybe they should like film hunts and that could be like it's a weird thing right because it becomes a part of what you're doing to sort of expand your social media profile yeah so then it feels weird it does it's like what's your agenda right like my agenda is meat in the freezer right enjoying the process and man I get to spend some really cool time with some really really really good friends yeah and that I don't I don't think I could give that up for pushing the I want to be famous too only because I'm filming these hunts and then also the filming thing the real problem is that person filming you is also in the way yeah like there's an extra body moving there's extra smells there's extra sounds they have to move to get the shot and sometimes like you're drawn on an animal and they don't have the shot so they move in order to get a better angle the animals like what the fuck is that yeah and the animal sees them and takes off that's and more power to guys like dud they're able to do it successfully uh-huh it's phenomenal yeah but it also takes a special amount of skill and a desire to do it and he's really a he's a really able to show people hunting in a great way right and pass on a lot of skills and a lot of the enjoyment of the process yeah is there any hunts that you were like really interested in doing that you haven't done yet I really want to do a spot in stock mountain lion hunt oh Jesus oh yeah you want a spot and stalk the thing that spots and stalks yes what are you gonna do that I don't know so I think in the Dakotas and in Oregon there's a decent chance for it it's a decent chance because the population density population density and then I think Oregon and I want to say South Dakota don't allow dog hunts oh so Oregon's weird that's dense Riggins a weird place that's dense footed I mean foliage yeah yeah that would be hard I think it'd be hard you know what though I want that kind of chalak those are the things that really get me like way deep inside yeah we were talking about this last night you're gonna give yourself well like three weeks like I'm thinking in my head I need a couple weeks to make it happen Wow and I man look I'm a new hunter mm-hmm but I'm doing as much research as possible talking to all the right people and when it happens it happens so I would really want to make it happen what's the process for that you get a tag you go into the backcountry and are you gonna bivy sack are you gonna just sleep in the woods like that'd be my that would be what I want to do mmm is solo Biffy all right solo or maybe one other guy I think more than that you're gonna have so much presence in those woods you're never going to see a cat yeah so how the fuck do you find a cat when you're by yourself I think you got to cut a track or find a kill mmm so your plan is to get yourself in an area where there at lot of stars got a lineup yeah but that's part of the that's part of the cool part about hunting it's not just killing right right then well that's a that's probably one of the most difficult hunts you can go on damn right which and for me I grew up in Southern California having seen a mountain lion when I was younger I've just had a a like a real deep feeling about mountain lions I think they're incredible animals and I think it would be a really really special thing to pit my training and brain with a bow against a cat like and eat it yes that's gonna be weird eat it sitting down there eating a cat that you killed with a bow and arrow it's gonna be really cool yeah if it's if I'm able to make it happen at some point but you want mean you don't get a lot of meals out of that cat I think they're huge that's you dude a little cat like the ones sounding down here they're like a hundred and ten hundred twenty pounds the ones up in BC are like two hundred do they really get that big yeah two hundred yeah that's a big cat yeah it's a weird animal that just sort of coexist with us you've seen that photo that I have out there of the ones why the how cool is Hollywood sign that's a real photo it does it looks bad it's so cool it looks fake but that's from a camera trap that is a giant cat that lives in Griffith Park right by the Hollywood sign dude cats are cats are wild that is a I mean that is a crazy place for it to live though because it's literally on top of people oh yeah and the good luck finding a deer up there for that reason that motherfucker's jacking them all eating everything and dogs and cats and probably kids some kid fucks up but you let your kid off the leash yeah I mean it's it's just a weird animal to coexist with people in these sort of semi urban settings like Griffith Park but it's only weird because of the setting and because we're not used to it like we've coexisted with these things for so long and now it's weird because we've separated the last few generations so how deeply how far away are you from planning this out probably a couple of years if I'm guessing correctly how does that work because it's hard to get a tag or no because I want to make sure that my skills and my ability are up to snuff where I'm comfortable doing that and pulling it off so it's right now just a thought like like a plan absolutely put it on the books for 2023 or something like that something like that what about in between then more ELQ I'd love to do it in there moose hunt I'm gonna start helping to guide with Cole Kramer up in Kodiak oh really I've been Alaska yeah he's a buddy of mine oh no shit I was up there I knew him before all this no oh you met him we met through all this oh and last year I went up and assisted him on a mountain goat mountain goat hunt that's a crazy hunt super cool that's crazy terrain right so I was up there packed kneeling really yeah and you do that for the experience just to see what it's like yeah and really enjoyed it and I told him man I really want to come back and help you guide with brown bear and with with sick uh black tails and mountain goat again so this year I'm gonna be up there doing something dude your balls deep you know I mean you're all in that's my bike that's just my I fucking love it like I love getting that deep into shit like you give me a pool I'm gonna find the bottom yeah well this is it's a really interesting thing to get all in with to because it is such a part of our DNA and then it is the source of your your nutrition now yeah which is really interesting like that a hobby actually feeds you my hobby has allowed me not not to purchase red meat at a store in years that's incredible and then I get to share it with people ya know it really is incredible yeah and it really is the best meat you can buy and it really it's you know we beat that beat it like a dead horse but it really does make it seem different when you're eating that food your feelings are different it's just it's hard to describe for people I I would like people to experience it somewhat and I think you can get kind of the shadow of it when you catch a fish and you eat that fish yeah you get a shadow of it you get a touch get a little glimmer yeah you don't get the real elk steak feeling now you don't get the elbow deep and yeah pulling that thing apart so this is like your life now like absolutely Wow which black rifle has really allowed me to do that because I get to take a fair amount of their lifestyle and environmental mm-hmm and pictures so I'm able to go on hunts with Evan and uh and Andy and make it happen and take pictures along the way don't they have a crazy ranch down in Texas - yeah I was down there last year how was that a it was incredible I heard I heard it's really awesome oh yeah Texas is such a strange place it's I always hit describe Texas's that's how the rest of world sees America absolutely I totally agree with that 100% they're like America and you're like you mean Texas yeah it's a coma it mean if it's America for sure but it's like it's sort of like there's places in America that is so clearly what California is one of those places so clearly California yeah it does it's very different than a lot of the rest of the country yeah and Texas is the most extreme version of that yeah well no make sure you know yeah yeah yeah they'll tell you they'll let you know yeah it's one of those things and it's for hunting opportunities like Texas is incredible I mean there's absolutely exotics and all kinds of weird animals from other places that they've transplanted their means and really I and probably find a dinosaur if you you know people in Texas some guy to have a t-rex ranch a guy's a dream for a lot of people to do the Ted Nugent thing Ted Nugent just he has a house on a ranch in Texas and he hunts literally on his land oh man he hunts basically every day because he has so many exotics the way exotics work in Texas they're basically private property yeah so you don't have to abide by hunting seasons you do it by whenever you feel like doing it so anytime he wants a step out of his you know back yard and go shoot ooh Oryx for dinner its kudu day yeah it's cool yes oh yeah there's kudu it's right how weird is that well the weird thing is like what if they get out of Texas like does anybody have a fucking plan for that I hope a sudden there's no marco polo sheep in nevada bro they have zebras here there's free-range zebras in Texas like that's my bullshit it's awesome it's crazy hilarious there's so nuts it's such a it's such a fucking nutty part of the country that there's you know there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in are all of the wild of the world cartoon version of the United States yeah yeah bunch into one state so are you planning on just traveling around and and hunting now like that's like a giant part of your lifestyle absolutely have you have it planned out like as um some of them I know I'm waiting on finding out from dead about spring bear so you're just gonna work for black rifle and then do your haunts absolutely and keep crazy how something can so quickly become a giant part of your life yeah I fucking love it now I just got a silver out some for some jujitsu and maybe or hobby creep like yeah see weapons well listen brother we just did three hours leave it or not awesome time flies um tell people one more time your Instagram and your social media so my Instagram is Trevor dot P dot Thompson and you can find me there as well as my photography and my art everything's there everything's right beautiful alright glad we do this it was fun hell yeah man thanks brother hi
