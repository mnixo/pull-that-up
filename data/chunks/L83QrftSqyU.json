the girag an experience that's the thing i was reading a lot of people you know that we're sort of dividing the idea that we're calling him crazy and they're saying you know basically when I when a a Muslim person bloke who kills a bunch of people we start talking about the calling them terrorists when a when a you know a black dude kills a bunch people we start calling them thugs but when a young white guy starts killing people we call them mentally ill and somehow that's there's some inherent hypocrisy and then I kind of just think like it's I was thinking about this last night like there's there's levels of human evil that are so intense that will we get when we approach them we just kind of like shut down like you know member the matrix when they would do like the electronic pulse and all the machinery would just shut down it's like there are levels of human evil that we get through that are so intense that when we start approaching them thought just drops out and pee in it's all emotion that's lie and so you can look at somebody like that and say you know it's hypocritical to call that guy mentally ill or you're fighting against a feminist caused by not recognizing the inherent misogyny in his attack but really what's happening is something so much sadder and deeper than either of those things it's just like we're living in this insane fucking world where human beings have some tick in this country more than in other countries no one can figure out why where they sometimes once in a while will go into a place and shoot a bunch of people and no one knows why it happens and some people say it's because it's mental illness and some people say it's cause of bad parenting and some people say it's because of gun control and some people say it's because of you know violent video games and violent men and MMA and movies and music and nobody fucking knows why it's really happening and it's so terrifying that we just start slinging mud at one another trying to trying to say well it's this it's that and you're part of the problem by perpetuating this idea and the reality is is existence is terrifying and humans are fucking weird and once and well there's a evolutionary blip that somebody pops out of their mother with a you know sort of genetic code ready to murder people and I don't think it's because of being spoiled and maybe it is and I don't think it's because of you know chemical imbalances or maybe it is it's just the reality is that's what's happening is Jack the Ripper exists in you know point oooo 1% of human beings it's terrifying I did the my audiobook of my book and I wrote an article of chapter about the trees and I had to decide in there do i do Patrice's voice or do I just do a regular voice so in though so in when you buy the audio book my book you hear me god damn part is good that's not even a good and I was like do I do that with all black people like when I when will Smith talks do I make him like I did it I did it it's done Patrice is just so big with it he so is you know his voice is so beggin he was you kind of almost have to do it because you know cuz you heard I was telling it on Opie and Anthony but the whole thing was that I dated / cerebral palsy didn't know she had several palsy cuz I was drinking so much and Patrice thought that was fucking hilarious he kept saying you would you want alcoholic you can't even save someone disabled part she disabled that is the worst version but it's like if you do a Joey Diaz impression you have to do it right if you're gonna say something that joey said you kind of have to say it everybody does like everybody does if they say something as Joey you don't just say like if Ari has a joke you know i might say it like as me i might tell you all are he's got this great new joke you know about buh buh buh buh buh except if you're describing already mad then you'll do the whole mumble mumble mumble you do that you can't do that what was your Will Smith boys tho same exactly our boys hey know exactly is Kobe Bryant boys I i wrote the N word in the book twice and I was as white people saying it and I didn't realize it cuz I didn't fucking really pay much attention to the editing of it I just wrote them and then if the publisher like them I was in and I was like I read it I was like oh shit I gotta say the M word knows if thinking for history i'll go down as saying the word and despite whether or not i've ever said it no one's got me on record saying it so I called my buddy Omar door see who's on he's on he's pounding down I was like hey can you come and read a passage of my book and he's like oh I'd be honored thanks oh my god so abrupt end to read a passage with the l word on we know you did because I was to do this am I supposed to do this like a white person I go pirate sounded that way he's like you know I love you if I'm getting you out of this one oh that is so ridiculous yeah you should own up to it in the book itself this is on the audio book itself you would say well there's a questionable word in this passage so I brought in a good friend I do I'll do you course yeah yeah fuck is 16 hours to read my own audio book I was like oh my god can I cannot read out loud to save my life
