the girag and experience and promise awkward moment ever is when they see like in Vegas about five dudes hanging out together and there's no girls Nero and they're getting a couple of drinks in them and they start sort of like half dancing yeah they can't like totally commit to dancing so they like little go through like half the moves like I'm not really in the fuck of this music it doesn't make me move that much you know I'll give a little move give a little move here and there you know but they can't like dance with each other they can only move just a minimal amount you can't get crazy now you can't just be front of each other draw try rating hips you not allowed to do that to dudes girls can get together and dance all they want but with dudes you can only sort of half dance i cigar just by myself yeah sometimes sometimes you should go out by yourself to clubs um when I first moved to LA I did really but I would go on the dance floor by myself oh my god there's something wrong with your brain you need to go to a doctor oh hey at first it's a little better first you're gonna get the guys that are like look at it what's this guy doing you kind of do but then you get the girls that come over to you because they like the guy who's then we've done a lot of work yeah it's a little gutsy that's it's a little bit of very good it's a gutsy move not not always worked how many times have failed on you oh I don't even know probably more times than but but it just takes that one time you know just that one time some dudes can take criticism and or a rejection rather some dudes are fine with that I I have a friend he would he would hit on every girl that he was an ugly guy he was ugly and it was fat but he didn't give a fuck he would swing he would swing at every pitch I know couple never know that way never know that you know cuz comic yeah it's I don't want to give them up on the air yeah yeah I want you do mine either but you can't go to bars with that guy cuz it's it's too much to mind then those are always the guys who let people know you're a comic right lately there's a whole bunch of comics that are that way so they go up to the bounty like hey we're the comic set to chocolate and then the bouncer usually like I don't care it's a little what you wanted free tickets or they want the girls to be impressed it's bad it's brutal when you would a dude will you know there's no way if you go somewhere and there's a chick that he's not going to hit on her and it's not going to get annoying and it's not going to get a bear yeah those guys are brutal we're you know it's like okay I can't hang out with you anymore because if I hang out with you and we go somewhere you look immediately just everything that moves the first fucking the waitress comes over I think she's gonna haunt me look at that target yeah yeah and the next thing you know all it's all about this fucking waitress and him getting this waitresses number I'm like whoa can't you just have lunch yeah fucking weirdo and then they don't come to your table anymore because they don't want to deal with you and exactly exactly and it because it works every 30th time they fucking just want to put in those numbers man those crazy dudes they just want to put in those numbers and if you're around them you're like oh great no that's amazing yeah it's fucking disastrous man it's a shitty feeling I would have well death a movie when I wasn't by myself I would go up to girls and say my friends left me can I dance by you so I don't look like I'm dancing by myself and then can you dance but here's here's the trick young guys here's the thing you have to commit to that and you don't talk to those girls you don't go can i bevor and then hey what's up ladies then you ignore them okay and then the cooler one of the group will then kind of come over and go you can earthen then they'll let you into the circle if you're not completely hideous in in embarrassing them the key is not to give them attention after you do that little move Wow and then now you're the hurt animal in the forest you're the bird with the broken wing and there'd be one nurturing girl in that group that'll bring you in mmm but yeah I just go up the middle hey I'm a producer I like your moves ladies I just want you to just stop and think about how fucking gross men are have you heard of big brothers I started stop for a second and think of how gross men are and how fucking how much effort you put into creating the perfect environment where they think you're a nice guy or interesting or
