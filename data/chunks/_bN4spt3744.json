all right here we go mr. Dawkins thank you very much for being here I really appreciate it thank you I'm a huge fan of your work and we have a new book out outgrowing God when does it come out is it out now it is out now it is nothing like this week right last week I think I read The God Delusion in in preparation for this do you pull that microphone right up to your face just get it about a fist away from your face you have to move okay the microphone move for you I'm a huge fan of your work and I always wanted to ask you it you you go so hard against religion and you have for so long has there ever been a time where you've gotten fatigued from this where you like I just leave this to somebody else well obviously not because I just it's not so hard as you think I mean you remember it as hard but actually if you read it again I think you'd find it was not as hard as you remember I didn't mean hard in in a negative sense I mean you push you're okay you're so enthusiastic about you're an enthusiastic yes I'm also humorous I mean I like to think it's a funny book but a lot of people do think it's hard in the other sense and and sometimes when they read it again they realize actually no it's more humorous it's not so not so edgy not so hard-hitting as as they think it was they originally thought it was well I think that's probably because you've had some interviews in the past we have talked to some fiercely religious people and you've had some cantankerous interactions with them I think maybe so they they associate you with having this almost aggressively atheistic stance yes well he perhaps you're thinking ability well I mean he's aggressive all right yeah in the other way I did once had to tell him will you please stop interrupting me and let me talk and and so that might give this slight impression that I'm addressing you know was that BBC documentary that you you had done or you'd you have done several the one where you had gone and interviewed a bunch of different religious people yes that was not BBC that was Channel four which is the commercial station and yes I interviewed Ted Haggard yes and a guy who ran a thing called hell not hell holes hell hell hell houses where they write yeah try to terrify children mm I mean freak them out with horrible little plays little playlists yeah the devil coming on with horns and living eyes and I actually participated in a reenactment of that play in Los Angeles back in the day a comedy reenactment Bill Maher was in it a bunch of other comedians were in it and we read word for word the the script and we acted it out in front of a live audience so people would come through the Hell House yes this haunted house but instead it was people knew it was all comedians reading and they like is this really the words that they said it was so preposterous that it actually without being a parody it actually played out like a comment well when we filmed it we filmed them doing the play and then we filmed me interviewing the perpetrator Michael somebody or other yeah and I said to him what's your target audience and he said 12 and I said really are you are you really serious that you liked he said hell is at a terrible place that anything I can do to persuade children not to sin and they must acknowledge in knowledge Jesus and so on is it's worth it I thought that was a deeply immoral thing to say but I think he was sincere yeah why I would agree with you is it's it's very disturbing that that was a there's a great documentary on it as well for someone who wants to see like the thought process behind them creating this but one of the things that I really enjoyed about The God Delusion is that you you kind of outlined every single possible argument against atheism and then how to counter to it in advance like if you you know you you have a soft position look at chapter 1 if you look at this look at chapter 2 and you you outline that in the preface before you got into it yes well I tried to be as persuasive as possible the new book outgoing God is sort of aimed at a younger audience and I like to think that can be read at any age but being able to a younger audience is a bit shorter and perhaps some a bit easier to follow I'm not sure why is it do you think that there are so many religions and that basically every single civilization throughout human history has had some sort of deity some sort of higher power it's amazing the way they split and divergent divergent divergence as though they somehow can't get along with each other and maybe new leaders arise who have a leadership complex or something and want to found their own sector time and time again you have breakaway religions breakaway faiths I don't know what the psychological reason for it is but they what I have noticed is that they usually hate the religion which is the closest to their own more than they do more distant ones and that is a biological ring to it too that kind of makes sense to it to a biologist taking it diverging species well it almost seems like if you were studying human beings if you were something that was completely alien to our civilization our culture and you were looking at this the strange tendency to believe in something that there's no proof of and devote a massive amount of energy into defending that put it into your songs and put it into you know your pledge of allegiance and all these did which of course was not until the 1950s but all the different things that people have done in so many different cultures with in regards to religion it almost seems like a natural aspect of being a human being you're right that they put an enormous amount of energy and effort and expense and time and and cost in sharing some of the extreme sex which whip themselves with horrible weapons and scar their own backs it's a it's very very surprising to a biologist who do you think we would think that they would movie more interested in surviving and reproducing but know there's something about religion that makes them go to extremes of costliness and I don't get it I must say do you I've thought about this so many times do you think that it is in some way a counter to the sort of existential angst that comes from being a finite life-form being a finite a thinking conscious finite life form that's aware of its own demise where it's coming so it has to formulate some purpose and some meaning and and a hope of an afterlife is yes yes and is the purpose and meaning right yeah yes I suppose that's right yes I think that's that's right I can understand why people might want to believe a priest who comes along and tells them you don't have to worry about death because you're going to survive it I'm less understanding of people who make up stories to comfort either themselves or other people I mean a made up story should not be comforting I didn't understand how a made up story can be comforting of course if you make it up and persuade somebody else then they could find it comforting on the other hand is an afterlife really all that comforting when you think about half of them believe they're going to go to hell so is anything but comforting and also even if you're not going to hell if you're going to heaven eternity in heaven I mean sitting up sitting in in heaven for not just billions of years but trillions of years I mean these are these are time spans beyond our comprehension how unbelievably boring it would be what it though I mean I don't know I I enjoy life but if I had to live my life over and over again infinitely if I had an infinite number of this exact lives I don't know how I would approach that in the moment I can enjoy it I could do it maybe 200 years but after that now I mean I think I think that eternity is what's frightening about death and eternity is best spent under a local under a general anesthetic hmm is what's gonna happen right gonzo alcohol the lights maybe yeah or maybe not have you had any experience with psychedelics yeah no give any interest in that I've been offered to be accompanied on a trip by a very nice woman friend yeah and I've never so far dared take her up on it how go I asked advice of a cousin of my father who's just recently died who was a major expert on psychedelics and I think he was the one who introduced Aldous Huxley to mescaline for example and he judiciously advised against he said that the horrors of a bad trip are so awful that he wouldn't he wouldn't advise somebody to go into it my friend who's offering me this this trip says it would be a relatively low dose and she would take another low dose so she could kind of accompany me you know I don't leave jumping out of window or anything well there's so many stories in so many ancient religions it seemed to originate with the consumption of some sort of a psychedelic yes and you know there's many including John Marco Oleg grows the sacred mushroom Jesus Jesus was a much yes yes so I mean I mean you could see the connection if you were a primitive person with no access to science and you found some mushroom growing under a tree and consumed didn't have this unbelievable experience you would assume that you've transcended this life and gone into this other realm where God exists I once thought that I would try a psychedelic when I was on my deathbed that's it but what if it was amazing you know like I could have gotten so much done was this okay if I had tried this out when I was 30 yes maybe right I I don't you know I don't think anybody should do anything I mean I used to I used to encourage people to do things all the time now my thought is do whatever compels you whenever you feel like it but I would think that a person like yourself who has this sort of rigorous belief that the lights go out and then that's it I would think that that would be attractive to just at least dip your toes in yes yes well don't you think the lights go out I don't know you know I don't know I've had some pretty profound psychedelic experiences that make me wonder what what thoughts are and what what consciousness is and whether or not there's some way that it transcends when I wonder what consciousness is but it's pretty clear that it's to do with brains and brains decay and so I I wouldn't hold out much hope that were you well you might be right yeah you might be and well certainly consciousness does have to do with brains no brain damage severely perturbed consciousness but there's some interaction with certain chemicals and that makes this experience far different than what it is when we're on the natch little brains there mm-hmm yeah still brain but that's it reductionist I think wrong with reductionism nothing wrong with it you're not saying there is do you what is the the fiercest opposition that you've ever had to to your work fiesta stole most cogent well let's try both fiercest meaning the most the who has become the most angry at your work and most Ted Haggard maybe that guy really yeah well he's such a preposterous person for folks who don't know he was a guy who he was he was pretty anti-gay right and turned out he was smoking meth and having sex with gay prostitutes and you know the whole deal and which is whenever someone to me is ridiculously anti-gay I always assumed that they're gay I always assumed well this guy's he's just trying to like divert divert attention yes well he was very hostile and in a very weird way so it's all on television it's that was before his scandal oh yes you got a hold of him before the scandal oh yeah yeah yeah he was he was very hostile with you I remember that he was aggressive like angry he almost tried to run us over in the in the car park after afterwards I think he didn't know who I was when he interviewed me and then I think he went away afterwards and googled me was there Google back that I don't think there was I think that's Gator yeah that's so he was the the the fiercest in terms of his reaction he had a very nasty smiley face and and he looked at the fiercest yes yeah what does anybody had a good debate with you about it where they had some good points not good points no I mean I've had very amicable debates with religious people bishops Archbishop's and people like that rabbi chief Chief Rabbi of Britain very amicable and the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is such a nice man and intelligent in the literal sense that he finishes your sentences for you and so it clearly understands exactly what we're trying to say it gets there before you finish the sentence but then for some weird reason doesn't agree with it [Laughter] yeah that is that is the conundrum super intelligent people who are deeply religious and who believe everything everything from the resurrection to the Virgin Mary to everything I assume that he would believe possibly in the resurrection because they regard that as a kind of non-negotiable part what surprised me was that he turned out to believe in all the other miracles as well which I thought sophisticated theologians just don't do I thought they said oh that's just a metaphor or didn't really happen all that's not important just symbolic or something like that but he really believed believes in that a lot what was his interpretation of things like death by adult for adultery and things along those he didn't ask him about that I saw I simply don't know well what's fascinating to me is not just the old religions but really the young religions the young religions too as I've gotten older are more interesting things like Mormonism and more particularly Scientology which is even more preposterous probably the most preposterous one that we have though those are really interesting to me they are interesting but because they're so young that you can see how they grow out people couldn't see actual process Mormonism I'm depressed by how successful it is actually Scientology as well but Mormonism since when we know Joseph Smith was a charlatan everything about him screams charlatan and yet plenty of respectable people including presidential candidates men in suits appear to believe it in the case of I mean I discuss it in outgrowing God in addition to the Book of Mormon Joseph Smith purported to translate another book called The Book of Abraham which was in a different language some ancient Egyptian language and he published his full translation of the Book of Abraham which was he said was all about Abraham's journeys in Egypt and lots of detail about Egypt and Abraham in Egypt and things the original manuscript was were destroyed in a fire in Chicago and so he was safe from anybody exposing his translation but it was discovered that he some of these manuscripts the device had survived and they had not been destroyed and modern scholars who actually knew the language including some Mormon scholars translated it again a true translation had nothing whatever to do with Abraham or Egypt this is absolute cast on demonstration that Joseph Smith was a complete fake and charlatan this is fully documented and yet they go on believing that he was a prophet when he was 14 - when he came up with it which is even more bizarre see ya 1820 he's 14 years old I didn't know that there was a little kid yeah just a boy with a fantastic imagination and it sort of caught fire yes the golden plates which disappeared yeah and the seer stone into a hat it's just so strange to me that it persists but the people that practice the religion are so nice they're some of the nicest cult members I've ever met in my life yes I suppose so Mormons of my faith they're my favorite yeah absolutely my favorite even when they come on your doorstep and sort of they haven't if they did maybe I changed my mighty right over there Jamie good okay I'm also very interested in the perhaps even a even more recent things like the cargo cults hmm the Pacific where again these these actually arose in living memory and I was of the worship of Jordan from in some of the islands in the Pacific where you couldn't see what happened mm-hmm and this gives you an insight into what must have happened with Jesus where you know that the Gospels weren't written down until decades after Jesus's death if he ever liveth which he probably did and so having seen how easily the cargo cults arose people who worship John from worship Prince Philip believed that cargo planes were sent by the ancestors and would build dummy airfields with dummy control towers and radar dishes and dummy planes on the airfield and things this is all within living memory and something like that it just so transparent that something like that went on in the early church well the Scientology story to me is the most bizarre because it was literate I mean if you wanted to have a crazy religion like what would be the most ridiculous religion for people to believe in well and he even announced he was going to do it yes I still believe it but if you're gonna have the most ridiculous religion we would say well get a fiction author particularly a bad one a bad science-fiction author who walked around in a jacket with metal zombies he gave himself and have that guy create a religion a guy who is really self diagnosing his own psychological issues and trying to deal with him through this concept of Dianetics yeah I'm sure you read Lawrence Wright's book go ahead and read it but I mean I know the story the book is fantastic yes it's just so crazy it's so and it's so strange that to this day people are clinging to it and it makes you wonder like what is it about these systems of belief that are so intrinsically attractive to people so uniquely a part of being a person these these belief systems I think I get it when there's childhood indoctrination involved but in the case of Scientology some of the celebrities who joined it that's not childhood in don't know and that's just sheer rank stupidity I think there's also an element of being a part of a tribe yes that especially the celebrity thing because I've met quite a few of them out here especially in the early days the 90s before the internet came along and sort of exposed a lot of this stuff and South Park before they came along and exposed it there was quite a few people that thought there was a career advantage to being a part of Scientology there were so many successful actors they were a part of Scientology and they were they seemed to be disciplined and focused and they they were avoiding drugs and all the pitfalls of Hollywood fame and stardom and they also seemed to be helping each other that Hollywood directors who were also Scientologists would look towards hiring Scientologists producers and actors they're kind of freemasonry then yes yes there's some strange thing that we are all very attractive attracted to being a part of a tribe and being a part of even if the belief system is ridiculous if we are in a group that subscribes this belief system it's very attractive to people it's a very important point and tribalism is a very important part of human human nature a very eat of a bad part I think yeah and the rewarding part is well I suppose so Steven Pinker you probably had him at some point he makes the point that so much of what we believe we humans generally believe is not about evidence but is about is this part of my tribe right what does my tribe believe this yes and Jonathan hi it also makes the same point about Republicans and Democrats yes there's that there's a fierce tribalism going on and it's it accounts for so much of what people believe as opposed to actually looking at the evidence the Center for inquiry which my foundation has just merged with is of course all about trying to get people off that sort of thing that of irrationality and to instead evaluate claims on the basis of evidence critically evaluated scientific evidence but it's hard because people have other motives like emotion tribalism things like that well people find great comfort in these belief systems it gives them sort of I've often said that it gives them some sort of like a scaffolding for their just their structure of the world their ethics their morals they can use religion as some sort of a mechanism to help them get by something that they can climb on to ease some of the confusion of the unknown I'm sure that's true but I don't understand why anybody therefore thinks that therefore the religion is true why would you think because it provides you with a scaffold you can climb on that makes it true I could understand you erecting a scaffold that will say gymnastics or a certain diet or something like that but a belief about the universe that's how I that got to be true or not and it doesn't make it true just because it's comforting or provides you with a scaffold to climb on well it's almost like it's a spiritual system like a placebo effect like a spiritual placebo effect and by believing that this is true it gives you this comfort and allows you to condense your thoughts into a better path the placebo effect of course is very real and yes and doctors know about it but did you know that the perceiver effect works even if the patient is told it's a placebo yes that I don't get I mean that incredible yeah it's very strange well it's sometimes people doing things and knowing that they're doing things gives them this sort of feeling of momentum of accomplishment of progress and I think so many people are just so adrift and don't have focus that even just telling them hey we're gonna you're gonna be a part of this program yes program to treat X Y disease whatever it is and here's this thing like just just focusing on it I think the main reason why so many people believe in homeopathy which which not only doesn't work but cannot work is the placebo effect then they say well it's part of their gonna get better anyway of course but it's also the placebo effect that the homeopathic I would say doctor homeopathic practitioners yeah gives them nonsensical piece of medicine and they believe it's were going to work and so it does and and so the placebo effect is important the CFI central inquiry has actually got a lawsuit going on at the moment against pharmaceutical shops selling homeopathic remedies alongside genuine ones hmm we can't stop them actually selling homeopathic remedies what we can try and do is stop them putting them on the same shelf as though there's no difference but between them but my colleague Nick Humphrey who's a psychologist very insightful one things you could actually even justify homeopathy on the grounds that homeopathic practitioners are allowed to prescribe placebos they call them homeopathic where they are placebos whereas real doctors are not allowed to prescribe they used to real doctors used to try placebos all the time but they're now no longer allowed to because it violates human rights but homeopaths are allowed to a bizarrely because they don't call them placebos if they did they wouldn't be allowed to well I have a similar thought about chiropractic work chiropractors you know do relieve pain from some for some people but there's no reason why it works I would not be totally surprised if it worked I don't haven't looked into it enough I would absolutely be surprised if homeopathy works it cannot work because there's no active ingredient I can't well wait to tell you the story of chiropractic medicine that it was created by a guy who is a magnetic healer it was murdered by his own son and his son took over the business and started saying that it can cure everything from leukemia to heart disease everything all by manipulating the spine yes it was done in the 1800s and there's no science behind it at all but yet so many people have found pain relief and chiropractors today it's weird to lump them all in together but many chiropractors today do do good work because they incorporate legitimate modalities in terms of like rehabilitation like cold laser and all these different massage remedies and all these different things that actually physically work I know a woman who is that horse chiropractor she does know Christ but what I'm trying to make is that whereas it's a it's an empirical question whether it whether chiropractic works in the case of homeopathy it cannot work because the dilution is such that the there was nothing there visiting there right there's no chemical region one of these they will they say it can work because water has a memory but if they could prove that water has a memory they'd get the Nobel Prize for Physics and they're not going to one of the things that I really enjoyed about your book was when you explain to people that everyone who practices a religion is an atheist you're just an atheist in regards to Zeus or Hollow 999 other gods yes and that that's a home run yeah this Ark yes because just go one God further yes yeah but that it really is a home run because this is this concept of you know I me and my friends jokingly what would always say praise Odin when anything would happen it was that pretty good cool yes we say praise Odin and I started doing it online and people really got into saying praise Odin about certain things or other like that yes some people get mad at me they actually got mad that it was you're mocking Christianity by saying pretty you are why not really I was just having fun yes I was having fun because I owed encima we're cool God you know it's a old-school God you know I mean it's the god of the Vikings Douglas Adams wrote a lovely book called the long dark teatime of the soul which had in which the Norse gods apart a vision Odin in that in that book has got old and senile and he's just lies in bed all the time and asking for clean sheets every day and Thor is out there doing mischief with his great hammer and at one point Odin sees gets Thor super glued to the floor and think there's a wonderful story the vast number of different religions the I mean the incredible number I mean how many how many actual religions are there thousands thousands yes I'd say I forget how many thousands and many of them share similar belief systems and it's really interesting when you see how they're put like you know the Noah's Ark story is very similar to the epic of gilgamesh and there's so many that you see like oh they probably told this to someone else and these people moved in coast has traveled on and it's it's just amazing that that concept is alien to people when I was a boy I was raised Catholic and I had an aunt who was Jewish and my uncle married my aunt and he had to convert to Judaism and it was like a big deal in the family everybody would talk about it and it's there was no anger everybody loved my aunt she's great lady but it was just strange that he was converting to the sides of other religion I remember I was five years old when this was going on and I was like wait wait wait what do you mean another religion yes like what's going on yes and they're like oh she's Jewish I go what what does that mean what do you mean she's Jewish yes and they had explained it to me yeah okay but she believes in God like yeah that they believe in God okay so why is it a different thing well they believe Jesus was a different kind of a thing it was they don't they don't necessarily believe use the God that we think he was but if it's been Hindu they'd have had to explain to they believe in hundreds of gods Vishnu and yes yes yeah and then we'd have to go way back yeah it's just when you first hear that I mean that was put probably put the first seeds of doubt in my head when I was a young boy when I was like with this more than one like I'll never forget that moment cuz we're all sitting around the dinner table and I was just a little kid and everything what do you mean there's another one I think that's a very powerful way of getting to children is to just simply tell them that yes telling him nothing but facts you're not indoctrinated right he was telling them there are lots of different religions and Hindus believe in hundreds of gods and Jews but even one God and Muslims believe in one God and they don't believe in Jesus and and just lay out all the different religions that would be a very good educational exercise has there ever been a civilization that existed without a belief in a higher power I don't think there has no of course there are plenty of individuals who educate that don't believe in a higher power but I think probably true to say that ever every I mean anthropologist might couldn't might deny them and there might be some tribe that doesn't but I suspect they all do well there's been some tribes that worshipped animals and particularly oh yeah although they survived off of yes yeah and and and and river gods and thunder gods and and moon gods and Sun gods and forgot some things yes when you look at human civilization and you go back to the origins of religion and you look towards the future do you envision a time where humanity is free of what you would consider irrational belief systems or belief systems are not based on fact I do I'm not sure it'll come soon but I do and I look forward to that time of course I think we're moving in the right direction and the figures bear that out in even in America which is office of the scale of Western civilization's even in America the number of people who now subscribe to a religion is is is dropping dramatically and the number who say they have no religion is now about 25 percent that's a lot there is a deal and that compares to any one particular Christian denomination and yet politically that group the the nuns the note the no beliefs have no lobby they have no no powerful pressure group so politicians will go out there and suck up to I don't know the Irish lobby the Polish lot lobby the Jewish lobby the Catholic Lobby etc but the atheist lobby hasn't got his act together or isn't only just now beginning to get his act together well politically I think people are terrified of the concept because it's such a such a long branch to go out on one of the things you brought up in The God Delusion was the willingness of people to vote for a gay candidate for president a black candidate for president a woman candidate for president but then an atheist which is I believe 40% they think they think that you've got to have a belief in some kind of higher power in order to be moral but the weird thing is that it doesn't have to be the same higher power as the one you believe it anyone will do right as long as it as long as there is one but if you don't believe in a higher power you must be immoral you and that of is totally ridiculous how do you think about the horrible immorality of for example the both the Bible and the Quran which of which are horrific in the sense that if you build if you actually got your morals if you got your moral values from the Old Testament or the Quran and they they share that great deal of course you would be stoning adulterers to death and sterling people to death for breaking the Sabbath and doing he sacrifices human sacrifices and animal sacrifices all sorts of horrible things which of course do go on now in Islamic countries especially gay people getting thrown off high buildings and women being beheaded for the crime of being seen with a man not their husband and that kind of thing so that that we could see what you get when you get your morality from an Abrahamic scripture and yet there are still people in this country who say you cannot be moral unless you believe in a higher power what do you think let's extract these this concept of a higher power let's let's get rid of it let's let's get rid of where where do you think people get their morals and their ethics from and that's a profoundly difficult question we clearly don't get them from religion and yet we get them from somewhere and you can demonstrate that by the fact that the moral values of any particular century are markedly different from those of other centuries even decades so in the 21st century we here now have moral values which are really significantly different from a hundred years ago or 200 years ago or 300 years ago and within any one of those centuries you could take people who are in the vanguard of moral progress for example in the 19th century Abraham Lincoln Charles Darwin th Huxley would have been on the liberal progressive end of the spectrum and other people to be on the opposite end but even Abraham Lincoln for example made a speech were quoted in outgrowing God in which he said of course no nobody would seriously think that black people are the equal of white people nobody would seriously say that black people should be allowed to vote or should be allowed to marry white people this is Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves right and was as I say in the forefront of progressive thought Charles Darwin again was in favor of freeing the slaves he was passionately anti-slavery but he too thought that there was no question about black people being the equal of white people they obviously weren't and and and and Huxley Thomas Huxley again Darwin's Bulldog thought the same way now those people were at the forefront as I say today they would still be in the forefront and they would be horrified to look back on what they said mmm in the 19th century well something is changing as the centuries go by I in outgrowing God I call it something in the air which of course doesn't explain anything but what I mean by that is that it's not literally hovering in the air but it's a chemical it's a current collection of all conversations between people dinner party conversations parliamentary decisions congressional debates judicial decisions by judges juries newspaper articles journalism all these things together conspire together to produce something in the air something that that defines a given century or maybe even a given decade with the moral values of that of that decade then the knowledge base which is just so superior today in in terms of what the general public has access to in terms of what we understand about human beings it's just different than it was back then and it continues to be different and now with the internet we have so much more access to these conversations and it's not just about being a dinner table with the right people you can watch YouTube videos yourself debating religious scholars so that so the that progress of something in the air has allowed as it were take on an accelerated pace because of the internet yeah and I think that's a very hopeful sign of course the internet also can be used for the opposite purpose but there I think there's a kind of asymmetry there because especially if you look at the United areas of the world like Afghanistan and Pakistan where until recently the idea of vegan atheist was simply inconceivable it was off the radar they didn't even consider it it wasn't something that they thought was possible now they do because they got the internet and we've got a project within CFI of downloading free of charge as pdfs several of my books including The God Delusion and we'll be outgrowing God as well and these are being downloaded by large numbers of people the first PDF download of the Arabic edition of The God Delusion was downloaded 13 million times Arabic Edition 13 million times so now they are being exposed to the possibility of atheism which wasn't a posit of course there's still me the Internet is also exposing them to Islamic propaganda but they've had that all along from Imams mullahs and and their madrasah schools but now they've got it got it coming the other way as well and I have great hope that the internet will mark a turning point do you think that people need a structure and is it possible to give them a secular structure that mimics religion there's certainly some sort of a community aspect yes possibly I don't feel that very strongly myself and I rather than many other people do and there are people who are interested in starting up sort of atheistic or secular meetup groups on Sundays and lectures yeah my worry is that that will become a sex call always seems to have someone who gets in control who winds up as religious cows yeah I mean this is rotten restore is that awful man what he called them who ended up taking his followers to a South American jungle and Jim Jones Jim Jones Arya and I mean he had this gigantic harem of all the young women it always do yes Waco one that they all do yes yeah well okay I mean I don't think that's happening so far with the secular oh not once the worry is that once someone gets into position of being the person who gets to speak the Alpha the the one who's on the you know on the stage addressing people and giving them the doctrine that he becomes far too attractive for his own good well that that would not surprise any naive Darwinian who would say what another do you think do you become and the the dominant chimpanzee becomes dominant for right that's what it's all about exactly there's got to be a way to avoid that though I mean maybe maybe the the exposing nature of the internet would be the the thing that the the actual yes the thing that mitigate is I'm not personally that interested in meetup groups and communities are centers and things that other people are I mean I like it really care about is scientific truth and and that's what I'm trying to propagate that's very admirable but I think for some people it represents our bonding of the community you know you could have concerts and lectures and book clubs I think when they get together and they talk about all the values that Jesus proposed if Jesus is the higher power it gives them this sort of again moral scaffolding yes yes well Jesus would probably on the hill provide a fairly good moral scaffolding not totally but good right he was ahead of his time anyway do you so you do think he was a real person most of the scholars I've talked to say he probably was the evidence is not great of course but I think um I don't think it's that big a deal actually because he I mean a wandering preacher called Yeshua Yeshua would it not be surprising I mean it's a common name and the wandering preachers what would be very surprising would be if he raised Lazarus from the dead and water and turn water into wine now that of course didn't did not happen well why couldn't people just drink water either why did they have to drink one he's trying to get people drunk so that was a separate question i I mean I think it the point I'm making is that it's a very big difference as they did he exists and maybe he did maybe didn't who cares really or as that's very different from saying that a miracle worker right who really did do miracles rather than conjuring tricks existed yes what was the you you said that you wrote this it's a beginner's guide outgrowing God well it's for young people I originally wanted to write a book for the young children and publishers didn't want to do that they so they kept pushing the age range up and so it it stabilized at about 15 but I think 14 well I what the first chapter has been read by one ten-year-old of my to my acquaintances he loved it and I I think it but really I'm hoping it'll be read by people of all ages there's um one thing that does happen to some people that are indoctrinated very young that the experience is so so negative to them that they rebel and they rebelled and then they seek out other ways of thinking and then you find them eventually abandoning them religion there's a woman named Megan Phelps do you know she is I think she's Fred Phelps from the Sue's his granddaughter and yes amazing woman yes he wound up communicating with people through all things Twitter yes and men her husband she rebelled against your father yes yeah she wanted leaving the church and wind up realizing that she was trapped in some sort of a Christian cult and a very hateful one yes there that God hates fags be exactly on it and the same was true of Nate Phelps who was Fred Phelps his son and he also escaped he escaped on his 18th birthday well and and became an atheist and and became I think he's actually spoken at some of our conferences from time to time yeah there's there's hope in that yes there is it's just when I like when people cans and she I've had her in the podcast she's such a unique woman and she's so kind and she's so thoughtful and intelligent it's hard to believe that she's only been out of this cult for a few years me Twitter have only been around here why wasn't she really inviting why wasn't she ruined by and why she is so intelligent what how did she exist in that structure while being so intelligent I agree but of course you I feel the same way about apparently intelligent people who believe obvious nonsense you know and it's it's it's it's hard to understand it seems to be a part of what we are though it seems to be a part of what human beings obviously exists in so many different civilizations yes but decreasing numbers decreasing numbers of actual individuals right and in places like Holland and Scandinavia hardly anybody is religious really what are the numbers apart from immigrant Muslims who still are but among them I don't know that they're pathetically small is there any evidence that that is reaching the Muslim world as well and that people are well as I was saying the the downloads of of my books have been encouraging we have this thing called CFI has a thing called the translation project which is specifically in order to do that in order to to take my books and we hope other people's books as well and put them into PDFs and then have them available for free download and I hear evidence from is Iran from Egypt from Saudi Arabia from individuals who say yes there's now quite a substantial groundswell of anti religious anti-islamic opinion and I think it's going to increase and I'm really encouraged by that one of the things about Muslim in my eyes mmm it's very similar to being Jewish is that Jewish people it's there are many Jewish people that are not religious but they are Jewish like I have a very good friend my friend Ari he is he is Jewish but he is Nathan and it's he identifies with being a Jewish person he is Jewish relatives his father is a Holocaust survivor but he looks at it like a thing that he's a part of like a great long tradition he's a part of but he doesn't observe no I understand that I think especially for people of Jewish heritage who have relatives killed in the Holocaust I think it could be a matter of kind of loyalty to their murdered relatives mm-hmm I could easily get that and I think that there are probably cultural Muslims who probably not for the same degree of loyalty but police think of themselves as Muslims I suppose I meant cultural Anglican in the way I mean I sort of you know I can sing the hymns and and I my family observes Christmas as a result away when someone sneezes do you say bless you I never did say bless you actually but right I know I know I don't say anything but I have no objection to saying because I don't one cause that was religious but not religious but they my college at Oxford had a fella who was a famous philosopher a famous atheist a Jair and he when he was senior fellow he used to say grace at dinner and when he was asked why he said I will not utter falsehoods but I have no objection to uttering meaningless statements now when you set out to write this book and write it for young people how did you structure it in your mind did you use did you address did you think of it as addressing young people with questions that are trying to talk yes it's in two halves the first half is debunking God it begins with what we were talking about earlier this year number of different gods and then moves on to the Bible and how unreliable a source of information it is and both the Old Testament and the New Testament they get a chapter each and then there's a couple of chapters on morality and why you don't need or not only do not need religion to be moral you better not have religion if you want to be moral but then the second half of the book is about science but because I think that one of the possibly the major reason people still cling to religion is a belief that the world is so complicated especially the living world is so complicated that it cannot be explained by purely scientific means and so I've set out to disabuse them of that and to show how even the most radically complicated and beautiful and elegant pieces of animal design can be and are explained by science so that's most of the second half that's a weird one right the argument that it's too complicated for it to not be of the divine well it's I'm not sure as weird it's it's kind of understandable until you've thought about it for a bit because complicated things don't just happen complicated things like these cameras and this computer and things like that they if we all know they had to have an engineer design them and factories to build them and they're very very improbable things statistically improbable the components of a computer or a camera if you jumble the up at random they wouldn't work obviously so it's kind of pardonable that people should think there must have been a designer but then you think of it further and you realize that the designer himself would need just the same kind of explanation and therefore the designer is not an explanation that flies and I mean philosophers before Darwin viola philosophers like Hume realized that but didn't have anything to put in its place Darwin came around gave them that which you need to put in his place and when humid have loved Darwin if only he lived long enough to to meet him to meet his ideas so I think we have to have sympathy for people who think that complexity must mean design but nowadays we know better and that's what the second half of outgrowing God is about who designed the designer that is that that's the big conundrum for people who believe in God yes it is and they they shrug it off they say oh well he didn't did need a designer he was always there all but well my favorite one isn't why did he wait until 6000 I know yes I know exactly yes that that seems rather specific is his favorite favorite one we have in in the Center for inquiry a program came over from the Richard Dawkins foundation when we emerged called ties the teacher Institute for evolutionary science which is teaching teachers how to teach evolution because middle school teachers in this country apparently are not don't have science degrees and they don't really know how to counter how to combat the pushback that they get from children and parents and school boards and things specifically against evolution and so we we are teaching teachers how to teach evolution I mean we run workshops do not run one in every State of the Union and that I think is one of the that's one of the projects of CFI which is closest to my heart so back to this book sorry folks through a little bit of technical difficulty what was your motivation for this you were just trying to figure out a way to sort of cut off these these notions at the room yes I mean I'm worried about childhood indoctrination and the fact that people who are religious almost certainly adopt the religion of their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents and so we've got a kind of pseudo genetic inheritance going on and I I really hate that I mean that that's wicked that's that's indoctrination of children so I've always wanted to try to break that chain going down the generations I've always wanted to write a book for young people and of course it's highly necessary when you see the enormous and pernicious influence of fundamentalist religion especially in this country actually yes now the science aspect of it this is I mean obviously when you talk about the science of evolutionary biology and natural selection and random mutations and all these different things that lead to a thing becoming a human being over the course of billions of years it's such a complex idea for people to grasp how is it how do you condense it and sort of simplify the path you introduce them to the works of these great scientists that have sort of established these these ideas for them it's actually a very simple idea but it plays out in very complex ways and I think the main problem from a didactic point of view is that the results are so complex that it's hard to believe that anything so simple as natural selection non-random selection of randomly varying genes could really be responsible for producing something as complicated as a human body hmm and so it's a matter of getting around beating that barrier of incredulity if the idea was more complex in a way it might be easier that's the fact that the idea is so simple I think that may be why it took so long for a Darwin to come on the scene when you think about in the middle of the nineteenth century is rather late 200 years after Newton did the face of it much cleverer things and yet it was another 200 years after Newton before Darwin came along I think the reason for that is that the idea is just too simple it's always ridiculously simple to be big enough to achieve the feat of explaining the complexity of any part of an animal really on but let alone animal is there any are there any examples that you point to in nature or observable evolution has occurred because there have been some where we've seen observable evolution over the course of you know the last yes I mean Dawid himself made great play of domestication which is very fast and which has occurred in historical time so we we can see how wolves have been changed in topeka nieces and poodles and Labradors and spaniels and and that's a very very major change to have occurred in only a couple of thousand a few thousand years and we see the same with cabbages and with roses and with horses and all sorts of other things that's artificial selection not natural selection everybody knew about artificial selection of course farmers and gardeners pigeon fanciers all knew about it Darwin's great insight was to shochet you don't need a human selector you don't need a human breeder to do the transformation from wolf to pub Pomeranian Nature does it for you non-random survival is the equivalent of a human breeder doing the breeding so that's what what Darwin did and and as for examples of natural selection we do have some the famous peppered moths in Britain is one of them mosquitos I think is explain in the purple marsupial yes very peppered moths is the this is a moth called based on virtual area which is lizard tree bark it sits on on tree bugger is perfectly camouflage it looks like tree bark so it's it's light coloured and then the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries caused the woods around industrial areas like Manchester and Birmingham to become blackened and so the moths stood out they became conspicuous and they were picked off by birds but Newton mouths were black and the mutant black moths were not picked off by birds and so what happened was that the percentage of black moths in the populations around industrial centers like Birmingham and Manchester it became much more numerous and the light colored ones became almost extinct in those areas with at the same time the light colored moths in rural areas far from industrial pollution like Devon and Somerset stayed with their their original original color and this was worked out beautifully by by a battered Oxford actually called Burnett Kettlewell and and he showed he actually went and sampled in these different areas and also did experiments showing birds actually picking off light colored moths in dark areas and and vice versa that's one that we can trace that we can trace yes because the Industrial Revolution was only a couple of hundred years ago so that that's an excellent example for people to see like this happens look at this over 500,000 years look at this over 10,000 years I mean this is this is what happens this is a random selection well this one happens have over only one hundred years or a hundred years but that this is how a human being came to be that this same process yes that's right and and the the creationist don't like the peppered moth story they say oh well that's just one one gene they mean they they try to say that that same process will not give rise to major changes like from reptiles to birds or mammals oh so but it just is the same process over a much much longer period and what couldn't be achieved in a couple of hundred years is more what can be achieved in a couple of thousand years is wolf to Pekinese what can be achieved in a couple of million years is Australopithecus to homo sapiens what can be achieved in a hundred million years is shrew to human and a thousand million years would be bacterium to to human well well maybe not maybe two to two thousand million years but it's just a it when you're living in the present and you're thinking of yourself and you're thinking of biological life it's it's hard for a person to see things on those scales which is one of the reasons why I think for many people that aren't educated in these these sort of subjects to to buy into this concept of some sort of intelligent design yes well timescales are well we have no concept of millions of years we can really just about cope with when even thousands of years even going back to the ancient Egyptians we get a kind of free song of all I don't you know wondering what it was like what the Epic of Gilgamesh what what was it like then that's nothing compared to eeveelution your time that's just me it's not even yesterday it's a couple of minutes ago it's it's ridiculously short time well you have a heart out at four o'clock and that time has come so I want to thank you for being here and I want to thank you for your commitment over the years to educating people and just you have an amazing amount of endurance for this stuff and because of that a lot of people have you know shifted their ideas and gravitated toward science it's been a pleasure thank you very much thank you very much Richard Dawkins ladies and gentlemen bye-bye good thank you and I have to sign this [Music] [Music]
