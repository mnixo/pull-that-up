talk about your fucking time I could talk with that wait a bit tie bar 1 boom gavin McGinnis you are live sir from Williamsburg Brooklyn which I understand you invented yes I did congratulations thank you very much can you see all the hipsters walking around just like you do you feel proud sort of you like the bait the daddy yeah I'm the Godfather of hipster him I don't feel I've always been sort of anti follower mmm like there's ways you can get followers where you you know don't piss anyone off and I probably could have a big following with these super far-right dudes the cock Servet of guy's cock servitude yeah they call you a cock if you race mix and stuff you this time that's a first but I ostracize them is for being a race mixer and then I could probably get gamer followers but I think it's gay to play video games Oh like the gamergate yeah gay like homosexual no gay in the in the grade school center lane yeah why is it why is it lame video games are fun you're pretending you're Batman that's 40 years old you could be 80 years old still pretend you're Batman yeah that's remember when we were kids we're probably the same age how old you I'm 45 48 so you'd see those guys playing Star Wars when with 10 year olds when they were like 13 and you felt bad for those guys that's true and now those guys the average video game players 31 but why is it okay to play chess and it's not okay like a real online strategy game I've been thinking bout that a lot actually this week and really yeah and I think it's because when you play a silly game like poker or chess there's some social interacting going on mmm like you'll go you fucker right if you're in the room shit and you're talking to the guy and you develop a relationship and then you know later on you guys are at a bar or something and it's like you fuck me just like you did then you know two months ago with that checkmate move or something right so it's improving your relationship with the people around you hmm that's interesting I never really considered that but video games you're shooting monsters it's into the void it's-it's ephemera you're blowing away time like dust well they found that videogames actually do improve cognitive function some sort of strange way and even can improve improve your your vision sure great it's kind of crazy because you know your vision you're darting around the screen especially like first-person shooters you know you're looking for things that are trying to kill you yeah it's like this cab drivers in London have that over developed part of their brain that does directions really yeah it's physicans physically see that part of the brain is sort of engorged the directions part of the brain whoa so if they do like an fMRI on them or something like that yeah I think it's like somebody's cat scans could probably identify a London cab driver whoa yeah crazy so that's good you're working at a muscle but I witnessed a cab driver screaming at an uber driver last night you know cuz he's fuckin uber drivers they look like it's just it looks like a normal Camry or something like that right and there's a cab driver and the cab driver is pulling up these people that are waiting for something and I don't know what the deal was with the people had called an uber or called a cab and an uber you know sometimes people will do that people are assholes you know they'll call both and see let's see who shows up first and the uber guy was in front the cab driver is honking out his horn screaming at them and uber driver you could always tell the uber driver cuz they always have an iPhone and one of those little iPhone holders so they could type in the address and just go it's always like sitting right there yeah and you know I'm like my about to see some shit go down because I was right next to it I was like this guy's gonna get out and kick this guy's ass or something's gonna happen but nothing better than seeing a live fight I've seen a lot of them couples to male and female couples having fight if you go to New Orleans during Mardi Gras and she's wasted and you're just like I'm gonna pull up a chair and grab some popcorn but I love riffing with people and I fucking hate cab drivers cuz they're from another country and they don't know how to riff like the guy that brought me here I'm like what's going on with the traffic when the other one he goes what this year going that way yes dude what do you think I mean the traffic we're not in traffic this traffic right there and he's like oh he's maybe they are going someplace maybe yeah I know they're going I'm trying to get into like are they shopping one so you want the small talk I want the small talk see I don't want the small talk so when I get the small talk I'm like I have to pull my earphones out what oh yeah I guess they're given up cuz you've been abused by immigrants for so long I want to riff with barmaids I want to riff with drivers I want to riff with the woman I'm ordering my coffee from and I just I just see these immigrants doing these jobs and I go these are teens jobs we're in the teens Oh like driving cars or teens jobs yes really well I actually you know I drove limos for a bit when I was in my 20s in my early 20s but um what's the matter Jamie as Flitz let me let me extract LaBrie a little bit here in 2015 with unemployed teens everywhere in unemployed college students they should be driving cabs now traditionally I like the idea of Archie Bunker with the stubby cigar and the tweed hat saying that he saw a prostitute die right on this corner as we drive that's ideal right what I'm saying as far as fixing the system now I want teens doing immigrant jobs see I don't want teens driving definitely yeah no day no I didn't like the way I drove when I was a teenager I don't want anybody like me driving me and I I don't mind immigrants as long as I can ask him like where they're from and like you learn some weird shit about people that's I asked the guy here I go it's English it's just massacring the English language I'm watching someone just murder it is his place company and I go no you mean is the place we're going to a company yes he's place company and there's no interest in learning the language I go how long you been here for and he goes six-year I'm like six-year if I was in Armenia for six years I would be Armenian poet yeah but he could just go to Glendale and fit right in exactly I almost asked that I almost said Hamlet said why do you only hang out with Armenians right like it assimilates anymore I like Armenians because they're the last unabashedly masculine mmm like ethnicity in this country well my skins are my cheese mo sort yeah that's true too but they've more they've integrated more into the Aryan culture especially in Southern California medians they walk around with gold chains and wifebeaters on and yeah those string vest I have a friend who's Armenian his name is Armand which is hilarious and you know he was talking about this girl that talk shit to him and he's like and you know what and this fucking bitch was Armenian like you don't know any better like like they have like special rules I there was this Armenian dude I knew a long time ago he's an enforcer for a little shark and he's in jail now for double homicide but he gave me the best tip about picking up chicks he goes wend sorry I'm burping like some drinkin beer me when you're with woman right you say yes to everything if she's late you say no problem if she don't show up for dead you say no problem don't worry about it you pay for everything you say it's okay you if she's rude to you even if she hit you you say oops you know you just let it go yes yes yes then the second she say I love you you turn that bitch around and you fuck her in the ass and you punish her father bullshit you put your through whoa and it's true I think that guys doing it wrong Oh plus the real jail not just jail jail what did he do he murdered two people at once no homicide yeah that's that'll put you away yeah people frown upon that it's well we've noticed a pattern over time since cave days where when we allow that mm-hmm it gets worse it gets worse and worse and worse and that's one of the most amazing things about human history how frequently people were just killing each other up until really recently yeah like I was at a place recently last week actually that didn't have they didn't have cable they didn't have internet but they have stack of DVDs and so was there all right well we got here and we watched Gangs of New York right and you know that opening scene with Liam Neeson's crew versus Daniel day-lewis is clear battling with fucking machetes and axes and chili that that's not that long ago that movie was hyperbolic but there was like a claw lady who had the claws bill the butcher was a guy yeah he did he was a butcher he did have a fucking glass eye yeah and he probably did kill a gang of people yeah yeah well you look at life expectancy in you go people died really young back then but no I think the those stats are skewed by the number of people who died childbirth five ten years old twenty in a fight yeah guys that live to 75 yeah but so many of so many people died young mmm that it fucks the stats and you think everyone died at 30 yeah stats are interesting like that right like you got to go oh how is that possible and then you could look oh I see it's because so many people were murdered okay you look at old photos like you got that old mugshot who's that Rosa Parks yeah you're the first guy to guess that correctly by the way yeah and you're there all cross-eyed in them and I she's not but I realize oh you run a fucking all-out brawl and your retina got separated from your eye and then it was just oh well I look from now on I lost one eye this eye right eye doesn't work but that's fine yeah they didn't fix anything back then I have a buddy I put this on Instagram yesterday is a fucking nasty picture my buddy got a staph infection and it became mersa do you know the medication resistant staph oh oh oh it's disgusting I know if a guy had that so bad oh my god that's fucking gross how deep is that hole well they had to open him up that the big scar up the the knee was because the infection was so bad they had to cut him open like a fish and they had to disinfect the area and drain the area but it all came about because his knee was swollen so he had his knee drained and he got his knee drained and he caught MRSA at the hospital he doesn't know you know you don't know where you catch it and a lot of guys get it from jiu-jitsu because you jitsu either there's a lot of scratches and a lot of abrasions they actually have specific soap that they've developed just to keep your your skin flora your outside skin just talking before the show about how jujitsu ruined your back it definitely hurts stuff let's stop the jujitsu it's lose-lose what's the lam know you learn how to people it's very fun it's like the most advanced version of chess huh everyone says that about every sport yeah they do I know it's like everybody says chess boxing his chest it's like people say well that's that's our version of the word nigger it's like that expression like gay people like to say that with the word faggot or I've heard that with tranny like that stuff yeah I heard that with long hair these dudes who we did an article about in vice a long time ago but guys who were super serious about long hair and getting through that awkward phase they call it what's like here and someone goes get a haircut and they go that's our version of nigger that's like our version of being dragged behind a truck oh my for Texas behind a truck is pretty much the worst thing that can happen you haircuts don't feel like anything somebody really said that yeah they should be beaten yeah that person should be thrown to a maximum-security penitentiary Doris just just have them get their ass kicked don't drag them on a truck till they die drag them behind a truck for 15 feet because that probably kills kill you it won't kill you but it hurts like your head depends on how you protect your head you know cuz you might hurt your elbow and then lift your elbow up and then you faceplant and then it's over right cuz you know how strong are you mentally to let your elbows just grind down to nothing because once that 15-feet starts you don't really know when it's gonna end I mean they might say they're gonna take you for 15 feet but you you know no you have faith that they don't just go [Applause] gasps and oh my god I think it's worse than drought 15 miles yeah it's worse than being buried alive - yeah well buried alive I don't think would be as painful to be horrific and terrifying drowning they say is actually fairly peaceful once you just give right it's like there's the struggle and then you get let's go how would they know burns on what you lived round burned alive maybe they can test the stress levels like the amount of adrenaline net on the cadaver or something I don't know why you'd bothered yeah let's go burn to live top drag - Chuck - drowning 3 in Canada we say buried mmm buried alive for I say buried oh you do yeah what do people say buried buried how do you pronounce the space place as a buried how do you NASA NASA how do you say it Nassau is right is your second day different than your first day NASA that's true it's not na s eh hmm NASA NASA NASA NASA but what do some people say well it's NASA now so you need to say NASA but why would you say now saw there's no W you're right that's stupid you're right Wow learning a lot today we fixed it like black people love acronyms like like like Fame stands for you know forget anything me and everyone you know what I mean well I think it's a sign of a year when you get into the word rather than go look it up and they'll be like library where they keep the lies why don't you move past just the fucking word library and get into like publishing or what gets published and what doesn't I don't need you to take apart the syllables things my favorite is fear false evidence appearing real no no no you should be fucking scared there's some shit that'll kill you I'll tell you that is the biggest way worse and racism and anything the biggest albatross on black America's neck is this vision this this assumption that the world is out to get you hmm and there's no sense in trying you go to law school you can graduate Alma come latte or whatever it's called you won't get a law job because you're black so they go well fuck you world like when the Ferguson riots were where cops are killing us we're fighting back and you go cops aren't killing you stop assuming they kill that one guy yes sort of but then the Ferguson one was the worst example it's weird how examples get picked up and then people run with like the worst one it's like like Ferguson was that was a bad guy that was a guy that had just committed a robbery Lee just had punched the cop was in a fistfight with the cop and got shot at close range like he shot he and then then shot him and then people like hands up don't shoot like that became the narrative like boy I don't know if there's a lot of evidence that that hands up thing happened at all not guys seems like a thug I can get you black guys shot by cops I can get you black guys killed by racists I can get you black guys who stuck stuck with their families and had kids and got fucked over in a retail for no reason let's do those guys right it's not sexy enough yeah but like how well here's a sexy one that I understand didn't take off as much like that Tamir rice kid the 12 year old kid hate that guy saw that kid for two fucking seconds and shot him and killed him that's a BB gun yeah he had an airsoft gun and the guy who shot him had poor evaluations on his his ability to handle stress had a breakdown during one of his training exercises they they said he was terrible at communicating to the point where they didn't think that he would be able to fix it they didn't think they'd be able to make him a good cop he resigned from that police force was picked up by this police force goes on to fucking kill this kid then on top of that they do they have private people investigated or whatever groups they have investigated and they decide that what he did seemed normal like that was the most recent finding that what he did seem like a bunch of kids shooting people with BB guns in that area and doing robberies with BB guns it was in that area I do not know that it may be possible but either way you don't fucking shoot a 12 year old kid within two seconds of seeing them I mean if he's got a BB gun you just don't you don't do that that the whole that but to me that one is like oh my god you're dealing with a 12 year old boys playing with a gun a toy gun I don't know whether or not there was an epidemic I don't have this is the first time I'm hearing that but that makes a little more sense but that seems to me like a way better one to highlight oh yeah that's that's a serious man well the elephant in the room with all this stuff is black failure white guilt and we need to explain why blacks are imprisonment Eve to explain why blacks are doing badly and to say Oh cops are fucking horrible racist pigs and America's racist explains away the failure and then there's no culpability and you go oh that's why they're doing bad it's our fault and then you can get on with your day but no you're in jail because you've committed a crime right but the problem is like when crime is all around you you grow up in this environment that's the same as it was 30 40 years ago I had this guy Michael Wood who's a Baltimore cop on the show and he they when he was a cop he was talking about this area with used to rest people this is the area where the drugs were is there with a lot of violent crime in this place and they found this man date from 1970 something right 70 something and when they found it it was the exact same areas with the exact same crime like they were going over the police reports from the 70s they're like Jesus Christ so we fucking spinning our wheels or what like this is the exact same areas the exact same kind of crime like it's never going to change it's just such a swarm of bullshit in this one area these kids grow up in this it becomes their environment they become institutionalized like it becomes their their reality and then they're stuck and it's so hard to get out of that it's so hard for me to empathize with that I mean I look at Green Point which is a really poor Polish neighborhood and it's crime free there's drunks all over the street passed out but it's crime free you look at any poor Eastern European neighborhood like right in beach in Brooklyn and I think I'm my dad my dad grew up so poor that his toes make me dry heave cuz he had his brothers hand-me-down shoes and they were too small and if you wear shoes too small after an hour you're like I'm gonna kill myself but his whole life was shoes that were too small he looks like Chinese foot binding and he fought every day of his life you know sup with his brothers whom he fought every day and he got scholarships because he was smart but I mean Glasgow being a student is like the worst thing it can be so if you have a private school blazer that's like wearing a Klansmen uniform in Harlem so he fucking shouldn't and then so his nose he looks like a boxer he looks kind of like Karras one his nose is totally fried he's got huge elephant like inner tire lips no no I said outfit big elephant lips and he made tons of money and brought us to Canada raised a middle-class family from poverty and he never complained about it once and he would have a million reasons to say that's why I fucked up and that's why I'm in jail but I did go to jail but don't you think that this is an environment like you're talking about a guy who lived in a certain area and moved to another area like had had the courage and had the ambition to get out of that area and it became a thing with Europeans I mean the United States was essentially founded by Europeans who weren't happy with Europe so these ambitious people that created this new environment in these new places and these new immigrants who you know all got together and they created these communities like you know I my grandparents lived in Newark and you know that was an Italian community that all came over here they all came over from the boat from Italy and my grandfather him the other side came over from Ireland but this is like a group of people that were very ambitious and wanted to do better so they came to America whereas you deal in the african-american community with people who were slaves that were do you an American look when we say black yes okay so black community you're dealing with people whose ancestors were slaves and then they are released and they live in these environments then you have in places like Baltimore institutionalized racism where you're really not allow it to sell but they did they had places where you weren't allowed to sell homes to black people like it was it's yeah that was then you want to talk about what the Irish went through I don't know I think you're in 2015 you're not in life is who you are and I was actually thinking about you I was beating off the other day thinking about and no but I was thinking about you socks on or off I had to get my socks off because I had is in them but I used growing up punk rock you laugh at Hollywood and you laugh at celebrity and you go they're all fucking phony losers but in my old age I'm starting to think maybe these people are talented and you were on that show what was a radio day whose radio news radio right look at all the other people on that show you get I think you get 11 million listeners is that right probably little more than that now a really insane episode of Hannity which is the most successful show on the most successful network I think it's four million 11 million is fucking insane I think Anderson Cooper gets a hundred thousand viewers so I'm starting to think maybe Joe Rogan is just very talented like Jennifer Aniston she was on that show friends right Courtney Cox had her Cougar Town thing mm-hmm normally I would roll my eyes at this but I honestly was thinking about this yesterday I thought wait a minute she went from friends to Hollywood maybe she's just a really good actress maybe he's just really good at her job and if you dropped her out of a plane in Costa Rica maybe within a few days she'd have like a coconut stand and you know maybe she was genetically predisposed to be successful well I don't necessarily think it's genetically predisposed but she certainly worked on it yeah but they all did everyone on friends worked out I don't think they did I mean Matt LeBlanc's got a show now on Showtime right here's some show that ya like Joey where he's he plays himself no it's some new show that's like he you know you let his hair grow gray and I don't know what the fuck he's doing but but the other people in the show they kind of they made a shitload of money and that kills ambition right and they kind of stop but she was the only one that really developed a film career and obviously she works hard but that's the case with almost all those shows it's like one person goes on to do it what I'm saying is maybe that person was very talented like Phil Hartman was on Newsradio yeah incredibly talented guy he would be rich and famous if his fucking wife didn't blow his head off yeah no doubt unquestionably but the guy that was on the show from kids in the hall Dave Foley maybe he's not talented no he's very talented but Dave he went through a fucking horrible divorce and is still going it's it's this is what happened I'll explain to you he had he was married while he was on Newsradio and he was making more money than than ever in his life and so well like 30 grand an episode probably maybe more than that I think I was probably making that so he's probably make it more than me 50 yeah something like that and when they broke up and got divorced the judge ordered him to pay a certain amount of child support base not alimony a certain amount alimony but the child child support was based upon the amount of money that he was making at the time and he had argued that was unreasonable and the judge literally said to him your ability to pay is has no relation to your obligation to pay and he was like what the fuck does that mean like you you have an obligation to pay I don't care what your ability to pay that's true if you remove the amount if you have a kid you're obligated to pay but yeah well you're looking at you know he's making several hundred thousand dollars a month and then all of a sudden he has to pay half of that and he can't so he was like within a very short order it was half a million dollars in debt to this woman who is in his words a raging cunt she was always in a crazy person she's just in his entitles but again I'm lacking empathy and I'm Dante Nero do you know who he is beige Philips yes yes his shit is and I agree with him if your marriage failed you fucked up your the with a few exceptions like Jim goads wife is fucking insane but if your marriage failed then you your boat sank and you're the captain of the ship and man why did you have kids like louis c.k he's bragging about is divorced and how awesome it was and I've talked to friends I know all his friends I don't know him but they're always like well she was a nut and she was a rich artist type and she she was wasn't livable livable with Abel and I go why'd you come in her then why'd you come in a crazy bitch so even the few exceptions you control their change if you don't man you that's crucial her but you tend the kids people change like men change women change you can't control change together but you don't always you sometimes you just want your job there that's like saying you have a corporation and your employees you know you say oh when my employees change no this is how we're running the company you guys have to show up 9:00 to 5:00 and we're gonna do it this way we're making grapple grummons well sometimes things even though they're successful they fail over time like Pontiac the GTO is an awesome car so is a Trans Am none of them exist in Malaysia doesn't they should have adapted or not I should have made shitty or just did a good job let's get out of here Doc Martens were Punk skinhead shoes then they were 90s grunge shoes now they're lesbian Footwear and then they went let's be lesbian Footwear we gotta adapt let's become Fluevog x' right well this certainly you can adapt but you might be you might be happier breaking up giving her money and then finding young girls you can have sex with like Lucy Kate's doing I'm against it why that's not the way it goes for the kids okay that I agree with you that I agree with you and that's what's worse you need to start interrupting me you have to have kids so you don't have kids right I have three oh that's awesome are you married yeah oh great with the three kids you have a witness her yeah well that's I'm glad I can relax cuz every time I talk about divorce and kids especially with people in the comedy world I'm talking to someone who's divorced you never had kids well it's it's very common but I am married specifically because I have kids and then to see I mean I've always said don't get married don't get married marriage it's a contract with the state which I agree with up until when I had kids I was like look bringing a life into the world to me is Wayne more of a commitment than a legal contract that you can get out of with a lawyer right so like that that contract the contract with the child was so much bigger and so much more involving and I had so much more commitment to raising kids I was like okay let's do it like if you want to like it if I get divorced some somewhere down the line then you fucked up well maybe not you know maybe it's just people want a moon oh wow throw it but what I'm saying is not while the kids are young I mean I'll do everything I can to not because I just think for kids it well I say that but goddamn it I know a lot of goddamn interesting people that became interesting I'm not gonna use this as an excuse because I'm actually happily married but people that became interesting because they went through childhood breakups and they moved around a lot sort of I mean Mike Tyson is a good fighter cuz his childhood was hell didn't she want everyone to have a shitty childhood so they become good no no I mean the son not necessarily good fighter but I mean like interesting people like every interesting person that I know overcame adversity they went through some crazy shit that's a great point that's a great point it's a hard thing like you have children yeah I got three so when you're you know I'm sure you take care of your kids but do you think of it like man I'm sort of sheltering these children from the very things that made me interesting a lot of my friends that have kids we kind of go through that dilemma yeah but I got plans for that I mean I want to boarding school yeah for real yeah boarding camp boarding school really like send him away to go to school every top producer at Fox News went to boarding school okay well then don't send your kids to boys there you go I got that nailed I keep thinking you're right wing but you're not in some ways okay in some way I'm a very I'm an outlier I'm a middle of the road and a lot like I'm in the NRA but I support gay rights and you know and a million other things that pro-choice million of the things that people would associate with left-wing obviously Pro marijuana right well you're normal basically just I just don't believe in right or left I think most of it is bullshitting these ideologies that used to have to rigidly apply you know and you were originally adhere to the right or the left and you you know you automatically I got had a conversation once with this fucking guy at a party and I'll never forget this he was talking about Democrat she's like well we gotta win the Senate because if we win the saga we what is this we shit what is this we is it you want a team are you want a team cuz you're talkin we like you are you as well as a lifelong Democrat like you're a lifelong Democrat Dallas Cowboys ice-water people to be left alone I want yes just to in politics is two groups it's people who want to be left the fuck alone and people who won't leave them the fuck alone and I tend to go right on most things because the right as of today seems to want smaller government in the left but that's not always true Bush spent way more than Clinton I don't know if I believe that I think they just go where the money is I think the goal of the money isn't they go with the influences you know we were talking before the show about this thing that I'm doing with Anthony Bourdain where we're gonna an episode of a show that we're going hunting for birds and we're gonna talk about a public land versus private land and Steve Rinella who's a the host of this show meat-eater who's on the podcast early this week had a really good point about about politics he's like he said I'm a political eunuch was his words he goes because you got the left which is trying to take away gun rights so I can't support that and then you got the right who supports your gun rights but they're taken away private land they're taken away or public land that is used for hunting they're selling away to corporations and so he goes like I'm kind of fucked he goes because in both hand cuz he's a professional hunter so on both on both sides he's like I can't adhere to either one of these the right is selling land away to corporations to what right is doing is there there are many on in the Republican administration and many on our side that are supporting the rights of corporations to either sell away or take away some public lands right now used you know there's public national parks and public areas when they find these resource rich areas that they can exploit and make a lot of money then they'll sell contracts these corporations I mean this is what's going on in Alaska when they're talking about drilling and but maybe give it time the free market will make nature better I mean we saw that in Bob way Mugabe was starving the fuckin wildlife to death and then he started selling off the land they realized that it is in their best interest to have lions and fucking zebras and giraffes running around so wildlife started coming back and that cease of the lion dude was sort of a result of the free market getting involved in sorting but that's a very extreme example of an insanely poor area and on top of that one of the best versions of that there's a Louis Theroux documentary on these African hunting camps and I you know I hunt so I have these conversations with people all the time the way they did it in Africa the most of the animals that are hunted on a regular basis now we're on the verge of extinction all these different like kneeling eelain's and differently Bucks and different kinds of deer and antelope they're fucking dying off like crazy right but now they have them these private hunting camps so they have thousands of them and there's Isis right throught but they're thriving so that people can go over there and kill them like it's this crazy catch-22 that's mine you can't it's like the guy found a Greenpeace who's now kind of anti Greenpeace goes if you want more forests buy more wood because you incentivize trees right but in order to get a real good hardwood tree that's a hundred feet tall it has to grow for hundreds of years and if you chop all those fuckers down you're not gonna have any not only that you change the environment in which these trees grow all the birds the songbirds disappear their nesting areas go away the environment completely changes like there's a lot of issues you can't just say yeah but like go in there and general Americans there's our trees now than there ever was before mm-hmm and that's true yes more trees and more trees now know a lot of them are small I mean II yeah but that's because we like trees we need trees well because we sell I look at like Ducks Unlimited right isn't that run by hunters yes so they are doing more for marshlands than the government ever could that's true yeah that's true that's because they didn't want those lands those are public lands Oh like the the lands there they're preserving there's these habitats are public so what are these corporations doing with this land likes well look fracking fracking you issue you know awesome yeah well is it yeah is it it's not awesome if you live down water from it and your water it there's a possibility it could pollute I definitely please water no it does not but there's definitely wells that have been polluted by fracking maybe one come on that's not true yes movie how many black Nations one movie was a nominee for honey was like your tap water on fire that's that water was always flammable it's naturally occurring methane in the water there's burning Springs New York it's my fame Nassau they use centrifugal force that that water was always flammable that's why the people frack there cuz there's methane in the water well I don't know if that's the case and it's the case it can be that that's the case just like about air conditioner falling in your head is risky everything has inherent risk and where I am in the Catskills my place upstate there's tons of perfect land for fracking and these people all the hippies all the weekenders the city it says they're called obsidian yeah they banned it Mark Ruffalo is one of the big guys up where I am oh the Hulk you know Hulk banned it and these kids in my neighborhood up there are an F Afghanistan so they're going there risking their lives to get what I call unethical oil oil from people who stone women to death because we've considered natural gas some sort and fuckin eighty percent of your natural gas is already fracked all of Ohio Texas that's all fracking well it certainly changed the the price of gas gas is dropped dramatically since they started doing that racket up but I'm scared of them polluting wells and I'm scared than ruining water supplies and the under underground water supplies okay this is a lot of hands with Tia and LA in general where me and LA and John I'm a part of LA that's a pattern I've noticed here okay where you go like I heard it you with Greg Fitzsimmons and you were talking about teachers mm-hmm and you're like the children are our future they don't get paid enough right and it's Marc Maron's says that too I got in a fight with him and he never aired my what the fuck podcast that's really why well here's my theory he claimed us because I came out as a trans phobe and what's our interview is now incomplete and it would be weird to release it without me I was discussing trans wait a minute you came out a post post interview as a trans folk yes why is having an opinion on something whether it's a negative or positive opinion why is that a phobia exactly and I that was my point I said your dad cutting his cock off you're scared that that's scared like that would be scary hmm you wouldn't be like good morning I guess mom you would be freaked the fuck out and that's a phobia so we're all transphobic so I said transphobia is perfectly natural well I think I have you guys yeah but it's only because of this this guy was a guy for 30 years became a woman for literally 24 months started beating the fuck out of women and if you watch the fights you're not talking about even a skillful person it's just like it it's it's someone who's just got a completely different frame I mean the waste throwing these these girls around but that's I support your right to become a woman if you want to or give a fuck if you want well I do say I support it but here's a big miss Nomar with this whole live-and-let-live thing like hmm Anthony Camila always says yeah you want to be you want to get married you want to be gay go I don't give a fuck right fuck you now that we've legalized gay marriage people are getting fined like a couple in upstate New York I find 13,000 dollars for not having a gay marriage in their living room what I understand what that means well they usually host marriages they said we don't want to do this here because it's our living room so I am a live and let live dude and now that gay marriage is a thing people are being forced to go against their religious beliefs so it looks like gay marriages let everyone be but it's actually fucking with Christians well that's a very rare case isn't it isn't that a pretty rare case where someone's having these marriages in their living room Odom suing them yeah I don't think you should wear this suit he's wanting to get married Israel let's go where is it they don't want to get one on my block know my neighbors getting married these two fags upstate and and they they don't use that word sort of term take oh uh yeah I just proposed and I'm like oh great and then one of our mutual friends goes isn't this exciting and they go no they have ate like eight some Satyam's Oh like I've dragged before I've had a bunch of threesomes in the hetero world that's hot shit yeah but to them I'm a fag because you've only had three sons only at three we have eight Sims all the time and I'm like I can't even picture like were that your legs go yeah where's the trick they're just holding it in sucking toes I mean even a foursome is kind of you've ever had a threesome yes it's hard to maneuver to you feel like you're walking around the clipboard let's ovary are you okay how we doing over here it's it's it's missing the critical aspect that makes sex great when you're really into someone and they're really into you like that's the perfect example when you can't get that prostitution is nice second yeah when you can get what two people are really into each other like you're sharing a moment together and then there's this other person and without me oh yeah even if you go on a trip with three people it's kind of weird it can be but it could be awesome it depends on how they gel I mean I've had friends that their wife is a freak and they have threesomes or their girlfriends a freak and they have threesomes and they go out and hunt for girls and they they do it on purpose and and they enjoy it that must be fun and believe me I wouldn't have worked if my wife brought a chick home I would not be kicking her in a bed for eating crackers but I've never experienced that but I think that my wife fucking lied to me by the way when I was courting her she goes I might be a lesbian so don't be surprised if I bring chicks home and we're 10 years in the chicks where the fucking threesomes yeah that's a crock of shit but see the reason you have threesomes and I guys if you're listening never turn it down struggle work hard they're really hard to set up I yeah I would say I've probably had about four or five and good two-thirds of them I was like a tour manager like when are you in town okay right setting it up well maybe at 8:30 one of them I had to fake look you go to the bar and you pretend that I know you from high school and you go oh my god and then we'll go upstairs to your oh you had a fake it yeah so you got to do those though cuz you beat off about them in your 60s oh I see so you're filming it with your eyeballs mm taking it all in but the actual act itself is kind of annoying mmm it can be and that's why I was saying to the gays they don't they're never gonna have kids they're fucking my age you have eight Sims you take kids and monogamy at a marriage what's left they I think they want to be able to visit each other when they're in the hospital yes that old thing that's like with abortion where they go what if your dad rapes you can you get an abortion then and you go you mean all one times that happened why are we dictating policy based on this crazy scenario hmm yeah that's I think you should people do whatever the fuck you want and don't you yeah I shouldn't have to have lesbians married in your living room but if you're gay you should be able to get married right I don't think you should have to sure totally will please totally by Matt please half my shit is there bullshitting what do you mean they don't want to get married it's just a something to fuck with us don't you think some of them do three and they're like your frakking number one well you know gays are 1% of the population say half of them or even 1% its 1% so it's one out of a hundred is gay yeah like think of your classrooms how many are lying though how many are gay and they just they just never commit is it so maybe it's two out of hundred suck a dick yeah but we all know one closet is this he's a fag but this whole thing like oh we like the far-right religious guys going we need to get our kids away from gayness or they're gonna go gate suck a million dicks Margaret Cho says this she goes if you think gay is is something something you can learn then I got some bad news for you you're gay I could suck one dick right now I'll suck a dick right now you're right okay here we go I'm still not gay he just sucked a dick right right now here's my 900 ix cock this guy's I've been a hostage for right two months oh I think he'd get away better at it I think he'd be more efficient because you'd realize if you're more efficient and you pretended you were into it it would go by quicker maybe yeah it's like when your wife faces will drive even quicker I think that's what's happened give a shit if my wife comes so how dare you so but you know if she's turned on you get more excited right that's the idea yeah baby you know people talk about women who were bad in bed that's like a painter saying that a canvas is bad she's just your canvas you have to maneuver and that's no no no c'mon okay so bad and bad male and female women can't be bad in bed that's not true girls are awkward they get they grind on you we're they then you slapper you say don't do that can we go go and turn over here talking real here so like this Marc Maron thing tell me what happened okay so we were in we did the podcast and he he's got that LA fucking thing where a fucking thing yeah where it's like I'm not gonna look it up I'm just gonna go by my emotions woman politics basically Jesse Ventura's like this - he's like I saw you and Jesse Ventura the one where you had your shirt off and he was oh I see yeah so what you're saying is people in other countries are nice good people in America I say some of Mexico and he goes I go to Mexico it's doing I say you and I go Jesse that's cool that's your experience that's anecdotal evidence I'm talking with millions of people I met a black guy who had a Nobel Peace Prize in Physics okay so black people are awesome at physics anyway he was doing this la thing and he was the only thing well the problem of education is I don't think people get paid enough to teach I think it's it should be a more prestigious position they get paid 60 bucks an hour who does New Jersey teachers okay once date no California they get paid shit they probably go down to let's say 40 bucks an hour yeah but for an hour worked per hour worked you get can you imagine having your summers off that'd be nice I would die abhorred him but I don't know if that's true like so like while in school they're getting $60 an hour so we're worked yeah how many hours do they work a day jack shit oh well we have to do a lesson plans fucking don't you've been teaching that same class for three years but they still have to do lesson plans don't think they're just in autopilot it's karaoke at this time what are you saying they should get some sort of an alternative surprise it and they should be it should be possible to fire them and that's what I said to Mary okay he goes I agree with you said that's whole systemic thing I fucking hate that word it's the stomach and there's not just one thing that can nail it and I go yeah there is it's called getting fired and in Harlem they have charter schools now and teachers can be fired they are fucking thriving blacks in Harlem are getting educated and it's kicking ass and the left is floundering because they hate they like blacks as their little pet victims and when the free market helps them they go wait don't help my victims that's mine and I saw the New York Times headline it said uh though charter schools thrive in Harlem it's not a fix-all and the article was basically saying not all black kids can go to charter schools in Harlem so they're not that great oh that's hilarious open up more charter schools is one thing it's called getting them fired and then it got weird after that he was just reading my Wikipedia page and talking about shit and Posey trying to find things that you do wrong no it was just you didn't want to be there so he was like what do I ask this guy about and didn't want to be there so he had shut down after that yes it yes so what what do you think was the trigger just the fact that you weren't willing to go nailed him on education and he didn't like it okay he probably thought we're not releasing this and anyway no Wikipedia like hey I saw that you did that's a power trip that's a power Narron well that's what the doing that not releasing it like I have conversations where I don't agree with people all the time and I I do well I don't mind disagreeing with somebody you know but it's this funny man that the comments like people say like oh you you and that fucking guy fought like cats and dogs no no we just didn't agree on things like right I shake their hand afterwards haven't one guy one guy in the history that Brian Dunning guy was probably the one guy because he was so fucking dead in his head his brain was so rotten he just couldn't he couldn't understand he couldn't grasp simple concepts I don't believe in disagreements I think then that one guy has more information than the other guy and I would just want to get there to the right answer well I also want to see how you got to your answer and there sometimes is not a right answer or a wrong answer it's just this is how you look at it and even though if I and some I play devil's advocate sometimes too much because I want to see what your arguments are to the contrary I want to see what the thought processes I every time I've had a fight with someone they and we leave and we're not agreeing they're wrong they have less information and it's happened to me once David Cross and I we were doing coke and we argued for eight hours of just out David Cross as a coke user you didn't coconut Whitehouse I think he really explains a lot explains his letter to the Cable Guy open letter to Larry the Cable Guy oh yeah yeah from the desk of I think it was I don't think he does coke anymore he's old and married but this is a long time ago and I was talking about free lunch programs and I go it's fucking stupid you don't lunch is a ham sandwich that I did the math and it's like a buck 80 well I go bums get 10 bucks a day to do vodka you can't you had a kid and you can't scrape together a dollar 84 ham sandwich because the liquid is just the water found yeah but it's not the kids fault I understand but the state can't be supplying people with a dollar eighty sandwich the K the state can't supply kids with a little bit of food a dollar eighty s where the food you use the argument the opposite way to the state can't come up with a dollar eighty for a kid for a sandwich then the state's fucked up no I'm saying it's as crazy as the state going we're gonna come in and brush your teeth like we have to give you some basic things that you're expected to do that's like helping kids go poopoo a dollar eighty the mom it doesn't cost some money to brush your teeth doesn't cost money to wash your hands it costs money to feed a kid but that's where you draw the line with kids they can't fucking support themselves they're little kids they don't have jobs so if a kid is hungry like and it all costs a dollar eighty to make it this is the same fight I had with this it's not a bad fight because I just I feel like look I was a kid I was poor you know we were on welfare and we drank powdered milk and the whole deal and you know I I was hungry I remember being hungry well that didn't fucking rare in 2015 a kid named hungry i mean ii can't be saying and i know the way it works in school even my own kids they go do you want lunch or do you want the school lunch today it just became a thing that was expected and the state has to go at some point all right we got to draw the line here no kids are like have hunger pains cuz their mommy you have to be a fucking crackhead well there's a lot of see blind crackheads that have kids okay well then that's a bigger fish to fry now we have to deal with having kids there's a lot of people that are irresponsible that have children I don't I think if you're gonna have a state school or a state sponsored school the state's gonna pay for everything think about all the shit that's okay that for dinner that night I don't know but while you're in school while the kids in school you were responsible for that kid for whatever at eight seven eight hours whatever it is that Keigo's school this mother is so useless she can't scrape together a ham sandwich and now we let the kid go 320 take this kid away you can is not competent yeah she can't fuck that kid away that was what I was saying if your kid if you can't supply a ham sandwich your kid I have to take your kid away well at a certain level you got to figure out like when is someone completely incompetent right it's a scale it's a dollar eighty a day for lunch is income I don't think there's anything wrong with supplying kids with food at school for free and I think that if you if you look at what what needs society should cover like which it's which is society cover should they cover the police should the police be private should they cover the fire department should that be private I mean there's a lot of a bunch of arguments for what your taxes should and should not pay for I don't think it's unreasonable say they're sent of public schools in public schools I don't think it's unreasonable to say you should provide the kids of food no it's not unreasonable to say you should provide kids with shit their pants with underwear but if a kid is shitting his pants we have an issue here so if a mother can't afford lunch sorry that kids out anyway okay but that was the only time that David and I we both had 100 the facts mm-hmm and after eight hours and probably a gram of coke we were like let's agree to disagree that's the only time you ever go down my life everyone had all the facts and we still disagreed at the end mhm otherwise disagreements are someone who doesn't understand what was happening and Marc Maron was just saying oh they need there's not one thing it's systemic and it was you know he personifies this sort of bit fake beta male comedian with the cardigan and the oh I'm such a mess I'm so fucked up and these guys fuck 20 year old girls while complaining and scratching their heads I am a mess and I realize like this year we have this narrative of the jock with the letterman shirt right the UVA frat boy uh-huh date raping chicks I'm going through my own rolodex and I see those guys cleaning up a drunk chicks barf and I see the beta male comedians fucking chicks fucking passed out chicks what beta male comedians are fucking passed out chicks gonzo journalist thing here you're like half serious half reality partially fiction no but it makes your arguments very difficult history and think of every time you know of a guy who fucked a passed-out chick I don't know and he's not a jock he's like he runs it he doesn't indeed fucking show if I know a guy who fucked the passed-out chick he didn't tell me about it I don't know anybody that fucked a passed-out Chuck well it's usually contentious like the guy I'm thinking of she was sort of like I don't remember fucking him and I'm never speaking him again but it was kind of wishy-washy and he's not a like I know these super handsome dude she's two guys one of them would use to be a male model and this chick invited them over and she was she got to way so I think she wanted to get gangbanged and she fucking drank a bunch of oxy she's showing them her pussy and this point of the story by the way I was mad at him for not fucking her but then she started projectile vomiting because she overdid it right and I've heard this story a few times especially with threesomes girls get nervous in the over drink and what are these disgusting frat boy jocks do they washed her sheets they've put the towels in the fucking washing machine and they made sure she was okay and then they went home these beta male guys like the kind of guys were on the Nerdist these guys who everyone thinks is cool I see those guys fucking her skull fucking her or beating off her from them and Tom shaloo said this to me once he goes he goes jerking off in front of a woman is obviously pretty rare but it's not that rare in the comedy world well that I do know a few comics who have done some inappropriate jerking off yeah there are mentally ill narcissists for the most point and they wear this wolf in sheep's clothing of I'm a beta male I'm a loser I'm a nut and they just use it to fuck chicks over and dump broads and they're the jocks there are the date-raping jocks that everyone's scared of well you're talking about like very specific guys that are famous and wealthy and also are playing that role of being the failure yeah it's not a young community like Jay Mohr but there's there's Jay Moore with the dress shirt in the Blazer mm-hmm that is that generation I don't know those guys they seem like pretty good guys then there's the American Apparel sweatshirt dudes like the millennial up to maybe 35 those are the guys I'm talking about okay aren't you doing exactly the same thing as someone saying that black guys are great at science because one guy knows a guy who know something this is your theory first of all I'm basing it on a lot of guys what guys well you don't have the name names but I don't know anybody who's doing what you're saying I don't anybody's skull-fucking passed out girls other than Bill Cosby okay how many young communities you know sold as a data girl it's a 26 write a lot then they dumped her at 29 her ovaries are dried up 29 yeah I don't think they dry out that young yeah they do know you can have kids here's your ovaries right is your brain on drugs at 30 the hourglass turns upside down and the sand is draining from 30 to 35 s no sin and Oh 35 you're fucked does the pelican bring your baby it's an analogy Joe the the fertility is draining from 30 to 35 my wife had our first kid at 36 or something they would go through a door that said geriatric mother now it's over well there's that's anecdotal evidence they die young in Canada no no I murdered in New York since 99 no it of course is exceptions my mother had my brother at 41 but generally through a brother soft we joke about his weak sperm but I mean that we say he was piece of bread with old ovaries but I realized my youngest son was born much with a mom much older than my mom so we don't do that joke anymore but even with my youngest son I was watching him like a hawk at the beginning worried about autism mmm so anyway if you date a chick at 26 and you dumped her at 30 she's gonna take her a couple years to get over it right to the point where she's ready to have kids nope I mean get over the guy and marry him and maybe be ready for kids who knows man I know a girl who whatever anecdotal evidence good if you kill a woman's ovaries like that you are killing as ovaries yeah you are you taking her there should be some stigma around this that's Hitler because she would her best years those kids would have had kids those good so if you did you're getting so hurt during a verse 30 you have killed a million people you have come in a war crime your Hitler oh it's very hard to take your argument seriously and you're a funny guy which part is bullshit all that you would get your Hitler you you'd kill their ovaries all the above you have denied the world millions of people no no you haven't cuz a woman can't give birth to millions of people that's fucking nobody her grandkids can and it's grandkids why did you sleep you could be making billions of dollars look at a Atilla the Hun I think he's responsible for like three million people mm-hmm Oh like physically yeah no no yes you didn't fuck three million girls no he fucked a bunch of you probably fucked you don't have enough thousand six you'd have enough time to come I'm talking about kids and grandkids and bullshit that's what you do I'm not you're both talking bullshit don't we're not look up come on knocking are you a nerd look up how many children dare you how many children came from Attila the Hun quite a few not as many as Genghis Khan Genghis Khan's responsible for something like one out of 500 dudes in Asia or some crazy number okay so that's what I'm saying he also murdered I mean you take a woman's fertile years you've done the opposite of a deal taking up her years her years are going on they're going on you happen to be 32 it's very hard to have around her during the time where she's 26 to 29 doesn't mean you're responsible for her any more than she's response you should be conscious both she and you should be conscious of this is our prime time it's like football players I think women are that's why they get like super serious all those times amongst my sort of media hipster kind of entertainment people that whole concept is gone and one generation ago it was you know you got to get her while she's young and this is her big year and blah blah blah there was some value on those formative over a years today it's nothing and these women they get dumped at 30 and then these women get dumped at 30 a lot of them getting married I know in New York got dumped at 30 Wow all right that's a super anecdotal but I think a lot of my friends when they talk about women they talk if they date girls that are like up to 25 26 they're more like they don't care they're having fun they're doing their thing with their career and they're doing their thing going on dates and stuff but they always say that when they get to be around 30 31 32 they're like where's this going that's late this is heading they should be saying that at 27 is all I'm saying in your world no you know your world world the document doctor I I had some chick a friend of mine 39 her her physician said ooh 35 getting kind of late and she said it to me like can you believe that sexist pig and I go he's a nerd he has Asperger's he doesn't have he's not sexist he's telling you about your fucking vagina is that a sexist pig to say your your because hey if you're 35 I'm tryna say today in 2015 to speak normal biological facts I call them hate facts is sexist it's sexist to say that it's hard to have kids after 30 and nearly impossible after 30 well I don't know what this has to do with comedians that are fake beta males sculpt these committees don't recognize that well they have to you're not responsible for that any more than they're responsible for recognizing that you're a 45 year old guy who's going through some midlife crisis some good special anxious goes back to what I'm saying about no one responsible for the relationship and if you a lot of these guys will fuck over this girl and sort of imply that he's gonna put a ring on it and then twenty nine thirty I mean New York has a very total though you're saying a lot of these guys fuck over a girl like relationships don't work out a lot of times people pretend to be one thing when you first start dating them like you're saying your wife was saying you know I might be a lesbian and then as you get deep in you oh that was just like a shiny little spinner and behind it was a hook you catch trout to try so you're you're you're you could play it on both sides people are full of shit and they're full of shit to themselves people pretend to themselves that they are this one type of person because that person appears to be more attractive so when you're talking about these hipster guys that are pretending to be these beta males that are super sensitive and male feminists they in their mind they have convinced themselves they are this thing because this thing would be more attractive to the type of women they're trying to attract so they're very just as confused agree they're not like this little self sub-nought this mastermind is trying to engineer this nose trap with its negligence well you're just young they're living their life now they're fucking a 26 year old isn't they dry up your ovaries and they dumped her okay I'm talking too many different things at once here right establish that wonderful 25 to 30 should start getting serious and they have a certain currency because their ovaries to or not where they overlap what if they don't want careful or fucking 95% of population wants kids I don't know about that I don't want kids a lot of girls don't they are extinct we've been over a quarter of a million years they just need to want kids like yeah the kid is a substitute that dog is a substitute is and it call themselves mommy but when you get on the 405 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon you can't fucking move there's no room cuz all the cars have blocked up all the road you go maybe we need more girls with little dogs maybe you need more gay guys who want to get married yeah well maybe these people who aren't having kids is is self-selection and you know we're gonna have annoying feminists they're gonna my kid isn't gonna have to deal with them why is that cuz they're gonna die off yeah they're dying off right now I wonder Jezebel won't be around in one generation kids know they don't have kids no one had Jezebel has kids maybe one or two and I actually know I used to be friends with the chicken Jezebel and she told me that that's not true really yeah who which one Traci Egan okay she's a writer yeah she's advice now she told me that uh that that I'm spilling the beans here but I don't care she told me that the managing editor who looks kind of like Jimi Hendrix but it's a woman she would cry herself to sleep at night because she waited too long and her ovaries dried up and I feel like screaming at her your whole agenda is telling women that they're men and they don't need kids and they'll be fine without kids and you don't even believe that fucking shit but is that their agenda because I don't think it is I think their agenda is saying that women could be empowered and women can not have to live under the predetermined directives that men have set forth for them and they can do their own shit that's was the beginning of the impetus the pendulum swing so far and now it's if you do that you're a sellout and a loser and you're a fucking Stepford wife right so if you have a relationship and you have a family modern feminism vilifies the Midwestern housewife come our wives are losers according to Jezebel really I've never heard that I've never seen that written down so you see and you read the articles it's celebrating empowered women they're celebrate do you believe that I think in some ways that's what they want they want to celebrate empowered women kick ass to is a movie that sums up modern feminism and it is women are men women kick-ass women are Marines like modern feminism is why aren't there more female superheroes I don't know cuz it's not a feminine thing to fly to a bank robber and punch him in the face and I actually have a theory about this anybody I've never heard anybody saying that they want more female superheroes oh that's a big thing is it yeah why don't the how come the women feminists about the women feminists there they're real feminists I mean if there are real feminists it's only women feminists men feminists are just did they're extinct of beta you got you got it we got all the same rights we're done humanists is really what we should all be that I don't think they have the same rights you think they have exactly the same rights what rights do they have what rights does do men have that women don't have well it's not a matter of rights it's a matter of Rights for sure like as far as legally any metric you no matter what rights as far as like but as far as like the way they're appreciated in cultures in society certainly now worldwide oh no no I'm the only talking about North America or the West right fucking Middle East all feminists should move to the Middle East and get to work why don't feminists embrace like Ronda Rousey she seems like the ultimate feminist she's like a like a feminist from a movie they don't embrace her no cuz that's my beef with feminism is that there - Ronda Rousey well she is she's hot and she kicks ass like she great like - later when I see lera craft I don't get a boner I get a boner when a woman is feminism like Southern Belles make me hard when some woman does a backflip and shoots a monster in the face I go oh and some Dyke has short shorts on and knows how to do back flips and I think nerds like it because they want to see action right and they want to see pretty girls so they're they to save time they make it Tomb Raider right so it's like what's that thing when you take a turkey and you cook a duck in it yeah exactly turducken I was watching the movie support your local sheriff you know that movies know what does local sheriff it's like what's his name from James can no James calm no support your local sheriff eat okay the guy who was in Hawaii five-o forever Jesus who the fuck was the canary whoa nerds not an insult Jamie's not a nerd I mean he's apparently not he can't look like a nerd the sense that I'm a nerd but uh all right what is this so anyway in the movie there it is and who's the main guy what's his name again no James Garner Oh James Caan's anyway in the movie there's this scene where they're in a courtroom and they're having some trial and this woman comes out and she's got on like you know that's Wild West dress and the fucking hair up little blouse quite attractive anyway she gets up in the court and she goes yeah you listen to me and you listen well partner I've had enough of this and I want you and then they go order in the court you sit her down just know I will not sit down I demand that you listen to me and I'm watching I just had this fucking epiphany wash over me I realize men invented this bitch like men invented Jezebel feminism lair craft this whole thing because she's not being feminine like that movie was cast by a dude that movie was written by a dude they're making her get up there and I think the suffragette movement the whole like women should vote was guys going say that you should vote and the ladies go what I was making a lasagna no get up there say I need to vote I'm a lady and they go okay I'm a lady well you know there is a biological reality for women who have to take care of themselves women who work actually develop more testosterone women who are in the workforce have to compete yeah they actually develop more testosterone and they become more aggressive like because of that testosterone and I think that when women are forced into that sort of a position like is it is it a coincidence I'm not saying that all feminists are unattractive but a lot of like really vocal ones are unattractive and so therefore they're forced to take care of themselves they're forced to be on their own so they're forced to compete in the workforce and you have to in order to survive you have to become more aggressive and so begin becoming more aggressive and then in standing up for themselves in their own gender they become like an antagonist or they become rather an opponent of of the men that they're competing with they don't belong there they don't belong in the world environment well that's whatever the mole okay secure worker in Maggie Thatcher you know this tons of alpha females who Oprah fuckin rock Oprah she's great but my experience has been when the woman contributes to the workforce I'm gonna say 80% of the time it's just and the forehead nose let's let's ride this out until we can get back to creating stuff like for example when I ran an ad agency we were doing a commercial for converse and the bit was um this guy's standing over here and then this guy walks over and and he says hi and then he leaves and he's a hunk and she's a girl and then later she talks to her friends and goes oh my god he talked to me blah blah so okay got it we'll do that and then the woman goes and then she comes up to her friends and she's like can you believe what happened her friends like I can't believe it and I go wait a minute these are people and she goes yeah and I go but I thought these were the people of this world and she was well who cares it's just and then she also said that you do some weird things with your hands here for the people to write to this you're walking your fingers along the table and I don't even know what the fuck you're doing and I'm in the room with you getting drunk actually but this is the world okay the people the fingers right you can't just flip it and make some people fingers and sometimes fingers are legs I didn't know this was gonna be taken in audio-wise let me give you a better example my brother 90% my brother designs video games and he said when we do a thing with men they'll go okay it's a squirrel he's on a skateboard an app right right and he gets a bunch of nuts and then you win a prize got it and here we made it okay looks good but he goes well if I do something like that for a female client so ago we had a thought what about changing the color scheme from sort of autumn to more of a summery thing and he'll go okay well that's not a button I'll have to go back and change all the code so it's essentially making a whole new video game from scratch okay fine and then he'll go but we'll have to Bill you the same amount again and then he goes they kind of get indignant like they go well fine like you're not gonna question me what cuz I'm a woman I'm gonna have a problem with that and then they go okay so my brother will have to redo the video game in a different color whereas men would go oh it's a whole other thing all right fuck it yeah some men right again this is anecdotal I'm talking about my personal experience but so much like just the other day this woman I have a meeting on Wednesday and this woman set it up and I've talked to this other woman and this other woman I know this is sexist but I go well I have a thing at 2:00 and she goes okay I'll just move it I go no no this is an important meeting I don't want these women to think I'm a flake so don't change it that makes me look like I'm hard to work with and she goes oh okay I was gonna move it around I go this meeting is huge don't be fucking with the times and I'm just like why am i dealing with these chicks when I could be dealing with a dude who would just go okay well the meetings only gonna be an hour so I think you'll make it fine okay handshake well isn't don't you think there's some women that can handle that it sounds like it's an incompetent person you could run any incompetent due to speaking generally right about millions women are good at micro management they're good at line producing for example right they're great event as far as big decisions and handshake deals men are tend to be much better at it and my entire career has been almost exclusively woman why is that because I'm selling shit so when I ran the magazine the marketing people marketing people tend to be women the ones buying the ads they're women advertising the ones who aren't you know bequeathing the budgets the ones who come to the set women women women the queeth is great word I don't I don't know how we got from bethe comedian skull-fucking passed out girls to this but I'm trying man and men are different that's the big picture and feminism is something that's created by men as a false narrative yeah women have bought it hook line and sinker where they really should be at home protecting those very very valuable three years from 26 to 29 before their ovaries turn to sand there's it's funny that you're being sarcastic because I'm listening you're going yes well done exactly I'm trying to figure out what went wrong with you and Marc Maron that you became transphobic or you transphobic after the you know I wrote an article called transphobia is perfectly natural and it shit hit the fan I read that and I also saw the the video that you put up about these people regretting their transition right you know there's definitely there can be that right that goes back with what we're saying what gay marriage on the surface it's just leave them be they want to get married and I go no actually people are getting fined for not having gay marriage in the living room so it's not as simple just leave them be you're actually antagonizing Christian yeah but no no that's just one when you were talking about you have to bake the you know that whole story about the pizza like in the wedding cake like they sought out someone who would say no it's totally fake right that's my whole beef but that was it was a story the rest but they were trying to say we want the right to go camping and you go okay but I've never seen you camp before but they don't not have the right to go camp now you're like camp blacks camping right scam and you go not no one's suing black people for camping like this is a non black camping ground right but if I heard about a campground getting sued wait a minute okay but if the campground did kick black people out yeah my point is with gay marriages they don't really want to get married and but they do and lives down the street from me they're good friends mine the thing with try and have a kid with the trans was when you normalize it and say it's perfectly healthy right then your eight-year-old son who's gay by the way says I'm a woman you go we're gonna ride this out and when you become a teen you're gonna move to the West Village and wear a red leather short shorts and suck a bunch of dicks and realize oh I'm a fag I'm not a woman but now that we normalize trans what we what these moms are doing cuz they love having a trans kid it's like a status symbol now what moms love having a trans kid yeah you want to talk about outliers that's the real outlier not even the people getting sued for marriage the moms are soup a status symbol now yeah what where are you hanging out look it up anyway so these trans moms are giving their kids hormones right to delay Huberty I did see a video really young kid that was getting their first hormone dose yes I was like wow because he's a chick but when I'm time is slightly different they're giving him hormone blockers so puberty won't be disturbing because so you won't have pubes and your dick won't get bigger or whatever happened yeah so kids are getting hormone blockers because we've accepted this as fact that trans is normal and then we're also normalizing the operation and their suicide rate is brutal now I'm not denying there are a few dudes who are happier with a cunt like Zoey terr who have said I've talked to him a few times he's got a cunt he used to be he used to be a helicopter news guy he's the guy who saw Jay and the Bronco he shot that uh-huh and he she created a vagina and she seems to be happier about it but she's pretty conservative and doesn't think that operation should be normalized cuz it's fucking weird you know it's adorable is that Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in gay marriage yeah well that's common with trans they tend to be conservative really because I think they have this woman that is very traditional like Caitlyn Jenner didn't turn into a bull dyke and didn't wear a sweatshirt with a nose ring she turned into like a 1950's lady right so she has this very traditional with a very rigid of anak yeah like this doesn't move very not very pliable cut your cock off by the way Bruce no he's keep it well then he's a poser he is a poser but doesn't Bailey J still have his dick mm-hmm her dick hey can you say her dick how can you say see that's the problem with this mess Bailey it is a mess Bailey won't speak to me anymore cuz I call him he really and I'm like so you're a woman and he goes well I'm not a woman but I'm not a he fucking people have you seen Harvard's new rules YES on Z and Phi and what is a new so Z walks into the bar slams to each face and you're like was it a chick or a dude like I want to know the race I want to know how tall and here right here1 of them there's like a bunch of them XE there's like there didn't just making shit up see this is the key to political correctness it's not about justice it's about me telling you how to speak it's about the upper classes telling the lower classes oh you don't say blackening you say color it's also about calling people out it's calling people out on their transgressions calling people out on using the wrong gender pronoun calling people out on being insensitive it's like looking for green lights so they could say that you're wrong it's looking for the moral high ground that's a real issue with it because it's a game it's a social brownie point collecting game like you want to be the most progressive person and you want to be the person that is the most aggressive about calling out other people it used to be the preneur salacious like open minded progressive was like about being like sensitive and loving and trying to be accepting of all people now it's become about finding people who aren't progressive and calling them out and outing them and shitting on their life I think it's people that just get a green light to be a cunt and one of the best yeah the best green light is finding people that you think have violated someone else's civil liberties or civil rights or or you know sensitivities and you just aggressively go after them Lassen it could how they act when an old person like a war vet says negro they have this sort of giggling like that's like four names ago they're not up to date with the names we've been telling them and they go negro then it's black and now it's person of color United Negro College Fund still how do you have n double acp I still do you have reinforce and keep up they go well like like I was on Fox once in this woman said that Hillary said a colored person and what Hillary actually said was person whose color and she was mortified in the green room going oh my god I said colored person I meant to say that Hillary said person of color well that's what you I'm like why don't you apologize to him right next there's some black guy sound guy over there I'm like go apologize to him maybe he'll forgive you well isn't it hilarious though think about what you just said I mean if you didn't know this language and if you didn't know human beings how ridiculous is it that it's okay to say a person of color but is not okay to say a colored person that is the same crew fucking that this is all bullshit like at my boxing gym all the black dudes are and the Puerto Ricans and the Hispanics they're all really good thing they're all riffing on each other's ethnicity mm-hmm like yeah you're Puerto Rican what would you know you're like on welfare it's a fun way to riffin it was the way it was a generation to go with the Archie Bunker's on the door look at this fucking Polack and I believe that we were closer when we could make jokes like that and relax and be like oh it was on island time look at the black I disagree I disagree with that because I don't think we're not I think we are closer now and we ever been before but I think these these issues that we're dealing with these are like transitionary issues and I think that as people become more and more aware of each other those will start to erode and be outed as being preposterous and I think these kind of conversations where we're mocking this like national Oh like the the colored people or a person of color these conversations are important and I think ultimately people will come to their senses or at least come to their suppose so but I disagree that I think like I'm scared of women at work I don't know women period I don't I don't riff at work they turn to sand by ovaries oh you fuck with people and you can't take it how no I want to be clear I understand black woman at work okay we had some black work and I was scared of them because I thought this is a blood loss a woman mm yes and the black women right at work they don't like that they're a pariah and you know you're in the lunchroom riffing and going look fag you like hot because their cocks and then a black woman walks in they go hi Shaniqua how are you and everyone is walking on black woman eggshells and that's not fun and I don't think the black woman liked it either so you know everyone's having fun until I walked into the lunchroom it's hard for me to get into this because the black women that I know are all black comedians right black women comedians or the black women that I know from work rather I should say that's so they're fun you know so it's like Tiffany when I say we're we were better off when you could riff I'm talking about Middle America I'm time when Archie Bunker I'm talking about cubicles and the lunchroom and the water cooler and I believe that all this political correctness has just made white people say I'm getting away from them they're not worth the trouble they could ruin my career if I say the wrong joke well that is a real issue I mean if you if you're dealing with a super super fucking sensitive people and you have them in the workforce you know if you if you have a company sorry for doing that over and over again who's that woman that sued a famous tech woman who sued some company and they said she was really hard to work with really and she lost she lost a lawsuit because she said it was about sexual discrimination all women company Mis woman she went on to work for Google or reddit rather she went on to work for reddit well the Asian mom yes yeah yeah yeah didn't she own yeah she ran reddit or something yeah she didn't run reddit but she was one of the CEOs right right right um I guess that is run reddit right but she she sued for Ellen Powell all right that's her name I think she's a black husband okay good friend they're wanted for all kinds of fraud I think she learned the hustle from the black husband and he said Oh grace and it's tons on I think she was bitching about race I think she was bitching about social discrimination but you know they were trying to say that just this is not a good person she's not a good person and that was like the whole argument behind like having someone like that is inherently dangerous like if you had not her in specific but having someone who's like looking for those green lights like we were talking about like with progressive people looking to find something some some made-up transgression that they can call you out on a lot of the time sorry for my driving with a lot of the time these women in the work force subliminally recognize they shouldn't be there and they need to generate income so they come up with some sort of grievance and it's the grievance industry and I was watching TV in the hotel with my wife this morning we don't get to watch TV because we have kids and I don't like the TV being on at home so I'm just fuckin binging on reality shows and hot rod shows and everything and she got bored and went to see her friends and I thought the reason she's bored with all this reality show like I was watching food factories when I watch food factories and they're shown how you make jam I can imagine oh I see what they did there and I can imagine driving the truck that harvests the berries and I can imagine inventing the Machine and I can see the screen oh the screens probably best way to get out all the twigs and shit and I'm watching like my guys do my shit and I see that when I look at a building I'm like oh you had i-beams there and you built a strong foundation obviously it's 84 so I and I think women don't see the world the way we do and it's the same with kids like I'll take my kids to the park and I'm playing with I'm chasing my son around and as a monster but a lot of the times after maybe 20 minutes in I go this is getting fucking tedious I'm sick of being a monster but my wife has unlimited patience when it comes to being with the kids so generally overall I'm not obviously there's exceptions but I think men are better at creating societies and women are better at nurturing and I just keep seeing these soft types of what about these angry women you know angry feminists or what you don't want them raising kids right you don't want fucked up kids yes you're talking about a handful of cunts but what's happening is these woman like my wife instead of meeting me and having three kids they're going I guess I should be in the workforce cuz men are women and women are men so she goes into the wulfing I should roll on some stupid converse idea and everyone is just sitting pinching the bridge of their nose going yeah that's not gonna work we can't use rolling stones music in a commercial it would be like three million dollars you know I mean so what he's saying that women should totally rely on men they should another thing relying on men look you fucking mage three human beings come out of your con but what if they didn't what if they didn't they do have to find a man in order to get by oh I see what you say well first of all I would never say women aren't allowed in the workforce I'm talking about this huge contingent of women who have forced themselves into the workforce and don't like it and especially even moms with kids I keep seeing my friends who have working moms getting messages texts I've even seen emails where they go I'm fucking miserable I hate it like Nina Simone I saw this Nina Simone documentary and they talked about how late oh well the implication was she was lazy but how miserable she was with her career and I'm watching going no she's depressed because she's on tour in Europe and she's not with her fucking kids it's unnatural well now in that sense yeah if you do have children and you're not with them in your touring somewhere that especially if you're a woman that should be really depressing it's tanking for metals oh it's depressing for me if I go on the road for a weekend and I'll have my kids I get a thumb down first two days are pretty good third day you start missing fourth day sex with women it's like my wife we're moving gone for 24 hours my wife won't let me say things my son says because it'll remind her Wow like he says put-down me if I said put down me right now to her she'd be mad right I understand we saying I don't I it's it's it's real hard when you get into these generalizations like this because women if they don't enter the workforce then what do they do they wait around for some guy to pay the bills and when the problem with like the idea of saying that like working moms I agree that a lot of women wish they didn't have to work so they could take care of their kids but then they're looked in disparaging ways by then and you know talked about inspiring ways by men they're like well you don't even contribute to the household well those guys are fucking assholes and fuck them and I don't understand this whole I need to work I don't I can't afford it when I was a kid we were middle-class and if you had that my childhood today you would be below the poverty line like we had one car my mom would get the groceries on Wednes day after my dad got home we didn't go on vacation much we didn't have babysitters the I didn't have a car and it was a perfectly happy life but there's this I need to get in the workforce you need to get in the workforce to pay for the nanny you bought yourself into a higher tax bracket you need a car to commute from work I think it's a zero-sum game you probably bring seven grand a year to the family where you live in Williamsburg isn't that like super expensive it's like an insane I come out as an apartment cost this in the past few months I ran the numbers I've been spending seven hundred and eighty dollars a day we blew 50 grand since March on what there's no culprit like booze that's $40 a day the babysitter's a name today yeah definitely yep how many days you try to take off I quit boost for Lent I didn't have drinks on fuck Affleck I just became Catholic I would grab a theist how old do you 45 what the fuck's wrong with you why becoming Catholic now I had kids I was I believe I realized that there's something else going on that's why I wanted one having else going on what a cult of child kid fuckers what's what's going on I was raised Catholic oh really yeah I band in that shit with those child fuckers are called gays yeah they're called priests ooh and they're they're the runnin the Catholic Church by the way okay you know about that right that kid fuckers run the Catholic Church yeah I think there is a problem in the Catholic Church giant problem right a massive probably literally is a cult of kid fuckers and ever NASCAR had as many drivers fucking kids it would have been closed down in the 60s yeah well the whole Middle East should be shut down yeah but you're joining in on this why are you joining in why are you giving the money then they pass the tray around do you throw twenty bucks in there thinking I hope this goes to kid fuckers no but to be totally Frank I realized there that there is a God and Catholicism was the nearest thing to grab I mean I really aim is a God how did you realize this well first of all I think that religion should be a little more private like my wife I don't know religion is well it's very convenient when people want to talk about religion and say religion should be private because then they don't have to defend ridiculous ideas religion is a ridiculous idea I'll bite unlike ancient by dick ulis idea that makes no sense no one ever like my wife's American Indian right no one ever even of Americans yeah you mean indigenous Indian feather not dog and I don't know what her fuckin religion is she never talks about it if someone done taken they do fuckin shrooms and send a teepee for three days that's Mike she doesn't talk about it and no one ever criticize with Indians you can't go in a tepee if you're menstruating right no one ever talks about that there cuz they don't want the Bears to come in and kill everybody else they don't have to justify their their spirituality but for some reason Christianity is is like on the chopping block every day what about this on page three I don't understand it well I know he has a defend because there's a book you just said it yourself you don't know what they believe in reading it that kind of this kind of interrogation the Quran don't get this kind of interrogate or is not filled with things that you would say are magic what is magic in the Torah what's more is just a Jew Bible but what's but they don't they don't believe that Jesus walked on water came back from the dead or healed sick I'm not that well versed with the Torah but I assume as a religious tract it's full of whimsical superhero resounding style you have to be able to defend Moses in the Torah that was magic he's put the seat well I don't know if that the the parting of the sea was in the Torah is it yeah well the thing about it was fascinating because it kind of brings it all full circle the mainstream Jerusalem scholars now believed that Moses was on drugs they believed that Moses was in dude it was taking psychedelic drugs and that's what the whole burning bush was the burning bush represents the Acacia bush which is a very common plant in that area and it's rich with DMT so they think that the burning bush was them smoking DMT Wow which is the most potent psychedelic drug known to man and it also gives you all these experiences where you feel like you're in contact with some sort of a higher power so they think well that's what was going on also helped get me here in my teenage years but uh yeah why did you join the Catholic Church it was the nearest one I'd like the Knights of Columbus to join the Knights of Columbus I'm a third-degree knight but what made me really uh believe in a deity and I I don't know why I'm telling this but I was coming home once and my kid was in her crib my first kid and I was looking at her heel and you know a little baby's heel mm-hmm and I'm like that thing fucking works there's a bone there there's the tissue it's got padded tissue below the bone and I'd always suspected there was a god deep down and then I just it sort of washed over me and I went oh I get it now the big bang was some sort of omnipotent force that created the first domino and that domino fell and everything followed after that so the dodo bird it's not like God went and killed the dodo bird he set up this almost like that movie where the dude drinks the drink and turns into sand and goes into the waterfall oh yeah yeah yeah fuck the the prequel to alien yes what the hell yes almost like the beginning of Prometheus the that massive incredibly complex Domino was set off boom with the Big Bang and that made my daughters heal Wow that's convenient thinking you know it's it seems like a guy who calls out bullshit all the time but then just buys the into that like it's not about evolution it's not about random you know successful okay evolution is God well when you say God though do you mean like a guy who created everything a specific that vidual our shitty little teeny brains trying to wrap our minds around this incredible thing here I'll prove God exists okay don't you think that Catholicism represents our shitty little brains that create these ridiculous or pathetic attempt to grasp the infinite right but why join into that like why become a problem in our life like I go to Latin Mass and I'm in this unbelievable church I don't understand what they're saying and speaking Latin that's kind of cool just recognising the miracle that is birth and I'm just so thankful that I'm here and the infant essa Mele small odds that I was created and I'm just sort of saying wow thanks do you do the same thing with science do you go to like the Hayden Planetarium and do the same thing when you study constellations sure because you think I think the earth is flat because science pretty Pro what the fuck you talk all Galileo Galileo just kept poking the church until they eventually said fuck off you're under house arrest they they never really denied that the universe on us is not true at all they fucking put him under house arrest cuz he was insisting that the earth was not the center of the universe right but he wouldn't shut up about it and they was right he was right so they launched him around the Catholic Church in 1502 well don't even defend them today here look how about Ratzinger how about the fact that they own the fucking biggest gay by they own a building that houses the biggest gay bathhouse in europe so you would be ok if I was a member of a different Christian I think all religions are ridiculous I think ideology is a ridiculous daddy is your against deism you're against him against predetermined patterns of behavior that you subscribe to that are thousands of years old that were written by people who were extremely ignorant to the facts that we know now as to how the universe was formed and how biological life has evolved and all of the work that science has done that doesn't mean I don't believe in God it doesn't mean I don't even the possibility of there being some grand order to this but the idea that the Catholic Church the guy who dressed like a wizard and sits on a fucking golden throne and you have to call him father that that's the guy that this is this is that is trying to represent us that's us trying to we're doing a really shitty job I mean this is this is a really really ancient shit that didn't make any sense back then and they were it's all they had but now that we do have science and we do have so much more knowledge than the people who were writing this shit down in Qumran and fucking animal skins and leaving them in clay pots for people to go over and decipher this is it's it's ridiculous to know you're talking about that that enforcer did a double homicide and you said the in force at the beginning of the show the double Sal and you said we've learned over time it's been a pattern here with murder we don't like it right the Bible was an amalgamation of all these stories where we went here's some things we've learned killing people sucks don't do that mm-hmm and it's lasted for 3,000 years that's longer than catching don't wear two different types of cloth that's really bad yes it's not perfect there is some weird shit in there there's a lot of weird shit in there guys come back from the dead and they heal okay do you believe that a good definition of infinity is if you had monkeys on a typewriter forever they would eventually print out the completed works of Shakespeare I think that that definition of infinity is is a very strange one because the idea that you would have these monkeys randomly typing on a typewriter and they would come up with the exactly there's no evidence that that's possible there's no evidence that it's possible that a monkey just slamming their fingers onto a keyboard would type out words in perfect grammar with periods and commas and question marks it can possibly be how about a computer that is just randomly hitting randomly printing out keys it's certain for infinity would it not eventually in a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years happened to have printed out the complete works of Shakespeare it could be possible but I've seen no evidence that it's ever been able to be replicated even in a simple sentence it's infinity but there's but we're talking about something like something that's never been replicated even on the tiniest scale yeah it has been replicated on the tiny scale it's called hacking you keep trying the password and eventually the computer after three thousand tries cracks your password yeah but they work on complicated algorithms that were created by people like this is not to have random text punched out on the keyboard but it's not random they're they're testing it like when you were talking about like a monkey typing on a keyboard the monkey doesn't understand language so monkeys using semicolons in the in the proper form using like fractions in a row and then a space but doing it over and over again to form the complete works of Shakespeare like I guess I get it I guess I get it okay but I don't buy it let's start with that so you get it so we are next to an infinite universe mm-hmm that's monkeys on a typewriter that means at some point there's got to be an earth or a planet like earth right more than that even okay good right then you go wait a minute if I'm doing infinite possibilities here there's gonna be an earth where this is happening Joe Rogan's not only that the what infinite means is the universe is so big that every single thing that has ever happened on earth in the exact same order has happened an infinite number of times throughout the cosmos that's because you're talking about infinity but you're talking about something that literally has no boundaries so if there is one the possibility of there being an infinite number of those things exist you sound like a nice science is Joe Rogan interviewing it's exactly like Joe Rogan but my name is Gavin McInnes yeah look like you yeah that's happening and then you go wait a minute sure why does it have to be 2015 in October maybe it's 1936 and you're talking me on a little timey bullhorn right so why does that mean there's a great a minute that is mathematically true I know for a fact mathematically that Joe Rogan is interviewing me with an old-timey bullhorn in 1936 earth right way the fuck out there and I look exactly like you right I know that to be mathematically true three two plus two equals four and I have three cocks but I also know that that isn't true I know that that's not happening well you don't know that Joe Rogan is not interviewing me we do 1936 how do you another planet how can you say that the fact that those two things are simultaneously true one and the other is proof there's a guy wait what do you mean it but I don't understand what you just said don't shake your head like that you fucked you didn't say a goddamn thing how do you say it's not you two is four and I know deep down two and two is not four I know and you know you sound like a religious person there is no I'll give you that you sound like a guy who should go to church so crazier you guys where it's 1936 Earth you're interviewing me and bullhorn no and I look like you I'm saying all possibilities in an infinite universe could possibly be happening right now all possibilities meaning if earth exists and if we do have cloth in the form of curtains and and cameras that work with LCD crystals and a little tiny statue of biggie small that that's possible everywhere if it if it exists here and the universe is infinite that means you're dealing with hundreds of billions of galaxies right with honey it is happening if we don't find 10 times it's probably going to be a pretty even distribution of heads and tails if I flip a coin for 3 months there's gonna be one of those crazy on Thursday there's a time I had heads 60 times in a row maybe now when you go to the infinite universe there every possibility has to have happened right but we know it didn't happen what is we don't know it didn't happen how can you say that Wigan Gavin stop that's nonsense we have very little evidence about other planets at all the evidence that we have we've collected all this data about planets we're looking at the gases that they admit in their atmosphere we're looking at the wobble that the stars around them have well we could see that there's something that's circling the star so we know that the light changes we don't we don't have a view into those planets we have a view into the planets in our solar system in a very limited way and when we're just now getting to this we're just now getting to Pluto we're learning how fucking weird Pluto is we haven't gone at all into the Kuiper belt we don't know anything with the Galactic shelf outside of our solar system there's all sorts of shit out there they think there might be a brown dwarf star that we can even see that's way way way outside of Pluto we're trying to figure out why there's certain things out there why the Kuiper belt is filled with all these objects why there's a drop-off what massive body there might be deep into our solar system and then you go into other solar systems and other galaxies this is a fucking they've barely scratched the surface for you to say that you know there's not a Gavin out there who looks like me with three dicks sitting in front of a 1930s microphone it absolutely could be true and it could be true it could be billions of light-years away well we'll never be able to see it not only that that was a great atheism no you're sitting there saying there's no God not just as crazy as you were at least I've reduced you to as crazy as me it's nothing nothing has to do with religion there nothing nothing else to do nothing magical omnipotent force or science or the for science what's the scientific explanation for the Big Bang what started of this mess no one knows that that's a good one is a big miracle what did the Bible say there shall be light well Terence Mckenna said if science grants they ask for one miracle they say grant us one miracle and we'll explain the rest of the universe but that's just because of its a lack of information it's they don't know whether or not the Big Bang is even true there's a lot of scientists that believe that it could be possible that the universe exists in a constant state of expansion and compression the same way the tides work the same way there's cycles of breathing in and breathing out that the universe will expand into some infinite direction then come back some infinitely small place this is why I believe in God that's why you believe in a cult of child fuckers that give you bread that's supposed to be the flesh of God just drink my blood this one's a sad human attempt to act out what you just described religion is a sad human attempt to act out what you described so we know the traditions are a maybe but he turn at a meager a humble attempt to grasp what you were just talking about I think it's rigid ideology I think it's rigid ideology they try to control behavior and they want your mighty people shouldn't go to church until they're 30 cuz when I go there I just see all these nice old ladies saying god bless you well that's I mean look in a big building like Jason Jones you know Jason Jones from The Daily Show no Samantha bees husband I don't know her you know okay so he was saying I wish there was a religion I could join it wasn't religious and I think Bob Odenkirk Skidz go to a fucking Jewish school where the rabbi's are atheists so that thing exists but okay after we agreed on that that that would be a cool thing because I was back when I was an atheist I go Jason I went to this thing it's called Church like they don't talk about gays and dinosaurs they just say god bless you and you're in there going thanks that I'm here gays and dinosaurs an abortion don't come up you just sit there going Jesus Christ what a miracle we're here I'm so thankful so thankful that well that sounds all positive that sounds all positive but the idea of like subscribing to this ideology and doing it because you want to somehow another put order to something that doesn't have order I don't want to put order no working I am in all of the chaos it's like an all room okay and that's Native American religions too they sit there and they give thanks to the North they give thanks for the snow thanks for the East thing yes all religions are the same well I think for Muslim religions because they have such a severe problem with inbreeding that they've gone backwards in time look at Iran in 1965 and looking Iran now they've gone backwards in time well a lot of that has to do with war a lot of that has to do with all sorts of fucked up shit that's going on the Middle America through his cousin is we are relying on them for oil there's a lot of shit going on lying in the oil well mine oil and then paying them tons of money well that's also created these oligarchs created these monarchs these people that have insane amounts of power and wealth and control these these areas let's crack then if it's if you hate it over the well much I just don't want to ruin our earth I don't want to ruin the natural resources of our planet of our of our country I don't necessarily think that I don't think there's anything good about giving these people insane amounts of money or that there's anything good about relying on them I think also we're dependent upon fossil fuels so much that we've innovated and that's this one direction in such an extreme way I find people like Elon Musk pretty fucking fascinating because he's trying to figure out some way to do it in a different way the left goes no I don't like that bitch the left like we get a pipe in Canada FoxNews yes we get a pipe that goes from Canada down here how's that no one would kill a bunch of owls okay how about we we we frack here no no okay so you want us to continue dealing with these fucking inbreds well we have done some really stupid things in the past that have ruined environments that's the same with what's Chernobyl that's what's going on and Fukushima both there's a lot of different areas of this country that we could point to all the the was a Love Canal was that fucking one area that the poisley Mile Island no no there was no there's been quite a few of sure then of course safe all the nuclear tests that they've done I love that one animated gif we see all the nuclear tests throughout history and all the ones they've been just lighting up in Nevada do did it if you're seeing that no oh it's amazing it shows you nuclear tests throughout history and you know you see like the first ones in the 40s like boom like whoa boom and then somewhere around like 1950s 1960s they go crazy and in Nevada they just just over and over and over again racking off thousands of nuclear explosions and that you know that's how John Wayne died he knows how the Hulk was created I don't think that's true gamma rays is a different thing but it was in Nevada at a test site was it not well I think it was an experiment with gamma radiation that went wrong look at this this is the thing this is an animated gif file and if you look it shows the dates and then around 1940 something 1949 no this is we're coming in late because why don't we see these Jamie there's one boom so this is late you started it late I laugh every yeah so we're in the 1950s now these the United States ones have already gone off what's the matter with this if you look at the time up in the resting water explosions well what's the matter with it well boom boom boom well they're blowing up shit in the ocean they're blowing up shit but there's a lot of those areas that are just extremely toxic now like like Chernobyl Chernobyl is a fucking mess now they're communist but we have to use nuclear weapons that ended World War two the Chinese you know the Chinese the Japanese you know what they were doing you got to read this book rape of Nanjing broken you know that Angelina Jolie movie no she ruined it this guy Lee Louise Zamperini she ruined it yeah the book no the book is awesome the movie blows right but did she write the script Oh was her baby Oh was hers yeah you should created it yeah she did the movie of the book I'm gonna get back to Marc Maron eventually okay I hate a lot of famous people but he said when he was a powa in World War two the reason I brought up Angelina Jolie is because I was gonna say if you hear if you're look interested in unbroken please don't be discouraged by the shitty movie it's a fucking unbelievable book where this pio w was stranded on a fucking raft for 35 days he beat up sharks he got in fistfights with sharks anyway in the book when he's a Japanese powa saw Japanese women and children being trained to fight and this wash of doom came over him because he goes oh my god after we kill all their men they're still gonna fucking fight how are we ever gonna end this war they're gonna go right down to the woman and children four-year-old we fighting four year olds before this war is over and then kaboom kaboom lit the whole island on fire horrible bombs I'm not a pro nuclear guy ended the war but isn't there a lot of evidence they were already willing to surrender and that we didn't want to pay any attention to their their training women and children is not surrendering yeah but that's just survival did you see anecdotal evidence of training women and children doesn't mean the country wasn't willing to give up they were starving I mean there was embargoes they were in a real bad place there was evidence that Japan was willing to surrender now and then we just fucking bomb them anyway yeah we bombed them because we wanted to make a point and we wanted to test out our shit really I'll have to look into that yeah there's arguments on both sides obviously because you're talking about something that took place 70 fucking years ago it's a long last time but I think there's arguments that can be made that they didn't have to do that can I get a bucket to piss in yeah well you can go piss it's a bathroom right out there don't worry about it man don't worry about it well pause this bitch alright he's a fascinating guy isn't he it's uh it's it's cute because like he's fucking around but he's not fucking around it's like a sort of uh it's sort of like a low-rent gonzo journalism thing he's doing but he's sort of pretty he has like real opinions and then he fucks around when you challenge those real opinions and says like really brash things that he doesn't really believe yeah very Fox News right I don't think it's Fox News just but I find it fascinating that all these right-wing guys they have to be religious it's a part of the protocol you have to align yourself with people that will blindly support you or will take you in if you were like you have to be religious like steven crowder religious Milo you Napoles religious all those guys they have in common that they represent the right and it's I don't necessarily even buy it I don't I don't think they're really they're really subscribing to it I think you have to align yourself with people that that will blindly support you and that's like one of the best ways to do it that's how Reagan got office right lined himself with the fucking religious people that's how he got in there no there's all Canadians think that America is run by Christians and then I moved here and I saw a bunch of atheists what run in the country well they have to say they're Christian you have to get a job ama doesn't believe in God how do you know Christian I can tell how can you tell you look at his eyes the black I can smell it a fact he's really yeah he's gay I have heard that rumor it doesn't really wash but I do believe a lot of conspiracy shit like what I don't think his birth certificate is real real I think only one of his daughters is his birth daughter what you know I never heard that word you got to talk to show have you ever had Charles Johnson on the show yes he is he's a silly boy no he's a great guy he's a he's a nerd beyond nerd he's a robot he's such a nerd right and his research is fucking amazing well he definitely does a lot of reading goes after people he says some preposterous shit like what what the thing about taking out DeRay Mackeson he didn't mean shoot him doesn't matter the way you say it like saying it like that when you say something like that how much would it cost for someone to take him out like you you have to be like really specific when you say something like that we were talking about a a marginalized figure who's a you know and maybe people would say a civil rights activist you should have said take down take down even is weird how about look up dirt on him be real specific as to what you're looking for this is nitpicking yeah maybe I got some gossip you want some gossip sure I was I do a show on Anthony Kamiya's Network right and I was gonna be on race wars with sherrod small and Kurt Metzger uh-huh no I hate Obie for what he did to Anthony well what did Opie do nothing you mean that he didn't support him yeah yeah and they should they should have left together their contract was at least put up a bit of a fight or at least call the guy yeah well I think series probably offered him a lot of money right and he has of wife and kids and okay so this is what you do internet thing was not serious offered me a ton of money yeah and I got wife and kids I know what you do you do exactly what the Jeremy Clarkson people at Top Gear did you just step back everybody when Jeremy Clarkson got in that fight with the producer at Top Gear and they fired and punched a guy after a 12-hour shift lost his temper James LeMay and Robert with whatever they step back and they went okay weird show's over we're not doing this anymore we're not doing it without him and they decided they recast Top Gear and those guys are now doing their own show with the Amazon Network that's fucking awesome it's great I wouldn't even ask that of Opie I would just say at least try like I had these friends who you know we're always trying to get pilots made and trying to get shows on the air and this guy did like a funny news show and they didn't like they liked the concept the show they didn't like him as a host and they'd go how about you is the host and we were all friends and he goes they want me as the host and it's his show what should I do I don't I don't know what to do I go fucking call him mm-hmm and present the city yeah and go this is the deal they're not gonna hire you talk oh no no I don't think they've spoken since what so when Anthony got fired that was the last they spoke yep what he just thought fuck you you fucked up I don't need this shit that's what I only did yeah hmm finally yeah I think he was looking forward to an end there's some fights on YouTube where there's a one show where he was like chewing grapes I think and he wasn't paying attention Anthony wasn't listening or Opie was chewing grapes I can't run what the details were but Opie loses his temper and he goes this isn't gonna last forever we're gonna we got maybe another year so but we're done yeah yeah and I'm even fine with that but just call the dude and go I'm done mm-hmm you know we live in this shitty society where people don't fucking talk to each other anymore even even my inner co Punk friends crass they they penny Rimbaud the guy started crass he goes conflict were getting all kinds of royalties from our songs and fuck them we're never speaking them again and I go did you call Colin from conflict and he goes no I just I mean that's what I heard I give him a call it turns out they had a crass cover on one of their live albums and technically they should have been giving the royalties from that side of that why didn't you fucking call him anyway mom that's a very specific instance I know so race Wars so race Wars there's gonna be on it I am gonna be on Wednesday to discuss exactly this but uh I get this text from Kurt he's gonna be so pissed on bringing this up again but it said hey Mandy have some Opie shit going on and I on Anthony show a long time ago I don't feel strongly about Opie at all really I am actually very new to Opie and Anthony and I said I just noticed as a new listener every time there's a fun riff going with Jim and aunt that's funny because they're funny guys Opie would come in like a chick and just go yeah well you shower and I'll show her right guys and you just hear the the vibe go brew and it would ruin the fun and I called him a torpid sloth meaning a slow sloth even slow torpid torpid look I've never even heard that word it's a great word thank you I'll add that to the van Euler torpid and lugubrious are great ways to salubrious what is lugubrious mean same thing slow yeah why not just say slow sloth that sounds like I love the English language and I want to expand it that's why I hate it so much they Massacre it every day so that's a beef I have with Opie I guess right and by the way with as far as beef I'm sure both of us personally feel like one molecule of contempt okay but if you ask me about him that's my opinions my opinion on Macy Gray not my cup of tea the singer yeah like what well I don't have a beef with Macy Gray I just think she sucks I don't even know her sausage on she's just one really good song right yeah yeah choke Oh goodbye and I choke oh yeah I think she abandon her kids actually Freelander ear yeah are you just making that up no maybe the nerd could look it up but the nerd how dare you maybe the super cool guy gets laid a lot can look it up so anyway Kirk goes do you have some weird beef with OPI I think we got a recent we got to cancel you what yeah and so I we got to cancel you from a podcast you have a beef with Opie why would he do that to save his job to save his job and then sure I understand Sharad how's it saving his job because it's on Opie Radio resources on Opie radio ah so then sure odd call that's why you should be on a fucking network right there because I have people on here that are enemies with people who are my friends and I'm friends with both of them and they have fucking beef with each other I'm like yeah like Dahmer air and Dice Clay they fucking hate each other they're both friends of mine that's good radio it's I don't I don't take sides unless there's something like if he's just arguing like this guy sounds dumb or that guys there has to be some reason like you have to have done this has to be some transgression that I can't accept you know where I say I'm sure my foot down but it's just this guy sounds like a chick or the exception is is this guy threatened your wife and kids or something it's a felony let me say more or you're a rat or you you steal jokes or there's gotta be even stealing jokes actually one of my favorite things on the Internet is you confronting Carlos Mencia that's what you do you fucking go to the guy and go this joke this joke this joke this germ you know well with that guy it kind of had to be done but when you have people like that that's a reason to not have a mod like that makes sense like that's true but even Carlos Mencia I would imagine today him on this show that would be fucking up what happened he's so dumb if you had him on you would just be like oh this is just fluff kind of get him out of here then he leaves like there's a what's his name and you have to deal with them this dude who was on Opie and Anthony once threw lies max oh yeah he was some threesome that he filmed and with a fitting beta tape they're like where's the tape then if you filmed it right and he didn't know cuz he was lying and then they'd just go get the fuck out of here and he leaves and it's a fucking great clip and then they tore up his book yes yes yeah but anyway um she goes yeah and then Sharad who's sort of the alpha male that show goes he goes every time I do is an imitation of him he says it's slave II so I won't do a slave II yeah I go I'm Canadian we don't do slavery shit I can't seduce I want it and I go why and he goes I wanted to be more informed and I go then text me and go did you threaten his kids and wife and then I would text no and then you go you're some accusation no but I'm saying oh that's a reason to cancel right so find out if it's the big one but if it's not say let's have it on the air and the same thing happened with Jim Norton on Opie and Anthony back when it was Opie and Anthony he was doing a show with Vice and I was scheduled to be on and he bumped it and I called him now Jim Jim schrott occurred I love by the way I'm I'm sorry I'm fucking talking shit awesome dudes but this is just a thing that I think someone did wrong I mean okay you jaywalking it to jaywalk so Jim goes no I wanted to be informed before I had you on and we fought for an hour and a half about this and I couldn't get anywhere in the air it was like that David Cross thing about free lunch I couldn't move forward it was just and I go right how can you fuckin believe that informed what you always have a dossier on every guest and you understand every facet of their lives you didn't want me on cuz you had a vice show and you didn't want to jeopardize it he goes no I didn't want you bringing up some beef with someone advice that I didn't know about and I'm like well then have it out on the air well not only that how about just do a little research I mean how long is it takes I now had a guy on my show who believes the earth is flat I fucking said to be YouTube clips he's angry and they made a hate video about me because I deny that the earth is flat and he finds inconsistencies with the space station photograph puddle theory I think it's adorable I clearly wasn't informed on puddle theory when I had the guy on clearly I didn't go whoa actually the Antarctica has been explored in 1936 bla bla bla bla right I was like so what's this the earth is flat and then we discussed the flatter and what did the guys say well can i watch that what's what's the episode oh you got it's the David Webb down the rabbit hole deep down the rabbit hole guy he's a podcast on stand-up knows a rabbit hole yeah rabbit holes the earth is flat he's one of many people who believe this yeah it actually made him believe in God because he thought the Great Creator made this series of puddles Wow there's a series of 1930s microphones and dudes at 3 dicks jesus fucking christ so what what is the beef with with Vice you guys started together get Shane Smith's a good friend of mine but we never easy though yeah I like that guy okay how dare you okay I like him I like him he's uh I mean I grill of him how about that I hug him when I see him really what's his sweetie I think that uh he is not a friend of mine but you grew up together yeah when did it go wrong Oh six what happened I think it was legally can't talk about it cuz I sold my shares so I did a non-disclosure non-disparagement thing get paid I gotten fuckin incredibly paid I made great money since then too but uh I just keep hearing things about him and I go really people believe that like I got this story recently uh oh yeah when I was in the Bosnian war is a war reporter writing about Tito and I thought a lot of these war journalists are lazy and I'm like dude you weren't even there and war reporters producers died reporting on that war and you're talking about them like they're human garbage audacity and no one ever looks it up Charles C Johnson is one of the few guys who looks it up and goes you you weren't fucking there you never worked for AP I don't know anything about that so I can't comment well but I heard him as a salesman in after we started the magazine I never thought I'd be talking about a mr. journalist because he never seemed to have any kind of interest in it whatsoever but well his videos of him going to all these different places are fucking extraordinary he gotta admit that I never see him really yeah you should watch them and then maybe comment okay yeah and as far as he goes I can't say anything about him post oh wait cuz I've never seen anything he's done or my problem is everything that I've seen is post onine okay everything I saw was post me starting this podcast so we're not contradicting each other here yeah yeah I don't know I don't know what he said before what he's saying now but I said this this is how we sum up most splits like I was talking to Jill Abramson from the New York Times you know her she was executive I know her name sure she was ousted but how dare they I go it comes down to beers right like you weren't going out for beers with pinch Arthur's souls burger the the head of the New York Times and she goes yeah basically I mean that's what all these splits come down to is we stopped liking each other we didn't go for beers anymore Opie and Anthony yeah we're friends that's what's so great about the Japanese they insist on beers and when you have beers with someone that you work with you wouldn't a super hot hunk you established that you're both human beings and that though you disagree I hate when BLTs aren't toasted too right and it just it's like a reboot of the humanity right of people I'm right I had a wife and kids you know they didn't and we stopped hanging out and then any excuse was a reason to to split mm-hmm so you agree to disagree on what on that no it was a horrible divorce it was lawyers and tons of horrible shit but I'm saying that was the impetus is it's that simple it's not like there's some sort of big secret like I fucked his girlfriend or do you wish that you were still involved in that because you started it and now you see it grow and it's on HBO and it's fucking on mine yes massive the only way I could I always ran hundred percent of the content I was the boss so that needed sales so how did it happen that Shane became the boss well as we grew bigger we were doing mergers and I think you know your salesman has power because he's bringing in the money and so that salesman can start exercising that power if he wants and so you know he when he said fuck you all of a sudden had this big influence and when I said fuck you back it became lawyer things but for me to still be there I would have to be subservient to my previous employees in a sense like my salesmen my herb Harlech would be Johnny fever asking herb taluk if he could play a song reference I'm struggling to keep up with I kind of remember Johnny fever but herb was the sales guy yeah okay herb Harlequin les Nessman have taken over WKRP and you're saying to Johnny fever would you like to come back to WK are you Johnny fever yeah who else am I gonna be Bailey maybe the chick was it Lonnie Anderson yeah Lonnie and Bailey I was the chick I was a secretary in place well vice is a totally different animal now right I mean yes massive multimedia conglomerate I don't know anything about it that's got to be so weird it's a house of cards but you name it I don't know yeah we were called voice of Montreal Suroosh named it les Nessman named it and it was a tax scam that these black Haitians were running and they just kept this as a golden goose pretended it was this multicultural paper and they got their money and then we realized I think after I hired Shane that uh they don't want us to generate income because they just need us to be this tiny little bubble that they get paid to promote you know there's all this money in Canada to promote multiculturalism mm-hmm right so we were a multicultural paper but we wrote about skateboarding and punk bands peepers hanging the money yeah never read the it was a newsprint tablet and so how did it become what it is now so we left and to avoid litigation I said let's just change the name device from voice right and then we made up this lie where we said the Village Voice in New York threatened to sue us so we had to change the name to survive and Canadians fucking salivate over any David and Goliath story involving America so it was in everything it was in all the magazines all the papers coast to coast Americas bullying Canada again and no one looked it up and after you left so this is 2006 that's when it took off you had to be like what the fuck I left a no wait we left in a way things start getting rocky you know six we have the salesman takes over a company it's gonna become more profitable I mean my that's just model hospitable but bigger I mean not just profitable but the the reach like what it's with life is sucking off a dude a really good job trying to get to that Woody Allen movie and husbands and wives when they go I saw your ex-wife she was with Liam Neeson she look great is that when you found Jesus no I found Jesus and no five any coincidence that that's when shit started to go bad twelve months later no I mean I've never been very public about my religion and right deism I I don't even know how it came up in this podcast I honestly get uncomfortable when it comes up because I feel like we're talking about my foreskin or something hmm actually saying you feel like you talk about your force it's like talk about my wife's asshole mmm talking about religion is like talking with my wife's ass I'm interesting yeah so but now when you see vice like on HBO do you have to like flip two channels would you watch it I've never watched it it doesn't come up I think it has come up once in a while when I'm scrolling mm-hmm and I just keep scrolling do you have a feeling like a photo of an old girl stain I don't like those guys hmm so you know it's like an x-band right I don't enjoy it I'm not enjoying this actually you're not enjoying this show well no no the show is great but this topic okay we don't talk about this I love Anthony Anthony he's fucking awesome I think he's a national treasure such a freak great guy but you know what he hasn't gone with David is 50-year olds are kind of done like they have their shit that they'll I say David David Cross oh okay they have their shit they like and they're not looking for buddies and they don't want nuggies and they don't wanna know geez wedgie you know like I like I'm a buddy guy right you farted and you didn't say safety right I said slut I get to slap you so with Anthony I'm like alright we're part of everybody's now fucking Canadiens let's be buddies and he's like no I'm an old dude I like watching Fox and play with my cat so he doesn't like to do anything he's not as I don't know he I thought we've become best friends after Jordan you were hoping yeah that's what you wanted to join for you wanted a bestie yes and it's saying I did out and Carolla Show same thing I was alright so we're getting wiener dogs or what's the deal here and he's just like by and walks out of the room and I'm like wait a minute and I'm not yet to be best nobody gets to be besties to that he doesn't want to hang well yes 50 different projects going on simultaneously all the time you know that guy has TV shows he's got fucking who knows how many goddamn podcasts he runs simultaneously he's always racing cars and he doesn't anytime no but 50 year olds have established that 50 year olds get to a point where they go I wanted to have 50 shows and a racing car I'm good and then you show up and go are we best friends yet and for like can someone get him out so you really you really need to make friends at the church isn't that like part of like what's good about Church every time I've been to church the people around me are losers that's weird I won't have to think the same way ladies incredibly obese hideous people why because they're desperate and they're looking for yes I'm sort of liberals I mean it that's the reason most comedians are liberal because liberals don't have rules they're like I'll take anything so all artists the artists are liberal what do you mean to have rules well like think of how liberals and conservatives see painting conservatives go can you draw a hand does it look realistic liberals are like put a tampon in a teacup you got an A+ so creative people tend to be left because the last Christ thank you Robert Mapplethorpe yeah so that's that's hilarious well it confused me for a long time because I thought why are so many comedians liberal they're analytical people by nature they investigate you hmm yet they're all Pro Bernie Sanders he wants to take your money why didn't you look up how much money rich people have and what the debt is I think they're trying to find an alternative to what they think is a broken system and they don't really investigate it deeply enough to realize that what Bernie Sanders is saying like financially doesn't seem to be possible like I don't I don't think I've seen anybody say that the numbers jive yeah well they don't look up the numbers and I like someone was saying to me about you they go he's like a smart dumb guy go he no he's a curious guy and that's what interesting people are they're curious and most comedians are curious people more curious you look good weird that doesn't make sense well maybe it means mine but elaborate subjects in a blue-collar way okay but I don't get how people can be comedians which means curious and not have looked shit up you could drain Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and all those guys bank account it doesn't take a pube out of 18 trillion how have you not googled that you fuckheads well not only does it not take a like I think if you tax every single person in this country that makes a million dollars if you tax them 100 percent you don't even come close right yeah every single person like you would take all of their money that they make it doesn't come close this is why I don't like arguing with liberals and I prefer focusing on my disagreements with people on the right because at least they've done their fucking homework well I just say I don't like rigid ideologies like I said I don't like the idea of a liberal or a conservative I'd say I think people locked themselves into these ideas and then hmm this is azza like i said about my friend who is a democratic we've got to win if we win the census what are you saying I go that's what's this we you you are in you know you're you're rooting for the Raiders right now it really is what it is but if you say to a conservative we're a nation of immigrants or something like that some sort of cliche thing they've already heard it so many times they go actually or a nation of citizens and the borders are open in 65 well listen what you just said if you say that to a liberal it's this if you said to conservative they do this that's not my experience with the left they say things like well like you and Greg you go teachers don't make enough you hadn't looked up how much teachers make they don't make enough it's still not enough money 60 bucks an hour isn't enough money we agree that it should be private because I think that when you have things private and you can make people fired and you know you give contracts to companies that are competitive you you get a better product right I think capitalism does work in a lot of ways charter schools are great and charter schools make less charter school teachers make less than public school teachers and they're kicking ass and they get fucking three months off a year they go home at 3:20 you know bored you'd be if you work that little I would be I would look if I got off work at 3:20 that would mean I'd have to go there at 7:00 I'd be fucking tired and I would be I would be looking for a nap easiest job in the world but my point is I don't know what I found with the left when I bring up shit they have never looked it up like you say to them how many legals are in the country they've no idea you say education needs more funding how much does each student get as far as how much we spend in what goes to them the answer is about 12 grand about a thousand bucks a month they never have any idea they always say it's not enough whatever it is or with immigration I go how many immigrants can be taken and they go more than we have now and you go there's 30 million what's a good number a hundred million and they go more and I'm like you fucking hate math that's why you're a liberal you just like the idea basically a woman you like I'm not saying you I mean liberals in general they just like the sentimentality like this we're immigrants my little Mexican my liberal no I don't think so what am i I think you're mostly a libertarian yeah I probably say that I'm a libertarian for everything but open borders I don't understand they want open borders well because we feel like the people in the other countries got a shitty deal they got a bad roll the dice and they're stuck in this really roll the dice thank you evolution is a roll the dice evolution from Mexico Mexico sucks cuz of Mexicans what have they contributed to society in the past 100 years executives that's remotely and sent a fox said when he was challenged he's a Mexican innovation from the past hundred years and he goes the taco delicious food he's got a point yes it is about sombreros I've noticed in California when I bring up Mexican people get uncomfortable because it's like medicines I like food I love Mexican and the Mexicans we have by the way it's borrowed are the funny ones northern Mexico you know different regions have their different thing like in Britain the Scots are known as funny right for some reason northerners are always funnier maybe it's colder yeah they have sense of humor fucking freezing yeah so we get the best as far as cool guys to hang out with and I love but my movie how to be a man did incredibly well with Hispanics more than is this what is I don't know not even aware of this no I did a movie called how to be a man what was it there's a comedy about a guy who's dying a fiction yes and he's recording videos for his unborn son so after he dies the kid can watch the videos and huh learn from that which we stole from a Michael Keaton movie which we mentioned in the film and I just assumed it would do well with hipsters then we got the demo back and it was like all Hispanics is they're the only ones into how to be a man most Millennials think it's a bad thing to be a man huh but anyway so I love Mexicans right but we just don't want to come on over here way we have immigration work now is a fucking disgusting that's funny you say that because you're an immigrant yeah I took ten years ten thousand bucks brought a cheap blow to jobs and I got punished for it how did you punished I was charged ten grand it took me ten years but that doesn't seem like punishment that seems right fucking citizenship I'm another six hundred and fifty bucks away and a bullshit test about what color is the flag why do you want to be an American citizen you don't want to be a citizens of unified drunk-drive or do something bad it could fuck up my green card and shit like that Oh so you want to be able to drunk drive so that's why you want an American citizenship that's not why but I do thoroughly enjoy drunk driving I think it's really yeah do you drive drunk no it's the best it's like video game oh come on man you don't mean what blackout but seven beers that's a fun though right god damn dude that's really drunk like your your your fucking reaction times terrible something happens you could slam right into things no drunk driving is a myth Wow what do you mean it's a meth what does that mean I mean the world wouldn't be better if the world wouldn't change if it was made legal people would not people don't jeopardize their own safety it's you know in America in New York sorry it's illegal to drive after two beers you shouldn't be commanding a vehicle if you can't handle it on two beers two beers right now yeah it's Oh what is it Oh a Toro 9.9 yeah well that I think is low but I think that's also a revenue collecting device totally you know I think recycling I think if you could do a test of people's coordination and after two beers you would find it's really not much different than being sober but seven beers big fucking difference driving is simple think of how driving is not simple if something goes wrong and you have to make a split-second decision and your reaction times fucked up so a collision occurs that wouldn't have occurred if you weren't drunk that's where it becomes a profound super anti drunk drive this shit hits the fan if the shit hits the fan you can't keep it together it's morphin if something happens if I'm not you I am on your breaks a dear a person someone makes a mistake someone goes into your lane you could cause a collision because you're drunk where you would avoid it if you were sober that's a fact people are jumping out on the highway now well I don't stand the snares cars making a mistake yes I'm coming in your lane you bonked no you don't bonk you collide and people die it happens all the time car accidents on the highway are fuckin deadly people happen all the time you can accidentally like Caitlyn Jenner did push someone into fuckin traffic yeah the guys texting is way more dangerous and he's spaced out he was texting why is he here she thought he was he then why do you say I think he already had fake tits but he was uh are you a bull dyke then he had a sweatshirt on he was a dice though hit that big face the big man face before he turned he was dancing I camera where I said I don't think he was I think that's ever been proven I think that was the part of the investigation we my main platform on a run for president but I think drunk driving is not an issue I thoroughly enjoy it I mean I've roger every killed somebody drunk driving okay the guy who wrote pulp fiction with Quentin Tarantino hundreds of right now think of how many cars right and we only have what 40,000 deaths a year but don't you think that people like are less likely to drunk drive because they're terrified of losing their license that's terrifying yeah so they do it less that's why la is less fun la is not fun because people don't drink all right I'm talking to because I don't know when you're fucking around and when you're okay when you're be gently serious la sucks I fucking hate this like you the passion you're doing the onus for under here silly bars don't open at any given time and everyone's petrified of drunk driving so they don't even drink when they go well people go no they do drink they get ubers ubers are everywhere is recent yeah but that's what they do no Kay well I can't wait to the post really we're going back like three years now mm-hm I'm talking about La really only six I've been coming here with who like the over things like one and a half maybe like we're really did it maybe la is getting better since uber ele I know is fuckin shittily dressed squares what about you don't you you call dressed you think that's a good time yeah I'll kill you at that time that's part of the problem that I got an altercation I'll kill you with that tie do you know that combat it's not a good common terrible but as you have a leash you have a leash around your neck can I control you with that I'm wearing it into the cage man I get my hands underneath that and I twist I'm criticizing your town no I'm not no look here you must go to New York and go holy fuck no that's what this is no fun I don't think it's a good idea to have that many people jammed into a place whether it's here or there I don't like it here allow you have there person Sidewalk empty cup fucking tumbleweed person fucking and baby look at palm trees they're not even wood that's not a tree no it's not a plan it's a disgusting hideous plan why is it not why is it not a tree you can't get wood from it's right it's got dead leaves hanging off it you go to like a carpet store and in West Hollywood and you go oh this must be abandoned the paint is chipping off no one likes this place no it's open it's actually super expensive yeah but in New York fucking car I am an American and I enjoy Auto kills your only fucking 30 minutes from awesome forests and fucking shooting bears you mean over there up there well I shot an elk an hour and a half away from here okay well that's pretty much Earth earth an hour and a half away from Elk may I mean maybe not Europe but as far as you know where you would want to hunt you're usually an hour and a half away from nature mmm yeah no I don't think LA's ideal but I think la has a lot of great things I think the real problem is overpopulation I think whenever you have too many you know all that right sorry San Diego man I when I worked in San Diego last night and we drove down to San Diego we had to leave at 12:30 and it took us it only took us three hours to get there which is pretty good yeah I mean it's really a two hour drive with an hour of traffic that's not bad but the last hour was all San Diego traffic and I was like wow this is crazy different than it used to be a few years ago it's gotten a lot worse and ego fucking reeks I don't mean stinks literally but figuratively reeks way worse in LA and a lot of bums I think skateboarding is illegal there that's a shitty it is what's a very conservative City yeah it's only a bit there and it's like they're telling me that they suck black guys dicks on the weekends I like I go what it's a conservative town you know it's a lot of lot of military people a lot of bait you know it's the bases there here's the best cities in the world loot wrecked what's that it's near Amsterdam so camp strain without the jocks Oh Barcelona I heard Barcelona is pretty awesome my friend Chris Ryan just he's moving back there Paris Paris New York City Montreal so when you're in New York City do you take cabs do you to the subway wherever yeah now full disclosure you say you don't know when I'm kidding when I'm serious I'm kind of being pre 2015 gab mm-hmm at 45 with three kids New York's been there 15 years to be totally honest this kills my argument but it is wearing on me a little bit I appreciate your honesty yeah I mean I don't I don't think there's ever reason how blind allegiance towards a particular spot I did for a long time but to rats at once regularly fucking saying no to I'm done with the city to be honest did you see the video of the rat killing the pigeon oh Anthony had that on a show yeah it's amazing uh no they hunted I had no idea of rats hunted rats hunted this pigeon and jacked him I mean it's like fit his neck yeah and and chased him like lost him for a bit and then how to chase him and got him again like it was it's crazies everywhere yeah I can and you know what drives me nuts about New York sorry prief 2015 gaff these fucking kids dancing on the subway for money and they're swinging around the poles you know what this no they fucking so like you get on the subway yeah and they get out and the shit they're doing isn't impressive they're swinging around a pole on the train and you go that's a stripper pole faggot you're not as good as the strippers I usually see mmm you're a loser and then they'll do shit like though so they'll go upside-down and slide in and slowly and you can see that people just moved you're going oh my god and I go go to a strip club and you'll see way better shit than that and then they do this thing with their hat where they flip it and plop it on their head like that's hard right like if if we were drinking on top outside no a baseball hat or the cops in their teeth and flip it on their head if we were drinking at an outside bar and you did that I would go oh yeah it is annoying it's fucking and I didn't know that was going on yeah it's a thing most people don't know this you're educating a lot of folks right they will kick you in the head too really well by accident yeah when they're spinning oh yeah all New Yorkers go those fucking guys start near me and they fucking touch me they're all going down Wow and it's like 7 Yorker impressions old-school Irish Held's kitchen guy Hell's Kitchen yeah that's the Knights I'm in and those guys are fucking because I said when they say shit like that I go yeah but then you're in the New York Post in that little sliver that says man in subway stabbed to death mm-hm after altercation well how much violence does go on in the subways cuz you always hear about the bad incidents but every day millions of people are going back and forth and back and back and forth it's not crime in New York uh-huh there's a murder a day all East New York all Bushwick bloods Crips most of the gangs are a day one a day on average no more maybe 400 a year but yeah well West Hollywood only had one murder this whole year happened in the comedy store a couple nights ago no way yeah yeah who was it Don Barris he killed and killed on stage no there was a guy who apparently wasn't even a comic and he was out on the patio and someone walked up to him and shot him six times in front of everybody you know maybe a brutal debt they think it was gang-related it's all speculation yeah and it was they had a black comedy night you know urban in quotes early comedy night and they'd had some issues with gang members there before allegedly oh he probably made fun of the dude I don't think so he wasn't a comic oh yeah they think he just was a guy that they knew he was gonna be there Oh Compton culture visiting yeah West Hollywood well I was seeing what they go through every day probably yeah something along those lines but I found it amazing that that was the only murder in Hollywood for a year well isn't it all gays in hollywood west hollywood that area like below that is very gay not all gays but a lot of straight people move to those areas because they're super safe because where the gays live it's like they take care of everything well gays are happy because they get laid a lot mmm that makes a big difference either kills your argument about gays having a problem it seems I never said gays have a problem it's good I think gay marriage gay marriage is a tiny contingent of bitchy gays most gays don't give a fuck now what we'd never figured out what what did Marin get upset with it was it was after the show he said the problem with education is systemic right a word I hate more than the word batshit crazy you don't hate i hate the word bad shit what the fuck does that mean well a batshit is really dangerous guano oh I never knew that yeah there's a funny story you making me hate the word less there was these scientists and there's a particular cave in Africa and so they had set up to make this video of these bats coming out of the cave because millions and millions of bats on a nightly basis come out as cave so they set up I set up the cameras what they didn't anticipate is that these bats when they come out of the cave they release their bowels oh oh instantly so they were literally covered in bat shit like swarms and millions and millions of bats shitting all over them and they developed these hemorrhagic viruses these horrible diseases bleeding from their eyes Oh horrific and they were dead within a week and they don't know what the fuck killed them and they you know they had to can I donate that shit crazy anymore yeah thank you for that shit is dangerous again yeah good good we're gonna wrap this up soon anyway as soon as you come back no I don't do reads during the show it's falling apart a little bit falling apart with his bladder [Laughter] he's laughlin teacher wages okay let's see what it is of course he is closer to 15 to 20 bucks average this is a un okay well there you go yeah median hourly rate by job yeah I didn't believe that that $60 an hour that seems kind of silly he said it's really interesting because he's a very smart guy but it's almost like he's purposely like sabotaging real intellectual debate he like I know what I said FoxNews earlier it's just like they're making points to make a point and then they went the point well he gets into it and then he sabotages it with humor like he fucks it up and like it's almost like there's a strategic use of the word faggot Hey look at the the actual statistics for how much teachers get paid it's a lot less 11 dollars for a substitute teacher 14 dollars for preschool elementary school 15 dollars in our high school 20 dollars now imagine getting hot 20 dollars that's the highest rate they get by the way but imagine getting 20 dollars well have a seat so we can hear you on the microphone okay get a beer what is the the source keep it up there where is this where are they getting this from it's payscale.com wing of totally different numbers the the teachers Janabi is the most powerful union in the world they fund both sides on Capitol Hill so it's more than any era see this is like black helicopters and 9/11 was an inside job and then they act like the Mafia like you will you will get your window smashed when you fuck with the what are they call the NEA so you guys anyway back to the Marc Maron thing you guys had a problem with the worst word systemic and bat-crazy sorry that shit crazy so I said and he said it's not just one thing right I agree with him and I had sense I go yes there is just one thing and what is the one thing make it possible to fire a fucking public school teacher that would help that would certainly help the end and appreciate it's in Harlem with charter schools they can get fired and Harlem's doing awesome with that just one little thing but what did he get upset about it was the transport I'm guessing that that's why he didn't like to show Oh that as far as verifiable it was in the tank the show and then when my transphobia controversy exploded because he wrote that article he's his people whatever said we're not airing this show because judging by your views on trans people the interviews now incomplete hmm so I guess it was like saying we interviewed the head of the KKK about fruits and vegetables and then found out later he's the head of the KKK this would stupid to put out talking about food the whole time or say I shot the president after he'd go wait a minute we talked think I killed the president we didn't mention in shooting the president so because of the fact that your article came out after the interview he couldn't just release the interview because it didn't discuss this very important topic you four that's his side yes that seems like it's not that important a topic except to those people or if you're talking about that subject I don't think that the subject of transgender people is like an integral part of who you are or call me or have your people call me and I'm in LA all the time you are doing a demo say update or say hey I didn't know you were this weird you don't think it's cool to cut your cock off let's discuss do use it but you did not think it's good like do you think people should be able to do whatever they want yes but we're getting back to this gay marriage thing when you normalize the transgendered we end up in a situation where kids are taking hormone blunders to prevent puberty we're clapping like muck and losers when a little boy a little gay boy gets female estrogen when when should it be okay like with Bailey Jay you look at Bailey Jay doesn't she look like that's like a mentally ill gay men a mentally ill gay man whom I like uh-huh where's guy what's mentally ill he doesn't think he's a man that's a gender dysphoria that is documented as a mental disorder well well I think I like about him is he can cut his tits off when he realizes what's going on and be normal but there's no Old Bailey Jay you realize there's no like I am Barry Jay I've been gardening all day or my knight in shining armor no they don't what do they do they ice them suicide they fucking to go back become a meth head and they get stabbed in a bad drug deal or knows that they removed some because it's almost like but they want to be a woman you're not you can't be a woman you can't be a bat you can't be a giraffe becoming a woman is not something you get off the shelf what's the matter with homosexuals but they don't want to be homosexual like a lot of them like it was a perfect sample the one that we were talking about the MMA fighter she's now a lesbian she still likes women like she was she was a man for 30 years and then became a who still likes women she is a wildly mentally disturbed gay wait straight straight yeah yeah that's a fucking crazy straight dude Jesus crazy man you're saying what's your problem why do you hate all this shit and I go obviously I don't fucking care like if you're on a mountain and you do something yourself you can write cut your face off there was just a woman in the news she decided she want to be blind and she had a position puts his nose in her eyes she's blind fucking insane I don't want to make that illegal but I want to also say let's not normalize this because someone who is kind of dumb and crazy and thinks they want to fight now you've made it ok mm-hmm so that the MMA fight is a perfect example of the problem with this whole live and let live thing because now we have a dude with tits and a fake cunt kicking the shit out of chicks well there was a really funny time where this guy was when Rachel Dolezal came out as trans racial this guy was supporting transracial and he was right he was but he was joking he was trolling and there were so many people that were arguing back and forth on his Twitter / he's a comic I guess from England and you know he was calling it wrong skin hashtag wrong skin and but it was it was hilarious to watch these semantics arguments here's one that you'll find funny okay I got in an argument with someone about the MMA thing and about the woman who was a man for 30 years they became a woman and she said she was always a woman and I said really I said even when she was a man having sex with another woman and making a baby and she said even then Caitlyn Jenner so that means Kris Jenner was raped because she thought she was having sex with a man right susceptance it was a woman deception so that's a crime I assume it is in New Jersey especially in the definition of rape today where you if you regret it it's rape yes and if you look at him funny after it's over that was bullshit that's rape God if regretting sex was rape I would be doing the 10 life sentences well you know the whole thing that's going on with drinking where the man always gets accused of rape if two people are drinking together right if the woman is drunk if the woman is drunk and is doing one of your favorite things drunk driving and she kills people she's responsible for her actions but if a woman is drunk and she has sex with a man apparently she cannot consent that's another great example of what we're talking about because in the MMA situation you lied and said women are men and I have a man being assured well she didn't mean like she didn't disclose the fact that she used to be a man that's how she looked at it she said it's a medical condition factly so you've got a chick beaten up and then with the drinking thing you go wait a minute so all drunk sex is rape now we have like there was a woman who was kicked off a flight for joining the mile-high club really yeah because she was belligerent and she was fucking some dude in the bathroom and screaming oh oh like wasted my kind of girl and then she gets in a fight with the staff the stewards or whatever they're called these days the waitress is in the sky and she gets arrested because she was fist fighting them and screaming and and you go well wait a minute you were raped you were drunk you were drunk having sex so you should be charging that guy and when you reinvent the system and change all the definitions you have to take into account the victims here like well they've abandoned the alcohol thing outside of colleges big dates feminists were pushing that for a few years ago right they're trying to push it nationwide but then it became preposterous because he realized everyone's a fucking rapist because the whole country is filled with rapists because socially people drink and that's how they wanted to fucking so the people under the influence that we're having sex it's like 80 percent it's something it's something nuts that's why we're here I mean I wouldn't be alive if drunk sex was rape or illegal but when you do all this shit and you you reboot the system what you're actually doing is trivializing reality and if you say drunk sex is rape some fucking woman who was raped at knifepoint by a guy in a ski mask is now right your peer you've just trivialize that and when you say Rachel Dolezal is black you should realized every black person's experience who grew up with real racism and when you say that Caitlyn Jenner is a woman you've trivialized womanhood now like this woman who gave birth and had you know she's a grandmother and there's a family reunion and she's the matriarch that basically built all these 60 people she's the same as this fucking guy who put some fake tits Bailey Jay you've that's sexist you've trivialized it well it's certainly a weird thing I don't know if you've trivialized it okay diminishes real women in any way shape or form he does I'm not in my eyes okay I'm a woman we are we have been suffering we are oppressed we get raped and then some dude in a way goes yeah it's a fucking insane we are getting harassed on the street and she's looking at him going uh well I was actually really raped so was I I had drug sex well you just shat on her whole experience with your bullshit wig I don't know if you do but I see what you're saying I see what you're saying I just not masterís ain't going the Million Man March and go yo this shit is outrageous man well what about the guy who's one of the guys from black lives matter I'm John King his wife like I feel like I'm the same liberal kid I was when I was a punk teenager right I don't like Rachel Dolezal and Shaun King cuz they're racist racist yes they identify with black people they are trivializing the black experience I don't like Islam because they're sexist I don't like fucking feminists because they deprive women of the joy of having babies and they trivialize what it is to be a real woman their whole sort of anti southern belle thing is anti woman I'm still a feminist anti-racist fucking punk rocker you're a feminist I'm a feminist in the sense that I as Donald Trump says I adore a woman I like women I think that's the definition of a feminist right a feminist is someone that definitely has a merit to femininity to women yeah that's how they use it though I know that today it means you're a feminist if you think men are women you think women are badass and kick ass they're in kick ass too and they're doing circle kicks you know what my favorite is when they say that if you are a feminist there's no need for any other sort of equality gender equal the issue because feminism addresses all of it so there's no need to have men's rights issues because once feminism is completely achieved once female rights are equal to men's rights then they will address all the other rights I actually I talked to a feminist about that and I said okay so you must hate the amount of prison rape going on with men right and she goes yes we do and I go I can't even conceive of feminists standing outside a prison with placards going stop the raping of these guys well the promise of being raped by guys like when they say that more when they say they're humanists they don't care if it's me well I think a lot of when you when you're looking at these really unattractive women that happened just so happened to be feminists again we're not saying that all feminists are unattractive but I've friends and I'm sure you do too that are just ugly dudes and they grow to hate women because they just associate women with rejection and feeling bad that they're just getting just constantly shit on by women like fuck these bitches and they develop that sort of mentality it just seems to be like a natural course of progression that some really unattractive women would be like really hostile to men too because all their life they've been rejected and made to feel terrible by men right yeah I agree but I don't understand why they don't try like try what grow your hair long wear high heels shoes maybe around at last call and I'll fuck you but here's the thing a really hot chick with purple hair and it's short and she's got a fucking banging body oh fuck the shit out of it you wouldn't even care that he wouldn't even care like you sexy bitch like we don't like short hair we don't like Birkenstocks I used to date this girl she had a shaved head she was hot as far when you fucked them from behind it looks like a dude does I don't like that that's very very small dude with a big ass we have women talk about unattainable expectations from men that's gays and women coming up with those expectations we're pretty cool like grow your hair long wear high-heeled shoes even if you're fat well put on a some lingerie and we'll work it out do you think this is what's going on with a lot of this is that there's a lot of people that are they have these standards that they feel like they've they're supposed to they're supposed to uphold or they're supposed to live up to but now they have a voice they have a voice because of the internet because they find like-minded people online and they get really active in those communities and it gives them a sense of community and a sense of purpose that they never had before totally yeah they don't really believe it I saw some feminist girl you know they hold their stupid fucking signs I love those signs and this sign said I'm sorry my breasts aren't big enough and she had like pretty decent tits and I'm thinking I'll fucking cum on your tits like I don't care that is feminism right there maybe maybe one guy in my life who likes fake tits I dated a girl had fake tits and she sat me down we had a talk where she told me I had to pay more attention to her breasts because I would be like face neck and shoulders down and had a talk yeah cuz she's like what did she say you need to pay more attention to my breasts Wow my dad could have those I can't get into them I can feel the scene yeah well the old ones especially they're really good now they have some new ones now that are like they're they're a solid instead of a bag of water now it's like a silicon mushy thing where it feels exactly like breast tissue allegedly I like your shitty tits you like regular natural tips I like
