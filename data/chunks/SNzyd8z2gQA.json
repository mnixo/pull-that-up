there's like you're changing my life he changed the way we think you changed you know I mean we keep hearing that same thing that same theme over and over again you know I'm like I'm hanging out with you guys and I'm thinking like you guys I'm I'm thinking positive and I'm trying to enjoy my time here and surround myself with friends who are like-minded you know it's the most important thing you could do we be positive have fun enjoy your time be fun to be around surround yourself other people that are the same way and every day you're laughing look at us Joe did everyday the crowds will you make me laugh I make you laugh so I mean I can't really a long away I'm wasted there was everything you know I had a drink what did you think dude because you this was the first time when you got on stage you got some roars dude yeah they were like happy to see it right yeah it was I can't see your face under you a little crazy and it's so amazing it was insane how awesome like the crowd reminded me a lot of Texas yeah it's like really happy to see comedy yeah like a lot of people came out after the show was just like you know we'd never have an experienced comedy like this before we never were into stand-up comedy or anything this is like it's all new to us and that's one of the unique things about this town and Joey can tell you you know the history of this place twice to come down here in the late nineties there was Harvey's and Harvey's is a good club but there's still many restrictions you can't curse so just a certain amount of comic the only dirty comic had one week of dirty comedy was James Evans that's it that's what that was like crazy I don't try to play the drugs would be a magician so when helium opened they put a different type of table top here which opened up the door for a lot of different comics that wouldn't be allowed to come up here because in the budget restrictions at Harveys or that I'll tell you man one of the reasons why I hate travel is because of the club's fucking with you this club that the city was outrageous that's how they are in Philly - you know Philly is incredible I'm happy I came thank you oh please thank you feel of fifty five fucking joints I'll be sick again please because I can't smoke with people we've just got them smoking like eight Bulls and seventeen joints and the last the last was there was one where I'm like holding two joints on oh it was like really eighth grade that was the best fun I was like being the eighth grade yeah and the first night was telling Jo there was 60 people 40 people you know like six groups or like 6:00 p.m. and we were smoking on the top stop look this I just kept fucking driver like you got that well I've felt like the vibes of the crowd they felt to me like real like real strong potheads it was like a strong pothead crowd like that might have been like 90% stoners right right right everybody was cool as when borrowing ya know we grow out here we don't have doors we just grow our super gross yeah and apparently they don't give a fuck they're like no they're not trying to force this shit at all like I had coach oh we know it was crazy because the clothes guys I just want to warn you if you guys did this on Friday and Thursday tomorrow's would be completely nuts and I want to eat with you guys stairwell up to my room last I've taken about where they said they grew over my head like a fucking weed and actually put too much pressure on me i 5:30 I was already dressed as a showered that's how the crazy again because my true emotions come out I understand them I see people and the first show tonight usually it's a Christian crap on Saturday - the people have babysitters these people were fucking nuts they took the ride they were eating a finger back they took the rod Zoe Rowling said we're not there to watch him for ten minutes and I was listening to you and I could feel these they were in with you it was a movie you're watching a movie it was something even sitting on the side of this place so thank you brought another fucking stop this is a badass town man so in short this town is unquestionably the shit one of the short lists of where to move when the apocalypse hits Portland just shot right the fuck up the charts this is how fucking bad-ass Portland is look at they have they have a solar-powered compactor the solar 50 this is solar panels on the top the sunlight powers this fucking thing you throw the trash in there and it smashes it up into a nice usable cube which if you were so inclined perhaps you could use for the construction of a very biodegradable house you know what this is badass shit Portland's ahead of the curve [Music] [Music]
