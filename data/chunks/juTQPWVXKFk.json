hello freak bitches ya flat earthers forests aren't real is that what they're saying Jamie the flat earthers we're going to talk about the flat earthers for one reason the reason why I wanted to bring this up is because I think there's a lot of folks out there that are super gullible and I think they're being trolled I think they're being trolled by people who put together these it's one of two options either they're being trolled by people who put together these elaborate arguments for something that they don't believe because they're just trying to make money off of YouTube news which is entirely possible yeah and this needs to be thought of it really needs to be considered because YouTube videos can be extremely lucrative if you can get a youtube video with millions of hits and a lot of these videos on all sorts of different conspiracies and all sorts of different crazy things can generate that kind of volume you're making real money pennies on the dollar but if it's millions yes yeah it starts becoming real money and starts and if you do a bunch of them and you can you do them on a regular basis it becomes a gig it becomes like what they do they create these silly videos but people who just don't have the time or the inclination to actually read scientific papers and articles and journals and all these different things that explain how we've known for a long time that the earth is round right yeah it's a myth that Columbus proved that the earth is not flat that it's round they the ancients knew the Greeks knew Columbus knew everyone knew then that it was round Sumerians knew absolutely their depictions on clay right drew it in clay they drew all the planets a circle right thank you right I mean there's some obvious simple ones anybody could do if you see an eclipse like a lunar eclipse you can see the Earth shadow on the moon it's round you know if you if you're high enough and you know the ships are sailing out you see the mast is the last thing you would see as the whole drops over the horizon first slowly you know there's things like that that we know the earth is round you know you travel around you come back to where you started you know now their explanation the flat-earthers is that yeah it's round like a pizza but around flat pizza and all the continents are on the one flat face side up and that the satellites are up there going around it's like yeah but the satellite photos don't show all the continents in one picture because some of them are on the other side of the globe so that refutes that well not only that but they think that satellites are actually in planes they're in planes in low-earth orbit that are just circling around there's no actual satellites they don't even believe in satellites yeah so back to the original comment I some of these recent ones are so crazy that you can't help but think okay they don't believe that they're just yanking our chain for maybe financial reasons but that does get to this question I can always get which is do these people really believe it the cult leaders the people that make extraordinary claims are they just making this stuff up you know people make shit up all the time it's called fiction fantasy or do they really believe it are they you know true believers and you know it's hard to tell it's hard to get inside people's heads the old flat earthers in the 19th century I think they really did believe it there wasn't much money to be made you know on those kinds of things I mentioned the Alfred Russel Wallace who was the co-discoverer of natural selection with Darwin I wrote my dissertation on him and wrote a biography of him and he was quite the colorful character who was so open-minded to new ideas that he was also gullible so open-minded enough to see this radical new theory of the evolution of life by natural selection that's good pioneered other fields like biogeography and so on but he also was really into spiritualism and phrenology seances handling all that stuff and then he encountered an ad in one of the Natural History magazines for this 500 pound bet if anybody could prove the earth is round so he devised the test and he went down to the Bedford Canal which is a long straight like 10 10 kilometers long you can see the whole distance and if you put these little sticks in the ground with markers on them and you get a little telescope like a surveyors scope and you line it up you can see that it bends so at each point the stick is you know three meters above the ground if you point and but you can see that it's dropped down in the last one so it's bent so he won the bet but he didn't get paid of course because these people are cranks and so we had to take him to court this ended up costing him about fifteen years of his career you know it's wasting time you know writing letters and getting court dates and suing this guy and you know what does it try to win the bet yeah just try to win the bet so and of course what happens you get caught up emotionally like I'm not gonna let this bastard get away with this yeah you should've just cut his losses and laughs but anyway and I found these letters that this guy wrote to the National jigger are they the Royal Geographical Society about Alfred Russel Wallace you know you have one member of your society that should be you know he's a quack and a crank and you know and he wrote letters to the two Wallace's wife you know you better not sleep in your bed at night quietly because I'm coming to get you guys it's like Oh like death threats yeah so you know it's always questionable to deal with cranks because some of them are a little mentally deranged sure and they can attach themselves to someone like Wallace or Darwin or anybody else if you can somehow or another connect yourself to them and some sort of an argument it's kind of legitimizes you at least in a way because that person's giving you attention and that purse is engaging you and it elevates your standing and then whenever two people are arguing a certain amount of people are gonna choose sides they're they're just gonna even if what you're saying doesn't make any sense there's gonna be a gang of people to go I like what you sayin and they're gonna join in and people love and they love to be on a team [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
