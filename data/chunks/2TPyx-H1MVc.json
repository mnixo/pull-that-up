hello my friends it's time again this episode of the podcast this is July 4th weekend so I know you're gonna be out there at the lake or the beach taking your clothes off trying to look sexy in your swimsuit and it's probably a disaster we can help you ladies and gentlemen this episode is brought to you by audit calm its onn IT I've always been a big proponent of kettlebells because it's one of the first weightlifting things that I've ever done that allows me to kind of get like the whole workout in like a lot of times when I used to lift weights where you lift weights and then another day I'd do cardio I do one day weights one day of cardio but with a really good kettlebell workout I get a brutal cardio workout and it allows me to get it all done in one shot I'm a huge fan of them they just it's fun to do and it's it makes you feel like some Russian savage living in Siberia back in the 1930s or whatever the fuck they invented these things what they are is it's like a cannon ball with a big metal handle on it and you swing them around and in doing so and all these various exercises you develop what they call functional strength meaning strength for your entire body not isolated individual movements but your entire body and do they have no chimp where's the chance I'd say something's missing the motherfuckers ran out of champions ran away now we must have run out those fucking things sell like crazy that's the primal bells the primal bells are these new kettle bells that we had this is the most important thing they look cool as shit there there there we have chimpanzees and then we also have zombies we have apes rather we also have zombies but the the most important thing is that they don't just look good but that they're 3d mapped what we have them is we made sure that all of the kettlebells you're getting there they're not imbalanced like you can make a cool face but if the cool face wasn't balanced it would kind of defeat the purpose of the kettlebell the whole idea about a kettlebell is it's gotta be balanced when you move it so it looks badass but you get a like I use the the gorilla and I you get a really good workout with it it doesn't feel at all like a gimmick even when it slams into your arm with a gorilla face first if you're an idiot if you're not paying attention to how you saw the kettlebells one thing that I can really not stress enough when it comes to this stuff if you're thinking about doing any kind of physical activity if you've never worked out before you've got to do two things if you can the one thing the if you can part is hire a personal trainer to show you how to do the movements correctly just you know find out there's someone will do it for you probably let you iPhone video it and let let someone you know show you how to do like a clean and press how to do a windmill how to do these things correctly and then videotape and then you can do it on your own and you could literally never have to go to a gym again with a chin up bar and a couple kettlebells like you can get ferocious workouts in on a daily basis but start slow it's if you're a mean head like me and in you're a dummy and you if the you know someone says take three vitamins you're like oh say fuck at five and see what's up um you could hurt yourself with these things start slow we have thirty five pounders we have eighteen pounders the howler monkey is 18 pounds and we go all the way up to 70 pounds with the primal bells but if you're a real savage one of those bonafide fitness freaks like perhaps one let's go those CrossFit dudes who enter into those championships that bitch asked seventy pounds is probably not gonna be enough for you if that's the case we sell them even heavier the heaviest ones we sell I don't know why they do them in kilograms I guess that's out of respect to Mother Russia or some shit they all say kilogram I think they don't say yeah we got rid of food but it's now it's still in kilogram okay what the fuck is 40 kilograms let's find out what Stella I think it's 88 pounds that they would do that yeah what is 40 kilograms in pound yes it's 88 pounds so that's the heaviest one we have if you can throw around an 88 pound kettlebell you are some kind of man oh if everybody else starts low be healthy and like I said it's my favorite all-time method of just physical exercise just you know without martial arts being the obvious number one but just for regular exercise kettlebells are the shit and it feels good it feels good when you do them it's just it's like it's it's it's you're stretching out a lot and a lot of the moments so it's got almost like a yoga sort of a vibe to it like windmills windmills are some of my favorite things to do super good for your core and your back and butt again do them slow and if you're interested in any of the on it supplements use the code word Rogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements alright crash from the float lab is here ladies and gentlemen so without any further ado and no more fuckery a foot experience ladies and gentlemen for many of you who have heard this podcast before you're aware of a thing that I'm really into called the sensory deprivation tank the semper sensory deprivation tank was invented by a guy named John Lilly who is a scientists and a real freak like a guy who is just really out there really fascinating guy and he wrote a book that I picked it up on I think like amazon.com like the used books that they'll sell yeah like people sellers individual sellers are selling and it's the deep self and in it he talks about the benefits of the tank it detailed construction on how to make your own tank he's got like diagrams in it and just really really fascinating guy and he was into all sorts of weird altered states of consciousness and one of the things that he wanted to figure out was how to separate the body from the senses and he came up with a bunch of different designs there's a movie altered states that's kind of very loosely based on you know the idea of a guy like him going completely haywire and becoming like a monkey just that's how I got into sensory deprivation tanks I saw altered states and they were historically fairly accurate in the design of the tanks the initial one that you saw in altered states showed what Lily at first came up with which was like a glass scuba helmet that sort of suspended him in regular water and he would actually poop and pee into it he had like some crazy filtration system so he could stay in there and have to defecate or urinate so would go through some system that he had created I mean this dude was gone he was off a d-pad I mean he's about as off the deep as ever but his his big thing was to try to figure out how you can get the mind free of the influence of the body and the best method he came up to was this idea of the tank and he figured out eventually to put salt water in it and then if you put enough epson salt your body would float and then he could maintain the heating temperature - essentially what's the same temperature is the surface your skin and you wouldn't be able to recognize where the water was and it would give you the sensation of complete sensory deprivation that and he figured this out and from that point on till like god I don't mean I met you in what was like how many years ago is it five or six probably five or six years ago before that I had that other gentleman who used to repair tanks for Samadhi who's a great guy yeah and he he told me about you and the guy was fixing my Samadhi tank my smarty tank it fucked up something something wasn't the tank that fucked up was the heater like it burnt through the the lining of the waterbed and it shorted out the whole thing was a disaster like sometimes those heating elements just the pop you know for whatever reason there's they cook and it just melted a hole through the thing so he had to repair it he to repair the lining and while he's repairing the lining he goes you know there's this guy in Venice that makes these like really high tech tanks and he goes you should contact him his name is crash he's kind of an interesting guy and so I asked him about it and he went adapt about all the crazy shit that you had done to these tanks and what they looked like he sent me to your website and I saw the team this is pre the stand up tanks they were still like smaller like ones like Samadhi but way better constructed you you had figured out how to do it where was just like this it looks like a meat locker I mean it's so solid and well built and all your crazy filtration system never and I realized that you were this one loan dude out there who was innovating and it's sort of forgotten business this sort of forgotten aspect of of modern-day understanding of the mind I mean it's really it was ignored somehow or another I don't know what happened I don't know how all these scientists and geniuses missed out on the sensory deprivation tank promotion they should have been talking about it everywhere it is a mind-blowing evolution in in meditation it's a mind-blowing next step in meditation where you instantaneously go if you get good enough at it and you do it long enough you instantaneously can go to psychedelic states intense introspective objective psychedelic states that are there they change your life they fundamentally change the way you think about life and the fact that these people aren't promoting this because it's not a drug it's it's totally safe it's totally easy to acquire it's it's totally it ends anytime you want you open the door to get out and it's over there's no repercussions there's no weirdness to it you instantaneously drift back into normal consciousness no one's talking about it no one was doing and I and I found you and Brian created this video Brian was the guy who made that video where we went down to the basement and a videotaped the the tank and from from that video on we started hearing more and more people opening up the center's they started going crazy they started opening up all over the place and you continue to innovate and you don't said a word yet by the way well no I've years III I'm just nodding my head I mean you're doing such a good job at the at your appraisal the situation that you know I don't want to dilute it no I I just feel like I'm yeah but really much not at all no I'm really enjoying this because you are the guy that six years ago whatever it was it first understood that - not only was I out there you know kind of standing around by myself but you know the when and when I found you then that really escalated the exposure in general and just isn't for me or it has to do with industry overall once that you know you became because you're you're an honest guy and your opinion people trust it and and when you say something then that it has value you know there's there's other been people to all this that whatever you know it doesn't have that that sincerity the the true you know from from what you believe type thing it's a lot of times influenced by this or that but once you you know and you've been like this even with the device thing was a big thing with this in the Oh Hamilton Morris it was great he's credible and without you that wouldn't happened you know it's just in that these things help out everybody right now because the industry deserves a opportunity to to expand and become available through people in general like because it is an important thing to a person that's in the process of considering what it is that they're doing with themselves which i think is very important for people to take responsibility for their actions and what what what they do and what they say because you know you you can you're free to do that you know you're allowed to be different you're allowed to go ahead and say you know what i don't think this is quite the way that i you know and that this is becoming actually more popular now this is like freaky people mhm that are able to go out to oh hey maybe that and they're going oh yeah they're doing all kinds of weird stuff these I don't even know what what a Pilate is it's catching on you know they're right I don't know it's just our neighborhood or but it's a la but they're different yoga spinning all these different activities that are that people do you know a lot of the crossover to currently is based on these athletes yet that you have contact with or that respect your perspective or whatever and they show up that guy Jeremy Stephens was here in the other day again yeah and then I watched him on a clip I don't know when that is when it was this pass was that when he great guide down fight he kicked them and then no no that was a knockout that he had in the previous fight man I just saw that the other day he he he knows in Brazil incredible and he's such a nice guy great guy although scary smart too oh yeah a lot of those guys are surprisingly nice and surprisingly smart I think a lot of people have these this idea about people that are involved in combat sports that they're mean they're assholes quite the contrary yeah I find to be some of the most level well-adjusted people that come in contact with they're not trying to prove anything because they're already secure with who they are and yeah they're Mardan level that's the best way of putting it like because you're forced to get your ego checked on a super regular basis and when that happens you're kind of you just have a better view of things you know you don't you people are constantly afraid of losing and when you're a fighter you losing the gym all the time and you kind of mellow that out you get an understanding of who you are and you and also the blowing off of the energy in the gym you just you feel so much better you're more chilled you more relaxed about stuff like a lot of people a lot of what their stress is is that their body's a battery their body's building up all this energy and it never gets exerted so you're taking in all this food you're you're sitting in a cubicle you're sitting in your car you're sitting at the movies you're constantly sitting and not do anything you're just irritable your body's just trying to dude you fucking move get something going come on you've got all this shit pent up and then someone get in front in traffic fuck you oh yeah you know and people wonder where that's coming from well that's coming from you you're all backed up you know you you are backed up I know there's nothing scientific whatsoever to what the trigger is short on some of us you know yeah pretty yeah it's also you know you're not getting your endorphins to kind of calm you down and I think that the tank represents a level of that in some way that I think that it's it's a thing that should not just be something that people it becomes popular but something that becomes popular in in a way where people get a chance to do a new thing that they could get excited about which is one of the things that people like with like Pilates or yoga a new thing they could be excited about that could benefit them mentally which is where I think we're missing out on a lot of this stuff I think yoga does benefit you mentally I think it calms you down and it's very good for you physically but the physical aspect the mental aspect coincide with the tank it's a hundred percent mental it's a weird weird experience plus it's available to it for it for a human being to actually participate in this meditation where you set the room with your legs crossed and you're supposed to check out somehow I can't I can't do that but I go sit in that box for a couple few hours and go all kinds of different things well you know the the meditation is possible I know that there's people that do that Kundalini Yoga and they have these intense psychedelic visions and I believe them 100% because you you you do have endogenous chemicals that the brain produces that can give you psychedelic experiences like we know about dimethyltryptamine and we know about five methoxy dimethyltryptamine being produced by the human body so if those are being produced by the body this could easily be some ancient method of stimulating that production of releasing some sort of a burst of that production and so these super Kundalini masters which seems like it would be something you'd want to do but for whatever reason I'm not compelled I'm not compelled enough to learn it but they can experience natural DMT trips at the highest levels of their art form which I believe I think you just got to get really good at sitting there yeah just get a really good at Yoga positions you got to get really good at meditating you got to get really good at just getting good enough at yoga physically that you could just sort of fall into these forms and then when you're following with these forms and supporting yourself in some way by by making your body work like that you like heightened your expression to whatever it is that yoga's trying to tap into and it's very psychedelic but still not that take it it's difficult you know for me is I'm too too wound up I can't sit somewhere and just sit there but but if you tried maybe you could force yourself yeah I would have to force me you know it's like what do you think that would be good for you to force yourself yeah I don't like that I don't have the it's just not in my ass my another way that I operate you know what I mean I have a operating when I'm awake I'm looking at like even when I'm out snowboarding or writing whatever I don't wear the ear plug your earphones or whatever if I'm right I need to listen to what happening man saw like all the time so it's a distractive in general but in there cuts everything off and I go straight into my head and there's nothing else there except for that I see what you say to you about the physical for some folks they just not interested in doing anything that's really physically strenuous I totally understand that and that energy winds up being they distribute that energy to their work like you do like you're kind of just a mad fiend with your work and your constant improvements and innovations to all this stuff like you know your energy goes where your energy is probably best suited you know it's not the same for everybody so what I'm trying to say some people have extra time or they're there in the process or pursuit and they're that's a viable method of expression plus it's a good way to meet chicks with nice legs that's what I think that they're probably the most advantageous otherwise well why they going what does it become yoga or yes wet either and there's our for our degrees did you go to oh wow this is a lot of fun you're basically having sex with a room full of people no it's like the strangest thing ever they see with all these things in mind that the chamber doesn't sound so bad you know today there's a just going this thing and lay down there and and all of a sudden you have the ability to tap into yourself I like both man I really do like doing yoga we'd like to go pump up I'm gonna get me one of those gorillas a couple of those yeah that I like all what you just had to say about that start small though yes yeah a baby gorilla or something do you do any exercises no nothing nope I go up and down the stairs that works that's something yeah and I walk and you know that is a decision that people don't realize like if you get to the airport and every time there's a stairway you force yourself to take stairway every time there's you know escalator you avoid that and get the stairs that just that alone will make your trip just slightly better yeah just get a little blood flow in your boat I like that circle sonic too you ever get on yeah yeah yeah I get on that once in a while cuz I don't like that that doughnut top is the muffin muffin top I don't like to have that thing so I got it helps you lose weight it'll get I don't do it you know too much for my Damocles sit-ups or something like this to try to get that from collecting down there but standing on that thing it kind of helps I think at least I psychologically believe it's something I'm doing for exercise what's that thing invented for Russian cosmonauts to keep them in orbit yeah I think that they were having issues with muscle deterioration and atrophy or whatever so they I guess incorporated this system of vibration into the strengthening of their muscles apparently but I don't really know it seems like well where did they take it did they take it up in the ship with uh yeah that's a good question stop off somewhere at the place you don't use you would have to have gravity to use it right yeah is it where's it at you know certain electricity seems like a bulky piece to bring up with you if you're limited amount of space I don't know doesn't it all also seemed that you um if you did use it up in space if it wouldn't work yeah cuz it shoot you right up maybe who knows you don't have any resistance yeah you have the gravity's like half the thing right I think that's the principle that it's working with oh well that would work fine you take a chamber up there to space don't have to use as much salt there or something I think it feels good that's why I like it vibrating yeah I don't know I don't know if it's doing anything yeah I think I feel it's like a little body massage when I get on there and for folks who don't know what it is it's like some sort of a giant speaker but it doesn't make sound it just sends it's so weird to describe it sends like sonic waves right yeah it moves you up and down it's a voice coil what you like it's like a you know speaker has a voice coil and has a cone on it then the voice coil moves the cone up and down that creates a sound wave if this those have a cone has platform so it moves you up and down a variety of frequencies so it kind of runs you through a pattern and yeah then you could dial it up and say all right when this is supposed to do this or that you know I thought it was gonna be a big hit be a big hit you know cuz it I think it has something to do that fat ass syndrome you know are there people they get that going on from too much as a stopping off at the wrong places you know and they'll say I don't know if the turbo sonic can fix that it's hard you know it's true it's I think they should you know eat less of that shit and work out a little bit but what I do know about it is whatever it does it feels good you know I don't I don't know why it feels good I'm not sure it feels like a little on your getting vibrate or feel like a little massage ash like oh yeah you can believe something's happening you know I don't know exactly what's going on but it seems to be something the variations too it's really cool cycle we're gonna go really fast and really slow so it keeps you kind of interested in it and it's supposed to by doing that it's supposed to be stimulating individual glands and get your flow going you know you're like you were saying about that working up like that and you got to get your body in motion you know I think people they sit too long on a chair all day long without moving around I don't think it's probably not that good yeah we've talked about it a million times the whole thing is just sitting in an office it's a fucking terrible way to live your life it's supposed to be super bad for you as I said in an office well you know this we only do it like three hours at a pop and even then I get up and I'm like I have an office I sit in my office every day all day long then I get out of it and go back to it you know an office that's how you set it up I think see this is okay to sit around here there's a fine office sort of crisis is that they got that they're horrible lied and then there's this there's the there's the rules and you got a suit on you know you're sitting in the office the whole thing represents a bummer do you think you have to do that to people to get them to work do you have to make them wear a suit to get them to work I mean if you if you let people wear t-shirts and jeans and shit would they take insurance as seriously as they do if there were that goofy monkey suit you know would they stick to the company line when they're on the phone giving those those peps peaks you wonder what's the image they're trying to project what is it you're trying to you know I'm a no-nonsense guy mr. crash yeah I look at my tie and I never swear why when I'm at the office I'm completely appropriate and I'm waving these guys every time because I just don't think that that's who I want to be doing anything with is these characters that are not working on their own you know there are therefore these guys are those who are you what do you want what's your story well these guys are those guys you know I mean you're working for somebody and that's why you're showing up in a tie and a suit or you have a bunch of people working for you and you want to look the role yeah I'm here to sell insurance mr. crash I'm a no-nonsense guy look at my cuff they're perfect you guys do those commercials all the TV rich person or whatever it is they're all they get my boat however these houses everywhere and I got a yacht look at all mine all this stuff I got yeah I'm living meanwhile I'm standing here in this terrible auditorium with a bunch of you and this is what I'm begging for you maybe to give me some of your money so I can continue on with my maybe maybe not lifestyle that you know it yes there's a lot of those weird guys that are like motivational speakers and they they motivate you to come to their seminars and they make a fuckload of money from your from your like wait a minute you had a boat like you're still hanging out here at this place this is a bummer in here I can hardly wait to leave this is your day you know you're getting yeah it's not the best way to live life for me no no I'm glad someone's doing it if I was doing it we would not have Apple computers you would not have Samsung phones you would not have outtie cars you wouldn't have these things if somebody wasn't out there busting their ass every day in an office people like it some people are suited for that type of a life so maybe if we reach too many people with this message of get your shit together it'd be terrible for civilization as a whole overall me this would weaken us and like the Chinese would take over oh this could be it's gonna be it's like they're not serving factor for that we're fucking it up we're fucking it up with these goddamn isolation tanks these medical marijuana dispensaries oh I don't want to live our unnatural life how you gonna continue to build these buildings and launch these missiles if we don't continue to live our unnatural life the more we tune into the natural life the more we see how ridiculous it is when we wake up it's coming our way I think that people are coming around right now is happening I think it is I think you're right is it that if you look at it like America is important you know even though I don't have a flag or nothing like that but but it it's where we live and it's kind of like where we're from and it's you know sort of like what we're supposed to be you know proud about you're supposed to say oh I'm from here and I you know and I'm really glad about that because where it is in the way they are I'm I'm PI I go along with that but it's gotten too far now in my opinion which is you know everybody's wrong it needs to get tore that people actually get an overview again where they start to evaluate situations and then make correct decisions based on now instead of like these prehistoric versions of what's got us to here need to be you know hopefully at some point let go with and get a new evaluation that's that's pertains to where we're at now in the world what can we do now to get along with people how can we work together this even if these military see what the I think that they're we sell a lot of guns in this country and in pharmaceuticals so you say oh I don't think we're gonna get out of the bomb business because it's our business you know so we have to figure out how to get these guys working doing something good you know so you don't like say oh all your jobs are gone now figure out how we could go in and do stuff together use our money and our resources to create situations that are beneficial for people they're not good we're not going to make friends by shooting at people we all know that I mean this is you know this is some kind of a fictitious a concept that we can go over and make people happy by by killing them you know I mean well the concept of war being for financial benefit is still pretty alien to a lot of folks they don't believe it they don't believe that that's why wars or stars or money hat yeah well but all you'd have to consider is how much benefit there could have been done to America if you're really a pro America person and you really are a patriot think about what it what a benefit it would have been to America to take a lot of that money that went to this crazy war that no one believes in anymore and try to clean up inner cities try to fix Chicago try to fix fix the border towns try to help Mexico how we oughta be dangerous we have a dangerous situation like 100 miles from us I mean what what the fuck is that you go to what it would how long how far is it to San Diego it's two hours so what is that 120 miles something like that and 240 I think is our neighbor but how fast he's on bitch you're not doing a hundred no wait wait 30 miles an hour my fucking retard 140 140 145 Oh okay so seventy miles an hour for two hours that's Mexico that's crazy it's a two-hour drive to a third-world country that's in turmoil and we don't do a goddamn thing about it and we're sending people to someplace that's so far removed from us that just coincidentally happens to have oil that's not why we're here that is not why we're here mr. crash we're here to fix things the oil thing is a funny one I got a mess over here we have all these people that kill people in New York City from Saudi Arabia but we need to get over here and over here do you know what I don't believe that oil is fossil fuel they say it's from a fossil if you know I got fossils there rocks you know I mean there's a pressure under the ground see also in other words used to be the same dinosaurs out in the middle of the ocean I don't think there's any more I think they think it's rotten plankton yeah up at the top of the frozen Alps and bottom of the ocean and over here in the desert and everywhere at one time there was plankton all over an hour or whatever to make these gigantic puddles of this stuff that we're pumping out for some reason and then you say oh look step back and say but what if I'm an alien what are those guys doing down there well you know they're they're pumping this stuff out of there the oil they call it and then they turn it into a plastic material that that litters the planet they can't get rid of it or they take it and then they burn it into the atmosphere and poison themselves and then and then what they do they spend all their money to fight amongst each other to see who gets control of it and you think and this whole stuff isn't really that necessary could be done without back to the hemp again look at that ham plate what it has to offer to be ass bacon well it's just too difficult to control you know there was a book on the process of oil being developed that they were trying to speculate somehow or another that it was that it was developed through a natural process in the earth and they were saying that our ideas of it were incorrect but I don't think it was well-received I have the book I never read it I bought it and I was like I'm gonna read that one day and I just sat there I never fucking read it I just couldn't get behind it it just seemed it seemed kind of goofy that anybody wouldn't have figured that out by now exactly are you going Wow that thing about the planets to know they're supposed to be circle eyes in the earth what the Sun let's say the Sun is moving right it's going this way so now the others believe although the planets are circling the Sun is it I think that this makes more sense to me and there's other you know this isn't my thought but somebody showed date that you know oh yeah that means say this Sun is going this way well what makes us think we're not in rotation in a vortex being pulled by the Sun going somewhere and I think we're we're on a trip man we're going somewhere started off where where was the Sun 100 years ago where's it at now and then where we gonna be later I believe the Sun is pulling us through space and we're in well that's not a belief that's a fact that's that's absolutely what's happening the whole galaxies are moving ya know this is something that astrophysicists have figured out a while ago so the whole universe is kind of moving that's that expansion thing I don't know I think we're going are galaxies moving I think we're going in a direction somewhere I think that if we figured out worth the Sun and where is it off - I think we're behind it I think that we're following it in this is the way the rotation I don't know which way is up or down in here where's the north thing that is exactly how it's supposed to be described I think as it goes you know we're circling around it I think we're going around this way I don't know I don't know I don't understand it at all I mean when I watched those scientific documentaries on space it's one of the most fascinating things ever and most fascinating so that it's so rarely brought up in regular conversation that some of this money should go into like yeah expansion of the of the reality situation we're in here Lisa oh look we have this and that we could think about now get these scientistic guy tell him to put the phone down first off put that Sun down enough on the phone it's a finger counter it's a designer tells you the name of the tune that's on you know right it's like okay it's a fund but nobody answers it which is what really freaks me out man I got I got a call everybody say hey don't forget to come down tomorrow I know I made an appointment but I'm convinced that you're not going to be able to remember it so I'm calling you now to say oh hey don't forget and then I get 20% people answer the phone say oh yeah no problem got it the other 80% is me leaving a message you know which I can't stand leaving a message but I'm thinking they got it in their hand they've got it right here they got how aren't they answering the phone it's a phone hello yeah but don't you think it's good that there's all these capabilities of these things have smartphones I think it's like ever people other people have them Bitcoin on it you can you kid check out an email link that somebody sends you you don't think that's good I think it's good for you know just you know people that want to do that oh I think it's good I think it's good I just think the problem is overuse the problem is overuse of anything though it's overuse of softball if you just became a fucking softball junkie and you're out there on the field every day throwing that ball in the air hitting them by yourself into a tree and people like what is Tom doing can't wait for that fucking game on Sunday Jesus Christ Tom you got a family you know wife I don't get home you know you're obsessing you're freaking people out man I think that's bad too but I think the phone in moderation is beautiful it's amazing how much scientific advancements they've done on the phone in the past how many years they put that kind of brainpower into anything we're driving the same car almost I guess let's got a pretty new thing some kind of motorized door but yeah it's pretty similar to the cars that we had I was just talking with a friend last night about how like the cars of ten years ago when I was a kid when I was in high school I was in high school I was 14 in 1984 that's when I was a nice or 1981 when I was in high school and there was a 1970 Chevelle that this kid had that was in my school and I guess he was like maybe two years older than me so he might have been like 16 but he had this 1970 Chevelle and everybody was like holy shit look at that was a classic it's a 70 Chevelle SS SS that's 111 years old that's only 11 years old like how was a car 11 years old like a classic back then but an 11 year old car today it's like you know it's not that big of a deal you know if you got a hold of a would that be a 2003 a 2003 car yeah that's like it's a modern car like what happened had that had that have dropped the ball something happened they might have hit like some sort of technological they're constantly pushing the boundary as far as like this this speed that cars can go and the g-forces that they can handle and like to get like to track times get a little bit better every year with their sports cars but for the average regular car like at a certain point in time what else can you improve you can add some road blocks that were up there there's people they get that road they made those tiles that light up oh yeah yeah the solar Road panel incredible incredible ice to city up like Tron and yeah off and they're collecting energy in the car and they could that could totally be implemented - apparently that's completely realistic it's crazy we're there already we just have to get get get somebody to say you know a hike do you know how weird do you know weird city streets look imagine if you lived in a time before electricity and then someone brought you to New York City Times Square Saturday night and you walk it and you've seen all these lights all this craziness and the cars with the lights you know like holy shit I can't believe this that would be like a really intense sort of a change but I wonder if it would be as intense as all the roads being lit all the roads being lit to us right now that might be like we might not be able to we might have to address the fact that we live in the future like if all of our fucking we might not all collectively just go what the fuck are we doing look what we're doing we have solar-powered roads that's progress oh yeah seeing that they're not breaking down or they have alternative purposes they're not only to drive on but they have other information they change would be so strange though the way would alter our world like our vision of the world would look totally different if Hong Kong was lit up with those kind of I wonder what the effect would be I feel like it would make people more festive it you know I feel we're I mean you're driving out on this road already if these cars are trying to tune yourself out because of the it's such a tedious process to get from point A to point B in a car yeah it's gray and there's other people jammed up in there and the speeds not what you like or whatever you know so it's kind of a the transportation I think they got some room to improve on that for us you know if they if they put the phone down yeah if they put the phone down is helping them communicate though maybe they can use the phone to make the car yeah this is the roadways these are soul roadways there's that guys Zach he was over there the day something we saw we looked him up to see he said he's on the Silicon Valley show or something so we don't see he's a funny guy but anyway but he said I want to see was this show Silicon guy I never seen this just a funny show it's on HBO I've only only watched one episode it was really fun and we brought it up and there he was and he's getting the car came to pick him up he looks in there and there's like I said oh you got in the car there's nobody in there and he says oh yeah I'm going to wherever it was and then the car took off it's all by itself driving it you know yeah well they're gonna have that I mean they essentially have that now the Google cars where there are many with it and they they haven't had any accidents they none of the accidents that they've been involved with the but the Google cars fault I think a few people bumped into him jump out in front of him or no no no that they haven't hit anything but they apparently have radar they can sense when things are in front of you I mean you've seen that on cars when you get close to the car in front of you to make a BP BP be like I rented a car this weekend it does it they park themselves now some cars yes they can parallel park themselves yes off which yeah redonkulous like they just decided you motherfuckers are too stupid to do this we have to help you excellent this is where I want the money for my car that I'm gonna buy to be invested in the ability of it to then Park itself it's you know what there's the thing that's going on right now where people are trying to go retro with a lot of shit because like there's a lot of people that like old cars now there's a lot of people that like like refurbish things because they don't want anything that they don't want all of that interference they don't want all of that disconnect between them and an actual machine we could work on it you but you're a car guy you look under a car lid now you're looking under there you go what is under here on or is the motor in here I don't even know what's on this thing yet you know if you could pop the hood of a 1970 Chevelle you guys get in that work on you got a wrench out a breather cap it's right there you can grab it with your hand there's your oil filter you can hold on to it yeah is the dipstick you could see how much oil is in there with a dick well you got computers you guy you have to have a guy yeah you have to have and the thing compute up and go wacky on you to that also can happen that that happens occasionally you know obviously there's mechanical breakdown too but make computers can go away that's you're a guy's guy after you get a guy then he has to have a guy say oh oh yeah my stuff isn't right but on the flip side you have navigation screens you have backup cameras you have all this cool shit that electronics provide - its I see both sides of it but I I do see like the appeal of like driving an old VW Bug like a VW bug from like 1970 not much horsepower or anything but man what a what a connection you have to the road with that piece of shit you know it's not good at handling it doesn't have good brakes but you know when you see one this is like a little bitch and driving it yeah I wish I could drive you're participating in the project my friend Jimmy had when we were in high school I was a idiot I always had muscle cars and my friend Jimmy had this VW bug and it was like you know we like I said this is right out of high school so I I graduated in 85 and Jimmy was ahead of me and so I think that it was probably like 1986 or something along those lines and he had this 1960-something bug or 69 bug ugly light blue you know but it was great there was something cool about it it was like we had a big smile on her face we were driving around in it you know there was something about yeah first of all he's like you know a pretty macho guy and it's a construction worker he's just really smart dude too though so he got himself a fucking VW Bug he's like it gets great gas mileage like the wind would blow and the car would move like you could feel the car moving if a good breeze hit it like your fucking cars moving from the wind man like what do we do we're gonna go kart yeah they do handle better now cars oh that's that's the understatement of the year snowboard rate so everything amazing cries bye break I had to stop from like 65 to zero like like on the freeway the other day and it just was like that no you have that sweet that sweet new Volkswagen yeah that's that's like or it's perfect I forgot you had that perfect contrast to the Volkswagen we were talking to me yeah because my friend Jimmy's Volkswagen was like super old school like that lawnmower engine a lot more or sewing machine yeah oh yeah you'd have to put the brakes but it was like a really light tiny car whereas the new one like we're saying looks like a like a fat Porsche yeah it looks like like some sort of a spaceship like an Audi or something like that ah the new VW Bug is a pretty dope look yeah they pretty much redesigned it for guys and I got rid of all the girl shit in it like that the flower pots and shit like that that used to be in the old ones that you more ones that look like bubbles and it's a perfect example of a car that like shows the improvement of today's cars because the the performance and handling of a VW Bug is better than like a 1970 Porsche if you got a Porsche from 1970 those bitches had like skinny ass steering wheels that were big like hula hoops and you had shitty ass skinny tires like they didn't handle that well they just weren't that good in comparison to like what your car could do if you have you brought your car back in time like when they had the 1969 Porsche and you showed them your car they'd be fucking blowing you be like you're a wizard from the future yeah this is a 2014 turbo I have this car but that doesn't it have like 250 horsepower something yeah they just put a new engine and I forget what it exactly the Fast Five are like that was a big deal like to how I mean that would be a little bit heavier than an old Porsche for sure but if you could get that kind of horsepower in an old car I mean that's ridiculous like they have these new Mustangs the Mustang GT the new one that's out just of just a straight Mustang GT has like 450 fuckin horsepower something crazy like that there's so much to people on oh yeah but that's like their basic car then they have a Shelby that comes out later that's gonna have more than 600 horsepower like that that wasn't accessible back in 1970 a place to go drive these things Hey look yeah we got a place you can go drive it to get something remotely as fast in like 1970 you had a special order shit you got to go to a mechanic you got to find some dude knows how to put nitrous on a car but now you get his buy it weird that how they allow people to have something like that well it's just a fact of what we're doing the facts of this can-can continual improvement this it's a process and it's a product of those things it's a product of this continual improvement it's a product of our constant desire for new shit we want the car that does zero to 60 in 3.4 because the car does zero to 60 in 3.6 is outdated you look at the specs oh this car went around the Nurburgring in 7 minutes and 25 seconds people freak out they go I can't believe that my car does in 740 my car is a piece of shit you're like asshole you're not going around the Nurburgring like what are you doing man like if you drove my friend Jimmy's VW bug that might make you feel better than driving some ridiculous car that goes zero to 60 in two seconds and corners at to G's you know it's rabid at dog well it's a certain a certain part of that you lose the fun there's like a fun and driving you know there's a guy named Dario Franchitti's I think you say his name he's a racecar driver and he drives his car to his fun car to drive he's like a 1973 Porsche with like a big engine in it he put like a more modern engine in 1973 bores like he could get like a Veyron or any of these like super complicated cars they're making today but a guy is an actual racecar driver decided to go for like the gritty feel of an old car combined with modern technology he's a very smart guy you know he's like all these zero to 60 times he goes it's yes it's importantly your racecar driving but not for the pleasure of driving like so that's the guy listen to yeah I mean that's the guy he does it for a living so if he chooses to drive like an old car that like really you really feel everything that's probably the most pleasure a lot of merit yeah we like passed the pleasurable point and went to some weird numb with cars where the stealing's like this and you don't feel any of the bumps you know it's weird yeah it's a it's not organic you know yes it's kind of not organic it's not very Mumford and Sons yeah it's not very yeah that that's the trend today the trend today is to go like a handmade clock you know like see that clock it was handmade and people like you know there's something cool about that as opposed to like if you lived in 1970 and you got a digital clock you were the pimp of the year like this guy's a digital shit yeah you go over a dude's house and he had digital alarm clock you like this motherfuckers got a digital alarm clock there is a microwave oven it like yeah yeah man I remember going over people's houses and they had that I was I couldn't believe I was looking at it then they came in to watch yeah first pin 644 is it what time is it oh it's 760 you know and remember the batteries were such dog shit that you you had to press it to find the time and then you let it go and time would go by it didn't just stay on because it was the batteries were dog shit back then you know if it was gonna stay on it would had to be like a foot yeah yeah I mean these batteries were just dog shit but ever thought about that yeah I mean those were it's remember the calculator watch mm-hmm for some reason that one never took off it took off and it got to a certain point people like wait wait wait what though how often to my count shit they got the calculator phone yeah but that's a your phone is kind of a computer that's a one device choice yeah um you better off with a compass what if you get lost all you guys a fucking time yeah you have something that makes them fire yeah why do you got a fucking calculator with not that as our first development here and that's also the calculator watch was invented with calculators we're only like that big like I mean what the fuck you doing how often is that coming up except this is the one thing that I know people are probably yelling at me right now except people cheating in school I bet there was a window I bet there was a small window where teachers are still fucking old people who were there they're out of touch with modern technology in a lot of ways so there's probably a window where these young little rascals went in there with their technological wizard phones with calculators on and they probably I remember doing that totally doing that how long was it before they were made illegal do you remember I don't think they ever really were I don't think they ever actually caught on because you were always allowed to use like calculators to cheat in school there was those big TI 81 Texas Instrument ones that you had to buy remember those huge calculators it used to be there was a note field kind of where you could just sit there and write all these like rot like answers to questions in the calculator and the teachers never caught on for us on that which is open up all everyone would open up the calculators and look at our notes on their calculator oh no that's hilarious so it was like like a note function on a smartphone yeah yeah that's hilarious but I remember calculator watches like we had them and I don't ever remember being told not to wear it like I don't think the even the math teachers even figured out well let's let's Google that to find out cuz I would think that the only way to get good at math if you're gonna really get good at math is you have to actually do it I mean yeah math is something that's fun to do I mean I think which is terrible you just lost all credibility I don't like I don't know who you are what you just like always the same way yeah but then you start getting into triangles and shit it needs that well that's specialized mathematical that's all that condition man I care about that assets like Harry Potter science like those guys the quantum the quantum deep into the quantum consciousness I like those guys that say shit that I can't understand at all I love when they're talking that kind of math when they show me those mathematical computations and you just go what is that an alien language like what is that I have no idea what that is those guys fast me I mean they see that there's a cartoon where they're all looking at that it's a big formula on the chalkboard or over there and they're going ha ha ha because it's a humor somewhere in the normal there was the joke in the formula that a regular persons not gonna it's not funny you know remember glacier I think they're called glacier glasses they can't they were out around the same time they were like like circle glasses but then they had this little leather piece that went on the side and then like the the arms were like made out of rubber and they're really popular for like two years or in the early 80s and they were like a dumb Mistah I didn't hang out those people look at Google calculator watch man it's actually pretty trippy they came out with one in 1975 man and that nuts calculated watch were first it were first introduced in the 1970s and despite enjoying a heyday during the 1980s continued to be produced the most notable brand is Casio databank series the watches were by Timex were also popular there's a Wikipedia but Brian is a Wikipedia where you could see all the old ones there it's a trip man it's really fascinating like I I forgot how silly these things were look at those we look at the one down look at the one even further down look at that thing how do you get your finger on one of them but you get a little memory at all but that is the future man if you had one of those you could totally get star wars chicks chicks are like really into Star Wars they would think you were so cool he's got a fucking calculator on his rest it's so future it's so space yeah that didn't work out we didn't give a fuck anymore now people went back to dials you know like if your car is fancy your car has an old-school clock on it like if you buy a Lexus or something like that doesn't have like a nice clock in it with a connection yeah and it's to show you this is a luxury item sir there's no digital clocks in here sir this is a luxury item like what do isn't it is it it just the thing that tells the time like what the fuck is going on here something's going on here if you have a tick tock tick tock tick tock it's fancy see this this is fancy this is fancy can't hear this I know what time we're at I don't look at my computer go away the computer digital numbers your exact numbers I like looking at a quartz and water too I don't know what's in there I got that shit at Target still going I don't know what it is it's just a clock but I like looking at a clock for whatever reason it gives me a better sense of what time is then when I look at a number when I look at numbers and it's totally illogical but I look at this number on my computer the upper left-hand upper right-hand corner my computer and then I look at that that's more pleasurable to me for whatever reason that's an interesting evaluation I think I have a more natural sense of we haven't had a log thing yeah you know the way analog is better than tape to you listening to recordings and so forth like that a lot of times yeah you know it used to record and you know analog and then when the digital came out kinda then they what they would do is they'll go digital analog digital and then back to analog yeah try to mix this stuff up to where it sounds and I fully understand it for some folks it's the opposite some folks they don't like that that's not pleasing to them but they love the numbers some I mean it's all different it's just me personally that's how I always feel when I I would way rather look at like a I think clocks are kind of cool whenever I look at a watch part of me goes oh that's cool can watch the other part of me instantaneously goes it is so goddamn fascinating there's a bunch of moving parts in there amazing that spin and took like I'm not a fan of expensive watches I'm not I mean I think some of them look really cool but it's not something that I'm like really into because they seem to me like peacock feathers a little bit but what I am a fan of is the engineering behind those watches I'm a fan of like my watch is Donna it's it's it's just not an expensive watch at all but it kind of nighttime it kind of glows like you I could see that the the hand very clearly at nighttime that's a good track it's a fantastic feature it doesn't require a battery to do that either it doesn't run on any extra you know something like your thing you have to do press a button or anything you could only see it but I'm fascinated by that I'm fascinated by the engineering involved in it but I think for a lot of guys they were and I'm not criticizing they look cool as fuck but it seems very kind of peak hockey you know when dudes have like diamonds all over their watch and you know diamonds and they thing and my buddy likes watches you just show me what cool thirty six thousand dollars for it to watch I was looking at going oh man you know I met a guy that had one in Toronto he's I think it was like more than a hundred thousand yeah I'm trying to remember what he owned like a company that imports them a very very nice guy we see he loves watches oh yeah yeah there's people that are into collecting watches you know they're very matter-of-fact about their watches you know there's this is a Hamilton from it you know there's a they have a it's like cars yeah and watches are another quality you know like a good watch you like you said it's Swiss engineer it's uh it's a piece of stuff that lasts yeah it's not a piece of junk that's disposable you get a piece of quality you know it's watch and it's got a lot of work put into it and it's something you have forever you know and I like that and stuff huh electronics probably have the the quickest turnaround as far as like when they kind of go on yeah like I've never had a computer lasts more than five years but I've had watches that last like 20 years there I've watched this 20 years old 20 yeah it's 20 years old people got their grants not expensive either it's just a regular watch and it's it's my battery dies I just buy a new watch yeah totally do that you could put another battery in that one yeah every time this battery dies a new watch is the one that did that to us they started the the lighter you throw it out and then they got the shaver you throw it out then what was the other fit pin you throw it out remember that was all BIC started with the throwaway stuff and then now it's like the phone goes down you throw it out the TV goes out you throw it out anything goes out you throw it out I mean yeah we should really really yeah really that whole throwing out plastic shit you see all the plastic that's in the ocean and all these photographs of these birds that have been feeding plastics to their babies and the babies died and you see that their bellies are filled with plastics you know it's fucking shit up lately is these those facial cleaners I have the little beads in them they're just tiny little plastic beads I guess they're fucking up the water and they're not biodegradable those things the scrubs and you know what they don't need to use those scrubs you can use seeds there's seeds that you can get like apricot facial scrub like it's an apricot seed and it's just as good and it's biodegradable like all these little plastic things like it's unfortunate man but a lot of that oh those was gone for this glass is there you know I'm ever having my calculator watching these glasses were really popular they're called they were called something also like douchebag Google glasses star star start Stargate or something something like that 30 maybe they have they had leather on the glasses it's like that and then your cars had brawls on them it's like we had this weird leathers oh yeah remember the bras bring that back brother I think some people still do it man I saw a guy with a Corvette the other day at a bra in the Corvette I was like wow you're rocking a bra on your Corvette it was an old Corvette that's a that's a can of worms you don't really want to open up yeah you know that real leather I know Supra I did bra my super course not shit yeah I think I had a bra once but I think I got rid of it pretty quickly I was like what is this stupid fucking thing what am I doing here that's what I'm saying there was a weird time in the 80s that the leather mm-hmm like there was no reason to have leather on you like look this becomes a leather on your glasses well I I guess the idea is that you want something soft that does that doesn't take light in from the sides but that also fuck up your peripheral make you very susceptible to hooks yeah plastic covering for the couches now that was oh that was a dream that was a dream when people you go over their house that was covered with clear plastic sit that it's a grandma's house how ridiculous is that everybody wanted to keep things saving up for so long that they never enjoyed them when they had them shit wasn't disposable that's amazing you come in there you know the moms telling you hey you can't walk in that room it's all this way or that you know yeah people some people still have towels like that you're not supposed to use those towels so he's get him out of here so about a little frog that was there yeah how could you do that you know yeah well you guys are freaks yeah the dispensers for freaks a doctor you know the bathroom props in here you know yeah they're trying to paint some sort of craziness anyways you know the cleaver the cleaver Jonah was miss cleavers name I don't remember its warden Eve it to be Ward Ward was the debut and was it June was it June was mrs. cleavers name wasn't she the best Barbara Billingsley I yeah okay June Cleaver I figured was it I think you're right yeah remember Eddie Haskell I remember any houses yeah it was June Cleaver she was wonderful what a crazy fucking show you imagined that there's a show that they made and it's called Leave It to Beaver and it was an actual show and the kid's name was beaver and what at what point in time did they realize that that means pussy was it like it started the 1950s right so what you know first appearance was it was a pilot that they made in 1957 so when did beaver become when did it become a vagina was that the 70s you think maybe that cuz everyone thought beaver was just like a pussy and so they just put it together cuz he had played it like a pussy character you know be really well he was always getting beat up it wasn't a savage yeah I thought it's because of his teeth or something I thought he had like a beaver a facial look or something hmm maybe I don't really yeah I really like they named it after this he'll think so that's the beaver the beef where did that go I think that was just his nickname yeah but I mean what how did he get it what did they say oh yeah you smell bad or what well they lived in a time before the Internet looks like it was a slang term from the 1910 England have you ever tried to watch that you ever try to watch Leave It to Beaver grew up on it look I we can get back to isolation tank talk in a couple of minutes we have plenty of time there ladies and gentlemen but seeing as how we're in the flow of this I would like to watch a little quick Leave It to Beaver episode just to see how ridiculous the world was in 1957 even the opening when they have their house and it's always welcome I'll be honest the Menace remember mr. Wilson yeah he was over there and it was like Oh Jonas you menace or whatever he said gee mr. Wilson yes the way it lays to talk to each other was so alien people hadn't figured out television that that's what they hadn't figured out how other people were gonna perceive them there was a a slow change where people recognized bullshit and they were allowed to do less and less of it and if you go back and you watch father knows best here it is Oh baby I say your home yes death this is me this home how was the movie like didn't go to the movie you didn't go to the movie no sir I went yesterday when I wasn't supposed to oh is that so yes sir and I want to race him by school to guarantee the other seat and I hate it larry's and I was gonna make believe like I want it today but I couldn't so that's why I'm telling you what happened well when did you decide to tell us about it when I was welcome to bike home from Larry's yeah dad it's too big for him to ride hilarious you decided to tell us the truth of course you realize you can't keep a bicycle you won while you were being disobedient ah gonna have to find something to do with the bike well yeah dad the stick that's the kid came clean leg keep the bike dad of the bike kind of fucking lessons you teachers on bullshit he didn't do anything illegal yeah see no I came forward and told him what the story was that's the kind of stuff that the kids now is I'm afraid to go tell pop because you're gonna take my bike away see that's some 19:57 type of psychology in 2014 I think they would say the best way to make this go away or to make it never happen again is it reward him with the bike to reward him and say look you did a good job by telling me in the future you'd benefit much more from just doing what I tell you in the beginning don't be lying bitch yeah go ride your bike and then he thinks dad's cool not dad some dick who's gonna take my fucking lawfully yeah one bike yeah he won the bike I mean I that was a bad dammit dad I thought this was gonna be good stuff yeah well there was good that was a bummer man I love the word bummer that a while yeah it is a bummer yeah well it's you know it's 1957 logic they just weren't that good at TV yeah they didn't understand they didn't understand how it was coming off to other people like we just watched that it looks so ridiculous right yeah but it's it's indicative of this thing that I think we're experiencing this thing that everything is constantly improving and one of the best ways to see that like you know if you wanted to determine the age of a tree you would chop the tree down and look at the rings of the tree I think if you wanted to determine the progress of our culture in terms of like the rings on a tree like in that sort of a way there's no better way to do it than to go back and look at the sections of our media go back and look at like the Six Million Dollar Man you know go back and look at the fall guy go back and look at you know the Incredible Hulk go back and look at you know the evolution of TV yeah Dallas you know watch old television watch The Dukes of Hazzard watch old television shows and then go back to Leave It to Beaver go back to this shit go back to this craziness that we're watching and then realize like whoa there's like this weird steady progression up to x-files and then you know game of throttling the media has improved like it's a totally different organism the type of shows you see if you watch a modern-day episode of Game of Thrones there's not a film that was made in the 1960s that could compare to that I don't get I think Stanley Kubrick was a genius I think 2001 Space Odyssey was a marvel of cinema for the time but it can't fuck with what they have now on TV HBO Game of Thrones is one of the best movies of all time and it's like ten hours every season it's madness seven billion it was a four million what's the cost on that how do we know it's Gawker episode it's perfect it's fucking it's a perfect show and my point being if you try to compare Game of Thrones to father knows best it's insane it's hard to believe it these are made for the same organism and yet it occupied the same amount of time of a person's interest yes so there's look how hard it's gotten to hold somebody's interest now I don't think it's that I don't think it's a continual improvement of in the understanding of human beings and I think it takes something really intense to rattle us now it takes like a true detective it takes like it's you can't just have a normal relationship like Bridges of Madison County get the fuck out of here Clint what are you doing like what you're doing you're hanging out with this chick you guys are drama queens you know you don't have much time left white crying get out of there have a drink get out of here yeah nothing meanwhile you watch Game of Thrones there's fucking dragons okay there's these White Walkers people are sword fighting in the middle of the night love this White Walkers oh it's mad the fucking how about the Giants guys are great it's a madness show I love crazy shit is happening and racy stuff what the humans do to each other is so shocking and you'd watch if you tried to watch a magnum p.i after that you'd be like come on man it's the world has changed we've gotten a much deeper understanding of what really freaks people out and we require that to get freaked out today's trolls today's YouTube trolls could start wars in the 1940s if you can send those guys back in time like the really sophisticated trolls the ones where you read their Twitter account you could barely even tell if they're trolling they're just so and then you watch like some of the arguments they get into what's all this guy's an artist I don't know what that is trolling is say if somebody wanted to reach out I just probably not tell you the trolls get mad like the fuck we got a fresh one call me out it's not a call you out thing they would contact you in some sort of a way either insulting you and trying to get you to respond to them or mockingly in love with you to try to get you to respond to them and then turn on you they would try to pretend that they were outraged about certain specific issues just to get a rise out of you try to engage you and just and as a game there's people now that HAP there's a group of folks said yeah yeah that kind of stuff it's a sport that's a sport huh it is kind of a sport you know if you can get a good one on the line you know oh my I've been gotten on the line before me hilarious do they got you yeah I can read I've gotten arguments with people before and you realize like what am i I don't even know you and you it takes a lot of time to realize that because the Internet is a new thing in the interacting with people on the Internet is what's been around 10 years if I study your buttons to say something like that you see what he does when you say that the longest people were interacting on the internet like this like in this sort of like instantaneous like Twitter type comments or YouTube type comments that's never it hasn't been more than a decade this is a new thing there's a new thing for people so people who are who like to get rise out of people if you can't do it at work especially if you're stuck at a job that sucks and you have no outlines of expression of the evil inside you I wonder why doesn't people watch these videos and then say that like with Hamilton they watch that video there and then they're comics I don't Hamilton Morris yeah Hamilton Morris we owe him an apology I mean when that podcast was made we both got way too high Brian and I got him we took him to the center of the earth we just watch event this morning we took him to Mordor we had this weed that was grown on Pluto and came over here in a time capsule I don't know where we got that shit from whose was that I don't remember well you didn't have to twist his arm well the thing is we're there with Hamilton Morris who is the psychedelic rock so we went to the bottom of the swimming pool and fucking set up a picnic table I mean we went deep it was rough man I don't know what the fuck you're talking about half the time we were in a conversation we were like seven eight hits and of some insane sativa there was no way we should have been having a conversation in a podcast no way we were just we were way too barbecued I turned out okay it was not bad no we arrived him and the tank was better but the comments were evil well you know even on some of these other ones you read and they say oh you know this or that or this guy they're trying to make an assumption you know an evaluation about somebody they don't know anything about and the fact that you just spent your time over viewing what it is they just did and now you're gonna be mean-spirited about it right why don't you just don't do it just don't look just yeah you know but you find that I didn't know these are these kind of cats that that's what they're up to these trolls that they they enjoy making uh you know getting a rise out of people which is a bummer when you don't have a lot of time to get it because you're trying to get through life without as little of these you know infractions as possible so you could keep your mind in a positive you know format and then somebody say something mean ugly about you and you're reading it you're going oh and I wish that that didn't get said about me you know right I think there's a benefit to it though I think there's a benefit to interacting with negative people is that you understand that there are negative people out there because if you if you don't interact with them on a regular basis I don't think you'll appreciate the positive people as much I think that's just the weird aspect of human beings we get accustomed to whatever we get accustomed to all sorts of things it seems unacceptable like if you look at the things and customs that people carry on in other countries there's certain rites of passage for manhood that if you tried to implement today in the United States like the weird shit that they do in Africa where they're circumcising each other with sharp sticks and they have to go crawl through thorn bushes naked like there's a bunch of crazy shit they make these guys do and if you try to implement that stuff in America today we would laugh at you but to them like this is how they've done it this is how they've done it for a long time and people get used to all sorts of weird shit so they I think a lot of people have gotten used to something that just it rages against their sensibilities and it rages against their body rages against their sensibilities because they've somehow or another committed themselves to a safe job that is not inspiring and they think that maybe if they just waited a little while or thought about it better they could have eventually figured out how to do what they actually want to do and when you run into someone who who has done that then you see the benefit of it and it fucks with people's heads you know and I think there's a lot of people that live a life of regret and bitter super unfortunate you know and I think the way our society is structured currently I don't I don't see that changing anytime soon mmm it just seems like so many people are rushing out to enter into the workforce because the economy is not so good so everybody's scrapping for jobs and they're willing to take jobs they might not have ordinary ordinarily taken because they want the security of it it's a very trying time for a lot of people but if you could figure out a way to separate on your own or you know selling coffee mugs or fucking figuring something out damn you'll be so much better off well it allows you to be more independent in your ability to provide for yourself if you could figure out something you can do what I find be a little bit discouraging is the the lack of interest in manufacturing products and then see a we like this country used to be like they really have a lot of pride and craftsmanship see we still have a talent pool here we've got a lot of creative people we have a lot of you know intelligent people and we need to pool these people together and get back into manufacturing our own products here whoo yeah that's what I believe would be a good thing get kids they took auto shop out of the school I think I don't think they do the welding anymore in school woodshop I don't know what they do in school a lot of schools don't allows don't have that anymore there's a lot of liability issues those things too I don't think it's very common no not something they teach kids how to use a hammer mm-hmm you know you go to school you should teach a kid how to work a hammer a saw well I think you know there's this ebony and that people some some folks kind of like bouncing back the other way and looking towards mechanical things and being in love with mechanical things I think that also is going to be said about working for big companies but I think that a lot of these people are going to get this feeling of you know like man I'm just lost in the sea of people whereas I can make kitchen knives I can make hand made kitchen knives in my garage over the weekend start selling them and then one day or another eventually break through I got a website from Squarespace and I put together this fucking knife collection and now I'm selling them online and now I'm independent and this I got kids using I'm on TV yeah I def luigi's endorsed my my now you don't want that shit you want some hand mage like there's a company there's a couple companies that have sent me crest trail knives kestrel knives and vehement knives and there are companies that did the exact same thing they just started making knives and start selling them they were into knives they loved the beauty of the construction of the knives the Emmett knife they made me this fucking big crazy cool thing that's going all the handles all handmade and when you know you see that someone can make a living doing that and like you mean you're chopping onions with something like that are you doing something Oh kitchen or your you know using for camping or hunting or something like that it's like you're feeling like you have a piece of craftsmanship with you awesome what is that is it like a connection to the person who made it right yeah I got more obvious connection absolutely I give you had a hand made like my friend already went to China get a handmade suit yeah fucking hand me it's perfect yeah that's me and a guy mine you know like that's there's something extra jazzy about the fact that you know that a guy made this for you like that feels good that's right it took your your proportions into consideration yeah you're six feet tall does it mean that your knees are bending here or your stride is this or that n is he's an artisan I mean he's an artisan he creates a beautiful suit it's a work of art it's a pleasure out of that so that's back to that that that feeling of accomplishment what you could feel like by making stuff there's a look at what I feel good about that like that what we do with the Chamber's we we really put a lot of effort into the the manufacturing of them and the products that we use the parts all of them not that there's anything wrong with you know whatever we use no cheap parts there yeah nothing made in China not that there's anything wrong with made in China but we don't buy anything that's used in China for our stuff at all it's all either made here or north and North America somewhere too - we have a few European parts from German and Switzerland but the rest of its all made here in America because of the quality we insist upon getting the best pieces now it was the guy you spoke about Lily John Lilly they didn't invented these chambers in the beginning he his Doc Orton was the doctrine or whatever this is a his his perspective was that it was always better to buy or to you implement or use it the better quality piece of equipment than to create this what it is that it is and that is you know so I agree with that so much then the better it is the better it is this saying all you can get away with it all we could do it this way it's cheaper or you know second you know it's I find it if you could figure out the best way to do things that's the way to do it first class you got first class or no class you know what I mean these people come up with this thing oh it's this way I used to mix sound right on the monitors mix those from the stage another system was it's okay pretty good I said no not we don't do pretty good we don't do okay we get it's just the way you want I'm gonna have that in a second for you you just communicate with me and we'll have it just exactly the way you want that not a problem right well that's like many aspects of life there's some people that are happily half-assing things yeah just happily off getting to the end of the day and it's slunk over you know slumped over and just tired and and then there's other folks that like you who were fucking crazy figure out a way to invest an incredible amount of time to try to renovate and reinvigorate this this business that had kind of been forgotten about I mean when you came along there was like Sumati tanks and then there was a couple other ones you could kind of find online you know that were made in Europe Europe it cut it had it had a little bit more popularity that Pathfinder mm-hmm and then they had was Oasis has been around since from the beginning why was it more popular in Europe than it was in America you know yes you know they were you know I really don't know to be honest with you still wasn't popular it's still way more popular even now overseas like I get letters all the time from there's a new place it opened up in London I believe this one in Manchester there opened up and I get yeah messages from those guys all the time so I know it's there opening up new ones you know it's not like it's already there and established well that's what we were talking about earlier a little bit you know in a way over here we had a chance to have a little brief discussion about the you know the future in the industry there I got a chance to show you some of these rules and regulations now that have been you know pinned up by you know the various health agencies and NSF national sanitization Foundation and we'll just explain that to people there's there's home tanks and then there's commercial tanks and you know people always when I tell them they should go to the float lab getting a tank they go wait a minute somebody been in that tank before me that is a very good question and that is a question that up until now hasn't been like completely thoroughly examine and your tanks like when people come over my house one of the things they always look at it's like the back of the tank where all the equipment is set up and they go what the fuck is all that and I go well that one does ozone these ones are filters and like is that overkill I'm like I don't know what overkill is I don't know I'm not I'm not at all I know is that tank is awesome crash makes the best tanks if he says it should be like this then it probably should be like this but when you talk to people that have other tanks they go to die got like a little fucking spa pump I get a little spa pump that's about the size of a basketball and that's it and you got like a JPL fucking set up back there with digital this and fucking just keep strobe or no more complicated as we get more and more involved with the authorities like UL yes and UL is what underwriters laboratory they do all electrical certification for any kind of stuff like this these people that you know what had happened to mine where mine shorted out is fairly common I showed you the email - about this and none of these electrical issues there's you got an email without naming anybody there was another manufacturer that makes pods and his pod melted it into oblivion yeah he you know made some sort of a thing and it just golf it fucking fell apart there's awesome ones out there but we don't want to throw slinky out or anything but for home use it's a different thing and a lot of these people are taking these home use ones and they're using them for these commercial places and all these different people are going in there and who knows if they're jerking off some of them probably let's be honest and where's that going you know it's like how are you going through your little spa filter that's not enough for me man yeah there's a video this is the video that Brian made yeah it was all shit that I've already said before I mean earlier in this podcast it sounds so different that was before I got my nose fixed wine face is floating above the water but your ears are such we already said all this stuff but you can watch the video and you can kind of see it yeah my nose um when I got my nose opened up changed my voice but that's crazy I can breathe out of my nose now yay for all my life dude I had no nose my nose I was a useless piece of shit it was this bad cartilage and scar tissue in there but now now I can smell when Brian's been smoking cigarettes too motherfucker so that is that's the tank from what is that video from Brian it's been awhile 2009 maybe is it really that reason I think but more than that maybe I don't know if I said this was tank number one yeah that's how it's facing yeah this is another see we're like 12 steps from that you know uh you know Joe it's uh we wanted to get over and switch it out for him because he deserves to have a more updated version yes he was okay with everything but well crash against the okay is that good you know I don't a lot of here okay oh that's not okay with me even if it's okay with you still not okay with me and so that we were so happy to be able to you know get you up to speed we still have some steps to go for you though to we'd like to uh what are the steps well you know this is the previous version now of what we have you know so as time goes by well the one I have now is even bigger than the one that's in that video the one I have Oh God is this weird fucking meat locker beautiful we're working on seven feet tall and it's insulting that it means more than seven feet tall and I don't know how many feet wide six seven and eight I think is what it is and that's a that's a great chamber there it's uh are using it see people that's the first thing that it you know it oh you know I joined the gym you know what was that you got to go to the gym you know I didn't mean yes you get out membership sometimes let's sit in their house and they don't use it you know people need yeah this it's it's hard but people need something to like jolt them out of their normal everyday routine they need something to joke to get in they'll try one day like today I'm gonna go to the gym and they work out in the next day it's like that fuckit they just for whatever reason it didn't catch fire but they want to improve you know and that's the first step but the the actually doing things people a lot of folks they discuss a lot of stuff they read about other people yep all these things and instead of like actually sit down and say okay what can I actually do today to get to make me do something that is of a value you know rather than you know these are the criticizing of other people is really a you know yeah it doesn't really help so much you know and well it's fun though it's fun I'd love to do it you know criticizing whether people's oftentimes a good sense of a source of entertaining it's an output to you say alright man I can't you know but you have to be careful of criticizing too much or getting only into the vein of criticism like consistently constantly like people that are smart can oftentimes make poor choices or dumb choices and I think one of the the dumb choices that a lot of smart people make is to like consistently and constantly look for the negative and things consistently and constantly there's a lot of things you can focus on the negatives of things they're always going to exist you're not stupid you see them but to constantly and consistently like only rally against dumb things in pop culture over and over again there's certain important time I have to go listen what you know we see it we see it - like what are you just angry about it like that doesn't that doesn't help anybody like what is it either either be funny or shut the fuck up cuz we see it's dumb - and it's not you know the funny part is best if someone instead Joe sort of added you know to the good part of our culture you know added you know may come up with something that's entertaining come up with something that taps into what people would like to be getting here there's more on this one if that one's empty I'm alright I don't know either way welcome I think one of the things that the tank provides is this sort of introspective moment that I think a lot of folks are missing you know and sometimes people get caught in patterns and you can get caught up in a pattern of negativity you can get caught up in a pattern of depression you can get caught up in a pattern of regret you can get caught up in a pattern of friendships of kindness you can get caught up in a pattern of affection you can you can get into good patterns too you just have to reject the bad ones when they come along don't indulge and be ready for those yeah just make sure that nuts with a cheeky self-aware yeah go in there and you got to look at yourself I when I first started doing it I got it I didn't even know what it was or whatever but I've been for an hour every day I would go in there and just beat myself up because I was a damaged goods you know no way Oh crash I'm not buying it yes once upon a time on sir well I would anyway yeah but getting in there every day for me for one hour in the beginning I see I didn't even know what it was but I knew that that's what I was a foot so I'm in there and I'd like to beat myself up I'd come out of there I'd be like beaten up and I'd get out no you go wow I feel pretty good I could sit down and just have a PA out there at that it wasn't a ranch I had a rental and a big screen and everything and I but I would come in there and I always need people around me and stimulation and stuff but I get out of that chamber I come in all by myself and sit down and not turn nothing on and just sit there and feel actually relaxed without use of drugs you know yeah I'm reliant on you know certain things in the past it was you know but the chamber now it was able to affect the way I felt mhm as a matter of factly without the use of any kind of additives and when I learned about that that's quite that's quite impressive that what a game-changer you know you now have a window into yourself you can now go in and look at you and see what that is and then say hey whoo look at that what that is over same thing because you're aware of what you are and who you are what you did and where you've been and whatnot like that but you have to be willing to you know admit to all that surrender whatever and then pick yourself up and start to use what it is that you're able to figure out about what to do from here exactly and and stand by it and then compromise and the tank tells you that but give me the experience sort of introduces you to yourself yeah and there you are in this box and you realize there's two parts of me there's this thing inside of me that that apparently has better information and then there's this thing outside they wanted to get high or goes to go to see chicks or do whatever you going to want to do is go out and blah blah blah you eat too much people do different things you know in the gamble gambling this is all kinds of all considerate and we get a hit from that you know that you know in it that but the effect that these things have see what they do is you also they'll alter your perspective of yourself sometimes you have these they certainly see how people are drunk and they're all like you know and they're really you know it kind of gives them an impression that they're more happy to be around or something right yeah the drunker they get the stupider they seem to be mmm but they don't seem to evaluate themselves from that perspective they think they're more fun or something yeah self evaluation is one of the hardest things to do right it's one of the hardest things for a person to do to step away from there whatever inaccuracies they've been telling themselves to make themselves feel better about their life or their situation and then to force yourself to go you know this is this is not right this is this society has an influence on you as well you because you don't want to look to like you're saying you know I can remember certainly I wanna get into this and start talking about certain things and if people go oh you know I don't want to talk about that or ever say that so you got to have a it's good to work on yourself this I'm big on the selfish ISM I think what do you what are you saying though about people not want you to talk about certain things like what kind of things well uh conspiracy theories yeah stuff like that you know it's kind of a negative thing because when I was you know in Vegas the same place mm-hmm and the guy loading the show and right and their truck driver goes oh there's the Kim Plains I go what he goes Hey look at that and I go oh my I couldn't believe it there's her plane spraying this mango unbelievable so I was damaged goods from that that messed me up for years and he said he quit telling people about it because they're on the he's driving a truck illegal oh yeah I take another hit on the crack pipe meanwhile there it is right in front of you yeah he should stop telling people about it and you should just go on google and find out what it actually and there was nothing this is like 15 years ago well it's not chemtrails see this is where people are really confused it's just airplanes create artificial clouds and hazy environments if an airplane is going through the atmosphere and there's a certain amount of condensation it creates an artificial cloud it just does the jet engine you mean you should look into this more than anybody because you've talked to me about this before and I know that you probably have these ideas in your head about the government spraying things in the sky I'm sure whoever it is airplanes someone may have done that at some point in time most likely has done that at some point time but that's not what you're saying when you're seeing those clouds that go across those are actual clouds they're clouds that be made by jet engines like this has all been proven this is all scientific that everyone agrees on it it's not there's no controversy about this at all when it comes to people who understand jet propellant engines or jet engines and airplanes and airplanes and atmospheric conditions like there's been articles about this since the 1980s I mean this all it is is when in in 2001 when September 11th happened there was an article that was on cnn.com like a couple of days afterwards that was talking about the changes in the temperature because there weren't the artificial clouds that were used to having overhead on a daily basis that are created when planes fly through the atmosphere so it's not something that they were being like secretive about this is just an effect of airplanes the real chemtrails one of the things that I said on my television show when we covered this burning jet fuel in the sky that's the real chemtrail you're we're polluting the sky and we just love it because we can get across the country in in five hours and that's where guys like Elon Musk and these geniuses that want to create these incredible high-speed trains that's what these guys are so amazing because if they could figure out how to do that and use the same sort of technology that keeps Google cars safe and if everybody can work together and make these we might be able to change the environment like the amount of jet fuel that we burn there's like thousands and thousands of flights every hour all across the country constantly going back and forth to the rocket ships apparently take a lot of propulsion to get out there's a credible network on the rocket ships I talk to them and they're they say oh yeah the the the biggest thing is the pollution that's created when the game's blast-off the amount of whatever goes course fairly well do it look you see fire yeah you know nobody sees fire unless something that's not good is on fire you know if fires coming out of a metal tube that's never good it's never waited for the girl is that people have that opportunity to investigate information that's why right now I think that you know in ignorant sand negligence or sort of the same thing they're like people say oh I didn't know well you don't know because you didn't care enough to look into it and that is true but sometimes you get caught in a situation where you don't you know you just still don't understand even after all the facts are in well you you also have contrary opinions that are varied especially when it comes to like certain historical events like there's a lot of people that want to talk about like JFK is a good example it's a lot of people that love talking about conspiracies they like sure wrap that one up tight and when you have these conversations with them and you look at the the contrary evidence on both sides pro and con it's like wow there's a lot of like massive amounts of confusion as to what the actual events were but actually so many people wanted him dad that you can't even pit the pit you couldn't pin the tail on that donkey no matter what yeah there was he had multiple people that were upset with his action boy would they be so lucky if it was just a lone nut yeah these are so lucky all those other people would be so might be so lucky because then this situation would have perpetuated to this point now if it was a lone nut back then and the system was actually failsafe from situations like this I think with in the 1960s in the death of Kennedy and you know the Kent State shootings and all that stuff I mean as tragic as it is for then and for those times I think that ultimately that kind of stuff is sort of a reminder in a lot of ways to the people of today about how bad it can get if things get out of hand so when they start creeping up on these infringement on civil liberties like and people start rising up that's where you see things like us going to Syria gets shot down I mean you see the entire country both Republican that was the first time that ever happened where they had made a plan to go in and invade something and they did not do it because of the voice of the of the public the voice of the whole public you know it's like how many awesome a public at this point in time or time I don't care if you got a blue suit a green suit a perfect piece no thank you we're broke and we're not invading other car what for what exactly we're not fixing the problems that we have at home how about the fact there's no water how about the fact that Texas it hasn't rained in Texas in fucking years you know California had like one rain all like over the past like three or four months it's terrible this is I mean that's something to consider this is something to think about where the fuck we're gonna get our water from desalination plants maybe drain out that fucking goofy ocean tire those fish sucking up all the good water what's happening with the fish all dead off over there too everywhere what's going on that's a lot of times is deal a side effect of pollution too or it could be a side effect of certain types of like fish need a certain oxygen level and things can happen and they develop dead zones in the water and there's no oxygen and all the fish just drowned you've seen that on yeah yeah Julian some of them the hundreds of thousands here there we looked all over the world it seems like there's problems but it could be just you know whatever I don't know well I think it's always happened but it happens certainly because of pollution as well I believe absolution is bad we don't need to say oh look yeah it's okay because it's only this amount or we get we got a we got a can we are containing it see this the containment system so what do they do with that stuff stuff in the ground waiting for Godzilla to come what is that all about we're gonna collect this garbage and then plant it in the ground over here well that's what a little kid does you know when you sweeping up he just it's a cartoon you pick up the carpet and you sweep it under the carpet and you plot that carpet down with no shit you know yeah it's very childish way but it's also the people that were alive that implemented these systems I mean they're not alive anymore and they were the when they were our age it was a completely different era and then when you go back to look at their you know the distance between us in the 1940s go back and look at the the 1940s and the distance between them and the same amount of time and you're in the 1800s okay you're in the like the times where he were riding horses and they had to paint their pictures that's that's how much distance has traveled I mean we really if you go back to 1940 and you look at those guys that are running the space program or look those guys are involved a nuclear program well how old were they in their 40s let's say they're in their 40s let's say that they were born in the year 1900 and they were designing and working on all these these crazy technological innovations from the time if you went back from them to as far as us looking at the 1940s you would be what 60 74 years is it go tonight so 74 years before that yes 74 years before that is 18 fucking 26 that is crazy they got a horse that stop and think about that there 1940 like world to us like when we consider the 1940 world is the early 1800s to them it's essentially two decades or two cents on the just that you know the the regular ratio mm-hmm and you start to consider that what you know the exponential type situation oh yeah their growth is uh you know defied as it goes on it continues to expand itself out no doubt I mean the growth and change between 1820 and 1940 was nothing compared to 1940 to 2010 I mean it's just this this is mad more then it look ahead and you say oh boy yeah I know it's gonna be really weird but it's just so strange that we are still running on the momentum of these people's ideas as far as like storage of nuclear weapon off storages nuclear waste reset yeah reset but that's nating no reason kids in I agree wholeheartedly but also as a person who's not involved in creating nuclear technology not involved in a that I find it fascinating just as an observer like looking at it all like wow this is really an interesting scenario because it was created by these incredible geniuses that lived as long ago as 1820 something to them I mean that is really hard to believe it's really hard to believe what's hard to believe is that we're still operating on that same mechanism to believe and it's it's hard to believe that we still have like garbage dumps we have like dumps like what I could have dumps we take all the garbage we throw it over there and then those dump lair I started fucking disasters we went to a garbage dump we film something for the man show what a garbage dump once it was what it was horrible it was horrible fucking disgust where do they dig a hole and dump the throw all the shit there and stay just keep digging holes it fucking stinks dude they just cover it up with dirt and it's disgusting doesn't like the fume the methane or whatever build-up if you put it under the ground that's a good question I don't know I don't know I mean methane comes from biological weight as long as that this guy took a rat a mouse and he made an art thing and he covered up the mouse with the with the resin right and then the mouse was is he's running through the resin apparently and tell it it couldn't go no further right he was like stuck in the resin the mouse was that's an art piece that's an asshole glued a mouse so it's inside of this thing now and then there were in the one day that was up on the it exploded that was like made out of a plastic glass stuff yeah and it exploded from the GAT that the mouse was off-gassing from inside of it and the mouse created so much gas it blew this whole thing up all over the place the guy told me whoa from the mouse being stuck in there the gas that it was off gassing as it died you know you know the smelly smell mm-hmm he said the house smelled like that - would you therefore that I forgot who was telling me no but somebody was in and they had to come and do the mop down on the house and everything but that seems like an unnecessary experiment you got to remember that next time you affect messing around some mice don't stick them in some plastic you know they don't do well well this plastics is they can make from plant material something a lot of people aren't aware of you can make plastic from hemp yeah yeah it's a biodegradable plastic you can make from hemp that's forgery right yeah yeah Ford made the first car the fenders are made out of hemp and you could hit it with a hammer hemp is a where's plan ever you know I'm not I know I sound like a hippie when I start talking great about marijuana but forget about marijuana the the psychoactive benefits of marijuana I've gone too in-depth I think there's there's a real benefit to people and I know I hear people saying oh you know kids and what about the kids what about kids what about the kids with fucking anything kids can die from aspirin kids can die if they have a contest to see who eats more salt kids can die doing a lot of fucking shit you know it's not about kids it's about responsible use of adults if it's your kid you have a obligation to educate your children do the best you can to protect them from the dangers of this world all drugs are a part of that including hundreds of legal ones that are available right now that can kill your children so that's not the issue marijuana is a minor minor minor issue when it comes to health and safety it's a major issue when it comes to consciousness and maybe even more so when it comes to the implementation of hemp as a commodity hemp for paper hemp for building materials hemp for automobile panels that are lighter and more durable Henry Ford figured that shit out at the turn of the 19th or the 20th century I mean he was doing that in the early 1900s this guy had figured that out we see the the pants they make out of it shirts and everything and they're durable they're way more durable than cotton and now that also has one of the best root systems so they they what they need to do what would it be good idea to do is where you have these erosion problems if they plant weed in there the the routing system happy obviously hemp yeah well to say we they think your hipping you wanna get high oh you know that's just you know you just get in your own safety of your house yeah this other stuff you could put outside and let it grow and well hemp is a very strange plant there's really no plant like it on earth and it's incredibly hard and dense but very light as well seeds they they make that omega-3 and omega-6 and well the protein to hemp protein is the most easily digestible protein salad add on it we sell heavy hemp protein supplement we bought the best hemp you can get it's really fine it's very high in protein it's the most expensive but it's the best and a lot of people don't like the taste I think it tastes delicious but I always fix it up with coconut water I just throw a banana coconut water and hemp force into a blender and that's how I am yeah you're off to the races it's are just easy the thing about like I like a different protein powders but I feel like the vegetable proteins I like pea protein there's a Vega that is a I think it's an all vegan based protein powder all plant-based protein powder I like to I like that I like those because they digest very easily you're getting the impact from yeah yeah I think it's it's also it's very easy on the body whereas I feel like whey protein which is also very effective but it's made from in a way which is made from milk products it's it doesn't doesn't quite digest as easily filled feel like makes my fart stink here to everybody knees II my body has no problem digesting it you know and it's illegal to grow in America unbelievable so stupid when I was a kid I said my mommy said my mom hey what is wrong with this stuff and she said oh well it's illegal and that was the best thing I could come up with that's not even well that doesn't even work with hemp because hemp can't get you high yeah it's the point I was worried about the other growing but growing hemp is like growing pine trees was like what if someone came along and said he can track all pine trees no more pine trees you can't make pine tables you can't make pine bed stands you know no more pine you Billy what are you talking about I can't grow pine or roses listen crazy grow a rosebush kind of stuff out but the the preposterous nests of pine is a good one because it's so readily available well if marijuana was legal it could be as readily available as pine trees the shit grows everywhere if fuckin grows everywhere and for the past hundred years almost there's been this ridiculous boycott on this magical plant it's a magical plant if it didn't exist and someone told you about it from another planet we would be sending spaceships out to get it if there was if we found that there was pot growing on the moon and they found that if the astronauts went to the moon and they came back with a plant and over the next decade they analyzed this plant and found it to have a million different uses psychoactive ly medically to treat PTSD inter ocular pressure from fucking glaucoma to give people their appetite back or they're going through chemo but you go through a laundry list of benefits of this fucking alien plant had they do that fucking what's that virgin guy Richard Branson he's be scented space ships out to the moon with farmers they'd have Mexicans in space flying to the moon to harvest the marijuana and bring it back home that's where we got it here yeah we got it here and these cunts are trying to keep it illegal it's amazing dummies like that chris christie dummy i don't understand it well i understand I don't dummies they write they rail against it they rail they rallied scream that's why corporate guys that what we need to do is have them on the right side so you need to get high they need to just chill down and say listen hey okay we're gonna do it we can do to make things better yes and get on board and then people say hey and the best ways for you to get high you better grab them yeah sell that stuff don't grab a cat say listen we use it in our product now we use this stuff because we found it's better than what we used to use well I think there's a lot of things that could be done to make people overall just overall in this country just a wee bit healthier just a little bit of a change in the dial in the direction that we're all going like remember Anthony Robbins who although I've made fun of inspirational guys I think is actually a very inspirational guy I think Anthony Robbins has some really good advice and I've read a bunch of different things that he said and back when I was competing in my martial arts days I actually benefited very much from a lot of his he had audiobooks I listened to by the pool when I listened lived in a shitty apartment and one of the things he said was that if he would take any consideration like two cars that are going in a certain direction if one of them just has a very slight variation off the line just a slight over the course of time the distance that it goes from the original direction that was going to is vast just a small change just a small adjustment and I think that could be said not just of cars that are driving parallel to each other but of a culture and I think that if something like the tank came along and the tank in conjunction with this newfound refusal to accept the marijuana laws there's a newfound refusal and now Colorado there was a an article that was written that came out today that I think it came out today I found out about it today i retweeted it today from reset me which is our friend amber Lyons website and essentially it's it's talking about how Colorado has made more money and had less crime and taxes to six months read about the school yeah the given point nine million or something for the school system the woman who wrote it her name is Laura Pegram and yeah it came out on the 27th so the school yeah can you imagine that they're doing something on the planet that's putting money into schools and if you have a problem with this and it's empowering people start their own business the right people people who are into wheat they're gonna start their own businesses and get rich that'll be a weird thing when weed farmers are like a bunch of rich people running around funding schools weed farmers are paying for the police to have better facilities weed farmers are paying for the fire department to be better equipped weed farmers are paying for the teachers to make more money like this is all it's not just a pipe dream very with the community and the officials in the community to create a situation these guys could be major influences on the entire not only this part right in the podcast people that are listening who are not into we look that's it that's it I'm fuckin hanging up indoctrination even if you don't want to smoke weed how could you ever say that a hundred million dollars in cash revenue 100 million dollars is not a great thing that you get that kind of taxes from your first year and who knows where this is gonna go could easily double by the second year so then you got two hundred million dollars in tax revenue oh my goodness and they focus where it went how much of the tax that you paid last month went to the school system who knows how much did the school get to Colorado care about it Joe's not that big no I mean it's it's it's big but it's not like the amount of people as California right not even close so you spread that money out yes if you gotta there's 800 kids and they made a thousand dollars or whatever do you know how much money marijuana would make in California if they just sent it loose just set it loose just Unleashed it fully legal let's go I mean just the the medical industry here is so gigantic that there's businesses where doctors just give people weed prescriptions it's all they do it's all they do they have a line of people with headaches out there that's their business everybody's paying 40 bucks and they're keeping it moving and that's legal I mean it's what they've done legally is crazy if they made it fully legal if they just said release the hounds it would change the culture it really would and it would it would help a lot of people would help a lot of people that are resisting it it would help a lot of athletes and the big one that would help a lot of athletes is edible edible marijuana for inflammation for injuries for relaxation for stretching just for your body just forget about the you know psychoactive effects of introspection and you know self analysis and all that other stuff that comes with the eating it the really the there's a physical benefit so it would be pretty substantial nutritional benefits mm-hmm there's the nutritive you already talked about that you can eat it it's really good super healthy great for your skin hemp oil is good for your skin you cook with it it's crazy it's just yeah you run a car on it you could run a car to the oil the whole thing is so ridiculous that if you looked at it on paper and it wasn't the case hey we have this stuff we just figured it out today it's called slippery whatever and we have it well it'd be the great it would be a great plot for a book if there was a company that somehow another managed to plot against one of the most beneficial plants on earth and suppress the development and use of it for almost a century if that if that was a book you would like be like captivated by this plot like could this happen because it's possible the one of the most beneficial plants ever known to man could be stifled they might have known about it in the beginning and then cut it off like say uh-oh this stuff could catch on III think that what happens is one of the things that happens is when anything is illegal and then you start arresting people for that thing you make a business and I'm arresting people for that thing you make a business out of that thing being illegal and then like we were talking about before when those guys are out of a job like they're just out of a job so they'll fight to keep their fucking job and one of the best ways to keep your jobs keep more things illegal right if you're a guy who arrests people for shit you want to make sure that more things like marijuana stay illegal because especially the DEA what would they could do if marijuana became legal and then people would start have to have to start considering all sorts of other drugs becoming legal as well maybe they could figure out how to direct like the uh you know the business aspects of it just to take this money now and we'll have a agency let's say that works directly with these people that then you know maybe then they could have a place in in being helpful you know yeah I mean obviously folks we're not this is not something that we thought on in advance we're trying to work this shit out on the fly yeah it's not the best way to design a government but it might be better than what's already in place you know what's already in place is just fucking silly you can't tell people they can't have weed stop it you can't you can't tell it's not very nice to devolve yourself in other people's business like that they're not involved in yours especially if you're ignorant you know I uh when I was first starting to work for the UFC I would often encounter these articles that were written that were critical of mixed martial arts and I could tell by reading the article that the person who was writing it had no idea what they were talking about they didn't understand the sport like from a fundamental level they were incorrect about the rules they were incorrect about what was allowed they were incorrect about the size of the participants that there were one size against all you know they didn't know they were they were acting on really old information really bad information but yet here they are writing for some having an opinion well in writing it in a published form where they spreading it out to the world that's what they're doing when it comes to slicing appreciation it's like having a guy do a wine a wine review this never had any wine yeah well I'll do you one better anybody that is trying to get anything like marijuana or mushrooms or any of these things removed from the culture and has no experience in them whatsoever is like a guy who's never had sex trying to make sex illegal it's mean it's quele it's insane it's nothing saying than anybody allows it if someone who has never had sex before tried to make sex illegal to all of us that enjoy sex you'd be like are you crazy it's like one of my favorite things like why would you cut the sex out because I don't get sex so you don't get sex I don't like it I don't appreciate it it rots your brain it weakens your knees and someone could just somehow or another trick people and it not having sex obviously sex is a natural urge marijuana is something that you learn about but they're both beneficial and enjoyable aspects of this beautiful thing called life and for whatever fucking reason we've allowed these dummies that are obviously like you look at a guy like Newt Gingrich dude you don't you know you don't get to tell me anything you don't get to tell me what to do or how to live at all you don't get to I don't believe in you you know I think you're a corporate puppet and you don't get to tell me that pots bad finally Chris Christie you're 300 pounds you don't get to give advice you don't get to give advice Oh marijuana rots the brain in this what about your fucking brain that's allowed you to balloon up like another animal you don't even look like a human you look like some sloth some some walrus type creature that's waddled out of the ocean and put on big pants you're a ridiculous person you can't talk about marijuana you don't experience it if you don't experience it on a regular basis you don't know what the fuck you're talking about and that's the problem that we have in our culture we have these people that are giving advice on something that they have no exploring other countries we're over mixed-up in other civilization these people they are operating for thousands or hundreds or whatever it is exactly and we're gonna come over there said hey here we are now we're gonna tell you guys what we need humility from people that are leading that's a very important thing so when someone takes a big strong stance on something that they don't have experience with or they don't have full knowledge of like to see was talking about some study that they've come out with it marijuana affects the brain yeah it affects the brain but they don't know what if it's good or bad did you read that part of it they don't understand what the effects are what the negative effects are but here's other than short-term memory loss no one's demonstrated anything really bad but a lot of positive shit too more shrinkage all sorts of medical benefits that do with deal with inflammation and relieving of pressure and for a lot of people it should Shermer you got so held up on your I hate that forget it it's over let it go short memory I like that I got some details there later they come up with me when I need them but it's just isn't a Kerry garbage Iran you're some father knows best shit is what it is I mean we're watching Leave It to Beaver we just watching a less less like ridiculous form of it more modern person incorrect moral value on you they've decided what is right what's wrong without having enough information to even have a valid effective what the gall of a man to say that another man should not be able to legally buy something as innocuous as marijuana is so enraging who the fuck are you can't smoke a joint somewhere by yourself especially a person who placate themselves obviously you're not you you're not some militant fucking like the the Gunny and full-metal-jacket mean placate I don't know that word oh well plate what's the best way to describe placate like to make someone believe in acid pretend like you're that way no no to try to here I'll give you a perk to make someone less angry I think it's based on Placid oh ok - try to calm me down right right right right right sorry I lost my train of thought no no I'm sorry I have a limited vocabulary in certain areas but you don't though you you have a very high technological vocabulary I like to ask questions so now I have that word in my repertoire as well so placate placate the masses you know that expression you've heard that expression a common acid I think I've heard the word yet never really understood what was I saying now what was I saying about the people and no oh that he placates his body he can't he obviously he gives in to his urges in order to you mean he's in order to be that big you have to be indulgent I mean there's no way so he's got issues so anybody that's got like some obvious issue like that like man you're not allowed to dictate health and and and in like consumption power behavior yeah yours is poor yeah it's ridiculous control on yourself it's also against the current data like there's there's there's no like real consensus that shows any sort of significant dangers involved in the consumption of that plant certainly not like some of these other ones that have how many dead this year from but you know what those other ones are fine too I don't have a problem neither being around but after part you up there you get crazy with it you you know you're you're you're your own architect you know a lot of people die every year from aspirin aspirin kills people you know nobody wants to think about that but people can die from a lot of dumb shit that doesn't make any sense it's available everywhere it's not our issue is education and honesty and if you're not honest about something as innocuous as marijuana then why am I going to trust you about anything else like what we're where's the dangerous shit no oh you were keeping that legal because it's always been legal well I'm not saying you should make that illegal but you got to let the less dangerous shit into yeah this is and what if the less dangerous shit changes the way people look at everything including the dangerous shit right and that's that's a real possibility that psychedelics offer to a lot of people that are addicted to diseases a lot of people that have PTSD they're addicted to diseases have extreme benefits from psychedelics it's legal crash you know see that's like I told you in the beginning that's what my mommy said all right so what does that mean yeah I don't even understand what I'm ranting too much I just get upset and I apologize anybody's heard this before but I can't help it at certain point I'm just it it hits me and I'm so confused by it I feel like I need to repeat it because it's so it's such it's the worst part of where we're at it's a bottleneck it's one of the worst parts is this lack of understanding about what should and shouldn't be happening to us whether it's our government committing to Wars or whether it's the people's emails being spied upon or whether it's people being forced to not consume certain things that would offer different perspectives or people being morality yeah people people telling you what you can and can't do that's not hurting anybody else and I think one of the things that I'm attracted to is altering the the current way that I think and altering the current way that other people think and again giving you a perspective of of the paths that we just get on we get stuck in these fucking grooves and it's so easy to keep making those same turns over and over again whenever you hit these very similar moments in your life and that's where something like the the isolation tank is so good it's so good to just get out of that groove I can't you know I think you know like a log is even when I you and everything like that you know I I think I would know if I just gotten back from Costa Rica or somewhere I wanted I thought you know this is never gonna happen it says people are never gonna get with this and then because it was just you kept trying and now but now it seems as if these people in general have gotten up to a place where they're more willing to experience themselves and then make action on that yeah I think I think where people are waking up with a lot of things I mean think what you were talking about earlier about Pilates and yoga I think people are just waking up about their body people are really concerned about where their food is coming from now this is something that hadn't really existed decades ago no one was concerned about organics or you know when one was current concerned about GMOs product in general this is affected I don't and I'm not necessarily saying that GMOs were all bad because I don't think they are I think there's definitely some benefits to some genetically modified organisms but I think it's important that we have the conversations that people who are really intelligent start dedicating time and effort to researching jeff's and its pros and cons and then relaying that information back to the people relaying it back to the public so we know what we're in for but then money gets involved in those things and that's what people are concerned about and that's the outcome and then what you see you don't even know if it was the yeah but it also snaps people back and makes them more involved in growing their own food and more interested in organic gardens and you've seen a lot of farmers markets that are popping up left and right I think farmers markets are amazing you go there you get a direct connection with the guy who actually grows the food this is the woman who actually milks these cows this is the guy that actually picks this celery he's right there this is their their special tomatoes they have heirloom tomatoes you get to meet these people you know I think that is that that sort of connection is exciting to people and that's the blowback away from a lot of the other stuff but it's all because we're getting this information we're good and we're we're able to make decisions kind of appealing yeah maybe years ago you really don't want to meet the farmer you don't know carrots tomato came from yeah now it's kind of like more interesting to understand you know the the orientation you know how it's happening or you know what's going on people are more like this spray on them they're out up then like I said if you know people back there just stuff just happened and they really weren't you know I don't know if they were certain they were just caught up in whatever was going stuff it's cuz they didn't have a way of communicating about it like we have to the Internet really someone yeah someone could put up a blog about here's the dangers of this particular pesticide on your tomatoes and then you hear about that and you go wow that that is not good and that's real the pesticides kill bugs monitor kill bugs cuz they're fuckin poison why why those plants not getting poisoned well they are but just not enough to kill him they figured out a way to make a puppet one day and I'm in there and a guy was in there spraying the stuff you know I said don't my say hey wisss conventional grown or organically grown what what what does that mean he goes well he goes uh I guess if it's organic it's done without poison and I said huh alright so the conventional means is that a poisonous substance in order to okay let's find out about that because I've always wanted to know what is the official description what is the official definition of organic please say I got this from the clean food and I thought I he doesn't seem to be a scientist but that seems to make a lot of sense let's look into Wikipedia this is organic foods are produced using methods of organic farming currently requires countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders the context of these regulations organic food is food produced in a way that complies with Organic Standards they keep saying nothing here what's organic do we go back called organic again while the organic standard is defined differently in different jurisdictions oh okay in general organic farming responds to site-specific farming and crop conditions by integrating cultural biological and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources promote ecological balance and concern biodiversity I didn't know that okay synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers are not allowed although certain organically approved pesticides may be used under limited conditions in general organic foods are not processed use irradiation industrial solvents or chemical food additives I didn't know the first part though I didn't know it was defined by cycling the conditions cycling of resources that's what they need to do no shame yeah yeah the nutrients mm-hmm in the soil there yeah that's that's one of the most difficult things about rotation I guess is a crop rotation and also you know when you have enormous chunks of land that are just dedicated entirely to corn or entirely to this or entire to that you know a lot of times those farm lands become minerally deficient and they have to actually add minerals to the ground in order to I think they would use in the old days like they would use like fish and stuff like that to try to replenish their garden fish is apparently really good for that but uh yeah the the idea that that's a weird thing to want something to be organic gonna you got to ask for that it's like how did you allow people to pour poison on food how did you allow people to grow I mean isn't there another way to deal with those bugs can you like hire someone to clean the bugs off and you have to fucking spray death from the sky it sounds ridiculous like my my version of it sounds ridiculous birds and animals do birds eat all the corn too though don't they I don't know animals well you know I was watching some show the other day on the History Channel it was actually about history which is hilarious because you watch the fucking History Channel was the last time you saw some shit about history all right never it's always like alligator farmers or something fucked up but it was about locusts it was all about the early 1800s and these people were like traveling across the United States setting up farms and stuff and the locusts hit these people's farms and they had to send in the army to bring these people food I mean these these grasshoppers these locusts were just they filled the sky for hours like for hours and hours they filled the sky and just flew by and just destroyed everything just tore through people's crops and they were talking about how big it must have been the millions and millions of bugs that must have been in the air yeah they've been saying for the corn though they went straight for crops they just buzzed through and killed everything they said you would see it as a storm coming at you and then as you look down or looked up rather you would realize somewhere along the line that that wasn't a cloud that was a storm hola pull up video of locusts pull up some locust video from the you know you got a clicky sound when it's flying I don't know I never been around locust I've been around grasshoppers apparently they're in the grasshopper fan yeah versus locust shells that's disgusting you just like go outside you and just see this empty shell of what looks exactly like a locust oh yeah just the outside of those things but if you've um if you've ever heard of like biblical predictions la kiss wasn't involved in biblical predictions of a caliph to conditions you know they always talked about locust locust taking the sky yeah like when you think about like old horror movies you know like the demonic possession things a plague of locusts hit Egypt this weekend causing some citizens to burn tires in an attempt to ward them off that's when you know shit gets ugly burn tires burn tires swarm of locusts were spotted in several districts of Cairo on Saturday as they invaded the Giza area of the Middle Eastern nation oh let's see this shit I can't wait it's like a previous from moving what is it Star Wars bitch thirty million in sex once upon a time in a galaxy far far away let's see this shit I want to see them invade I don't see shit there they are that's it oh they're coming it's not gonna be pretty this is not good film this is terrible I guess we're not seeing it in good HD that's what it is we're seeing in this shitty YouTube thing via our television but yeah Wow Wow that's a lot of goddamn bugs there's the noise too whoa that's so weird they're like the ultimate gang and they fly in this huge formation and just caused massive destruction and apparently they've done it you know since the beginning of time occasionally get together that's one of the things that one of the signs gay people have been fucking each other whoa look at that this isn't the congos I would have said whoa look at that oh my god people are freaking the fuck up bitch shut your mouth Jesus Christ how old's that kid she's over eight total shut her hole oh [Music] my god this kid with the ears shut this kid down you know what I might be screaming like a bitch all right I'll be right there with the kid on a motorcycle just trying to get home here just like splat spots and this said the Congo this is in the Congo so many of them this mommy's not helping you dude what's she gonna do goddamn storm you should be so psyched that people invented cars that's how you should feel right now you'd be like people are awesome what are the cars we invented to protect us from locusts that's you should be thinking should be like oh that's amazing thank God the invested pesticides to sprayed to the sky and knocked those fuckers dead can they um do anything when when locusts come do you think can they like throw Nets up or anything we're yeah what is it how do they stop locusts you know you do you get like a windmill with like a very large paddle and you just put in the center of the town just swatter just smack them right in the face as they come in just kill them all eventually put a pretty sheet down below so when you chop them up that's a good protein powder there it's very good for your kiss protein powder a lot of people eat bugs in other parts of the other parts of the world where they have to and the tasty little pissed yeah crunchy you know of you actually eat them Wow know that what are you saying crash thick doggone rock candies yeah I never got a cha cha grasshoppers really Jade them no I'd never tried it but they you sell that shit at Urban Outfitters actually Urban Outfitters sells locusts yeah they sell like these weird bugs that you just get chocolate there I've had chocolate ants shattered pillars the the thing about chocolate answers you know they're actually good for you like ants are actually good for you like if as long as you're not poison ants when you're eating ants actually a good source of protein so it was a good source of protein covered in chocolate you kind of feel like man I'm not really eating candy are you still eating candy I think we put the windmill up after they hit the the cornfield then after all full of corn then we then we make them into the powder and then they have more nutritional value well I think even if you put the windmill up you'd only kill the ones that are near the windmill the ones underneath the windmill that are like your height in my height its they fly like an inch off the ground those fuckers like they're everywhere kamikazes yeah there's so many of them there's no room they can't all just be in the sky does that happen how do they all get born that's a good question I think they fuck this all of those at one time it's like I do it's another clusterfuck the biblical clusterfuck yeah wow we're lucky we're very lucky especially here in California we don't even have mosquitoes dude you know I thought about that when I was up in Canada we have to they have a thing called thermos L you ever heard of a thermos L it's weird it's like got a compartment in it that you put like a chemical and then you turn these suckers on and then you put it down and this like mist comes out and you can't smell it at all but the mosquitoes avoid you like the plague so we would sit down outside in the woods and it was really mosquito ridden like immediately the mosquitos come near and you're like holy shit I don't think I could do this like this is rough I think were all of you you put this thermos elf thing down boom 10 minutes later they're gone before that I got like a mask on ski mask and a hat I got fucking gloves on I'm like cheese and they're trying to bite me through my glove like you fuckers they're everywhere this is the thermos I'll you keep it on for 10 minutes there's no mosquitoes boom no it sucks is those I don't know if they haven't been in Los Angeles is the Japanese beetles that in the Midwest we used to get so many Japanese beetles that would have to have these bags that you put in your front and back yard where the beetles will come in and get collected in there you know just like every week you just have this humongous bag of just sweaty bugs we're trapping right now yeah it's like a butyl uh hotel yeah it's like a beetle trap just wines and beetles Wow I saw some video the other day of another thing we don't have to deal with there was a hailstorm somewhere that it fucked this guy's car up this guy's entire car was like covered in like dents like everywhere as if it had like a really bad case of chickenpox and scraped off all of its scabs like the whole car was just popped in windows are broken the list the hail was so big it shattered the windshield was one of those hits you in the head father's your dad many people died from hail over here more than Hill City lot 10 more than coconuts for real I don't know I know some people do they say they died from coconuts look how excited I got 150 people die every year from coconuts really yep okay how many people died for a year about hail how many would you say died before I left for California my house got the golf sized hail went in a hole Columbus area and everybody's car got ruined everybody's house was ruined people would moved to Columbus just to be insurance agents for like a year because everyone's house were fucked and so everyone got new cars like it was so weird that like the whole city almost got new cars at the same time oh my god there's a hail storm a hail stone in 1928 that weighed 1.5 pounds what is it how big is that it is 7 inches Wow it weighed 1.5 pounds and it came from the fucking sky it's believed to be the largest known in the u.s. at the time and they captured that bad boy huh seven inches oh okay there's another one that in 1970 that was one point six seven pounds so it was even bigger Jesus Christ a Labor Day thunderstorm costs 342 million dollars worth of insurance damage in Calgary oh he's out there looking for the bigger one yeah oh no sorry that was eight twelve ounces over there you know no no here's a bigger one you know somebody's running around in the there's this ice balls flying around the place every now and then you know I can calm it on Kansas had this one in 1992 two batches of severe thunderstorms for six hours Oh within six hours of his I dumped hailstones up to four and a half inches across this area including the city of Wichita surrounding counties of south-central Kansas and over ten thousand homes were damaged the hail left wheat fields and a near total loss property damage told 500 million dollars with crop damage at a hundred million people died though I can't find it I can't find imagine if you'd be the first dummy that died from hail stay in when that stuff they say nobody dies not okay fuckin you're fine you know stalk a wheat doesn't hurt that bad let's see hailstorm I tried to get hailstorm Fred the fatalities as many people die a year from hail twenty seven people died from tomato tornadoes and hail storms in the Midwest what's that says here nine hundred people a year what's how many say it's from the coconut again what'd you say 150 150 where does it say that 900 a year where does it say that it just came up how many people died from hail nine hundred a year it can be very dangerous thing okay any instances of death there's only one here that says they know of of in the United States 1939 in Lubbock Texas a farmer got caught in an open field and died from hail yeah death Fort Collins an infant lying in its mother's arms was killed by hail 1979 can you imagine that it doesn't seem like ya laughter you do Matt if you're caught an open field and it started coming down hard it kills your kid oh that's got to be there's not many people man I don't believe it's 902 years yeah this actually says the last known death was caused by hail and the US was in the year 2000 yeah that makes sense there was 900 total well you know what today people know so much about storms and if you live in an area where you might you know you live in some Kansas type area where they have hail storms on a regular basis we get it yeah look at the car is getting pummeled you know hurricanes are way scarier hurricanes are the most scary you ever showed this old house yeah I remember yeah Bob Vila and they still have that show on I watched some PBS this weekend and they were rebuilding the Jersey Shore and they were showing how I mean it's destroyed it's destroyed but so but they've had to do is go under all these houses and like lift them up all 10 feet so all the houses are going up 10 feet to make them taller make them tall so if the water comes in again they're okay right and they have to take these humongous like like like these like holes you know they look like telephone poles and if they'd like push them into the ground like 20 feet or something like I just know it made it such a pain in the ass and it's not gonna be they say Jersey Shore is probably gonna come back for another seven to ten years completely until it's back to normal that's incredible yeah I can't believe that they're gonna do that and make these poles and then just sit there and what if the water is I'm actually fucking sit in your house and the water comes up to the top of the pole yeah and you're like oh my God why did I build a house here again what am I crazy yeah I got the ocean under my now right I hoped I put the boat on the roof see the ocean like slowly coming up closer and closer to the bottom of your house oh you just got 20 feet why would you go over that's 20 feet you have to get all the way up there and the shit would be swaying the breeze you'd have to dig deeper holes for the columns you'd have to worry about me I don't know how strong the ground is there we had a house in Hawaii it was on poles it was a race to beat you got washed away in 69 Wow houses the the waves came up so high is it between pipeline and why maybe they live in sunset there was a there's three houses there on poles because they had been washed up on the cam highway when they brought him back down they put him up on these poles and we lived in one of them wow that's pretty cool but there's waves never came up that high I mean I think they're only counting on tsunamis and shit I think that's what that pole thing yeah but a tsunami the thing is if the water comes in it's not coming in by itself okay did you ever watch the tsunami that hit in Japan yes it's bringing in boats and houses your house is gonna get hit by a boat yeah you don't want that to happen man we want to get out of there just fucking count on that ten-foot pole that's fuckin yeah there's people that stayed in you know many storms I remember Gloria when I was a kid when I was a kid and I lived in Boston is when a hurricane Gloria hit I want to say boy if I had to guess I'd have to say I was in high school so say was in the 80s it but uh it was a huge one and it hit way to fuck up the East Coast and it put knocked the power out in a lot of places okay doo doo doo doo doo it was 1985 so it was when I was in high school and I was graduating that wasn't like my senior year of high school was 85 and that's when this fucker hit and it hit the first major storm to affect New York and Long Island directly since Hurricane Donna in 1960 so people went a long time they went 25 years when they hadn't had a hurricane hit him and this motherfucker came down and wiped out everything and power was out and I lived in Boston which is pretty far away from the epicenter of the storm but I remember it being utterly humbling I remember we were in my house we were looking out the window and the trees were just fucking like they were like like leaves they were blowing back and forth like they were just leaves like there was no weight to them and he would you would go out afterwards and just trees would be falling everywhere just collapsed over streets collapsed on houses collapsed on cars just broke trees everywhere and just the feeling like whoa like you know I had been in storms before I'd been thunderstorms before I'd been in snow storms before but there was something about a hurricane and even a hurricane that you know I was way away from the center I lived in Boston I lived in Newton Massachusetts actually so that was like you know a suburb of Boston like man we didn't you know we didn't always yeah just the residual off incredible I mean it was I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be in one of those Katrina ones the ocean is so powerful that that water you know when I was out there I started learning out surf to about the same time near-death I don't know how many time you hit by one of these waves ya know that the water possesses so much power you know you you really have to have a respect for it you know once it gets riled up like that coming at ya there's not a whole lot gonna be done to slow it down I don't think well I think we're basing our ideas about what the atmosphere is like like what the weather's like what the you know the safety of being around volcanoes the safety of being around the ocean we're basing it on the few hundred years of people have been paying attention and taking notes you know how many people have been here before that the Native Americans only really what happened to them yeah well that was us most of it but it was a tsunami area but there was certainly people that died in that way as well you know we just didn't hear about it I mean they had to be people if people have lived in North America for the past you know X amount of thousands of years like they have evidence that goes way back to ten thousand years ago of people living in North America so if that's the case for sure or something during that time like there had have been a bunch of events a bunch of things happening we just we're not aware so when something like Katrina comes or something like Gloria comes when I was in high school like you you go where is this part this this can happen to like this can fuckin happen like shouldn't we be preparing for this how often is this happen well the last time it happens 1960s I just relaxed okay but it can happen right this can happen you should prepare for this now that you know that this can happen there should be no houses that are built from here on out they can't deal with this because it might not happen but it could fuckin happen it has happened it you've got two of them on record you one from 1960 you got one from 1985 what the fuck do I have to tell you we're waited for that these bitches are happening they're coming let's get ready you don't know what could happen you get three of them in a year like the ones that existed before people measured things they still existed the giant fucking storms had killed people before meteorologists were invented we're still valid and this idea that we're basing it off on this tiny little window that we've been alive you know I'm fucking I've been in LA since 94 I haven't seen a single fucking significant earthquake does not worry if everybody's a pussy are you crazy this fucking thing's on a piece of moving ground it's just you don't live long enough for it to move that much because the the perspective it's kind of high you're looking at in terms of a human life perspective you got to look at in the fractal sense there's no guarantees yeah this years is nothing it could be right now it's time to be up was just think about what we were talking about before the difference between us and the people in the 1940s the difference between the people in 1940's and the difference between them and the people in the 1820s add all that stuff up together look at it and just go back a few times like that a few generations like that and that's what we have that's the amount of information we have it in not that time in those time periods we have a bunch of them we have the earthquake and fire in San Francisco we have floods we have Hurricane Katrina we have Gloria we have the the most recent ones the the tornadoes that that one that fucking town in what was that town that Joplin Mississippi like almost completely wiped off the map I believe it was Joplin I should probably say rear Mississippi Missouri yeah you're right you're right you're right Joplin Missouri my favorite places are you really hang out in Joplin all the tornado they joking joking bro yeah 2011 in Joplin a tornado struck Joplin Missouri it was a large a larger late-may tornado outbreak and it reached a maximum with ready for this of one mile a width of a mile a tornado that's a mile no no no no no no no that's the devastation path Oh mile wide when it comes through the terror 5 it isn't I don't know I don't know what that means no it means death yeah it reached a maximum width of nearly 1 mile during its path through the southern part of the city it rapidly intensified and tracked eastward through across the city and then continued eastward across interstate 44 into rural sections of Jasper County and Newton County it was the 3rd tornado to strike Joplin since May of 1971 the tornado killed 158 people with the additional four indirect deaths injured some 1,150 others and caused damages amounting to 2.8 billion dollars it was the deadliest tornado to strike the United States since the 1947 tornadoes whoa since the turn in 47 there was a multiple yeah sure the glacier higgins Woodward tornadoes in 1947 yeah and these they traveled 125 miles from Texas to Oklahoma destroying everything in its path because it was originally thought to have left a two hundred twenty mile path but it's now believed have been a part of a family of eight or nine tornadoes a fuckin family of tornadoes these tornadoes although deadly did not match the astounding death toll of the earlier event nor did they match the record speed of that tornado or the although at over 40 miles per hour they qualified as a fast-tracking storm Wow dude could you fucking imagine looking out your window and seeing nine tornadoes coming at you and just thinking about all the times you jerked off and what the Bible told you and you're like thinking it was you you know if you lived in 1947 there locust are coming on top of it they know it's over if you were in Texas and it was 1947 you could convince yourself those tornadoes were coming for you because you jerked off if you were 16 if you were some kid who's just resisting Church so bad but you couldn't you couldn't stop beating off and still go to church you dad would scream at you and you're in there beating off and you look out the window and you see 9:20 and you're fucking convinced it was you convinced it was you that killed everybody fire and brimstone Brian Redman masturbating the devil has sent his henchmen to take you out of the path and out of the path of righteousness and you have to become a priest because everyone in the town died cuz you you and you're beating off you fuck family a tornado's yeah that's a terrifying idea there's a lot of heavy vibes on that man you know you're behind a mile-wide tornado what the hell man I know them that little patch I wonder if I could score NATO's I'm wondering I'm correct saying the mile of destruction because it sounded so much better than just the actual width of the storm it's so happy we don't have to deal with tornadoes man that shit was I saw one the other duck I saw one the other day where I saw a tornado of leaves oh yeah out of nowhere yeah that's true weirdest shit ever I mean it wasn't tornado The Kills obviously I was driving and I stopped my car to watch it yeah crazy you ever gone through like the desert like like like driving like Vegas or something you'll just see on the side of red like a a sand tornado you're like what the fuck is that is that gonna hurt me Yeah right like um they can get them I mean they have gotten them in California before we look that up one day what is it anyway some sort of a weather condition something else and it starts to spinning I believe it's like cold weather mixing with warm water it's like cold France and warm warm weather there's just been just I don't know I don't know okay let's look it up this is like a cyclone - you're the cyclone learn today we're learning every day hopefully well I'm not gonna go along with that I'm it's more sexy black helicopters a tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a okay ready for this one whoa how do you say this q CU m UL o n i m bu s q come come you lon bus camel anima bus come cumin Kuya cumulonimbus cumulonimbus whom you lo Nimbus cloud or in rare cases a the base of a cumulus cloud and they are often cumulus they were often referred to as twisters or cyclones although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a wider sense to name any clothes low-pressure circulation tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes but they're typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel whose narrow end touches the earth and it's often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust have you ever seen the video from Dallas Texas from two years ago where semis were flying through the air surrounding a twister pull that up pull up semis flying through the air in Dallas twister it was the craziest shit I was watching on TV I was in Texas at the time - I was in another part of Texas and they oh wait a minute that's not sure now I was in Texas during another one but it wasn't this one the one where they had it on the news I think I was in another state but I could have been in Texas I was like I was on the road I was like I could've been in Texas right now I've been there for Texas anyway point being I'm watching the news and here it is this is exactly the footage and there's a Twitter twister this is on the fucking news and the guys talking and you see actual semi like tractor trailers flying through the fucking air like paper cups man like as you're seeing this this funnel spinning look at that see that oh those are tractor trailers man and look they get a we log in look at you see the things crackle see all the electrical fires because they were there removing them they're removing electrical cables and shit from the ground and shorting things out and eventually it picks up these tractor trailers and is they're flying through the fucking air is this the same video I believe it is ok there there's one flying through the fucking air look at that that's a tractor trailer bro it's flying what is that way what but it's gotta weigh a few thousand pounds well it depends if it's got anything in it - yeah but if it does even if it doesn't have anything in it well there's one yeah that's flying through the air and landing on shit boom it's throwing it through the air those are all like cargo boxes and tractor trailers it's great look at all those tractor trailers just jacked picked up and tossed and twist it around like like an aluminum foil amazing they landed near the highway it's fucking crazy other nature's uh that bitch doesn't play no it's on her terms yeah it is on our terms especially when we're fucking around light and shit on fire and sending rocket ships into space fucking with the air airplanes burning fuel and cars or burn fuel and add into the pollution yeah it's weird but even if we didn't even if we didn't add that even if we did in the places goddamn horrifying mess even if we didn't do a goddamn thing if we lived our lives completely eco-centric if we lived our lives with organic farming if we lived our lives in a completely harmonious way with nature we could still get smushed by a big Robert bass clobbers boom yeah not to say that we shouldn't be you know loving to our mother earth and we absolutely should absolutely 100% without a doubt no argument from me but it's possible for us to get fucked up by a supervolcano even if we did even if we did an ice age can come even if we did the best we could do well the dinosaurs are all died yeah with meteor no they were using their cell phones too much your my cell itself a fucking cell phone drew in Madrid they found old cell phones that dinosaurs used and we realized these were super fucking smart that cell phone data picture that guy on that line who's in the beginning of a movie and he was walking borrow the phone on his ear was a front of man's theatre what was that movie there was a lost clip they found off of an old movie Charlie Chaplin movie oh no no no yeah they had a he had a a eat that's what everyone thought I saw that guy walking yeah that's not what it was there was an invention that they had come up with for people that were hard of hearing before they had hearing aids and you hold it up to your ear and magnify the sound that's what it was and so to in a blurry image when you're looking at it you know yeah it's like a future guys on a cell phone well you know to this day people have ear problems and they they get hearing aids you see them a lot they stick out of their ear well back in those days they just held it up to their ear right right that was a sound yeah I just saw that sound amplifier yeah you wonder yeah if someone's gonna do time travel I don't think they would go to Charlie Chaplin days yeah already gonna hang around here and do that for could you imagine if we did find out that some dudes been fucking travelling back in time from the future and we get up to the future one day we meet him you're like wait a minute dick I've seen you before find out he's Jimi Hendrix he's fucking there's been a bunch of different people like he's just been going back in time and being a bad motherfucker but really just some guy from the future you never know you know there's no you do know that's ridiculous and I'm stoned I don't you never know I'm hoping Hendrix shows back up then I think listen it was already here I got a Hendrix shirt on man poster here that's a cat that left a uh you know something behind that he was awesome but he doesn't need to come back yeah now you got Gary Clark jr. and I'm not saying Gary Clark jr. is equivalent to Hendrix but I'm saying look there's always going to be honey honey there's always gonna be you know new bands that come out there's always gonna be like cool let's home sounds is the Black Keys there's always going to be you know there's always cool shit man it's always coming out I'm glad fuck yeah this is the best time ever I agree anybody doesn't think this is the best time ever on earth is silly you know taking advantage of the situation then yeah here's what we have we're here all this stuff to keep us happy and keep us occupied calculator watches you know cell phones tons of you know things that occupy our time and there are things that occupy our time in a negative way they can they can take your time away but they also give you the opportunity to do things it's up to you to decide what you do with your time exactly that's that thing again is it so they say oh it's bad to be selfish and I think oh it's not because if you're concerned with yourself and what you're up to you turn out to be a better product for the other people around you you said oh wow this guy's actually spend some time with himself yeah some fish is a weird word though because when I think it's selfish I think of like you know I read II like you know you know those movies where like people are trapped somewhere and it turns out one dudes been hogging all the food and lying about it yeah that's guys it's selfish fuck that's the way they present right yes you know I mean you hear about that guy you like it you dick or one guy like shuts the door you know like stop don't shut the door hmm that guy's selfish right that's a selfish person then you hear the people get killed by the monster all right and you find out that he shut the door you like you dick that's a selfish guy but there's also self-aware and self-awareness and concentrating on yourself and some people are uncomfortable with other people concentrating on themselves some people are uh they're uncomfortable with people that are like really into their bodies they're uncomfortable the people that are really into fitness are people that are really into health they get they get upset at them they don't like it it makes them feel bad we remember these to look at the label in the store and you look at these people in this in a shopping store and they're looking at the label and what are they these are words you don't even know what they mean and you know many years ago mm-hmm everybody's now looking at it high fructose corn syrup look at that time to change can't tell you how many times I've greedy intent say it I'm not gonna eat it you know I can't even read what this stuff is I'm not gonna put it in my mouth I mean you're kidding me you know and I started looking at recently and I never looked at before grams of sugar and drinks like grams of sugar in like like a sports drink one of those sports drinks type things it's crazy so it's like more sugar than you're supposed to have in a day well is it sugar even now this one's are from the beets and there's this stuff from the corn beet sugar you know they sure yeah it sounds good well you know it's good I think that they're supposed to have been modified or something I don't know chemtrails yeah tried not to get too upset by all this but try do you like it when you buy the sugar get the cane sugar organic cane is it yeah that's what the labels now that I understand that I don't really your body doesn't want sugar like that I mean you can have it in cookies and you can have it in cakes and you can have it in moderation and you'll be fine but your body doesn't want your body wants sugar that's attached to foods yeah there's a lot of yummy stuff that oranges didn't exist okay if they didn't exist and he had to go to some plays crazy exotic location to find an orange like a real good ripe Florida orange when those big plump ones but it's easy to peel and he bite in and that's fuckin like also delicious it would be an extreme luxury it's so much better than caviar it's just caviar is hard to get but caviar tastes like dog shit it's grow oh it's an acquired taste no one needs an acquired taste for Elijah's oranges are delicious oranges are you like caviar yeah I used to live with some Russian people and I got a you acquired the taste I did acquire the taste but it is I can appreciate the it's nothing wrong with it but my point is the owner why I am Ryan jizz right there perfect it's delicious it's very different I get it it's a sophisticated palate that recognizes recognizes the subtleties of our caviar caviar is from a very particular type of sturgeon yeah I can't even tell fit to create I mean if it's a black or the red or whatever is it it's all taste kind of like the same to me it's dog shit it's like wine nasty I never used to you know like I can't really tell the difference oh this is a taste like a wine you know I can taste good wine like wine it tastes good I just don't it's good Assam all yay that is a real job like someone who actually understands it while it the guys are really good at it they really is really is an art just weird it out and stuff they don't even swallow it otherwise they'd get fucked they could tell what it is by swirling and somehow in their mouth a yeah well that you still get drunk but you get drunk less quick than if you drink at all yeah you know it tastes good and your tongue some wiggle your yeah some of them a drink it though they just go old school and get that fucking horseman wells potbelly and keep rocking and keep hitting Sonoma hard every year fucking pound that that's an Ian Ayres wine I never gone to one of those those wine tasting points yes Ryan swear it's great it's fine I don't to be around a bunch of stinky drunks cultured wearing your fucking boat shoes get away from me dudes with those moccasins with the fucking those weird yellow shoelaces in their moccasins get out of your mouth oh you're doing and yeah exactly those weird things I know what you're doing do gigs down there at the Gainey winery Gainey want you heard of that gigs a band that you know it shows yeah it gained a winery they have gigs at a winery yeah yeah outside it was like a party we're running out of time so let's talk about your your tank Center and the new place that you guys are doing and what's the difference between what you're doing and what a lot of these commercial places that are using these home tanks we have there's a real problem with that right as far as like infections and far as safety and as far as like everything needs to be moved to a higher standard that's certainly our opinion of the situation you know we've been working with you know with NSF and the other state and local authorities then to get in tune with what's required as far as rules and regulations as far as testing the water and that's that's our certification we've been certified for that which I have a 3 log kill what they call which a 99.9 of all the microorganisms that are in fact they infect the water then they see how long it takes to eradicate this infection and obviously this is a big difference between someone who just has one that's only for them only for their own personal use which is like a lot of these more low-end ones and someone who is running a commercial business sort of like the difference in your home pool in swimming pool I always like to say you know it's like you know opening a restaurant with an easy-bake oven mm-hmm you know it isn't appropriate right for appropriate you see this is not up to us to decide anyway all that we've had to do is adhere to these standards and codes that have been set up by realistic people that understand and you've helped with these these setting up these standards outsole is a very important thing for you super important it's more important to us than anything else is this disinfection this ability to disinfect this water solution correctly between usages because we don't use chemicals and we're all tested you know to do this 3 log we actually did a seven log in a vessel the vessel itself generally contaminates the specimen but we have such a small body of water in such an intense system there of cleaning that they tested the material in the vessel and we've still got the three log and then surpassed that but that's within one cleaning cycle without in the use of chemicals the problem with chemicals now which is what everybody else has to do due to the fact that they don't willing to spend the money on the disinfection process which is this I told you about this UV lights like nine grand if seventy five hundred for the generators and so there's a lot of bread to get it right man you know in the electrical stuff CR ul listing as well underwriters laboratory this is electricity and people you're into a water and electricity you can't you know say scooter McGee said it's okay or shifty Williams over here Williams yeah who are these people and what it makes them unlucky and shifty fucking shift he's got as before you know and referred as a story but the the facts are the facts you need to go into a laboratory and evaluate the situation correctly we utilizing you know methods of their ethical not not you know you pouring this chemicals the chlorine and bromine and procs whatever it is you're pointing is a breaking down now this this is a material and then creating a byproduct this by-product then you know you're getting in there with it and you're sweating or pissing or spitting or whatever then you're mixing you with this you know the ammonia or nitrogen that's what a lot of people have an issue with when I talked to him about the tank they always say that like I'm gonna get in the water that someone else has been in the bank and we're they should have an issue with it there is an issue with it it is a you know if these things are not dealt with properly they're you know it's an infestation and as the popularity these things grows this is something we really need to consider because this is something that could become an issue for some folks and I know that you're very conscientious about this is very important to you and this is like one of the main focuses of conversation that we've had over the years is about this this need to make sure that everything is like at the same standards of the tanks that you have it's supported for the people that are doing this to have a product then that is credible that has been designed correctly that's had a lot of time and effort spent to to verify how it actually works of what it does you know and then does all the horror all the good and none of the harm right and that's all the potential harm are all checked out and no undocumented and and and in like I said this is new and ul stuff to the amount of you know adjustments that we've had to do with the electrical aspects of this thing are tremendous you know but it by the time we've been working with him what now four years with NSF to try to establish these guidelines then for you know effective purification yes for people then to do this because if you don't have it and people come away from it with a bad you know how long is it gonna last right the industry you know it needs to have guidelines and standards set up to adhere to then to become a credible you know industry well I commend the fact also that your your your immediate head-on before it becomes a big issue like there's not a lot of people that are reporting like infections and one a lot of people that have become sick because of it no but is if this industry continues to grow the potential instances of people not taking care of their water can rise and that could potentially damage their the reputation that you fought so hard to try to let people know about the positive benefits of this me I know you you've been working on this for a long time and it's catching on now right yeah it's you know it's it's it's been something I've been dedicated to with you know all of my everything I have you know it's been involved in trying to get this right because it's it's important you know that that this technology is not overlooked right now we need to get a whole you see if it if it's set up with these little Mickey Mouse second-rate rigs the authorities are not going to okay and they're not going to allow it we've already been but they allow it right now but now it's unregulated okay so it's going to eventually be ran out so that's what this right but I know but to people that are listening when is this all going to take place it's happening now we we have a task group that's been formed with both the Canadian Ministry of Health and several health and safety officials here in this country state wise local wise and NSF national sanitization foundation to set up these guidelines so they're realizing that this industry growing the inner steppin in absolutely absolutely we were at a a task group what was a thing called the we went to a thing and they had callers calling in it was the most asked about subject a topic that they had conversate about at this it was called a task what was the meeting call do you think that it's possible for you to make two different tanks to make a commercial fully sanitize unit and make a unit for the home that's less complex and more affordable we see we were thinking about that because naturally that would be a good business sense but we got back to the point again it's like in order to do it right this is what it costs I mean we could make it Mickey Mouse or whatever but is it Mickey Mouse for the consumer like say if it's just you a crash lives by himself crash loves to do the isolation tank you battled a jerk-off or pee in his tank or if I do I'll be in there with myself yeah I mean it's like yeah but if you're going into someplace and it's these people in those pits not you know right but it what's happening then what we were doing was trying to you know people they're cheap so there goes first of all people are broke two rows also fucking super expensive to buy ones atoms that's correct I know that the the equipment is really costly and it's really high-end but all I'm trying to say is with our last five minutes of time folks are into a pumpkin all I'm trying to say is is it possible that it's it could be made into a consumer unit yes it would be but back to the liability see in order to get this right and not harm anybody by this can you know different things it's it's it's not easy like how much more do you have to say about this stuff do you want to do another hour wanna shut this off and do another hour you know be cool to talk about this are you running out of gas I'm not running out of gas I don't run out of gas okay let's just wrap this up because this we're running that time yeah we'll wrap this up we'll be right back in about ten more minutes so I have nine minutes that's an extra fine man we'll wrap it up we'll wrap it up and come right back alright so thanks to on it comm go to onn I T use the code word Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements I just want to give us give you a chance to go into a lot of these issues that talked about before so we'll be right back with crash it probably won't be a full podcast but it'll probably be like 40 minutes that's what I recommend I recommend another 40 minutes I'll be right back [Music]
