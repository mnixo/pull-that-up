huggers like I know yeah I wish cuz I don't have any mean for the walk three two one fuck well live on the day of net neutrality we might not be broadcasting anymore hmm might be over I don't know how that works when does it kick in right away I don't know I have no idea by the way is there ever been like a harder time to be a citizen meaning like it's just how much I never had to pay this much attention I know right like come on it's like fuckin we have to babysit it's like they're children that we have to like wait what are they doing no like where they used to kind of be able to take care of themselves yeah or seemingly could there's not one place where you can go you can get one that before you yeah ii maniac bro i don't give up it's gonna explode all over there let that fucker rest though the worst ones are those little small ones that I have those Cayenne cleanses you shake those bitches they just fucking shoot up to the ceiling is that true you know it's all fermented carbonated you know yeah but there's no one source where you can absolutely get 100% unbiased factual information as the news everything is leaning one way or leaning another way and even CNN which I used to trust all the time they fuck up all the time they're always having to print retractions there was something that was going around today it's just there's not one news source where I can say please just give me the unbiased information with no left or right lean yeah I get that which is hot which we talked about beforehand when there's like even the idea of the New York Times what I what people don't understand it people don't understand journalism a lot of the time like literally when people go it's fake news it's like you know you can't print fake news because they you ever you ever have anything in The New Yorker you ever be quoted in New York article I they literally you talked to the journalist then two different fact checkers call you to confirm what you said and like it's this true right is that and I literally this is in an article about someone else that I gave a quote for and like did you say that did and you can confirm that and they do that they do that it made every major journalistic outfit they did the New York Times Washington Post that like named the big ones they all have they're not as stringent as the New York as The New Yorker because in here only comes out once a week mm-hmm but they all have fact checkers and they can get and the thing is these institutions can get sued right this is not a good example but it's it's an example the Conor McGregor fight mm-hmm New York Times wrote an article about the Conor McGregor fight I'm one of the things I said that he was covered in blood and rescued by the referee before he fell through the rooms I contacted them on Twitter and I said you in this day and age you can't say things that everyone knows are false look millions of people watched that fight there was no blood yeah he was not falling through the ropes referee rescued him he made that up he was outclassed and battered by a far superior boxer which is what most boxing people expected that's the real story yeah but you guys added a bunch of shit to it yeah so they might rotate it that's for sure yeah it's not just shading it's it's a straight lie I know it's not a because it's not really it doesn't it's not like a big moment time and the result is the same but their description of the result makes you wonder how much other things do you do this - how many other subjects do you flavor in this weird way what was their attraction because I remember sometimes never seeing you right there yeah it's cool like yeah and they they change it they even but they still use hyperbole even in their retraction they said his face was completely swollen it wasn't it wasn't a quadrant of his face a tiny amount a little bit of swelling from a boxing match not like not some crazy like fucking Hasim Rahman shit had an iron on his head literally the fun like maybe the craziest thing I've ever seen in a fight it was disgusting this huge hematoma growing out of his forehead he could find that yeah Hasim Rahman yeah Lennox Lewis right it wasn't Lennox it was fight you know I don't remember but yeah was like he literally had to go to dr. pimple pop you that Oh dr. pimple robber that's hilarious like that that was that was a wild yeah that was an enormous swelling in his head he looks like a war criminal and an alien yeah so if that you mean yeah they do they do Shade invariably but you shouldn't you shouldn't you should tell the exact store the exact story was really clear for everybody that watched the two million people plus that watched it on pay-per-view or more it wasn't something that you can get away with bullshitting about okay but do you thought of her album 5 years ago do you know a man like it wasn't like it wasn't a problem it wasn't a problem day-to-day and that's the thing that I was yelling at somebody yesterday of like the once peep once Fox News created this thing of like extremely shaded shit and people saw there's a market for it they're like alright we'll do that like wall do that now yeah and then everyone's everyone's reacting but they don't think they're reacting but and now the New York Times is trying to go the other way where they're they hired this guy Bret Stevens to write op-ed pieces and every week there's a new like what did you just say like you know yeah because they're trying to be like they're trying to be kind of moderate or to see both sides and a lot of people on the left are going like but that's how are you seeing both sides to like slavery like the fuck you talking about like what's both sides of climate change right it's all they're scientists and not scientists that's like those the side so why are you this is basically appeasement I guess as of the you know consumer this stuff it's when I was to get into this conversation I wasn't even talking about journalism I was talking about government I was talking about the amount of fucking work it takes just to be like - like I gotta worry about statutes and fucking the FCC and fucking executive orders and just like I never had to do all this yeah like why is this so much I don't know if it's I mean they would say like you know to be an act of democracy it's only as good as citizens and all that shit but but it seems like we're all more involved and it's worse you know I mean like it's like it's way more upsetting it's P constant upset like it feels like havoc every single day hmm well it's it's definitely not good and it's especially from the environmental side like whenever a president is short-sighted about the environment that scares the shit out of me because that has repercussions for generation upon generation yeah and he's doing it for short-term money-grabbing yeah like the EPA being essentially gutted what they're doing in Alaska whether they're making roads and and they're setting up mines near the salmon fisheries with their monument monuments yeah it's scary because it's just they're just chopping away just chopping away and the repercussions could be forever we have an amazing system here in this country in terms of like the amount of public land that we have and the the beautiful places where you can go and check out all it takes is one or two assholes that have a mine one at one or two assholes that allow drilling for oil in these places all they all they have to do is extract resources from these public places yeah and we're fucked and those places are ruined forever yeah not just for your kids but for your grandchildren for everybody yeah it's like I hope you like equipment because there's gonna be a lot of fucking equipment at these place yeah that's the thing that I that I'm curious about people devote of a trump-like is this what you wanted like I'm just laying water democrat I know I know I've ever feel I have a notion that they they didn't like they felt excluded yeah I like elitism and going to Dutchess and the Hamptons and all these places and like the Aspen ideas festival and TED Talks and although shit yeah so it's like hey fuck you but this is a which I get the notion of fuck you like but this is like dude you can't tell me that Obama stressed you out on this level like the the level of Trump stress that like it's just created in the culture that's what I was saying like it's havoc everyday yeah it's like a fucking melee but do you feel the stress every day D I mean you I do like there are days where I'm like I can't look at my phone I literally can't like a couple days ago I was looking at something and it was the it was maybe before that maybe two three days ago there are days where it's so it's so like like in the red for like cultural or political toxicity them just like Jesus yeah this doesn't this is like inducing cortisol I think that's a good argument also to stay the fuck away from the news and social media for a few days a week yeah there have been a few you see the people in past couple days that like Facebook execs being like we we've kind of torn society apart didn't mean to whoops yeah I saw that one Facebook exec was apologizing for what they've done they've essentially engineered people to be programmed yeah yeah I mean we've essentially engineered this thing or you're going to be addicted to it you're gonna be tuning into it constantly and the things that are going to attract you the most of the things that freak you the fuck out so that's going to take prominence yeah but that you know that's a there's a market market but yeah it's just it's a bad idea to have a popularity contest to see who controls the news it's a terrible idea and that's what we have and this is this is a real example of an old system that really shouldn't exist anymore I had an idea that a couple weeks ago it was like I got to run that by Joe as that like a jumping-off point for conversation robot president ooh do you know I mean yeah like logical super logical your logic stats no emotions no emotions takes all of history human is of the 2,000 recorded history 2000 years what do you know really 200 years but like and takes it all into account even takes literature into account mmm like plots right like take Shakespeare no account takes plots you know member the atha all that shit and then wouldn't that isn't that kind of what you want yeah like in that kind of what you want and even if if if they say if the robot president says I've come to this decision it was 5545 in favor because that's all like the older you get I'm not a hundred percent anything like even the idle I really love Louie's joke in his last special which merely didn't make any top-10 list for the year one of those weird things I listened to it on the plane back from Hawaii a couple weeks ago I'm great he's great yeah the last I watched it actually the last few bits were fucking killer just give that one about the fingering and the Magic Mike yeah yeah dammit that fucking made me laugh I mean this is months ago this before we knew anything about the guy I did it right after I knew about on the air of course but Louie did the thing about abortion that he open whether he's yeah if you they think they're killing babies right I'd be out every day if that's what I thought right I don't I just don't see it that way but it's the idea of like there's so many debates that people won't admit to any doubt about right like I'm at2020 for that abortion you know I wouldn't I would have one probably I've never never had the privilege I've never needed to get one but like I and I think if other people want to get one cool but I but at the same time I see would I see what your argument is yeah I see both sides yeah I think there's a certain time where it's a baby you know a certain I mean a certain amount of months in we're like okay you're killing a baby now yeah I don't know what it is mine is either but but I it's gotta be at some point tell you what it's not the first day when it's like two cells clinging together and they become four cells just get rid of themselves and that's a wrap but you would even admit like or maybe it is yeah I don't I personally don't I'm not a scientist I'm not a I'm not a obstetrician but yeah if we had like a soul meter in the room and like you woke up one day and your wife is pregnant and it's like 48 days in honey honey look at the soul meter there's a new soul like whoa yeah no turning back now now it's yes oh yeah for then it was just like a nesting area like they were ready it was a prepping area for a new soul you believe in that 48 days you're at one day there's no soul yeah if you if you had a meter right now if you had a way obviously this isn't a world with a robot president and the soul meter and this is also in a world where would they proven the existence of the soul which is just theory yeah but if you could if you had a like a thing in the room with you sort of like when you have a pregnancy test er mm-hmm like you check look at this it's registering it's real it's happening like a soul meter yeah like so you have a countdown okay it says I'm pregnant we have 47 days or we're pieces of shit yeah cuz once the soul comes in huh yeah then then we're murderers I guess something like that yeah for sure yeah but and there are people that believe it's day one which is like I can understand how you think that I don't I don't even not even I wouldn't even say I don't believe that I just don't know I just have no I don't have any feeling one way or the other if you interview don't interfere with the process from day one and it goes all the way through term you have a human yes so how can you make the argument that if you do interfere it's nothing yeah it seems like you're stopping a potential human some things something's happen right but it's the it's the the foolishness of going like I am absolutely yeah absolutely anything and just the reductionist idea of you know it being just a bundle of cells to that's sort of preposterous to like to know it's a bunch of cells that will be a human being so yes you can't just deny the potential I'm not saying that a bunch of cells it I don't think it's any different I mean I think if you can show me for sure that it's for sells I think it's a complete total non-issue it's when you get into three months you know two months in three months and you're like whoa okay what is this yeah what again baby you yeah - you - that's your barometer yeah but that's the thing I was saying is like there's no you're not allowed to have a nuanced Ryan anymore you just have you like no I am absolutely yeah you must believe all women do you see that thing I posted the other day about it was uh the me - backlash is gonna come no I didn't how's it gonna come what kind of backlash the backlash is the on the on-campus thing the basically like the Obama administration and Joe Biden recommended these guidelines for title nine and and they so they recommended these guidelines for title nine the basically protecting women on college campuses but the problem is they throw out due process like literally if a guy that the idea is if you're can if you get accused you're basically convicted right guy gets accused he's thrown out of school and it's like well that's not due process there were all these things that were like like I'd never thought about before like because I want to believe all you know and I mean like I I want to believe that if a woman I don't believe women have much reason to lie about the shit see well that's not true I don't believe that at all because I believe there's a lot of women that have grudges and they're angry and they want to make things up about man and I know men where that's happened to before I know men who've been falsely accused of rape and the woman dropped it and told the police that she was just mad at him yeah and she had a vendetta that happens it doesn't happen a lot right that's why don't I just think that it's a minor I think it's just that I know it's minor or not Anthony Kumi has said something that's really he goes he goes calling all women liars is just as crazy as saying all women to say say the truth right yes that's true you're gonna have a certain percentage of human beings that are deceptive which is why I say 97% of women are like ah no I think it's I mean I don't want I don't even want to speculate about what the stats are the problem is if you're a person who didn't do anything to someone and then they're accusing you of doing something them and then it ruins your life that's devastating and that happens that so I've been having this conversation I posted it and I put on Twitter hey if I'm wrong if this is wrong yell at me here go ahead and I was surprised by how few people yelled no one really got mad because when you see what the recommendations were people believe in due process and the rule of law they should and they people know that mob mentality z' are not good and they're not american i mean they're not the spirit of america they're they're they are pretty american actually but like the they're not the letter of america and it was kind of baffling that Obama and the administration so what's happening is so guys are getting kicked out of school they're getting you know what these they're they're the colleges are following the guidelines and due process is thrown away guys get you know thrown out of school did it uh and then they sue the school and guess what a lot of them were winning yeah because it's unconstitutional what the school did so it's this weird thing of it's such a fucking sticky situation because I was talked because the after I posted a few female friends of mine texted or called me and one of them said that she was at NYU and was having sex with a guy he tried to put in her ass she was like no she said no he said can I she said no and he did anyway she just froze and was like stunned frozen silent he finishes no alcohol no it's and it just becomes he said she said mm-hmm and it's like what what should we do in a society about a situation like that and I truly don't know I truly am like I no fucking idea hmm well if she said no and he did it anyway that's a real fucking problem yes exactly that's rape yeah that's right but what but also then it just becomes what it's a he said she said thing right no everything that I said no we you know no main like real lie detectors I mean that's really the situations like this where it's one person's word against the other and the yeah the results critical you got a I don't know if that's really possible though I mean I don't know of anything that exists or any technology that's on the pipeline there no there isn't so a friend of mine jokingly said that that all guys and women need to wear body cams yeah yeah like that's kind of where it is because there again it is one of these like shit I don't because it might be you kind of think like oh yeah no it's probably it's always pretty cut and ready to and then you hear a thing like that you're like you know what I don't know what to but then no one's gonna shoot that guy get on camera right the now we're into like because I go oh guys shouldn't get kicked out of school there should be due process of course there should be due process then I hear a story like that and I'm like fuck man I don't know I don't maybe that guy shouldn't be able to go to school I don't know I true I don't know so he lied and he said that didn't happen he didn't she didn't press charges or any okay which by the way is super common so when you take an account rape the number of rapes that get reported versus the number of rapes that don't get reported it's like it's a drop in the bucket and and when when guys could well why don't girls report it dude you don't like going a jury duty and that's a week you want it you think a girl wants to talk about her fucking vagina for a year and a half not just that the stigma of yes flying around knowing that everybody knows you were raped like yeah I think that feeling yeah but judging you or staring at yes talking about you for nothing that you did no nothing it's like literally as these things happen because you read these a lot of the times the it feels like the choice for women is as it's happening it's like fuck I have to make my life about this now my whole life has to be about this for at least a year and a half cops lawyers fucking uh court dates all just like a nightmare or one in nightma yeah that you likely did nothing wrong you just and now it's like getting it's like getting in a in a horrible car accident something and again I I don't know what the solution is cuz as a comic my first and being contrarian ago like what did you what do they do what do they did all that all the things and it's like no most of these things are wrong place the wrong time with a piece of shit yeah yeah I mean due process is significant though it's gigantic I know yeah I'm now have it I'm gonna happen with the UVA case in Rolling Stone magazine they printed this stupid fucking lie this crazy story that really becomes a problem because there's real rape going on all the time on campuses that's happening for believe that that girl wasn't raped the UVA story yeah I believe it she was raped I don't think it was the 15th like the way something happened something you sure what do you think that because I think they probably think shit wasn't even there and that she was never in there with an errata or any of that shit maybe okay then maybe he didn't read any followed I think that significance pointing to the fact that it was all made up yeah that there's very little possibility that something actually happened to yeah I think they've completely dismissed that I think they think it was just a girl just made some crazy shit up versus the mattress girl thing the mattress girl one was a weird one because she definitely had sex with that guy and she definitely wanted to have sex that guy because she was messaging him about sex and about you know I think she said something about bring condoms and you're gonna put it in my butt and yeah just a bunch of crazy shit like it was sex talk back yeah and then she just decided this is an amazing way to be a martyr and to be a victim and to bring that fucking mattress everywhere including at her commencement speech yeah you know I mean that that's a different sort of case and that kid is now suing that yet is now suing that University and I hope he wins yeah again I hope he wins and because I think due process is as important it's literally a tie for first yeah between protecting women and protecting the Constitution but yeah I don't even the the the thing that bothers me about even talking about UVA or Columbia is it makes the story about lying women right which is just fucking right that they're the outliers yes they're the outliers by an extreme because there's more iteration when you can't ask a little ignore them in the equation right well that's the why you need due process yeah that is exactly what you need and you know we also have to stop thinking out of is like men and women it's human beings yeah human beings involved in these situations and we have to treat them like equals do you know the story about Occidental Occidental College in LA I bleach story boy and girl get drunk text each other back and forth I'm coming over and you have condoms yeah come on over she comes over they they have sex with each other and then her friends convince her that because she was drunk she could not consent and that it's rape you know memory that was a big thing for a while that you if you're not drunk you can't consent it was like for a year or two they tried to push that until they realized oh my god that makes everyone a rapist so they can't mean I having said that I think that the part that alcohol plays in this shit giant is so fucking massive and nobody ever brings it up it's giant yeah if alcohol was complicit and all the things that people did while drunk the same way the prescription drugs yeah they'd be out of business out of business so this guy in this gal have some sex and it's consensual 100% but after the fact her friends tell her you couldn't consent because you were drunk yeah so even though he was drunk to know huh so you know people get told authorities get involved he gets out of school she does not they just they don't call it rape they don't press charges he didn't do anything actually wrong you know in terms of the letter of the law since they were both intoxicated and willing and consensual but they kick him out of college and so he's like well what the fuck man she's drunk too so I got raped as well do you understand that I can't just be the man that is doing the raping if you're both intoxicated yeah how the fuck am I supposed to be able to consent so the idea is that this is as much of male versus female thing I had a conversation with a female friend of mine recently and the conclusion one of the collisions was men don't see women as humans well meaning there and while they're there like other yes there it's other yeah it's other it's like you're not I'm not saying you're not a human but you're not a man you know what I mean like there's something of like the way men treat women is not equal it's just it's other it's like you're in this other category well they don't understand them that much because they're not one of them yep and if they don't have a good relationship with their mother it's even worse especially they were raised by their dad alone those guys are the sketchiest guys of all yeah I'm generalizing I can't even think of one guy like that but yeah I don't think yeah I know a guy like that and sometimes even guys that were only raised by their mom are sketchy if their mom hates women but the the whole thing is I mean look it's just real hard when you start doing this men and women thing right here you're prone to generalization it's just no getting away from it but men want sex from women so they're pursuing women and do you have do you know any men that are that you're friends with that you see over time to become more and more bitter towards women because they became rejected over and over and they associate women with bad feelings yes the associate women with negativity I think men look at women like like they're trying to score on a team mm-hmm yeah it's dude it's first base second base third base it's literally like built into the language yeah of how we it is a thing that guys conquer so it ends up being I've liked it in the past too like Saudi Arabia we're like fucking towel heads but cuz they won't give us the fucking oil right like no it's there they don't like you they don't want to give you like they don't with date but that doesn't mean that their shitty any more than it means your shitty if you don't want this fucking kombucha like you just don't your body didn't want it doesn't mean that your her body doesn't want you like theirs but it makes guys it hurts their feelings and it makes them crazy and it also deals with these evolutionary mechanisms that are designed to make sure that we breed you know it becomes like a significant issue for you want to figure out how do I get this gal to like me to the point where she wants to have sex with me oh I gotta buy the right cars I got a rather where the right watch I gotta do this and do that and say the right things be a gentleman and hold open doors and all these things that we do like well why do men hold open doors will do be a gentleman no to show that they're a preferential mate that's what they're doing they're trying to con you correct and taking that dick yes it's ghost speaks to your bit about invention that the thing that that your invention thing now is that the reason the thing of like why women have an invented shit yeah it's because they don't have to they don't have to it's also the way their mind works you know the hunter-gatherer yeah that's very different with the females in the tribe versus the males and we're stealing we still dealing with the echoes all that by the way for people that are shallow we're talking about misogyny yeah no yes so you know yeah we're talking in theory about misogyny these are not views that either it was home but yeah but in fact the opposite I mean I and I have all daughters you know I'm used to being around little girls I know I know about women more now I understand them than I ever did and how would you how would you how different would your behavior been 20 years ago if you had what you but the wisdom you have now it'll be way different it would be way different I just would maybe might be hey I never did anything horrible like my record is clean yeah I know I stopped going to think about assault yeah but what I am what I am more aware of now is the inner workings of like a female from child to adulthood I understand that they're just so that there's a different evolutionary path for their sex for their gender there's a whole thing going on that they want to protect the nest they want to find a man like there's a lot of guys look at a girl who wants a successful guy like oh she's fucking shallow she just wants a bunch of shoot you want someone to pay for everything there is a evolutionary path where the woman is looking for a man who shows that he is capable of taking care of things while she is held up being pregnant and taking care of the young it is a natural instinct it is undeniable and there's some women that are super strong and super motivated and they don't have that instinct their instinct is to just have a kid give it to a nanny get back to work as soon as possible and you know what I'll tell you what I bet their husbands tall you know I mean there's still those things of like the evolutionary shit that you can't get rid of your body wants to fuck a tall guy yeah yeah for the same for protection all that shit for all that shit money the height strength provisions yeah yeah and and the ability to overcome significant situations like whenever there's a like a guy that falls apart under stress is one of the most unattractive things to women ever because I'm sure is anywhere like that I think winning I've talked about where guys women don't like when guys cry in front of them they say they want an emotional guy what they mean is I want you to listen to my emotions yeah I don't want you to be emotional I need you to be a fucking marine yeah and you're gonna be emotional and cry about things it better be like a brave display of ammo yes my one of your fallen brothers yeah somebody's you know like a baseball players retired something some physical some physical thing about the passage of time and Brotherhood yeah yeah maybe that's it yeah I mean like daughter's birthday party you're so happy yeah that's the portfolio yeah but the ability to respond to pressures a giant one the ability to provide is a giant one physical features like having strong features having strong genetics the woman has to know like genetically has to feel like she's being protected and then there's some women that don't like that at all there's some women that like bitch men and we we know those women and they they're the really domineering powerful women and they have these men that are like quiet and they're so sensitive yeah I mean that's that's okay too but these these patterns that exist they exist because for the longest time I mean look it's a weird situation when a woman has to be pregnant for nine months that's a long time imagine picking a man imagine if you're you're a man and you're picking a woman and you have to decide when you're meeting this woman is this chick gonna be able to keep it together with me while I'm held up literally held up for a year like a whole year for one year I'm gonna be stuck in this situation and then from then the next 18 years I'm gonna be responsible for the infant that comes out of this Union mm-hmm like that's so that's so different than our thought process it's so different the consequences are so much to want men only think about to me men want sex they don't think about they literally and then it's just blunt and then it's just black Shore it's like sex and then just like black in the distance infinite blackness whereas women do think which is why it's a it's a more intricate decision having sex with somebody yeah because it is like the long-term shit worse we just like we just want I didn't what do you got baby comes out of this that's in sweat just gonna come yeah yeah some women look are looking for sex too but they also a good percentage of them at least are looking to be a mom and it's just something that they want it's a lot of the reason why there's 7 billion people it's not because being a mom is so completely unattractive they want to do it we I want to talk about some of this stuff with the sexual harassment stuff is the stuff that people are not it's like the alcohol thing right like I've never thought drinking around your co-workers was smart no like literally I'm like why the fuck would you want I wrap parties I try to get out of as soon as possible yeah I'll stay for like a beer and then and I don't even understand the why a company would have it why would like I mean I'd say for morale yeah they're not thinking in terms of the you know potential hazards yes thinking it'd be fun fun flais for everybody to cut loose a buddy minds producer of a show and he and he basically a couple weeks it was like we need to have rules for engagement so he's made it so like there are gonna be no meetings where there's only two people Wow shit like where it's like no no everybody you and a dude I think yeah I think there cannot be I think two dudes can meet what about Kevin Spacey yeah again that just trying to go know why he was like were it three people but he's the perfect example because like he's just trying to come ya know a girl's daddy and me the other day talking about huh Kevin Spacey harassed her really yep yes he's trying to fuck women do yeah he just wanted that he'd like the power he liked the action it seems like wow that's interesting yeah did you ever see his brother no oh man it's a trip his brother dresses like a combination of Ringo Starr and Elton John and just completely out there guy and just talks about the horrors of Kevin growing up with his insanely abusive dad and it was Kevin's dad to like yeah yeah yeah just I'm not really gonna rape and just awful things just awful awful abuse well yeah that was like this thing's brother Wow yeah his brother dresses like that all the time like a Rod Stewart his brothers Ron would my goodness yeah Wow yeah as his brother and it's just that they just got fucking abused when they were children just fucking abuse yeah my monster created them yeah that's what what's his name Morgan Spurlock yesterday talking about did you see his thing I heard about it I heard about this more you should read it because it's like pretty like he he owns up to stuff which I get that impulse cuz because I had one I don't have any big stains on my record but I'm like well he had a temple he had someone accused him of rape in college yes and he also settled with the girl who worked with because the sexual sex pants or hot pants everybody yeah and then she but he was like I basically would just he did it like sex pants like a cross in front of everyone and so when she was quitting she basically said like I'm gonna tell people right you call me sex pants yeah yeah you can't do that but you know the confession everybody sort of puts their excuse in the confession or a lot of people do um it's like the it's the it's kind of like the I have daughters thing right right as a father of a daughter yes oh yeah well in that case well now I understand accordian that he was abused and then he's an alcoholic right and all this stuff that was like ah yeah I don't know man is maybe that's a different statement right it's no one will just go like I fucked up people hate admitting that they were wrong like just going like I'm a hundred wimpy even in these in these uh apologies goes for the people I may have dammit there's no May right you did it it happened right like the there's no I don't know if they do it for legal reasons mmm but a lot of the time it's like I for any anguish I may have caused what do you that puts it on them right where it's like you know you did it depending on what the action is right so like if he's talking about the rape in college you know you read the story what the he wrote it it's like okay you kind of did it when she said don't do it so it seems like and then she started crying I don't the way he told it yeah it's not very massive it's like it again this is like ghost of that rules the the rules I've been doing this joke on stage which is um I have a nightclub routine that I do Joe well usually got to come see it to you 10:15 tonight I was love for you to come but in fact would you like to introduce me oh my god I do but I did sex is the most consequential thing we can do with our bodies yeah we can't talk about it beforehand so we just have to go like yeah are you thinking I'm thinking if I'm going to jail sweet this huge thing uh-huh but we can't talk about it but it wasn't a huge thing in terms of like the communication aspect of it until recently I mean in the 1970s and 1980s what people did a lot of talking before they fucked no but I also think that there were women didn't have as many rights mm-hmm I think now that women are like wait a minute well women want sex to write each other and they start making out next thing you know they're grabbing dicks yes I'm of the mind though that we're women it's in in in my understanding women's nature that they want mystery and they want spontaneity as part of the package of sex that's that's what literally turns them on mystery mister miss masks you got one you got one should get Kate remember it tells all joke that's women love mystery which is why whenever my girlfriend leaves a room I'd take a shit in one of her shoes that literally has a great one-liner for everything but the so it's built in to want mystery so you can't you we literally can't talk about it beforehand you ever tried to talk you ever go you can't say hey I'd like to go have sex now you have to go like let's go look at my stamps or whatever that you know no man the mystic thing hey come up and look at my matches my got an egg carton whatever your fucking whatever your your ruse to get her up there cuz you can't say you want to have sex because it's like about shame part of its a lot of it's the mystery thing but there's also like women can't openly go like yes I would like that also yeah well after you date them for a while you can yes agreed yeah once you've done it a couple of times yeah I do this yes I think it takes longer than then a few times really to get there maybe that's you bro maybe that's me mess on me bro I ain't nothing but a bitch bro I wonder man I wonder how we're gonna get past this culturally I don't and that's so so what I've been talking to people about is like so there needs to be rules of engagement and like what I think guys would be fine with scheduling it the thing about the consent because there was a thing in that article about ever that thing that they used to have like at Antioch College like 20 years ago where it was like I want to touch your breasts now yeah I know I know yeah but I believe guys would be fine with that I really do because I don't I think guys are like wait I'm gonna get to touch move at 1206 great yeah but like can I touch your breasts now yes can I take your pants off not yet okay and then you go back to making out can I take your pants off now okay like yeah you ever see that video yeah yeah it's preposterous yes because what other is poss-eye this part the guy in the video they make it like the lowest test guy available who just like this weird beta male though the whole thing is just so strange I know what's wrong but just if you look at this you know scientifically what's the answer got to get to know people better for you fuck them that's a big one like that the courtship like period should be longer I agree I mean I people get hive and implemented that my own life where I'm like I don't cuz I don't what cuz I know once I sleep with somebody I'll feel guilty and if I don't want to see him again and they'll be mad yeah that's how I just try to part I just try to put it off for as long as I possibly can and then decide do I even want because a lot of times I've had like friends men I've talked about where you sleep with somebody because you can't think of an excuse not to yeah you don't even you know you don't want to see him again that's the worst you know you don't want to see him again but they're like going for it you're like okay I guess the problem is once you're engaged once you're locked and loaded and yeah yeah you know I could probably take this to the end yeah I'd be a fool respectful dared gift horse in the mouth well yeah the fuck does that even mean that gift towards you like looking at a horse's teeth is that the idea behind that like to make sure it's not too old yeah but weird expression stare a gift horse in the mouth yeah how is that one still around yeah there are there well there's a lot of things from horse types yeah that's a big one yet but so there is the thing of like just weight but again that that's where male nature comes in right male nature doesn't like waiting nature does not like waiting male nature's not like patience male nature also is testosterone itself begets risky behavior oh yeah and a lot of it some of it ends up in crime some of it ends up in fucking in you know electricity or the Wright brothers you don't mean yeah and it's like just harnessing it for the right thing you know it's like that cuz that like the the male character is it is a lot of it it's some of the shit is toxic well testosterone in a lot of ways is power and with power comes responsibility that I mean but I say that I don't mean its power like that estrogen is in power I mean there's fuel to testosterone that when you have testosterone what it's doing is it's providing you a certain amount ambition a certain amount of desire a certain amount of lust and that sort of that's the mechanism that a lot of men use to get things going in their life and some guys don't you know I know a lot of men who are like aggressive testosterone males who are just chasing pussy and not doing anything with their lives yeah and they've they've become addicted to that it has become a major distraction and usually their career suffers yeah yeah usually those guys their their career is in the shitter I think we may be thinking of the same person problem yeah you know that I was talking to my friend Michelle wolf who just got an HBO special that's really good and nice ladies and things heard that's really good yeah and she was I was we talk about this shit constantly I was like men want power right men want to dominate like that's our thing like I'm going to expand the I get it you know it's like that's capitalism that's uh that's Empire that's everything it's just expand expand expand power power power and it's like men want it's the Scarface thing first get though the money then you get the power then you get the women and I was like what do women want power and she's like now they don't really women want control if that makes sense like they don't want Empire they want you to they want to be able to depend on you right for I think fear is fine depending on you isn't that again this we're going back to those natural instincts yeah that a mother needs the father to be the one who's gonna watch over her and provide yeah that's and that sounds sexist right people don't like that oh well the woman is need a man to provide any more I understand that you're right you don't for the most part I'm not saying that women aren't equal to men in terms of their ability to do things but what I am saying is there's certain inherent instincts that we have that are left over yeah and there's also like a lot of weird shit right like with this domination and Submission the submissive thing that men and women have there's also rape fantasies there's also a weird s shit there's a lot of weird stuff that people have yes that's just built into there into the end of the operating right and your operating system is probably gonna be different than Jamie's and therefore than mine and yeah there's massive variables and to try to find them you know like I just ate a girl and she used to want me to just choke her all the time she would grab my hand I want girls because of your size would want that all right whenever I see it got a girl like you never see like a tiny girl with like just a monster of a dude yeah and I always want to say like oh you like getting fucking rails you don't like you fucking like to get do you like to almost get murdered every time that's your thing some girls like that yeah yeah like there's a ton of girls that like that yeah and again and and I think we've talked about this before it's because girls never really saw porn before 1998-99 hmm so now there's no full like all the options and I go oh that yeah joking fun oh that's what I want doing someone special my fucking hair Wow yeah because otherwise they learn about that stuff while they're doing it look at guys Spanx I mean like yeah yes I know remember when you spanked me well I want you to spank me because I want you to spank me I don't want you spank me because you want to say yes and it's like okay we're friends what okay girl once who told me she wanted me to rape her and I said okay but if you want me to rape you then it's not raping you and she goes and she was like she was like joking around she was like halfway joking around but she had some weird shit like she wanted me to grab the back of her head and force it on my dick like she liked that she got off on that and I go yeah but the only way that I can do that is if I know that you want me to do that like I can't like I can train I can do it but it's not I'm not like that's whenever girls want rough shit I'm like yeah I I can I like I can get there right but here's the thing like the saying you want someone to rape the problem with the rape thing is like if we just go through there are you gonna fight back are you gonna say no yeah I keep going that's still rape yeah even though you said you wanted me to rape down if you say no and keep going and ultimately it just wound up staying the way it was like we never went into fully into the rape fantasy because I was like a super perturbed by it I was like this could go terrible yeah you can't just yeah also I don't want ever to get sexually aroused by that I don't want to be connected yeah because I think that like I stayed a girl and she's still like to rub her feet on my deck and for a while I had like this foot fetish thing going on you know I mean yeah and like I had for you but it's she started it yeah well she was into it yeah she did like suck on my toes and shit she was a freak but she but that thing became like a sexually arousing thing to me I look at girls feet and I would get excited out of them for years yeah if you had a girl who wanted you to smack her around yeah you know and I have a friend who likes that like he's into that and yup dates girls that are into that and he's like you know like crunchers their own website their own pictures of like bruises that he left on them I'm like Jesus Christ dude he's like you have it goes ugly it's gonna go real ugly for me yeah cuz it's consensual but what proof does he have that no I guess yeah I don't want to get sexually attracted to that I don't wanna I don't want that to be like the foot fetish thing where you become that like that's your thing like I'm really into smacking girls around holding them down yeah yeah because then you gotta like that's what you need then you'd have to go to Craigslist you'd have to like you gotta troll on yeah you have to you have to like say look this is what I'm looking for very specifically is this cool with you I come to you with a heavy heart out but then the problem with that is like you know how do you know that the woman wants that every time you know they're gonna be and I know that's what I'm saying about like if I'm guessed wrong I'm gonna deal which is where you need that's where consent comes in yeah that's where like consent and again because women are physically weaker in general and men in in when sex it has to be them pitching it yes in a way like because otherwise especially if it's physical yeah buddy mine is huge physically huge a girl said choke me and he was like oh fucking so he just went like she wants she wanted like a fucking real like really was like I'll kill you and so he literally was so scared that he just kind of like put his forearm up just call her ex-boyfriend as soon as he was done it's all so crazy how fine get you choking yeah it's also crazy how the without yet like they'll how hard they want you to choke them yeah yeah like where it's like oh you really want I don't know I don't wanna it literally just feels like hang me off the roof hey hang we have hang me off the roof and then wonder what that is - why does that feel good well it's beast evolution yeah it consensual sex just started about three thousand years ago if that yeah I'm being generous yeah three thousand years ago is probably an option yeah yeah yeah just out of respect your brothers yeah I mean shit like it's it's just it's a part of like animals yeah consensual sex it's like that thing of like the universe is this old and earth is life on Earth is that all yeah it's a non-consensual sex is this long and consensual sex is a fucking sliver I think the good about all of this stuff all this me to stuff and is that it's going to force human beings to reevaluate their behavior and that is what moves evolution contract the ultra evolution is moving yeah and also I'm fucking as a guy who roots for the underdog fucking and justice fucking I'm fucking so happy for women yeah so happy for women I think we need in I think we need laws like unbelievably brutal laws when it comes to hills that people drop in drinks when it comes to like the cosby thing i heard another story the other night about that and i it i just that freaks me out that's the one that freaks me out I think the most because I feel like that's like straight sociopath shit yeah you you want this from some person and you just feel free to put job something there drink and sit back and wait and watch and watch a kick in I had a girl accuse me of doing that to her whoa terrifying in Vegas hi to Chappelle show like literally to the almost to the week and maybe a month after the fear factor sketched Jeff thanks again and so me too girl in Vegas long stirrup we mutual friends we meet for a drink at a bar on at the Hard Rock Cafe para Hard Rock Hotel and I get there she's drinking a mixed drink and and a buddy of mine our mutual friend is like hey I'm having a party in my room you guys want to come and and we're like yeah cool we'll come up we have a beer me and her and then we go up to my buddy's room we're on our way to my buddy's room she is like I don't we're walking across the casino she's like I don't feel good like I don't feel like a hundred percent and and I was like why don't okay I was like sit down like sit down at like a slot machine and and I'm just like I'll go get us drinks and she's like will you get me a beer I was like no I'll get you water like I'm not fucking so I come back with two waters and she's like yeah I just feel like way more fucked up than I should be like I feel like I feel like somebody put something in my drink and I was like not thinking the double entendre this I go do you want to go back to your room and she looks at me and goes I think you put something in my drink and runs and I chased her for like ten feet and I was like I can't chase a girl like I can't I can't chase this girl so oh how well did you know her not well oh I met her on Tuesday and this was a Friday oh my god so for three hours I was like a mic maybe I'm going to jail like I didn't know like I didn't do anything but I couldn't prove I didn't do anything like I couldn't almost it would be a move at that point to call the police and say someone just accused me of putting something in the drink I absolutely didn't I mean could you please do a toxicology exam on her she might just be drunk and crazy yeah looking back thinking back now I realize it was at a casino so there's cameras everywhere right but could the cameras have camera count the cameras have picked up me fucking dropping all right like could then maybe they weren't high-resolution enough what year 2004 they probably were well they're there they're there to like prevent stealing right and then gambling tricks so they must be able to see like your hand they can zoom in I think but how you know I'm on whatever you see it it's all kind of like kind of pixelated but after three hours she finally like called me and was like hey I know because I called her I was like hey just saying I didn't poison you right and I don't think anyone would believe I put like I have no reason to write poison whatever you wouldn't do it anyway right like it's not you like or because you wouldn't do it of course but I would have said the same thing about Bill Cosby would you have oh did I ever tell you this story about Bill Cosby no so so I dated a girl in like oh five OH six or seven in New York beautiful girl mixed mixed race and like cool whatever great and she used to talk about she some Bill Cosby came up one time she was like Oh mr. Cosby would have sweet man I was like what what what do you think woody huh she's like oh yeah one time I was on the street crying and mr. Cosby walked up and introduced himself it was like why are you crying and and and and you know and we struck up friendship and I was like he was trying to fuck him just so you know I was like just seeing I was trying to fuck you she's like no he was not trying to fuck me like and and and like what are you talking about like no it was just like again like I'm an animal for suggesting it like oh you're so Boris why would you possibly think right and it's like cuz I fuckin met the guy and he's not a good dude and and so she she defended him he used to take me to place just all this shit I'm like okay he just had a long game yeah man and so then all this Cosby shit comes out then I text I go so what do you think what do you think you're a boy and she goes uh she said something like I think it like he absolutely did it and I think his wife was in on it which again I don't know what that what she meant by that but so then I weird text back importance he goes you know one time I was supposed to meet him in Philadelphia and he told me what to wear and how to wear my hair oh Jesus and she goes and thankfully I got sick she was gonna do it she was gonna say what she wanted yeah wow that was the time yeah and that up yeah and he he was gonna take her to the ultimate musical and she and thankfully she got sick and didn't go and and I was like and the whole time when it's like yeah that's the thing that one of the things with some of these stories is like why would Bill Cosby want to be friends with some lady do you not even like what just because you're great-looking yeah well I think it's entirely possible that a guy could be friends with a beautiful again I don't even though he wants to fuck her just keep it together and just be friends with her and you know find some interesting muse I think it's impossible but I do think it's not very likely in my experience with humanity right no and also why would a guy torture himself like that well it's like when a guy has a hot nanny dummy ugly nanny yeah fucking don't why do that to yourself the hot nanny always winds up being a pro fucking no she's hot too yeah yeah does she though job done oh no she says food sweats I'm sure Edward spits all day let me pick that up for you are you talking about you're such a good dad yeah like just don't hire a hot nanny yeah I would I would give that advice as well I wouldn't hire a hot assistant that's a good device as well I don't know ever told you to start so so my I hired an assistant for the sexes for the second season Chapelle show right and um and interviewed a bunch of people and this girl came in super just like sharp just like I could just tell she was sharp and but she also happened to be good-looking and so I hire and Chapelle Ceaser and goes word she was the most qualified and I was like yeah she was the most qualified now I was like yeah she was the most qualified believe me now and I was proven right because she has since gone on to produce ghostbusters and the heat and all these movies and she just happens to be good luck but it was like I fucking knew it I fucking told you she was qualified she's just good she's what are you talking about with that girl you'd met Cosman he wasn't a nice guy I met Cosby at Arsenio one time because I'm a million years old I went to our I met a woman named joy Dolce he used to be in the talent department at Arsenio and she was friends with Dave because David did Arsenio whatever whatever so she would like just go hey come by the show to that this is like in when Arsenio was on the original like in 94 so I went by one day and Cosby was the guest and he liked and he could just like kind of fucking berated me about like he was talking about the history of slavery and he's like and then the duck man came and he pointed to me I was like I'm not Dutch anybody just like did invited I was like okay but it was just that he was just a really condescending dude and I was 19 so you know he had a right to be condescending but not really but I'll whatever like I Bill Cosby is a brilliant fucking guy and but I just he's just not I wouldn't can i I mean no would I know now he's a real piece of garbage but but uh but the my interaction with him at that time was not like wasn't Pleasant right and just seeing how he talked to people still like yeah this guy's fucking not a good dude well he definitely has an elitist sort of a thing yeah and I think that elitist sort of a thing is one of the ways that he was able to separate himself from his victims that he's better than them you know he would behave in these weird ways when he do these shows I've talked about it before but I talked to these people that worked with him in the casino and he would make the entire staff sit down and watch him eat yeah so all the people that worked in the theater all the people who worked the aisles they would have to come in the room and stand there while he ate yeah then he had he had a security guard tuck him into bed at night so he climbs into bed and the security guard tucks him in and then shuts the lights out and shot something similar to that yeah yeah so he had this thing like I am he's superior I'm Bill Cosby I'm dr. Cosby yeah call me doctor yeah I mean the dr. Cosby thing yeah let me fucking crazy yeah Oh Chuck D from Public Enemy broke my fucking heart cuz on Twitter he was talking about like at what on the accusation started you know this is all a smear campaign against dr. Cosby and I'm like come on yeah and he's not a doctor yeah he's not a real doctor don't say that and they took that doctor away too now yeah yeah I mean I get Dave talked about in his last special that thing like the he rapes but he saves thing Bill Cosby's in horton dude to black American culture history he's well just cuz he's in yeah but took to culture yes but he's the first black dude to win a name he's the first black dude to do a lot of shit right and did did it the right way I mean he had an animated show to the people forgot about Fat Albert that was a huge hit and black people don't forget about this yeah well it's hard to find now yeah right yeah and like just a huge impact and it was a real loss for black people like so a guy like Chuck D who was eminently respectable is like there's a mourning period you know man it's like you gotta be careful when you pull the trigger on calling it a smear campaign no I totally agree and it's entirely possible that your hero's a piece of shit and yeah and people can have both qualities they get amazing at something and very important but also be terrible yeah that I have a I don't even know if I believe it but I had the thought that like Cosby if the kink came before the talent meaning I know I like poisoning people right how do I put myself in a position to be able to plausibly poison women subconsciously that's how people work I honestly believe that there's like in the unconscious that you go I have this thing because that's not a thing that you just develop I don't think I think that and that's also not even a power that's not even a power thing per that's some other shit it is power but it's like sociopathy it's not just like it's not like Harvey Weinstein is like to me is like the casting couch run amok you know like I want come on fuck me like come on no you're a hot actress I even I got power like I thought that's how it works yeah like I thought that's kind of the way the game was played with Cosby I mean having said that a lot of Harvey shit was just straight rape so yeah but the fact that they were all actresses I don't think it's like a coincidence but with Cosby it's like that probably existed when he was 15 I don't know I think it's entirely probably been talking about this as well that I think that there was a time when that was normal I think it was a time where slipping a Mickey into someone's drink was something that a lot of men did yeah I think it was we looked at things in a different way just like we look at hitting women yeah in a different way like you go watch those old movies yeah a man got smacked all the time it was normal yeah the the leading man like yeah Steve McQueen would smack the shit out of women yeah frankly my dear and I'll give it to him yeah try slapping a woman now in a movie try it and be be the hero yeah I mean it's again what we're talking about massive cultural evolution and yet happening right it was that thing of like Oh women aren't people right yeah there's some else it's a woman do you know the with the real term for a faggot is what do you mean like the origin yeah yeah what it's a bundle of sticks yeah yeah right yeah a woman was thought to be a bundle of sticks it was used for a woman she's burdened some like a bundle of sticks yeah because it's difficult to carry around you saw a faggot as a man became a man who's like a woman yeah who's burdensome like a bundle of sticks it was never anything about what is this hair there he goes the rkq yeah take a take a picture unit of volume yeah so this bundle of sticks thing was like how men thought of women like I'll carry this bitch around Jesus Christ you know bundle of sticks is annoying to carry around I got a question for you what do you make of with now that we've got Louie it's Cosby I don't think they're even in the same category now just before my own for just for the sake of argument Pryor beat his wife coke addict etc etc do you think that there is a correlation between comedic excellence and degenerate behavior yes that said why I sent it to the crowd the other night I go by the way the ability jerking off on your stomach and writing amazing jokes are roommates yeah like there it's like I can't it's like hey we need you guys to think irrationally about everything yeah how about Kinison here's another one yeah Hicks yes another hex wasn't he was in yeah I I mean like dirtbag like like not malevolent yeah malevolent I mean I feel like Hicks is probably more conscious yeah didn't it do anything to women but you know like friends who worked with them and say like hey we're going out you want to come out now I'm gonna go back to jerk off yeah just he was just into watching porn and beating off all its you know the body I was talking about because yeah we both know Louisans you've known him since 1989 probably I don't I never knew a around them I would see him like once a year or twice a year somewhere and say hi I know you way better than I know him yeah the so I remember when I moved to New York and 91 and was in the comedy club scene in 92 93 94 in New York I was I couldn't believe the amount of jerking off that was going on why is everyone constantly talking about like what the fuck is it's going to Louie's apartment for to shoot movies like his shorts that he used to make I would like piei on them and and it always smelled gross like Jay Mohr was constantly Jay Mohr room and I were roommates for a bit he jerked off on one of my socks like just like what like why is there anyone jerking off all the time just like what is the what's the fuck is happening that's rape yeah no you know what's funny as I was wondering like today yeah I was thinking about the thing the Jay thing again because I'm I'm of the mind that like again Louie was more gross than than malicious and disgust malicious and criminal I was gross that what he did I think it was gross he did it to a man it takes on more ominous tones when he's doing it to women it's completely agree yeah it's I mean I'm not but it's not a crime right guys no no no I don't think so I think it's just sad it's nothing like me it's just pathetic it's weird and you know I had to calm some conversations with iliza shlesinger and she was saying that men would say things to her when she first started out she wasn't very good you know she just started out yeah and these guys were like established guys and they would treat her as if like you're below me and you're always going to be below me and I can get away with saying whatever I want to you he's you're less than me yeah and she was and I kind of feel like that's probably why he did that to those girls like he was above them they were below him and it was not just hey I want a jerk off in front of you it's like you have to watch me jerk off because I'm above you you know what's the thing you said earlier was relevant which is getting hard right from that how can you yeah that's the thing that's like but I I but then it's also like you don't pick your kinks and all that shit like it just falls on you yeah yeah you don't pick that yeah that's even a direct correlation most kinks are just like I don't know I'm talking like yeah being hung off the roof or what do you know yeah but yeah that's the thing of like the the getting hard thing but also I fuck the whole thing it is sad it's fucked up but I actually think he'll be he'll be in a year and a half he'll be back you think so stronger than ever yeah because now he's got something to talk about for yeah sure it's gonna be a lot of dudes at the show it's gonna be 90% dudes but I've asked the crowd I've asked probably five or six different crowds if Louie was doing the show after this would you go and 70% of the people applaud yeah they would want to see what the fuck yes I said yeah yes I think you should go onstage the first words out of his mouth should be well I asked I there's I believe light should just come up and he's jerking off button ah yeah it's a great idea and I'm just like lights down I'm just like yeah I think what he did was freaky and weird but I think Louie I don't think Louie's a monster I don't know him very well but I don't I don't think he's a bad person he's always been friendly to me he's not a bad person no like I he's not like he's not a bad he's not he's also again I don't want to be like defending a sex criminal if it's a power thing he the more powerful he got the less he did it yeah that's the weird thing right it's like I think you realized that what he did was fucked up and like he had these crazy urges and he did it and then as time went on he stopped doing it and he's like I am a prisoner to some shit that I know dude and if he had just got in front of it I feel like if he had just real a if he had just talked about it yeah in a Letterman talked about fucking his staff on the air yeah and no one cared well Letterman just went straight do you mean a hundred percent confessional yeah we could have done I think he does mishandled it liked having sex with the people that work with have you watched it he's getting laughs the whole time yeah yeah like the whole time I'm getting big laughs he's brilliant yeah I miss him but again the other thing it's like the irony of like Netflix didn't pull his show yeah but he was only having sex with people but here's the thing having sex with people back then but that you own a piece of power that's now that's that can sit again we're talking about four years ago that's crazy you gotta read it feels like it's changed what's changed is it just everyone I think the Harvey Weinstein thing was so fucking gross and he's such a monster yeah that everybody's like completely I think there's this ripple effect and that this we're like way beyond normal reactions for things like Matt Lauer yeah I'm still trying to figure out what Matt Lauer did that got him fired he had sex with someone on staff yeah I think he had sex with someone on staff that probably felt like she couldn't stop mmm that that would be the that would be that sort of rub I don't know you see I don't I don't want a victim shame right you don't know you don't know what really happened I don't know his version I don't even know her version I just know the third hand version you know like I read one that he had sex with some girl until she blacked out and like our like still fuck yeah he's thrown his all and then the other thing was that he had a button on his desk we could lock the door that hurt me yeah that to me is less a rape trap and then it is just like a fucking I don't want to have to get up and go aren't that big and you're like fuck you know yeah it's probably I don't want to walk 40 feet right every time I need to shut the door well it's also he's writing right when you write you don't want to be disturbed you just like it's rather just let me just lock the fucking door and lock into this thing I don't even think he was writing I think it's just like a convenience thing maybe but there was no the only abuses that he was having sex with someone who was above below him mm-hmm right there wasn't like he you know he didn't chase him down like Harvey did or you know offer them a gig or another friend of mine sits I'm interesting which he said until dating people you work with is illegal this is never gonna stop yeah Whitney's got a great joke about that that she's doing right now about working in an office you know cuz she works roseann now yeah it's uh it's their world you know it's like yeah when men and women are becomes yeah and you can't like where is he gonna meet people right and you're working all day so that's most of your day most of your life is with these people also in the same way that they serve like lunch at these places now or they have like we play foosball and all that shit at Google like we have slides and ball pits it's like you can fuck people here it's like that's one thing that's one of our incentives we're all a lot that they'll did they want to keep people on campus but as soon as you stop they make that illegal so if you if you decide like okay the are rules you cannot have sex with anybody you work with like then you want to fuck everybody you work with then so right yes but you can't do it okay speaks of it why can't you if you but sometimes it does work like if a man and a woman are working together like didn't Jimmy Kimmel like marry like one of his head writers or something like that yeah he did all right again is he a monster no she belong yes she was that's what it doesn't he's I know I know that happens thing that's the irony of all this shit there was a thing that that Leno did his last show it was like the 25 kids that were born to couples who met on the show and I was watching it going like this all with sexual harassment Saul crime yeah these are where this is this is a this is a perp walk basic but it's not if the two people really intimidated to comment no dated one when I was 21 mhmmm I don't even really like sleeping with weights on it like I really try to avoid it like I try everything everything in my pie can't say I've never done it but I really try not to yeah because I don't even think a lot of times you're attracted to them I think you're attracted to the dynamic hmm I think you're attracted to like the uniform and like you're working and they're working you're not supposed to and do that and then you see them off campus in normal clothes you're like put your apron on listen how about you just pretend to work at a diner I'll stop in for a coffee and then we'll talk yeah how was your experience with the dating somebody but just I just think there's too much I want to be a comic going on we were both 21 we're both both like really bra open my ears trying it out didn't know what the fuck the future held in store for us it was just too much comedy talk and I was like gosh she's too much like me yeah but she was fucking funny and she was one of the few people that it was like wow like she really could be like legit like when when we were all open never worked out for she's quit yeah gasps I mean I lost touch with her about last time I talked to her I think we were both like 22 23 something like that and then I'd heard somebody ran into her at an open mic night like a year later but she had never gotten out of the open mic scene you know so she was in the open mic scene for two three years and never figured out how to make money and now you know just didn't have whatever it is that some people have the the fucking driving ambition to yeah to figure it out I don't that one otherwise I wouldn't date another communities I don't like that ambition part of me mmm meaning like I have it I'm I it does like drive me you don't want to see it in I don't want to see I don't want that to be my emotional support the person who thinks the way I think or feels the way I feel in regards to achievement yeah especially like status and you know recognition getting the recognition from your peers and all that kind of crazy shit and craving it and where are you with all that stuff with recognition yeah um I'm everything right now because I'm pretty comfortable I was gonna say yeah I don't know if how you are with like congratulations or compliments or stuff but you've done really well for yourself thank you like you've done like this is fucking impressive I don't like I was just thinking that the other day I was like you don't get a lot of press you don't probably do you probably get offers all the time and just don't do it but you fucking built a great thing like a great like first of all to say like I'll tell you come when somebody else gave you Chris Rock said about you he goes Joe Rogan basically physically willed himself into being a great comic I don't even know what Chris meant by that but I know it's a comment like you just were like no I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna be a great comic and you became a great comment that's the same nothing of all this stuff that's say nothing of like building an atmosphere where two men can talk about rebuilding happens where you can have you're gonna you know Alex Jones on you'd have a fucking Neil deGrasse Tyson on you can have the Miley innopolis having all these people on and it's this weird cross-section that you built and it's all just from like I'm into that it doesn't even seem that calculated it's not calculated oh yeah yeah but it is but I but you deserve full accolades thank you sir yeah appreciate it yeah like really like it's really like you've done it you not only like you've built an empire whatever but you've like - you've you've you started with your voice and your interests and worked out inside out yeah you don't I mean like I'm into that I like talking to people I like talking to people about these five or eight things and then you didn't and you don't chase you don't seanrid chase you know I'm too wealthy and old to do it anymore in it but you're not like I gotta go I gotta do a multicam you've done one but I got to do with this thing or I got to do with that or I got to go but I if I was on a network I get billboards and I get all you know their main like you'd get you don't do dumb shit no I just I'm into what I'm into you know and I did dumb shit with Fear Factor I realized from doing Fear Factor was a great education for me first of all it gave me a lot of fuck you money which was great because then I realized well once you have that like oh you really can't it doesn't really matter you could really can't do what you want yeah if you don't have to worry about how your bills are being paid you know you have this freedom just like if they cancel it tomorrow and I'm like I still have this I didn't spend at all I still have a bunch of money and now I can make a living doing stand-up I could do whatever I want so also you could not make a living doing Stan you don't need to make a living right you don't have to write you how you'd like to make a living you've got it yeah I guess it's lay back yeah if you want to but I could never do that but I just I just decided somewhere along the line like what am I really interested in yeah you know and what's the that to me is the key of like that's kind of where I've gotten in the last literally in the last year because like the my three mics was popular and successful like creatively and and like you know people liked it and critics liked it and and it was the the last year is the first time I've been like am i funny am i telling I'm like no I am I am so now I can stop doing shit approved yeah this dumb thing you know that is mostly paranoia right because but when you fight when people are like what even what do you mean am i funny can you write or can like the things that I would actually consciously think Brian it's hard when you battle those things in your head because they steal they steal your perception you know it's such a waste of time it's it's not even a waste it's it's maybe the biggest waste of anything on earth like it's a it's a it's your brain is it's an occupying force in your brain but it's impossible to tell that to someone who's just starting out or who's ambitious and struggling because like that is all they want they they they so desire affirmation yeah to know that hey I'm a legit Pro yeah and magical thing is I got enough affirmation it was three mics is popular and I use this is how dumb the inner voices were I would think yeah you can write sketches but you can only write single-camera sketches oh that's so hot so then I was like you probably can't write multicam sketches and then Dave hosted SNL he asked me to help him with it and I wrote a great sketch it called me next I know I know you it was so obvious to everyone except me and then I was like and then the popularity three mics I was like oh it's fulfilling it is fulfilling but it's also like you just check it off the list of like okay I don't have to pursue this thing like I know that that won't bring me it did bring me fulfillment in that it shut the voices up Brian but it didn't bring me fulfillment of like now when I walk into restaurants five people know me and that change like that doesn't some people love that some people live for that I find that to be nothing that's a giant distraction yeah I just find it to be like hey you know what I'm in it yeah and then I'm just like yeah I don't really remember I guess lying but it's I just it doesn't like it doesn't permeate well it gets to a place where you're like Chris Rock where it becomes a problem yeah like if Chris Rock goes into Spago or wherever like all sudden poof yeah all eyes are on him the paparazzi get notified they're waiting out front with cameras people inside are looking he's over there he's over there he's over there he's over there there's there's that level where you get where it becomes a giant distraction and it fucks with your art - yeah the grease is good about that shit in that he doesn't have literally he travels by himself yes have any boys yeah he comes to the comedy store no bodyguards no Miller shit pulls in yeah hey what's up yeah yeah yeah no he's very wise no and he initially like yeah yeah he like I can't have people gas in me yeah I'm smart of him yeah he's a fucking smart guy though you know he can see the pitfalls in advance yeah he's like which is why he's a great comic he's like psychologically of aware he's not just delusional and trying to push something that he's you know he's trying to like make work yes he doesn't he have we all have blind spots creatively and you know surely he has maybe the fewest blind spots of anyone I know well that's why he was willing to hire people to help him with his act by the way that thing of hiring people because I worked on his new power uh-huh here's what it is he likes comedy writers right and when you're him he there you know how many peers right no one's walking up to rock and giving them tags right of course I would because I know him but like most like he doesn't really have like peers peers right right like so he just has calm he's like he goes I like having comics or comedy writers around and comics the way rappers like gold chains he's like it just makes me feel good he just sorta he just likes comics I can tell you in his new hour like it's not I have a two tags yeah no there's no premises there's none of that shit there's like literally I have two tags you wouldn't if I hadn't given them to him you wouldn't notice but it's also in the interest of making the overall product better and so he's willing to have a bunch of outside it is good it yes it's putting your material against his basically it's like okay how would you what do you have for that joke no I think I have all the best beat already well what I was gonna say is his work with Richard Jeni was a great luck Jenni yeah I did too yeah I think Jenni's the most unheralded I thought one of what was it his second Ptolemy steamy palmy was great and then the one he had some IRA subway car oh yeah I was like I ran watching going like this is fucking good it's great yeah I haven't watched it in 20 years probably but I remember going like yeah this shit is really yeah on the steamy pile of me I was just talking to some comics about the other night I'm like he has a bit about the difference between the left and the right in the center and you know and and then I don't want to do I want to paraphrase it but it's fucking such a well written bit and he was so good at squeezing every last angle out of bits fuckin premise oh just smash them you know just be do it would be obliterated and his economy of words was so magical he was he was a craftsman yeah you know yes he was really fucking and again a deeply troubled guy who you ever felt like he got the respect that he deserved and never got did me this well he was in a I think if he was alive today he would be this huge Netflix star selling out big places and he would probably be happy with that but in his era that wasn't the goal and his era the goal was get a sitcom and so I used to do clubs where I would go I would do the clubs after him and they would be saying like oh he hates it he didn't want to do this he hates doing press he's bummed out that he's on the road he didn't move to Hollywood to be on the road yeah I was like does he understand that he's like one of the best comics it's ever lived yeah like when we were all kids when we were starting out back when I met you at Boston Comedy in like 1991 or whatever it was you weren't even doing standing like that the goal was to make a living like do you think you can make a living you know was you know what Jenny's only problem was his material was great and I'm trying to think of a guy who's like this now his material was great his presentation was artless meaning he'd look like he bought his suits at fucking the Dick Tracy village like he just looked like he just had a hacky sensibility right his fucking bits were great right like there are people that don't like Sebastian because of what I'm saying cuz he's too stylized he's not stat he's he looked Sebastian shops it's the mall do you know you were saying he's not he's not a he's not an artist he's not like he's like he he I once described I've once brought Sebastian up as a blue-collar snob and which is exactly what he is and and but like there are people like I'll have arguments with people where I'm like Sebastian fucking great and they're like he does need a little hack him like no sake at all but because he dresses like a fucking Italian fucking Chooch from Chicago shoot he wears vests people literally people deduct points they don't even know they're not even where they're doing it yeah Jenni suffered from that word where you had to go boy this is a fucking good bit like this is like in terms of writing wise like he was as good a bit writer as Hicks was like that's better way better again better in terms of humor in terms of humor I don't even think they're close okay what I'm saying in terms of his peers at the time like but I mean if you listen to Hicks you're not gonna laugh a lot now listen to a steaming pile of me yeah I was yeah in the car coming back from the Irvine improv before I film my last comedy special I was prepping for the comedy special and one of the things I like to do it with you Irvine it's big plays yeah get everything tight a full weekend and and as I was driving home I said let me listen to some Richard Jeni and I listen to steamy pile me and I hadn't heard in years you know it was from 2007 I believe and I was fucking crying laughs yeah clapping in my car I myself on the way home yeah I think he was one of the best ever yeah and I think Hicks is a great comic don't get me wrong it mean he's one of the most influential and important guys ever but in terms of like humor value brightening Richard Jenny's a poet and so you but you put Jenny like closer to Carlin yes yes Wow that's to me yeah that's fine I kind of think rock might to rock fucking adore Jenny but no the you but people deduct points because it seems yeah because he matter within his voice pusher hit like in Karlin would wear fucking t-shirt and like doubt like where I'm a workman artist whereas like Jenny was like what are you going for the dentist yeah like at least who's on duty yeah and like his his and he's like why needs like tan and he's got his Harris come back and it's like he had a lot of plastic surgery too he kind of went a little nutty and try to become a leading man and yeah he had a lot of issues but yeah the comedy was fucking genius man yeah but people do judge like people the way they look you know like it's it's a weird thing you know like Whitney in their last special or HBO special she wore her hair down yeah and she said that was like a big issue this is like she always wears her hair up just like and if they wanted to wear and Chris wanted her to wear her hair down yeah and she's like I just wanna and I was he should have wore your hair up yeah she do argument rock was saying he wanted her hair down yeah by the way rock didn't say it rock just said it to someone at HBO like she to wear her hair down he wasn't like I demand Chris Rock he was like just she's worth heard up his thing was she reads too hard on camera with her hair pulled back it's all and her delivery is so like menacing is it the wrong word but like it's it's like very like forceful yeah but see that's what I like right I like the fact she's like I'm pulling my fucking hair up no-nonsense yeah yeah no but she was seeing it more from just a point of view of like a stir yeah yeah it's like cuz dude it matters it does matter though it matters more than you think but it matters more I think for the person delivering they feel comfortable and I think because she's a beautiful woman think for her pulling their hair up is like I'm not accentuating that at all I just want you to listen to what I have to say yeah and that's the best way to do it you know like there's parallels I mean like like if you saw a really funny woman but she was dressing like primetime megyn kelly on Fox with look at tiny skirts on and boob showing so yeah what do you selling like you're selling something different than just I'm a stand-up comic like you're selling I'm a sexy lady out for a night on the town but I'm also gonna tell you some jokes yeah it's a gas message yeah I but the thing that people don't take into account sometimes is like you know a lot of the successful male comics are good-looking Tosh is fucking good luck he's a handsome fella but weird gay tones right fine fine that's the small price to pay for those looks I love Tosh but the reason why I said that was like Doug Stanhope who's a fucking maniac wrote something crazy about Tosh in his book just just fucking with him I forget it was but then he murders women who that's funny question is sexuality like he did Stanhope went semi Hunter s Thompson and some of his stuff that's right clearly obviously he's making things up yeah you have to be it's you have to be obviously we're but yeah Tosh is obviously a good-looking guy Sebastian's a beautiful man Dave Dave Chappelle should kill you yes yeah he I think he was better looking skinny really yeah personally yes more my speed got some fucking guns now yeah like there's not like cos she was good-looking prior look like something like nothing I think looks may like mean more than people take into account it's like I always say to people no one with gray hair has ever made it as a comic not never but almost never think about it Steve Martin and Rodney are my list rodney was a cartoon old man I think there's something about being old though you look you'll lose your exuberance and your enthusiasm and then the people are you know that's a part of the aging process and it depends on how much you cultivate your own person energy yeah how much you paying attention to that how well you taking care of your body you know I think people are more impressed if you can come to these conclusions in 26 years yeah but you can't [Laughter] yeah but like Ron white is a gray-haired guy yeah I mean yeah a new city he's been and he's like a cartoon yeah alcohol yeah yeah and a real alcoholic yeah he's a JIT and funny shit yeah that motherfucker that motherfucker is so funny I said to him I was like hey he did a joke he did a joke that like and I go do you remember that joke were you talking about your in a in a fight with your wife and you said some and he goes like I remember and it's like you don't remem you don't remember dude he was telling us a story in the back room of the comedy store you know the back bar yeah he was telling us a story and I'm fucking literally when I hear this remember by the way it would he I'd seen him do it six weeks earlier and he was like I remember I was he was telling a story and I was crying like tears were rolling down my yes and I forget who else is with us and I go you gotta tell that onstage he goes yeah thank ya please tell that story on stage please and he goes man I don't know I go just fucking tell it it's gonna kill he went on stage with it that night he's like got a bottle of tequila he pours himself another drink literally goes from the back bar to the stage and closes with that yeah closes with it smashes yeah out of the part I think I may have seen a bit of it GEB by the way Jefferies Jim went on he Jim's not badly I mean it's like whatever it's good looking good yeah Jefferies went on the other night like he was been drinking all day and his friend was like can you do stand-up drunk and he's like yeah he's like I don't believe whatever and like Jefferies went on and fucking murder for a half an hour yes like drunk yes it can be done god bless yeah I mean especially if you're feeling it yeah you know if like you you like sometimes being drunk like as long as the Momentum's in the right way you know like you're thinking in a good way and everything comes out and you're on the stage yeah I got some fucking shit to talk about yeah here we go yeah and then he goes yeah yeah you don't really do drink much a little bit yeah no not before go on stage very very rarely I have it's not good I like a drink two drinks you know it get a little tipsy yeah but being drunk on stage it's like not it's not the right way to manage the ideas but it is a good way to not give a fuck yes like if you have an idea and you feel so strongly about it and you're I mean obviously so varies depending upon where you are in your life and where you are with the material but sometimes some material just needs a little bit of I don't give a fuck yeah you know and then if you have a couple of drinks before you talk about that subject like why the fuck do I have to pay attention to this and then yeah it gets in a new place it's truly like jogs the brand where it's like here's a fucking wall bigger wall is a door like all right yeah talking some real shit I'm a big believer in using as many different methods as possible to explore ideas whether it's the sensory deprivation tank or pod or psychedelics or booze or or just going places and doing things and I think as I've gotten older and I am on a schedule to put out a special every year and a half or so two years now I think it's like my last one was in October so my last one was a year in a couple months and I'm getting ready to film it in April so it'll be about a year and a half yeah that's what to me is like a good schedule came out in October yeah came out in October shot it in June so shoot to shoot is about two years yes I feel like that is if to do that I have to do things you have to have to have experiences I agree I have to force I have to not force myself to but I have to be consciously aware of being in action yeah things have to happen yeah like I'm going to Vancouver next week to do iboga oh shit and then the week after that I'm going a Bangkok is ibogaine legal in Vancouver yeah it is it should be everywhere yeah it's not something that kills people so it's supposed to be amazing for getting addictions yeah that's I'm just gonna see what it does for depression because it's gotten way better like the last year it did oppressions gotten better and which is the weird thing from I hate to say that having a successful special cured my depression well you hate yeah I don't want to be that linear but it made me it just got me out of fucking negative thinking isn't that funny but I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with you saying that because I think there's a real stigma between correlating having a successful life and achievement and being happy yeah but Ari Shaffir is a great example of that yeah I think Ari there was a chemical issue too you know Ari was on propecia for a while mm-hmm and hold on yeah well he let go he got off of it but one of the side effects of propecia is pretty severe depression yeah Ari got on some psych meds he got on some antidepressants then his career took off and he weaned himself off the antidepressants and he doesn't need them anymore yeah they are he's one of the happiest guys I know yeah but he's also very successful yeah and that's you know five years it's like money you know money can't buy you happiness it's true validation isn't nothing it's not nothing it's like it's you know esteem and the look in people's eyes and then yes that's what I'm like the look of like yeah you're yeah I can't like you're you're you're legit you and I when I if I run into you if we're passing in the hallway and you know you say I love that bit that you do in life yeah ah like I'm like I know you're a really funny guy yeah you like my thing I get happy you got me the Chris Rock said I'm a great comic wow yeah I get happy yeah positive out for me it's real I mean like as much as I like I'm not insecure in fact like I'm like go up tonight am I worried do I know how to do this no yeah no but you tell me someone who's really good says I'm good it feels good you you you feel like you're in and that's what so many of us felt like we weren't yes before we became by the way I like to say that goes away Ellen DeGeneres is a I shot this Netflix commercial with her and Chris and Seinfeld in Dave and um and so we mean Ellen or black buddies now and she's doing a new hour and she sent me 15 minutes of it on DVD it like she doesn't fuck with computers she doesn't email it just like smart so she I mean not like she's like yeah yeah she doesn't like she'll text on her phone she'll destroy Instagram whatever but she sent me the her 15 minutes on a DVD and I watched it like midnight on a Thursday and didn't text her cuz I don't know which when she goes to sleep and I woke up to a text from her going like hey did you watch it I was like yeah she's like I'm starting to get and she's like and I go yes I was like Ellen you're fucking hilarious he wrote like whew never they can't end if it ends you know that's like I've talked about this before that that dream of retirement that's sailing off in the sunset is straight-up for us yeah it's horseshit yeah you you want to do good stuff and the only way to do good stuff is to worry whether or not you're doing good stuff yeah that's the main or again I'm trying to balance the desire to do good stuff and not and having a good life yeah man you have to have balls cuz that's the the other thing that happened was like when like when Charlie Murphy died this year I was like points so fuckin that's like that was it yeah that's that that's it yeah I said that's the end of him right and like I want all I could think was did he have fun right you know your man like did he have fun because that's really the only thing that matter to all this stuff of like even the best-known comic isn't yes I mean you're like people don't think about Carlin that much anymore we're gonna man yeah like doesn't matter it doesn't it matters to the people you affect in a positive way but ultimately for you you live and then you die and are you enjoying being alive and those uncomfortable things do they help you like the uncomfortable things about Ellen like you what that's gonna do is gonna allow her through that weird sort of anxiety and insecurity it's gonna allow her to make an amazing special yeah and the same thing to be said of us my I'm one I'm gonna film in April I'm fucking terrified of writing a new Act cuz this act when I first started it a year ago it was like on Bambi legs and it was a dog shit and I would do it at the store and I would have bits that would just be clunky and they'd come out awkward yeah and then they started to take life after a month or so and then they started to grow and build too it was something that I could take on the road and now that I've gone through that whole process the idea of tossing the side and starting all over again is like yeah yes this is terrifying yeah but that's the only way you get back yeah by the way Ellen did like a half-hour Largo and then she did a half-hour of a QA and when I say this motherfucker murdered this month I mean it was like god damn like like oh that's the funniest thing she could have said followed by that being the funniest thing she could literally like in a fucking they was like watching someone in a fight just like ha ha like Q&A and fucking murderer and the people are yelling things out it was just like Ellen I have it and she was funny she was mean you don't write jokes from kindness like yeah no jokes from agitation and tell people that yeah but she's like she like even people that worked on her on her talk show her like Jesus that was like magic [Music] yeah talk show censored you know give her an option to just do something like that yeah you're gonna see what she's really capable of and and she's capable being very charming and fun she's really super true like that's what the show mostly is oh yeah it's mostly just like doing it she's just sweet yeah and then it's a comic she's not it's not just sweet you can't be it can't mute them literally you're you can't do comedy it's just I do that I do that stand up on the spot show you've done that yeah right I I did a Tuesday night and yeah I said something to someone I could look I go I'm gonna be mean I go yeah I understand that I don't mean this but when you say something stupid I have to attack you yeah this you have to be sacrificed for the greater good of the show yeah as I'm sure cool with that yeah I'm sorry that's just the way it and it's not like she's not like a dark hearted person or whatever it's like that's just kind of yeah whoo and you know yeah we all have this fear of like can I do it again it's jumping you're jumping over your Evel Knievel yeah and it's like you there really is like a fear of like can I clear the can I clear the the chasm and you're literally only as good as your last set yeah if you bomb like you better get up on stage quick and fish it hurts it stands for 20 hours yeah side effects may will sting for that shit doesn't you know I don't think it gets better it doesn't get better gets worse because then the people come to see you they expect more of you you have higher expectations you should know better ya should know better than to bomb what the hell's your problem how are you bombing still man the development of material must be done in front of an audience I mean I've write on a computer and on a notebook but the only way it really works out is in front of a crowd yeah yeah there's no that's if it's not if they don't laugh it's not comedy yeah and you don't really know for sure where the beats are you think you've got a pretty good road map from all your experience but until you do it in front of a live audience there here to tell you so Mullaney just did this Mark Twain thing for blood Herman the it was like the Mark Twain prize on PBS for David Letterman so it's like Steve Martin just Bill Murray everybody and John mulaney's doing it so he sends me his speech his like his bit and I'm reading it and it's whatever I'm like bathe like whatever a couple ideas and then so I watch it and he did a line that like killed like immediate like one of those things where they laugh for a split second and then immediately applaud like fucking laughing right we have to go immediately do applause so and I was watching this and I was like I didn't even know that was a joke like when I read it I was like man I know that was a joke so I text Mulaney I go did you was that a punchline to you and he goes nope had no idea two guys with a lot of experience no fucking idea I got like Klaus Berg I heat like the bet the highlight of his part that's so didn't even know was it joke that's the band that's what an audience does that you can't like oh now we're doing comedy I thought that was a straight I thought that was a just a metaphor you know I have an app on my phone the sound app The Voice Notes app and when I you can look at it you can edit the The Voice notes and when you do when you go into the edit mode you can see the spikes mm-hmm and so I'm going over this one bit and I look and there's this giant fucking spike in this this Harvey Weinstein bit that I have and then I realized that the giant spike is something that I didn't even know was a punchline when I wrote it yeah I was trying to set something else up but the way it played out it got the biggest fucking laugh of the entire a bit and then you have to act like you meant to do that like oh that old thing yeah like how the fuck did that and then I got offstage and Tony Hinchcliffe said go do that fucking line is so funny I'm like man I don't even know why I was saying I would I there is you did a thing that I was like that's a fucking oh the thing I like you said about is like so I'm not just like rapists just look like rapist I say shouldn't judge a book by it's like yeah but yeah yeah looks like great looks like a fucking total piece of shit yeah I mean what a trap it would be if you look like that and you weren't a piece of shit you're like I'm yeah a nice guy yeah I'm the sweetest guy have uh yet so there's no there's literally no knowing what yet until you do it like there's no it's a weird art form in that regard you know I was talking to Chris Stapleton about that I was you know he was I was saying you write all your music and then you perform it to the audience it's done uh-huh and I'm like for a comic that's so rare it's so rare that I write a bit that comes out perfect yeah and then I bring it to the stage and it literally mirrors what I wrote down yeah I mean sometimes but it's never there's also a thing I just read something or listening to something where like your brain adrenaline will make your brain do different shit meaning so you need to put your you need to like you can have the map you can have your plan but then adrenaline will be like it's like you ever watch somebody Dave did something did you see that def Comedy Jam 25th anniversary no it's not very good but but here's the goodness never again there's a sequence where Chappelle and DL Hughley Iran and Chappelle is so fucking funny it's truly breathtaking and he's improvising the whole thing and it's like so fucking breathtaking I was there with Jimmy Carr the comedian I was like this I'm it's like I when I'm impressed by David's like he must cuz I fucking know him so I was like this motherfuckers like and he's like yes but don't discount don't assume that you couldn't have done something because adrenaline does make your brain do shit it kind of makes it like superhuman yeah and super like like make logic leaps that you wouldn't but I in my in my line and like my I'm that's maybe 10% ultimately of like it's 90% written and I'll 10% say come up with someone's age yeah when I'm intoxicated a more willing to take these big leaps and and go into new rooms you know like take new paths off of stuff yeah I'll take a wild especially marijuana like there's something about being high where I'm if I'm doing a pit and especially a new bit where I'll go well what what about his mom how about this yeah that bitch's gotta be like what did I do you know and then you'll have this whole another angle that it's almost like in the moment it shows itself and then you have to chase it down you have to have the courage to chase it down live in front of a bunch of people that paid to hear you talk yeah and that's the risk you kind of that's where hubris comes in mmm yeah that's where it's like yeah I don't know I know you paid yeah this is how it's got to be done and one of the good things about comedy today is because of all these kind of conversations that we have people sort of understand the process and particularly yeah they want to see the process play out yeah like I've talked to a guy the other day that was like I came to see you while you were doing that Bruce Jenner thing and I saw it through all its incarnations I saw the early part was kind of clunky and then I saw it where it became the finished thing which was your closing bid on the special yeah and he was like I saw you over a period of like three times over eight months it was it was really interesting yeah like they like it they're cards yeah yes Chappell thinks that because of alternative comedy he believes that one of the great things about alt comedy was it brought people into the process hmm I think he's right I think it's that in podcast yeah I think podcast more so because obviously way more people listen to podcast and go to see alternative comedy shows I mean if you have one or two alternative comedy shows in the city it's a big deal like in LA I mean how many are going on a night three so what 900 people maybe that are seeing alternative comedy night whereas podcasts thousands and thousands and thousands if not millions and millions I think that there's a bunch of things going on though - it's like when you become a fan of it like I'm a fan of music and I don't really like one of the things about having Chris Stapleton and it just wanted to ask him like how do you write jokes like where they come yeah may I always ask that it's such a dumb question but it's like I don't have any idea what that's like I mean I said jokes I meant songs yeah how do you know where does the music come from do you have like a bead in your head I mean and his answer was there's a bunch of different ways he does it you know sometimes he's just in his car and the thought just comes to him he starts singing into his phone yeah you know yeah that's the Mullaney did a joke it's like an anecdote in his axe i won't i won't blow it but like Mick Jagger was hosting SNL and some Eleni was writing a song with them mm-hmm and Mulaney pitch something Mick Jagger goes now like he goes not funny Wow if it's like a like of lateral moment he's like yes but it's like okay you could kind of say whatever the fuck you want yeah I mean you're like a seven year old man who just had a baby yeah shooting loads and the models in Brazil and all over the world he just does whatever the fuck do you find speaking of which because I was saying to somebody that in in light of like The Cosby you know the thing where people become I was saying like I always say beware of a moral arbiter anyone who whole to beware of a moral pillar cuz why are you doing this right what like what benefit you're not doing it for society you're not trying to benefit you're not trying to sell the good word you're not you're literally just being superior dickhead right which was Cosby's move a hundred percent do you think have you noticed what what adulation has done to you your personality hmm have you noticed a little creep have you noticed a creep of like oh I that that's shitty or you know what I mean I don't and by the way I'm not saying this like cuz I can think of one Joe I'm just saying like are there moments where you like out like cuz I don't know I'm you're you're more popular than you know I mean like than I am so I'm just wondering like have you noticed anything happening that you really yeah that's interesting you got to be careful of it for sure yeah I think I felt it a lot more when I was younger or you know just dumber I think you're you just always aware the worst thing that you could do as a comic is lose your objectivity like whatever objectivity you have let it slip away instead of let it increase I think in order to be a good comic you have to be introspective it's obvious until it's very subjective yeah I'm sure you're sure of it right and then it's like no fuck you right that's where the hubris comes in yeah a man to think perspective you know I mean that's one of the reasons why I like pot because it makes me insecure yeah like legitimately I like I like that thinner and real durability and every like insecure define insecure vulnerability like insecure about the future about life itself about like realizing like wow like an any moment now fucking earthquake can happen at any moment now we get hit by an asteroid might the cells in my body literally only have about 50 years left of life if I'm lucky yeah everything works out great you know all that stuff you know worrying about my children worried about my family worried about you know all those things are real you know that those sort of vulnerabilities they're highlighted by marijuana and that the awareness of your own imminent demise and just life itself being so fucking uber bizarre like all those things are highlighted by marijuana which is one of the things I like about it that ruthless introspective quality of pot that people call paranoia I get paranoid well I just think that's hyper-awareness yeah which is why like hugs feel so good when you're high if you're high and you hug someone like oh yeah oh so warm like food feels better it's like you're way more aware I workout hi one of my favorite things to do is I did it yesterday I had this meeting here I did a podcast and after a meeting I had like two hours before the meeting so I smoked a joint and I hit the bag I just went over to the heavy bag and worked out for like 45 minutes and just man is like you're so aware of all the muscle tissue moving you like feel your body different it's like especially for me like for martial arts techniques I really aware of the correct way to utilize leverage and weight it all comes together it's just hyper awareness that hyper-awareness also makes you like hyper focused on yourself and your flaws and the way you interact with people I oh I never feel confident when I smoke a lot of pot I always feel vulnerable and I always feel like I should like apologize to people for something it was like something that happened like a month ago I was i but you feel like a woman basically exactly constantly apologetic well that's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't think of marijuana as being a manly thing you know marijuana is like very feminine in a lot of ways very nurturing it's really a community sort of a drug in the sense that it's not something you want to be by herself with it's something you want to be like with a community of friends it's makes you very it makes you it's a friendly drug yeah you know that's what I realized I didn't I never really I've gotten drunk I got drunk in 2005 and I realize like oh this is the value it I what I realized is it's all of us sit in a in a rowboat and we just slowly shoot holes in the boat and we all just slowly sink at the same we're just getting drained you're just sinking and sinking but you're doing it together right so it's like nice yeah and that's what your it sounds like you're describing wheatus like well the alcohols gonna come at a price there's no real price for the weed yeah for me at least I don't have the price when it's over I feel fine like I don't feel like like oh my God my head's pounding what the fuck did I do last night like that that I got with my buddies thing we had the best time we were laughing and high-fiving and howling and crying laughing but then the next morning like oh my god yeah your head it's fucking pounding pot doesn't give you that part you know yeah what was the so you had gone through a series of ketamine there oh yeah I did I did the TMS the because I was looking to at the last time I was here was a transdermal magnetic stimulation and which worked that man the problem was and I think I don't know if I talked about on here or not ih someone gave me some HGH did I tell you that human growth hormones granule magnetic stimulation 45 sessions it worked great like a little stop taking it takes like 35 minutes and they just put like electrodes on yours yeah I think that video they put they put that yeah they put video on looking Chris Rock sends me every single rape thing oh my god everything that comes every sink every page 6f literally he said why'd you do that 25 of these I don't know it's just like a thing now because then we go like there's so many guys Dario Batali yeah and by the way the more salacious they can make these stories the better they were talking about some room that Mario would take people up to and the floor is the rape room like what in the fucking laughs is the you have it yeah the you know makes me laugh is the the pictures of Louie got progressively worse and worse oh the ones they get fine yeah like the New York Times I just put up a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald fucking it's you don't define the shitty it's the guiltiest looking picture well there's so much video of him beating off like air beating on yeah you know play that video because this is you going the last time I was here this is online last time you were here yeah wow look at that man give me some volume I went to this whoa dude that sound is like an MRI yeah that's what it is yes that's right we talked about less yeah the butt okay so then the problem was after that I did HGH heard someone gave me some HGH and I was like yeah if I can take you I don't give a shit yeah I'll take a shit I'm always looking for the in advantage and I started having panic attacks from HGN yes which is a wee it's a narrow side effect but it's one of the side effects of HGH basically it like supercharged my whole system I started having panic attacks on stage well I don't like attack the night before I tape three mics why I couldn't go on stage Spade was supposed to bring me on and I've told Adam I was like I can't go on I literally couldn't breathe Wow yeah the night before yeah thankfully you killed it yes I thankfully didn't get one that night like oh my god dude trust me trust me and then I and then I had anxiety for months literally like just thanked like people say I have anxiety I'd never had anxiety I was like I'm not an anxious for it I'm wouldn't even know what that's like it's fucking miserable it's me to me it was worse than depression because you're agitated and like you just feel like static it just was like a static over your body it was like you're you just have like this like cortisol snow in your and it sucked so I went back on on Zoloft and then it ended the anxiety now but you were trying to get yourself off of that yeah so now I'm gonna go I'm I'm back I just stopped taking Zoloft like two weeks ago how did you can't I feel actually really good because oh here's what I didn't say I also micro dosed while I was on Zoloft I'm microdose shrooms like three times yeah which is actually like pretty fun it's super fun but it's like not daunting it's not that you're not like it's not trippy right you're not like oh yeah you just feel good I did that three times I did LSD once and I I'm thinking of so now I'm going off and when an interesting happened when I microdose I got significantly less angry just as like an operating principle mm-hmm like I was just like oh I'm less angry like I just didn't feel as like snappy and shitty now like for a long for like like in a over a big period I got a buddy of mine as a world champion kickboxer he remember doses and he fights on it fights high on mushrooms did a test for it or they it's just nope that's funny fucking people out while he's on mushrooms that's great and I mean better than he's ever looked in his past he said he could see things coming before they happened yeah he said it literally feels like he's got some sort of psychic ability when he's sparring like he sees what guys are doing and if you watch him fight he just looks way sharper than he's ever looked before yeah and homeboys doing mushrooms yeah and that's that so I've been I stopped taking Zoloft because you can't you can't be on it and do live again because you can you risk serotonin syndrome which is like it too much serotonin in your butt or nah yeah it went over the first guy that tell me about 5-htp before we even started selling it and on it before we started having yeah mood you were telling me about 5-htp yeah and the you were sandy danto told me about no shed yeah because I he sold me some ecstasy and he was like yeah and also take this the next day and I was like and then I like research and I was like I should just take so I still take that 5-htp I think it's good for weight loss really it like when I take 5htp I'm just not hungry it like that was the other sort of weird side effect of the micro dosing my appetite went down like significantly across the board wonder how much of the appetite is not really how much food you need but rather you need something to do mmm-hmm yeah or it's just a like and at this time of day I do this mmm but I end up like losing 10 pounds that's inch from me like you're 150 from I've lost 12 pounds from like 159 to 147 Wow yeah yeah but it's not like not starving myself or anything right you didn't feel uncomfortable no not at all yeah do you monitor your diet AUD are you eating healthy yeah like I got my blood tested probably three months ago and everything was good do you are you eating sugar and bread and things I've eaten I've stopped I've eaten I used to be a big dessert person and I kind of just like I think the mushrooms might have made me just like yeah that you don't sugar you know the thing with sugar is you don't need it for free day if you don't want it right like you just your body doesn't like you gotta fucking get us some sugar you're just like yeah good once you cut free yeah and especially if you're really conscious about what you're eating in terms of like probiotics and things that sort of help the landscape the biome landscape and make sure you've got healthy things in there I think that's so significant and the more researchers that I talked to and the more people that are nutrition experts to start talking about your gut biome and how important it is to take the proper probiotics yeah I think it affects your personality I think it affects your immune system I think it affects virtually the path of your life that you take depending upon what foods you eat it has a different effect on how you live your life well that's meditation does the same thing because you're like you get a feeling from meditation and then you're like do I want to spoil this right with like garbage thinking or behavior like let me just try to bring a bit of that into my everyday yeah i mean that's the tank for me yeah the tank is I literally forgot about tanks until you and I'm like I live like a block from flow lab you gotta go like I I went I went I think you how long you been doing this 2002 was the first time I got one wait I joined what did you start doing the podcast I think you told me about it heat you told me about it I went to float lab had the thought in the in the tank you gotta love something literally that was thought I hadn't and then I got a dog like I fuckin yeah like that that I'd like that shit like and I just forget that it exists the tanks yeah I think they're giant I think it's like one though it's it's one of those things that requires you to block off a chunk of your time so if you're busy person it's hard to yeah it's hard to pull that off but I think it's like one of the most important things you could do how often you do it well I haven't done in a long time because I took the one out of my basement and I had it installed here got a took me a few times off and we just got it put in two days ago so I haven't even been in it so I haven't been a tank at all in three months oh well two months two months I'm only thought how often do you think he'll do it now a couple days a week a couple days a week as good if I give myself two days a week I'm happy do you ever go in and just think about your daughter's yeah sure yeah yeah like is it so it's not I don't like have a plan right sometimes I have a plan like maybe I'll have a bit that I'm trying to work out and I just like this bed it's just clunky there's a part of it that's clunky I'll smoke some pot and climb in that tank and think about it there's that in the in the there's like a pre fucking syllabus for the ibogaine and it's like you need to come with questions ooh for ibogaine well for sweet lady ibogaine whoa and it's I'm like I have to write and then a friend of mine was like can you ask a question for me that's like no I don't think that's legal I cubed like eight so what Lucy needs about what's going on with her feet [Laughter] yeah but I'm like looking forward to asking asking big questions although I gotta say the last year has been very revealing for me in terms of like what what's important yeah that's valuable so how much have been affected having a dog have on you getting a dog something you love you come home to like 15 20 percent he's just a fucking good dude to have around yeah do you see that there was an article a couple weeks ago about dogs are so in bred that they're basically retarded well they have some wheat gene we look it up because it's they have some we've just ain't just piles of piles of piles and generations of everything that they have this disease that's tantamount to Down syndrome that all dogs have them yeah really Wow other than yeah I would assume other than like German shit like the most highly trained German Shepherds are like I'm not like them I've got a golden retriever that's a year old now and when I come home like he's the only one that's awake you know I'll come home from this door and you know everybody else asleep and I come home like my dude yeah he's running around me shining and kissing me and yeah just good just like good fucking good dudes yeah I take him running I love doing that and he loves it oh he loves it he gets so excited he hates going to my truck but he'll go up to the truck like he knows yeah and then I come on in he won't hop in himself but I'll pick him up like he knows he's gonna have a good time once he gets in there yeah how long is the ride just a few minutes it's not that bad does he roll up if it's longer he'll I've taken him on a 20-minute ride before and eventually old Chuck he gets he gets carsick did you see that picture of somebody tape took a selfie while their dog was throwing up holy shit this is funny golden retrievers though man he's the first golden retriever I've had they are lovely dogs they're so sweet they're just like bundles of affection and happiness and he's smart man yeah like he's he's really easy to train he wants you to like him he wants you to be happy and so like when he finds the things that you'll be happy about he you know he gravitates towards those yeah that's oh they're such good dogs man I mean I've had a bunch of different kinds of dogs in my life and I'm a big dog fan but I'm just particularly impressed with golden retrievers just so nice and he's so great with my kids too that's the other thing he's just a big big love my dog what he got Jamie oh my god oh my god I picture Solaris she caught the dog made her goddamn heart oh my god the girl's name it's not oh okay a repost yeah oh there's a few is it what does it say up there lie likely like y ly kke underscore Li that's a fucking hilarious meme that made me laugh so yeah that is pretty fucking funny okay dog yet pitbull oh there was another problem you know what else help with negative thoughts is a thing called a murder he kills homeless people for cognitive behavioral therapy and it was basically like it's this is this made me laugh like it it's so dead on they just have think on it it's just unhelpful thinking Stiles Jamie you can bring this up to actually there's a chart one of them's all-or-nothing thinking or black-and-white thinking something like if I'm not perfect I've failed either I do it right or not at all just like dumb shit so anytime I think these things there's gonna know you're disqualified like you gotta go mental filter only paying attention to certain types of evidence noticing our failures but not seeing our successes jumping to conclusions yeah hmm thinking over generalizing everything rubbish no comedy ever happens a lot of these are literally just like comedy how do you make comedy yeah you have to exaggerate jump to conclusions yeah but there really can be really destructive on a personal level you know I mean oh yeah for sure but I think everybody needs something difficult to do on top of what they already do this is my theory about stand-up comedy one of the one of the ways that I've sort of tightened up my game over the last few years is to concentrate on difficult things outside of comedy you know whether it's martial arts or whether it's yoga or bowhunting is another one for me doing things that are very difficult makes comedy a little bit easier how come because it's relatively easier yeah relatively easier but also you recognize like just didn't that doesn't seem like bowhunting and stand-up comedy would ever go together but the way they go together is an absolute reality in bowhunting and it's fucking really difficult to do yeah and in doing that it just helps you manage the difficulties of standup better the same thing with jujitsu I fell like jiu-jitsu helped me a lot with stand-up and martial arts in general because jujitsu is so much more difficult to do than comedy like physically difficult like as you're doing it you're groaning and straining and straining and just barely barely surviving certain situations and getting into positions where people are literally squeezing your fucking neck and you're about to black out yeah and it just makes the uncomfortable feeling of anticipation of stand-up it just makes it less dangerous like less scary I did a show last night at the Fonda so it's like a you know but me theatre so to speak audience probably 800 people or something and I'd done a spot on Tuesday night went great I've done spots every night for the last 10 years some degree of decent and the thoughts I was having before I went on like like no you're gonna throw up and then I'm on stage I'm like why did you think that was gonna happen fucking weirdo like none of it even came close to happening yeah but your brain is like no no he had huh this is gonna like this worst-case scenario shit that's so impractical the other thing you know what's great and Horowitz Antipas somebody was saying like yeah you can't compare your spot you're set somebody else's and it's like I can't not I heard the laughs they got right yeah I want to get those laughs or better yeah or you definitely can have someone bombs yeah in the others audience sucks and you go up there and they're great yeah like yeah like I have to compare like I can't like it's impossible not I can't act like it didn't businesses can't go like oh don't worry about that guy across the street do the exact same business the Theodore Roosevelt comparison is the thief of joy yes yeah yeah but good luck following that shit we all have to fucking you ever stick around just to see what the next guy guess we just see what do it in a pure way I try to do it as a comedy fan I still be a comedy fountain yes I've done that i bits 9 - it's 9 to 1 like doing it as a family most of the time especially the store like I want to see the person on em I think this store is oddly supportive yeah yeah yeah cuz I never feel like if I catch a bad one I never feel judged no by the guy I just brought out well that's another thing about we were talking about this the other day can't you catch a bad one at the store and everybody sort of wants to like commiserate with you like oh dude last week I couldn't get a laugh to say my fucking laugh huh and everybody wants to it's not like everyone knows like the level of comedy is so high that everyone knows that everyone's legit yeah so it's like not like Neal Brennan so yeah like he's trying out to this shit and bum yeah he's not a fucking it was his turn yeah and there are just moments I followed Eric Griffin probably a month ago and he caught a bad one and I went Eric Griffin one of the worst spots he's had in a couple months we all just like yeah I had that was me three days ago it goes down sometimes it's no not pretty yeah and they know what does it mean especially in the oh are oh no are the original room that room will fucking slap you in the face with reality like no other room in the country although I have more bad sets in the main room that I do in the LR do you yeah because I don't I don't I don't even really know I feel like the main the oh are like suits me better because I don't have to be like gregarious and did it at you can be like fucking you can be creep yeah you can be a dark creep and you can be a dark creep in that oh are yeah but it's uh it's also think I think it's incredibly valuable to have that many high level comics around you all the time yeah see that level yeah to be inspired yeah and like ethic Jesus that's a good joke you're like fuck it and whatnot even fuck why don't I think of it I'm jealous just like you know yeah it's a good person nailed it they nail yeah they give it to him that's a fair fair he did it fair and square the only time I don't feel those like guy fucking nail that why didn't I think of that the only time I don't think like that is what I'm doing enough writing when I'm doing plenty of writing those creepy like jealousy thoughts don't get in there yeah or the you know the winds Accola could have been me if I just got there first and it isn't it is that it is golf in that it's as much as you can hear the guy in front of you sink a long putt you still got it's you against you it smell like outfit doesn't mean because you killed doesn't mean I can't right of course well yeah but if you think you can't it does mean you can't yes oh I know I can tell you our before my said how I'm gonna do not even kidding I can just tell by my like my my serotonin level hmm do you ever try to break yourself out of it yeah yes there di+ visualization is good and and just like taking a moment and like trying to get some serotonin going and like feel just try to feel good for me I move my body around like bounce around in place like I jump around like I'll stretch and just get everything moving yeah my head yeah I've done that Stu shadowboxing just shuffle my feet just get my blood pumping and yeah get everything accelerating that's another thing that no one judges no one goes like the fuck is Rogan do you know I mean like no one at the store be like right we all just like I've been in conversation with people if someone goes hey I gotta get ready I'm not like yeah bro can't just walk good man bro one time Joey Diaz yelled at me for having a notebook Joey just get that weird thing like every now and then like what are you doing with fucking ketchup and fries fries tastes great on their own you don't need no fucking ketchup like every now and then he'd just get crazy with my absolute yeah I had a notebook and he goes what the fuck you doing with that notebook I go I'm working on some new shit he goes you're carrying around that fucking notebook like those other Momo's that just want you to know that they're fucking writing oh I know book get the fuck out of here with no books no Bowie is that where it is like this is important remember shit literally have to remember shit have all these new punch lines I have to I don't want to fuck this up yeah you know what the fuck you're doing come on dawg the fucking notebook out of here that again talked about and talked about hearing what the guy in front of you gets you can following him it's just like okay you guys want some fucking thoughtful notions yeah that's how I feel after him I feel like I might as well go up as like a fucking professor yeah we'll have like a briefcase like good Eve clapping well that's one of the reasons why I started taking Joey on the road with me just because I was scared to follow him yeah and I also wanted the best comedians I could work with yeah I was like uh how people come out to see me I don't want to be the only one funny I wanted I want everybody else to be forty twos I'd bring the best guys I could and and I realized that you just got to be able to ride the wave of joy yeah that's the that it's like that with anybody Yvonne had to follow Chappelle the other night and he was saying I didn't I was like scared I was like yeah you don't be there so gackt from seeing somebody that famous yeah that they're like they you just don't fuck with it yeah if you're comfortable you could ride the way but if you're insecure because oh my god I just going after Joey Diaz yeah shedding that nervousness and then feeling I took Joe in the road if he wants in New Jersey and I bombed it was like the last time I bombed going on after Joey and he went up and fucking murdered and he was fuckin with the crowd like I forget what happened but I remember that feeling as I was going up to the stage like this is not going to be good yeah it was a transitionary period in my act where I was like not quite yeah and have the bits down yeah it still works yeah but that's one of the reasons why I used to love taking him with I can't anymore he's too successful yeah but I would still love taking another rock rock does that rock is rock stone a weekend when he first had his new hour you like he's like I gotta get earthquake out here man he's like I need good sparring partners I need people that are like fucking I'm afraid to follow he's like I get earthquake and Leslie out here earthquake will murder oh yeah you don't even know it's one of those things where he's already murdered them when he gets out or like it's also high level yeah it's insane yeah he also had a thing his last special he fucked a joke up and kept it in oh really and it's like oh y'all never fucked up it's fucking really funny like which is like a hag it's a hacky thing to say other than heat the way he did it was so fucking desperate smart of him to do that to bring those guys with him yes murderer after murderer yes wise and then you have to fucking you have then you can't be like so cuz it's like I don't care about Fame I don't I didn't know who that person was and he's fucking hilarious well that in is not just about comedy and I think that relates to a lot of the problems that a lot of people have in life with what you would call haters like what a lot of haters are is they see people that are doing way better than them they see things that are happening and there's some things legitimately to hate right yeah but then there's a lot of haters that are haters about athletes or about singers or rappers or whatever a lot of it is just jealousy and they look that jealousy is they look at themselves they look at that person they don't like the way they measure up and so all they can concentrate on it's trying to find something wrong with that person mm-hmm like Trenton and and not being instead inspired yeah you know and like being inspired is so much more beneficial to you it's so much healthier and it's so much more of a strong move yeah it doesn't you're not having I think a lot of times with this like Harvey they go to that power thing I think some guys sometimes guys especially will see that see their career is revenge I think there is a little a little bit of that is worthwhile yeah but I don't I think it can poison a fucking sure poison you if you're if you're consumed by it because there's guys that we all know that are just like all they do is like you see what so-and-so got you're like yeah those guys are useless yeah again he's not it wasn't between you and him and it taints their work to that mindset that that limited growth mindset yeah that fucks with their work yeah just trying to be original and as good as you possibly know was complaining like yeah my agent didn't he moved and he did they didn't tell me and I was like dude every job you ever get is gonna be from other comics it's every job you every job I've ever gotten is from the Boston Comedy Club the Comedy Cellar and the store literally in my entire career that's crazy I mean basically I was videotaping people for casting director when I worked with Boston got a job out here working for her then then I started working for a nickel that we cast MTV singled out I got a writing job there next door was a Nickelodeon all that started talking to them got a job there me and Chappelle write half-baked him I know from Boston then I write movies for a while then we do Chappelle's Show still up still from Boston and then then I'm like in showbiz and it's all like a direct it's all the direct current from that every commercial I direct commercials it's all from that's from Chappelle's Show because it's like a long story but like the Air Jordan I did thing with them and then they they were like you should do more commercial so I do commercial and it's like it's all from your peers right right literally offering Reavers that's it that's the only people that are gonna get you that they're the people that are gonna hire you some people don't like to think that way because I think there's like this embedded mindset that used to exist when there was a limited number of jobs yeah there's like only two guys could uh you know yeah one guy is gonna be competing against someone else for The Tonight Show only one guy's gonna get it ya know that's not the case anymore now there's so much above by the way there's too much almost I mean there's it's too much to keep up with like all right just all the Netflix but can't watch all this yeah like I truly don't have know I don't know how people do it but like the that's what it comes down to it's like it's not being competitive with people it's supporting people and being inspired by the people that are really good that's fuel yeah like I was telling somebody I it's a long story but a girl I knew a girl I know who is is a producer at a TV show and she hadn't watched my Netflix special and I'm like we're friends and I was like you're you're stupid for not watching it I go eh it's insulting to me you're directly insulting me you're literally just hurting my feelings out of your way and I go and be you're in comedy it's a well-regarded thing like just inform yourself I was like I saw Schumer do a joke nine years ago that I really liked and just texted her like didn't really know her at all it was like hey that jokes fucking great and then she asked me to direct her show you know what I mean like and I'm not I didn't do it to get her to do you know I mean it's just a thing of just like yeah that's how you make relationships you just like I like that some people don't like watch a stand-up though like NORAD's what she said she's like I just don't like stand-up I was like I was like I go that's completely fair well Norton likes it but he doesn't want to be influenced so he doesn't watch any stage yeah that's fair yeah this girl just doesn't she's like I just like scripted comedy better whoa I was like a salted you she and bro to my face a bitch can't believe it hey I gotta go to the dentist go to the fucking Dennis man get your teeth did yeah so um come back after you
