a lot of people like when they do you know like they do stand-up they do jokes it's very few people telling like long stories like my dad the best favorite shoe was that look at the bar Linda is that yeah Alan would do both he would mix it up he do know but not jokes joke Kylie we do like one-liners you know he did say every thought was funny yeah Sam Kinison Bill Cosby though was probably the most influenced Bill Cosby and oddly enough Spalding Gray probably the most influential what happened to that guy didn't he die he killed himself insertional yeah I think he well I think you know I don't know if he can prove that sort of thing but they think he drowned himself off a ferry hideous leisure and whatnot but I saw his things his readings like if you've never heard or listened to there's you can listen to terrors of pleasure monster in a box of course he uncertain about came to prominence with the swimming to Cambodia but monster in a box is fucking riveting and it's literally a dude telling a long story yeah and I loved it it's like an hour and a half two hours maybe or so it's great to have something different like that and you just let you sit there and you can't I mean you can watch a video version I believe exists but I always listen to it it was just magical the idea of like a dude who is essentially telling one very long joke that has highs and lows emotional beats and makes you sad it gets real like every once in a while he throws in you're laughing and he'll just stop you dead but like my mother killed herself you know blah blah blah and he just derails the comedy and you forget like oh shit the students not a comic he's literally storytelling and so I appreciated that and I appreciate Bill Cosby my favorite comedy bits of all time is a the one side of that album to Russell my brother who I slept with it's all know if you've ever heard it but it's so fucking hysterical it's Bill Cosby's I guess how long was the side of a record back in the day 40 40 minutes or something 40 fine one side I don't remember 30 member man yeah cuz wish you would flip sides when you had a good long record right hey I want to say 30 minutes max I don't know but this week we should Google this piece is the whole side of an album and it's essentially him telling a story about him and his little brother trying to go to sleep when they were kids and the interplay with their father and it's so it is it's spellbinding like he paints the picture puts you right there in the room he never curses dude never uses a sexual innuendo nothing not know the tricks that like if I had to do it straight like him I could never do it never have done it still can't do it to this day and he drops science for that entire bit it is it's brilliant it's so it's hysterical he's absolutely adorable as the kids and he's playing both of them and stuff do yourself a favor listen to it that was very inspirational for me too I was like look I could do this if this was kind of comedy I think I could do this if you could tell Louis long stories like even his chicken hard shit the go-carts bit his Fat Albert buck buck in the ninth Street Bridge bit Bill Cosby stuff is I know some people maybe aren't into him now but oh my god before he did that show long even that go listen to the album's the alley apparently even now today stand-up is still great I've heard people that like Chris Rock was on TV talking about it once about how he just gone to see him and he was I think was in the movie comedian the Jerry Seinfeld movie think that's what it's Oh which wasn't that long ago you know ten years ago she said that Cosby was still sharp he said he goes Chris Rock who's one of the greatest ever yes it was like I feel like a fraud he goes I feel like a fraud after watching him he goes he just went up no opener for like two hours and he did two shows you know Bill Cosby's an elderly gentleman I was gonna say at this point he's got to be ladies 70 still up there killing it and the crazy thing is I don't even think he goes anywhere to try shit out I think he just writes it all down writes it at home you know and then he even said it like he does stand-up on The Tonight Show and he literally doesn't practice the stand-up he goes I know what's funny especially at now boy how crazy is that like I know it's funny I'm just gonna write out my entire monologue he's a he's an old master you know Bill Cosby will be a great guy if someone I mean I wouldn't but subscribe to all of his principles because he's really into clean comedy and I really appreciate good dirty comedy too I'm sorry I appreciate good clean comedy alike again he's a master master I can't do but that's not my favorite I gotta be honest I if I had a choice routine listening to Cosby in Kennison one of the reasons why I would choose Kennison is because he would go deep it would go take many crazy places and that's what I want to do I got a couple drinks in me I want I want to hear you talk about Jesus's last might words but oh not my left hand oh wow you know we I want to call him an ogre oh yeah talk about like keep the relationship shit he did was really really fucking yes Carlin the Carlin in his book in that sort of biography book I think he talks about Kennison either that or I was watching an interview the Carlin did with Jon Stewart before he was Jon Stewart Jon Stewart for some anniversary or some maybe an aspen comedy fest and he said that Kennison was the one that made him step his game up well Carlin was just like when I sees it very rarely did like a comic like bomb away but any loved comics but Kennison was the one that made him go shit like I should have why didn't I do that you know why don't you move to where fucking food is did you ever read his brothers book no how is it's awesome is it all broke my brother salmonberries am very honest very honest and very very insightful but one of the things that he says is that Sam got hit by a car when he was a little boy I think it was a truck and after he got hit he was never the same kid again all of a sudden he was angry and reckless so he literally became Sam Kinison because he got hit by a car they said before that he was like a normal kid but then after he got hit all of a sudden he became like reckless and wild which sometimes happens when people have head injuries that's it yeah that is crazy because a head injury might have created one of the greatest comedians in the history of the known universe right for real it's true crazy to think because he was so that's why walking wild man Silent Bob wears a coat like I wore that trench coat because of Sam Kinison really oh my god I love that's awesome son I I had a poster in my room as a kid like he had done I don't even know how they fucking got him to do this but they had in school is they this in-school advertising shit even back then we're talking 1988 and they'd have billboards where they would put posters in where there was some celebrity talking about read and it was sponsored by some fucking company and shit everyone made out somehow but ultimately the message was good whatever the message was meant to be for high school or passing by in the hallway Sam Kinison was on one of them and to think about that Sam Kinison an inspirational high school poster it's just kind of you've know Sam kinnison's work at all it's just lunacy Wow I don't know how it happened he must had a hell of an agent or manager was like I got you this gig and I don't know if anyone remembers it but me but I remember I was a huge fan I'd seen him on SNL like he did that fucking crushing I'd see him on the Rodney Dangerfield special but on SNL he came out and he fucking I had to bleep him and chin like that he was legendary already and there he was in this poster and I remember going the principal be like can I have this when they take it down and so he gave me the poster and I had it in my room for the longest time and even though it was like he couldn't curse on it was about you know fucking doing your best or whatever being your own person it was classic Kennison yell pose yeah you know ah so I had it in my room I start wearing trench coats because of Kenneth steel at little arias we went up to to New York City to when they were in Manhattan down the village was that place like vintage not vintage vinyl I'd be a record store but it was about clothes old clothes vintage clothes and bought old trench coats and shit trying to look like Sam Kinison is there a return of Jay and Silent Bob in the work any time ever no we do the podcast now we've kind of taken the characters and turned them into I guess title more than anything else did you ever have a script for it like I got another one there was like no there was no script for it but like every once a while you'd muse about like who maybe this be funny or I'd do this and they started getting more and more ridiculous and that's when I knew it was time to stop plus we're getting older it's kind of tough to pull that off fucking I love it worry yeah dude but don't rule it out if you smoke a fatty one day and you're sitting in jacuzzi and he goes it's the characters like because I like to get to see the kid people like you can do that in cartoon form I would love to see wherever that's true that's easier but I would love to see it from the place where you're at today you know I would love to see that's the English I I don't know you know of it that's I don't know that might be the danger like Jay and Silent Bob were not written by a STONER yeah at least that's what I want to ask you about at that point you know maybe they don't work if they're written by a stone I interrupted you earlier when you were talking about we we were talking about the you know what's the difference now yeah on that three years later like now you're you've been smoking weed for how long now started 30:38 1938 no yeah no 38 so that was I'm sorry 1998 yeah you started in 98 that's when you really started smoking weed I'm sorry 2008 I have two thousand eight years off yeah I was baffled cuz I thought I'd heard that Seth Rogen got you into it I was a I was those doing the math and my head going wait a sec I leave how are you you look how very at all day I'm bad at math but B I skip a decade in my head all the time all the time you oh god I forget you done checks no just when the conversation always talking about something where I'm like oh but that was like 90 something there like Kevin then we had an old decade and now we're into a new decade because you started once you start you getting to the bubbly start Megan entertainment there is no more calendar for either schedules you know shooting scheduled random or calendar you don't look at the calendar the way everybody else does and the idea of mm still is hard to sing in and then 2011 what really mm seems like we're living in the future you remember that ac/dc song no no Ace Frehley song don't you know I'm out mm really common Ace Frehley I was I think was on his solo when he was with kiss and they all branched off in his solo right but talking singing about some guy in the future he was singing about a mm man like guy flying around jet cars and shit you know I remember me and I was born in seventy and so it's very easy to do the math because you know every 10 years you were whatever the decade was you were kind of gonna kind of be that age or at least out of the number involved so I would always say like I'm in in the year 2000 I'll be 30 because I can do that very simple Matt and that seemed like such a faraway fucking concept and now we're 11 years past it yeah let me know that's like the oldest I thought I could ever imagined I could be I tell people I'm 44 and then I have to go oh that's not good doesn't matter come at seven how much longer is this going to last yeah well one it does matter manage out you know the pain or no well I ain't still in very good shape and I take care of my audition I work out but I have to if I don't take care of it it get drops off quick now that's what I'm noticing if I get injured and I can't work out for a couple weeks now whoa when I come back it's like I'm fucking starting from scratch man I come back I'm a pussy like like really just two weeks two weeks I lose like half of my cardio it's crazy two weeks you get exhausted like really quickly it's like you have to build your body back to some sort of artificial level of functionality in order to do like martial arts and things at my age and if you don't it's not gonna work anymore you should start a break son uh your your your artificial functionality must look like it must look like the bionic man compared to my best my absolute best it's just a focus thing I just been doing it since I was look I started doing martial arts when I was a real little kid so by the time I was fifteen years old when I really got really got obsessed I was I was in the sophomore year of high school and that's when I really really truly got obsessed with martial arts from that time I've always been training hmm that's a long time think about it yes for me it's like you know some people go and they play basketball some people go and you know the meet some friends and they'll go play golf together I go and do jujitsu to me it's a it's a normal thing it's like it's you know gone to and training in martial arts it's like you know it's how I get my aggressions out it's how I straighten my mind out at the end of the day it's how when you know when you're in the face of something very difficult like sparring with someone when you're doing jujitsu sparring you're forced into this sort of a moving meditation sort of a sone you know where you can only think about what you're doing you have to figure out a way to manage your resources because you're in a hand-to-hand combat battle with a skilled man you guys are going back and forth to each other you try to choke each other it's very intense but in doing that very intense thing you lose yourself in the movements and you hit this sort of a Zen state and you can only hold it for like a certain amount of time for you get fucking exhausted and the key is holding that moment for as long as possible keeping it going for as long as possible so you got to do like strength and conditioning and chin-ups and dips and fucking kettlebells and all this shit is just to to get in there so you can go deeper and deeper with the jujitsu so you can tap even when you weren't tapping them avoid being tapping you we're getting tapped so you have to tune you it's almost like your effort and your will is what powers your race car instead of just being able to you know go to the track and get a new engine or whatever the fuck you do know your effort and you will determine what your physical body can do so this crazy game that you get stuck and get addicted to and this game is easily years and you're fucking love it I love learning new shit man I love working with different kickboxing trainers and learning new shit because when you learn anything I believe it elevates everything I really believe that I believe that the more excellence you can get in your body in your mind in your day the better everything is I think that the better you'll feel the better you'll be you know you'll you'll project better energy out there you'll be nicer to people they'll be nicer to you I really believe that I think in getting great at something in finding even if just attempting to improve it something you're always going towards the right direction you're always using positive energy you're always using discipline you always getting results improving anything when you see those results that reinforces this this notion in you in your whole existence to push for it and be positive and create and and resolve things and figure things out and reach your pinnacle you know so I think all that stuff like that's why I got this tattoo I think it's all connected what is it the book of a seven ring book a five ring fiber and miyamoto musashi fucking ring yeah maybe you were the fucking next guy gonna contribute to it what is this away what do they explain the title five ranks nobody no I don't know you'd have to like really get into her oh I don't I don't know we so wait this dude was a ronin yeah he was wrong how to stir in what happens yeah - bangs bitches and writes poetry for real I just got tired of chopping people up and he wrote a book that was it he was just like you know I killed a lot now I'm just gonna yeah I wrote a book on how to be a carpenter and how to be a fucking philosopher and how to be in anything really follow that book it's an amazing book if you can figure out you see it so hard when you translate from Japanese to American to really know his words you would really have to learn Japanese and understand the difference in you know the way things are worded you know when you translate you you get a rough estimate of what the guy was saying it would have to be in the context of his culture and you take it in the context of the context of the time that he existed and it's an amazing insight into an exceptional individual it's an amazing insight into like a guy who had reached a height clearly that no one around him had with this sword fighting thing which is so intense and you there's no room for bullshit and sword fighting you can't pretend you're better than you are there's no bullshitting there's no need to talk shit okay but this is all going down with steel that's going to be moving it like 50 miles an hour towards your fucking face yeah you got to be absolutely 100% sure of the correct technique how to do how to avoid and get in there and get you shit done yes and survive this is not tennis bitch that's insane to live a life like that fighting people with fucking swords and to have done it successfully I think it was 62 times it was the number that he's supposedly killed and then he likes time to become a writer can you imagine somebody put publishes that book and somebody gives him a bad review he's just like yeah there's occasionally there's a guy like that that'll exist in martial arts which is occasional guys that will stand out above and beyond all the rest Hicks and Gracie is the last one he's the the premiere member of the Gracie family you know the Gracie's you ever heard of them the Ultimate Fighting Championship now you're completely out of the loop that's awesome yeah I'm bear I'm virgin mine Wow I knew there was people like you out there I knew yeah I heard up but that's that's not even just for UFC or mixed martial arts things that's an esports beyond hockey yan how do you do but everything else like you know they'll be like oh this guy they and they'll say a name and it's a name that I've heard for fucking years but I don't know what sport to do plays what made you what made you be this um out of what it that way yeah look what made you be that are you Lee Roque no it's not broke at all you look I'm the worst here's mine professional pool and fighting that's actually oh that's all I watch that's awesome I don't know anything else if you're a guy in another sport either you have to talk a lot of shit like that otro Cinco guy okay or you had a what does get arrested for something what does he play he's a football player okay I was gonna guess bass and then Michael Vick gets arrested for killing dogs so I know yeah totally they're definitely the infamous OJ Simpson I guess I heard of that guy yeah this like if they're you're not a boxer or a kick boxer but I know some obscure little Japanese guys at fighting some you know weird circuit over in Japan I know I know I've done the name of a lot of different fighters I've caught a lot of that information in my head but no sports guys never had that never been a sports dude wasn't very but you are because your hockey like I could say I'm not a sports do either but I obviously am because I'm into mixed martial arts I'm more about the philosophy of hockey than anything else what is not more as a Mors and I as an idea I the philosophy of hockey I mean is it's kind of a philosophy of life you have a goal someone's in your way don't let them stop you score like that's just a very base Lear I don't think it needs to go much deeper I think that's kind of the beauty the poetry of it now you tie that to one of the most graceful beautiful games on the planet and played with physical excellence I mean I understand it you need gotta be on your fucking game to step into a ring with a dude who could fucking kill you with his fist but when you dial it down to a game that's you know less lethal and stuff and more just about moving a ball and or a puck around that sport takes it's probably the greatest athleticism I think to play any sport because think about it just to stand in skates you're using more muscles than most people actually use on a regular basis so even if you're not doing anything in the you already have to be athletically inclined just to stand there now add to it they play tops what two minute shifts usually some one minute shifts to hardcore think about how hard you have to skate in order to go back and forth think about the running that you'll do on a football field or a basketball court rather let's go with a basketball court you know it's foot on trial you're used to running now try that with skates now stop now go back quick now wait go back the other way your puck chasing the whole time like that's why they have those quick shifts because who could stand that you have to be so physically in shape to do that and it's beautiful to watch people do that beautiful graceful look like shaking other skating across the giant diamond or some such shit yeah and they're on water there's this miracle this element of like what do you mean it's water like it's water but it's hard water you know just everything about it really speaks to me goddamn you're making me a hockey fan ready to go watch some fucking hockey it's humble too you know what I'm saying like hockey play most athletes are very fucking like you know big shades on and they don't want to talk to cameras and stuff a lot of a lot of a lot of dramatic Semana hockey players aren't like that occupiers man you never have to hunt a hockey player down for a quote I think when you're I think most journalists will tell you that like their whole philosophy is very beautiful it's not like any philosophy here in regards to baseball or into football any other sport philosophy is a simple Selda game that's it sell the game the are the idea of passing the game on to job what I just did a few seconds ago I sold the game so much so they were like yeah I want to see that that sounds somebody should take a clip and somebody will take a clip of this put it on the internet and use it as a promo for hockey no but you guys wait experience way more famous before anyone pay attention you have to be way more famous I think so before people that's hilarious how famous do you think you are you not aware never oh you're crazy listen you're famous as fuck dude no yes I'm now my listen listen dude I can know it's uncomfortable and you want to be all underground and shit Navis dude has Ben Affleck I have stood beside Ben Affleck and that's fucking famous that's crazy money that's ridiculous superstardom you're not that but you're famous is fuck it's a difference you're famous is fuck everyone I know knows who you are that's ridiculous you can't be so really they don't be silly I know you want to be humble but you're being silly you're famous is fuck I think most people like oh he looks familiar biopic people know if they know your name then you're famous as fuck I don't think anybody knows I think my name is um Grace forget you're cute that's cute no come on dude it's not a recognized daddy of mine yeah how do you mind my mom knows who you want so many people in this life go oh I love I love you on fucking King of Queens Kevin James you know what I'm saying to me some probably that's retards you're gonna get retards I'm gonna where you go they're an unavoidable can't factor them into the equation you gets hit by a random asteroid that's what it is when someone comes up to you calls you Kevin James that's higher rare meters happen on too many occasions for me to feel comfortable you know I fuck up with people's names - I'm always confusing one person with another person I like oh yeah shit you know but that's not literally still dying inside because I was thinking oh my god it was our wardrobe person's name Beth and I almost said Beth Pasternak and I'm like is that her name and because that's when remember you're like a you to stone I wouldn't call to stone but I'm just stoned enough yeah you give I'm if you're gonna commit to a lifestyle you you give up on short term a lot where you're just like I'm gonna need help like I do that a lot I find you were fine gee I don't know if you ever do this on stage but I tell such long fucking convoluted stories that invariably once twice per night now I'll be in the middle of something and just be like I'm like I I don't freeze I don't get scared anymore but I just literally go the fuck was I talking about I'm so sorry and someone will be like it was Jerry Muse in a bathtub like oh yes thank you anyway and boom right back in as long as they can help you out as long as they're there to help but if not dude there are moments where you're just like oh my god like I was on The Tonight Show earlier I sat down to tape a new Tonight Show and I wasn't nearly stoned enough for that you know I wish I had been more stone because I would have enjoyed more the whole time I'm sitting there just thinking like I look fat on the show I know I look found right now and no look fat and in the midst of it I did have those moments where I wasn't stoned but I had a moment where I was like what the hell was I talking when we run in tonight Joan you have one of those moments yet luckily I connected it quickly but I love doing it on stage I used to be like all you can't let people know and I'm like and let's be realistic like hey I'm 41 B I'm in the middle of a fucking labyrinth in story to begin with there's so many moving parts and B and C you throw some weed on top of that you know every once in a while maybe a gear is gonna slip and you're gonna forget a detail but as long as the audience is there to rescue you it's all good I love the fact that you're honest about it you know there's a lot of people that aren't honest about the positive effects of it and they treat it like it's a trivial thing huh you know when I when I was one of the things that I was upset with dr. drew about and I do really love dr. Drew but he's like I you want to go smoke your weed smokey weed you know like you saying look I'm not telling you not to do it easily but it's dismissive about it being a positive thing it's always like yeah you want to go do whatever you want to do with your life I'm for free will I'm for you having a good time and you want to ruin your thing and go go right ahead I'm for but that's not your you're not taking to account all the people to talk about these amazingly positive benefits that they have from it and you're one of them you know you you're always talking about mine medicine man a it's and some people be like ah just what is it fuel your creativity as it no quite the opposite like I don't think I've ever gotten a new idea from weed that I wouldn't have had otherwise what we it allows you to do is chase the good idea we're embrace it rather than let it go for fear that someone will judge it or for fear that it won't work or hey this hasn't been done yet so I find weed doesn't make me creative as much as it knocks down the inhibitions that block creativity like the reason you don't go further on that cool idea because you're afraid it's going to be judged or it won't turn out or who will ever buy this or what am I thinking or I can't pull something like this off weed you could smoke away those inhibitions is very important man that no matter how long we're here to push down all those even the dopiest fucking fears the things that you're like anything that boxes you in like you're talking about people like just sometimes keep that box tighter inside of your eyes but it's more important to kind of understand why things happen well who invented it what makes it work so to speak get to the bottom of the weed makes you more introspective it really does you start looking and you start thinking less you start know that it creates time for me and it creates time to think we have cannabinoid receptors in our brain oh I love this Go Go yo despond the THC you know we know that human use of THC goes back at least 10,000 years we you know we were constantly finding like old mummies with bags of weed with them you know there's there's people that believed that it had some part of the evolution of language you know and it's good but what the idea of this cannabinoids receptors all right the idea that you've got receptors in your brain tuned in to give you IG's to tune in to exactly what this marijuana plant is getting only that they do nothing else but that well they also they also I think cannabinoids can be fired up when you have that runner's high too I think somehow or another that's very soon you're the one telling me this fuck it I think it was when you were on the show you were going telling me like that with the drug that or the brain kicks in with something when you're about to die they say well they believe it it's called dimethyltryptamine it's produced by the liver the lungs and they believe it's produced by the pineal gland they're actually doing these specific super specific Studies on this ship right now because throughout all Eastern mysticism they've always talked about the third eye yeah I haven't seen that image course well that is where the pineal gland rests and it literally is an eyeball and sort of that from that HP lovecraft movie from beyond yeah they were going after the pilot glands a little fucking thank you man well the crazy thing about that gland is that in certain reptiles it actually has a retina and a lens like it's a fucking Ibis is an eyeball and they believe that this is what they call it the seat of the soul they believe it is the the factory of the most potent naturally produced psychedelic chemicals we don't know where exactly because you have to cut into the fucking brain like within 15 minutes of someone being dead and I think there's some some crazy roadblock to finding out exactly with today's technology where the the DMT is being manufactured in the brain so they're trying to figure out and invent new technology to directly monitor it so they can absolutely prove it well even if they don't prove it where where it's manufactured it's known that it exists in the body it's known that it's produced by several different organs and it is known that it's intensely psychedelic what I found comforting about that was the way you presented it was in the moment that you are dying your body knows it and sends it in doses you just send me an angel ya ass bitch it just dopes you the fuck out here's a notion that my body is like run he ain't gonna handle this chubby can't handle it he's gonna need to shut down boom boom boom and then the doors of perception open up like fuckin giant exploding kaleidoscopes of insane light with no boundary and you get shot through a fuckin tunnel just like a DMT trip don't give up or tit into the sound yeah man don't give up with a fire how many psychedelic experiences have you had never I mean what explain mushrooms no don't do that I've never done that but you like weed yeah I do and I'm not even judgmental better like I can't say people who do but I've never done it I don't know if it would I don't know how I would handle it oh you have much to learn gross yeah we do we're ready to straighten you out I don't know it's McKenna I don't know how high the building goes but like the floor I'm on is frightening enough but manageable Oh can't imagine what it's a well ninety-eight three years you're just sort of coming to grips with the whole thing you know that your your life is greatly enhanced and far more fascinating when you're high yeah and then you start thinking about well why aren't more people talking about the benefits of this incredible drug and why is it being demonized and you start processing in your mind and mushrooms are that times a million and then DMT is mushrooms times a million plus aliens so that's what it is it's like does anyone not come back yeah maybe you got to be a weak bitch but you might get lost if you just look at everybody I'm not scared of the woods bro I go out in the woods I'll go out in the woods to learn something about myself and that's what it is it's like every every intense psychedelic experience is like what you're the benefits that you're getting from marijuana is like a slow IV drip right this is like someone's sticking a fucking turkey baster up your asshole and shoving it scary lunging in your century resist or scared well it's supposed to be scary because as you said when you heard that your father screamed to death you only get one shot at this yeah you know and that that fear is the fear of losing control which is absolutely inevitable you know you know it I know it and but the psychedelic experiences are like it's like it allows you to almost go through a death experience several times not to the point where you feel dead but to the point where your your whole view of the world is so shattered your ego is so you or your actual worth in your actual piece in this puzzle is made so clear and it's so humbling and it's so confusing and it's so enlightening and it's so encouraging and it's so loving and it's so frightening all at the same time all impossible to describe the images and the feeling you get literally probably are responsible for human evolution they're selling the game land Terence Mckenna believed that the reason and he had this this documented down to climate change he believed that the reason why human beings evolved from other hominids is that they started experimenting with new food sources and eating psilocybin mushrooms and he has it all down to when the the rainforest receded and became grasslands because the climate change that's when the monkeys ran out of food and they started in grasslands it's not as rich as the rainforest so they had to fucking experiment new food sources and that's when all these cows were walking around eating the grass cows shit out the shit shit grows mushrooms on a monkeys eat the mushrooms monkeys figure out all kinds of different shit like language and coordination and how to make tools and how to fucking throw rocks at things and kill them tools yeah we were just on the ocean back tool no but my wife told me mr. fucking capture my imagination was just kind of write up the salad you see this dolphin story about the girls no-oh-oh they use them to fish yes yeah I did hear about that how fuckin spellbinding is that these dolphins are taking these cocktails which that was the second most surprising thing about the story to me there was a picture it's conch-shells fucking huge I think a conch shells is like being like this but it's funny but yeah so that's thing like wow I'm like then event these dolphins they found them like they thought they used to go under the conch shells to fish out anything that wasn't living in their fish or what have you but they've discovered that they're using them as tools as trapping tools like using them to kind of herd fish and then cup them and then eat out of it so using them to capture and to dig like not and very specific not just like oh he's balancing a conch shell they're using it they're figuring tools out how did dolphins get so fucking smart without thumbs it's really interesting when you think about it Gators in the ocean yeah I don't have to open door they're supposed to be really intelligent like we don't exactly know how intelligent and some people because I think they're cerebral cortexes some large percentage larger than a human beings like something like forty percent larger than a human beings they have it what would that mean I don't know they've known a new reason better I don't know no I don't think so I think they just have like such a different world as far as their coordination and their physical movement and like neanderthal had a bigger brain than a human being and one of the dummer than us for sure but they needed a bigger brain to operate that fucking ridiculous body like Neanderthals were very different than people there were five foot two two hundred pounds of solid muscle and bone there were these big like half chimp people you know like if you look at like like drawings in the end it's all like they don't really resemble I mean they do but they don't you know look they got your legs into they're standing upright kinda they would have fucked us up if it was just like one-on-one brawls between the inner dolls and people most likely Neanderthals would have fucked us up really yeah there's some this is some serious genetic what was I talking about what did I talk as it sounds like yeah what was I talking about you're talking about crap Neanderthal man big brain needed big brain to operate that big body Oh dolphins brains are larger it could be just to meet that incredible body they have you just hit a pothole my friend yeah yeah totally thank you for was there able to save you thank you and that's what it's a beautiful thing about letting the audience down to your high when you do those QAS do you let them know listen I just need you as a net the nice thing about always talking about being stoned is people just assume that at all times you are so there's a nice blanket for everything did you ever get to the point when you first started getting high we got to Hynde yes really paranoid yes yes well not parents always quit no not quit but I thought I'd died when I thought I was going to die I got really stunned with my friend I'm Jim Jackman and he came over and we were out on the deck I'm at my house night out stars and she had sitting there smoking and I'd already spoke before you got there and then he came and I was like I'll smoke another when this is in the days before I would smoke that much so two joints within the span of like what an hour and a half or something like that and by the time I got to burn down to the bottom of the second one I was like really really really really really really fucked up and I kept telling him I was like I think this is it dude I got a late I got a lay down like I I think my heart might stop tonight and he's like you want me to do anything I was like no let me just lay down I laid down next to the pool just on the deck looking up the Stars and I was like I'm too high dangerously high I don't know what it was I'd never really experienced that again well that debt what do you think it was well first of all you probably baboon heart explaining untamed hurt the movie yeah dancing heart is that what I have his mother never told me he's a silly do I get to fuck Marissa Tomei as well that was that was that one who was the boy had a baboon heart yeah he had a bad heart in his parents told me had a baboon they told me like every place those those rookie High's you don't really achieve those those rookie High's once you get a tolerance those rookie highs are like getting shot into the center of the universe when you Kris Maguire when we got Kris Maguire High one night behind the Comedy Store you remember the story you were there with me Chris when Chris is a buddy of mine from way back who never gets eyes at comic and usually has a couple of beers that's he'll get high if you force him to all right I'll take a hit of this he was a stone-cold rookie and he took two hits of was it was probably trainwreck because that's all we ever smoked is ridiculous super space philosopher and then I came back to him like 20 minutes later because I got a problem I got a real problem here he goes this is not weed somebody put something in this man like I'm Sony put something in this I'm Tony this is not pot I've been hard before this is not pot song this is serious man I'm serious somebody put something in this I'm like no dude dude dude dude tweets that good yeah the weed that good he's like no way there can't be real he didn't believe it I didn't believe it because that rookie hi the rookie hi is it's terrifying I mean you might as well be on ecstasy it was you might as well be in a sense I I can't say that I miss it though like I enjoy I mean I never feel I always said I don't get stoned that's for teenagers or gets centered I enjoy where I get now great place great for conversation great for like I said knocking over the inhibitions and whatnot I'm not quite I don't know if I'm ready to open third eye but if anyone sold me closer to it it's you you don't need to do it nobody needs to do anything man that's all nonsense you'll find your own place we can't do it a shot but it sounds appetizing I mean it's like look I'm it I am something of a journeyer now and at the end of the day it's not that far removed we're not talking it's not you going like you should do some bumps and fucking rails dude you're talking about another thing that's very close to what I'm doing hundred percent right this is mushrooms it's very much the same as what you're doing it's all the same thing it's it's forcing you into put it in a shake like yeah make an orange kind of juice thing where you grind it up to an orange if you want to eat it it gets really crazy because it lasts for like six hours it's like a slow DMT release what do you do can't eat it though if you eat it you have to eat it with an MAO inhibitor and you've got to know something else how to brew that correctly it's like you can't eat it when you when you or when you take it in or Lacey DMT exists apparently in so many different plants that our body has a built-in defense mechanism for it it's called mono a mean oxidase so when you eat something like say if you eat grass that has DMT in it like sheep if they eat that grass will die it's really kind of crazy like sheep if they eat grass as DMT in it they just fucking fall on their back and stick their legs up and they tremble in the air it's really kind of nutty but human beings have figured out a way to process it in our stomachs and that's what this mono amine oxidase is that's why we can eat it in so many different plants but yet non-psychoactive what these guys in the Amazon they figured out a way to make it psychoactive when you eat it by combining this plant that has is one drug with an MAO inhibitor so it kills the monoamine oxidase in your stomach and it allows your stomach to absorb this drug directly so you have to take something in order and you're gonna puke and you're gonna be in the jungle there's no refrigerators dude this is all bad it's a big step it's a big step so you got to be a real seeker if you want to do this I don't want mushroom I'm just on some fun that's the oral DMT some mosquito KO shit that's the oral DMT what do you mean your mushrooms first don't even what wait what is that my mushroom you chew right yeah you just need a little mushroom or you can make your first trip don't could I make our gastronomy no chariman you can eat it with them apples are the same bottle - yeah yeah yeah like it won't be like you I don't it you really shouldn't have food in your stomach but as long as that is the only food that and it'll be like probably diminish the effects very slightly but ultimately it's all gonna get into your bloodstream schedule your a bad trip bad trips are there they're actually uh it doesn't seem like it at the time but they're actually almost all beneficial as long as you don't go completely crazy what you learn from a bad trip is that you've got some issues man you get some shit that's bugging you you get some some seeds you've got some imbalances in your mind and you're not focusing on them that's usually what it is and it comes out hearts racing around nightmarish form it comes up in the nightmarish clarity that's what psychedelic experiences really do when you have something that's really fucking with you that it's such a primary focus inside your mind that when you open up these doors to psychedelic dimensions your mind is going to grab that shit and shove it in your face and go what the fuck is this why you hiding this from it why don't you get this shit out of the way why do you think Oscar De La Hoya came clean and said that he was wearing women's underwear in those photos then it was real because every night that the fucking truth is knocking him on the head dude you were in chicks underwear just fucking say it I can't he can't I can't tossing and sweating if he ate a pot brownie he would have been forced to admit it like right away rips you down yeah strips you down you know and you you you have a strong mushroom trip managed strips you down you see what they describe as the wiring under the board you know you see things in a different perspective it's it's it's an impossible perspective it shouldn't be first of all it shouldn't exist and second of all it shouldn't be so easy to get to all you have to do is eat this stuff you eat this stuff and wait an hour and 20 minutes and also you're literally in an impossible describe different world that shouldn't exist it can't be real because it violates everything you know about life when you're closing your eyes everywhere you look is something more and more impossible and there's information coming at you all the answers to all the world's problems but it's like slippery fish and you're standing in a river and you can't fucking hold on to many of it there's just too many fucking fish coming your way man there's the water and the information is hitting you like the fucking River you're selling the game you're selling again it's not for everybody but it's for you that's what I say it's not for everybody but it's for you there's great men who have learned incredible things from psychedelic trips and there's a guy named Graham Hancock who's going to be doing the podcast and he contacted me in the email I just emailed him back but he says genius writer who wrote these fascinating books about ancient human history all the fingerprints of the gods it's all about these ancient structures that point to the very plausible idea that the human race has been around way longer than we like to think and that civilization has had peaks and valleys where we were almost wiped out and we had to rebuild a new and he claims to be kinda like we were talking about before like return to the cities me like where these buildings come sure but in his case it was more of like I think what they're they're mostly pointing towards giant cataclysmic disasters that have you know all but wiped out a huge percentage of the human race and then people have to start all over again I mean the concept of what if today okay mm like the matrix sure third Matrix movie was that it it was that it was that what happened in the third Matrix they were like this is you know permutation of a fucking equation that it's essentially the message was this happened this is a 16th time we've done this like we keep running you guys into that's may strike at you guys there's a taste yeah that's based on an ancient Hindu system or it's an Indian system called the eel ugh that's what I think I don't know the full thing our friend Duncan's like an expert in this shit but what do you explain it to me is that this is Kali Yuga and the Kali Yuga is like the the most chaotic stage of the human existence and we have this normal natural progression from like you know sensible to wild to crazy - completely out of control which is where we are now into the next stage is some sort of an Enlightenment some sort of a learning from this some sort of a next passage that goes through and that the idea is that we're that humanity is in this continuous cycle and that it's you know we like to think of ourselves it hasn't having a direct linear projection from monkey to human being in 2011 but in fact it may have hit this peak thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago and then been shut down by some horrible disaster that killed almost everybody and that almost everybody forgets about it because you kill like half the fucking people and manda you know what good luck good luck piecing things together writing things down I know paper gets disappears they burn the Library of Alexandria they lost all the records for Egypt everything they have left is just shit carved in snow or carved in stone rather it's like you know you wouldn't want to really get the full history of the human race it's really complicated it's like you we don't really know what happened 10,000 years ago we don't really know what happened 15 20,000 and in the course of the universe or the course of the life of this planet that's a fucking half of the blink of the eye it's almost like as a race we have woken up at a certain level where we started writing things down like we call it a thousand years ago whatever the fuck it was where people really started writing things down it's almost like we're just slowly piecing this fucking thing together as it's moving it's moving in a direction people are just starting to write things down okay this is what happens in this business then the next people come along like okay they already figured this out okay what else can we figure out then we got to figure this out they're all moving along as life is moving constantly trying to riad to this fucking pile of awakening I try to describe this life that were just born in the middle of mid momentum hit the ground running as soon as you could walk your golf to school and you're a fucking cog in the wheel boom and in you know and very little time to sit down and think about what the fuck it really is the notion of it's all occurring like we're waking up the Renaissance of sorts with somebody writing it down number one I thought that was really sweet but number two the notion of doing that while you're moving it like a moving forward still if it seems like an odd time and tell people like wait let me catch up and write everything down so far yeah like they'd have to start fucking swimming you're absolutely right that's kind of evocative that's really beautiful image well done Thanks yeah I'm a writer I appreciate some good words as well done you took me right fucking there you sold the game I mean but that is what that is what we're doing right yeah we try yeah think I don't know I've boy now you're made to move in one direction the human deliver but if you just if you just look at the idea that we're constantly creating new things constantly trying to improve on the technology it's gonna reach some fucking nutty point sometime in the future I'm seeing steak over yeah man reggae kurtzweil yeah reycarts wheeled you know he's one of those futurists that believes in it a lot of other guys who have a very unrolling you know there's a lot of people that you know think that we have been so desensitized by the Terminator being a movie right we think it's silly that we don't recognize that this is a fucking real problems guy that could be what we what are we thinking that we're gonna create something that's gonna have autonomy we're gonna create something that has you we're gonna want to know if it can turn itself on we're gonna want to figure that out we're gonna want to know if we can make something could repair itself we're gonna want to know if we can make something that can clone itself given enough time with human beings mucking around with shit we're eventually gonna hit that point man you're talking about singularity yeah yeah son it's inevitable it seems I you know like it's a captivating notion I had the I forget either time or Newsweek did a wonderful article on it but the way they described it I thought was very evocative and as much as they said think about how like the first computer you know filled a couple rooms and Itzik waiting power wasn't even a tenth of what your phone can do right now and that was going back to what how many years ago is that 50 60 years ago so in that piece they said imagine what's going to be in 30 years from now from this moment you like this phone exists the phone the computer the outs outs with the piece I mean Steve Jobs said it himself a couple months back he was like when he was talking about doing the cloud he's like the hardware is not the soul anymore it's just a conduit and whatnot it's not gonna be ringtones you know the future is gonna be you're gonna be able to talk to each other I'm gonna be able to go dude where are you and people gonna get upset if you don't let them do that like girls are gonna get upset why can't I just talk to you whenever I want to talk to you what like shiny yeah like you want this do you want no you want the fucking cell phone you want the ring you want a ring so you can look at it and decide whether or not to answer but if someone good someone can make the cell phone ring honest I thought you were saying like in the future you won't need phone yeah it was jelly okay might not even have to be a phone it might not you're right it might not even have to be fun but I think initially it's gonna start out with ringtones the first thing that's gonna be the dam' is gonna break is instead of a ringtone what why can't they set it up so I can talk to you in the ringtone hey Kevin it's me Joe pick up the phone dude this is fucking super important I hate to be bugging you but pick up the phone almost like an answering this like a pre ransom yeah that's what you're hearing when the phone rings you're hearing your friend say dude pick up the fucking phone right now almost like old school answering machine you know that will be the first option and people would get that because they say honey what if it's an emergency and the some shit goes down and I need to get in touch with you yeah you're right okay and then people go with the fuck where are you bitch I'm fucking calling you right now I'm gonna keep calling you every with that fucking dude and you'll you'll be able to harass that person literally yell at them until they shut their fucking phone off that would be step one yeah and then eventually there will be no more phone they're gonna figure out some way whether it's a neural implant or you know yeah I think it's neural implants they were implying 30 years from now the phone will be insertable into your she's a tiny it'll be like this and there's that material what does it call that's the shit that's like as thin of saran fiber-optics I don't know if that's it it's this new material it's about thin as a probably can't be that new no fiber optics is old as fuck that's in and out like it's the talker myself it's thin it like they showed a piece of it looks like a piece of saran but it's the strength of it is like fucking concrete like sixteen layers of concrete and they're saying it also has foldability so you can roll it up and bundle it up and it's also made of sand or whatever you know fucking silicon so it's conductive so they're saying imagine you had like this little yeah this looks kind of so I don't know what these are but these ties next time is that what it is I'm I want to smell it if you had this and you could do this with it or you could just roll it up real tight and stick it in your ear this would be your phone they're like shape is no longer a problem like this is the material it's like when you watch the fucking Batman Begins he's got that memory cloth for the cape or yeah electric charge through it and it tightens yeah same thing here they only you need to tighten it they're like it's all flexible everything all the conductors are inside so it'll do exactly what it needs they have that for armor for motorcycle riders now like I think I have some shit when you hit the ground the impact of like flattens it makes it hard yeah I don't know if that's like in testing or if that's access for sale has Stan had I saw that video but one of the things they've come out recently with and I know a lot of people say like man you guys always talk about fucking soon you already I'm tired of hearing this like that's like a number-one complaint in the podcast and I admit it because I fucking drone on about it why because I yeah yeah and when I see things like this ok look artificial skin made from spider silk yeah bulletproof isn't that amazing dude I'm gonna get bulletproof skin it's gonna be awesome I can't wait until this is legal I'm gonna get a full bot they're gonna skin me they're gonna try to keep me alive by they skin me and then they replace your skin with bulletproof spiders get silk skin how crazy and many people are gonna sign up for that you don't want to be an early adopter it's like fake lips read the ingredient alert that shit down you know you don't fucking big stitches under your armpits yeah they left giant fucking scars dude I like my new skin it's bulletproof and everything but a fucking hate the scars read how they make it - that's goat's milk they put the ends were they they were you know Jean they fucked with the genetics the DNA if you will it's amazing man with of this weird goat's milk made it like more like spider so whatever the Goku you know whatever they milk out of the goat they spin into this fucking hard ass substance that I thought was stronger than Kevlar no dope is nature yeah this crazy little giant little fucking insect thing this weird abdomen produces this shit mmm there was a line in this great Batman it was a Swamp Thing issue that Batman was in years ago the Alan Moore wrote where Swamp Thing you know he's an elemental he's got the power of nature on his side and what not big Swamp Thing fan back in the dizzay so he attacks Gotham they have his woman they've tied up a br cane they've kept her in jail they've arrested her because she's cohabitated with the vegetative humanoid really yeah The Swamp Thing and so they put her in jail she was supposed to be arrested in Houma and they arrest her in Gotham instead and swamp things like we want to release and they were like we can she's you know she committed a crime she's gonna be healthy or on trial whatnot and Swamp Thing takes it slowly takes over Gotham he warns them you know it appears from like can make himself as you know out of any vegetative material whatsoever turns into a giant head and it's just like release the woman or I will take the city you know and they end the one issue the part one of like you know you see Gotham start falling into jungle like he just over vegetate sever ething and people just go back to fucking nature it takes the takes the city and turns it back into the jungle in the last panel is a high view of all this of course and standing on a gargoyle is the one motherfucker who does not want anything to go back to the jungle and it's Batman powerful fucking book but a one-point second issue Swamp Thing has this line where he goes just like if nature but shrugged you'd be all you'd all be gone or something very powerful like that but it's the if nature but shrug longing that always got me because he was talking about we think we command everything we think we're we've mastered shit we know we're done but it's just that you talked about before a cataclysmic event that wipes out half the planet or something like that that's if nature but shrugs it happens out here you know when there tremors the earthquakes were reminded all the time that surface fleas as George Carlin described us but when you see nature going crazy with the weather and whatnot he starts sitting there going on like do you remember that George Carlin bit where he talked about how the planets fine the people are fucked I mean it's a legendary bit but yeah you know he starts theorizing on like the planet trying to pick us off with disease and shit like that and and you start saying every time I see a natural disaster it's all I could think about it was just like the planets after us again they found the world's largest pyramid by volume in Guatemala experiment they found it a couple years ago its enormous by volume ago cigarette whereas a pyramid it's a like a Mayan pyramid you know the Mayan pyramids they weren't smooth like the Egyptian pyramids but they all went to that same shape essentially well they found it in Guatemala covered in jungle I mean this is just a totally lost amazing civilization covered in jungle and they think there might be thousands of these thousands of these all throughout South America thousands of lost temples and pyramids this incredible civilization that existed that made these immense structures in a place that's so nuts that the the jungle just over grew everything to the point where they thought it was a mountain they thought it was a mountain and they start excavating it and find out it's the biggest fucking pyramid by volume on earth when was a 2009 apparently they had it on CNN I was uh somebody just posted it recently and I tweeted it it's a it says though the thing on YouTube is world's largest pyramid discovered like they lost this whole thing man people had moved out of there so much to the point where there was nothing living there it was just trees and the whole thing just filled with grass and trees and someone had to come along thousands of years later and kick something over and go what's this dig a little hole hey man this is a brick hey bring over a shovel and the next thing you know they like the fuck is this you maniac slowly taking up to imagine what that what that experience must be like of finding something like this phenomenal I mean well I did well it's the opposite of whatever Geraldo Rivera felt when it opened up al capone's Walton was like nothing there's nothing in here but the shock that that's this could be left behind the shock that this is you know thousands of years ago we can't even really wrap our heads around that they built this shit and it all went bad and the fucking jungle overtook the land you know you go Atlantis you go as far back as Atlantis or no do I believe in Atlantis well there's some archaeologists that believe they found it off a Spain in fact they have concentric rings that they've found in a satellite view of the ocean they somehow another you know they can they can see like the topography of the ocean from space and in this satellite view they they found this place that literally matches the geography matches the area that it would be matches the local layer matches you know there's this there's folk layer that is attached to it you know that you could be a tribute to history and you could say it's actual history so they believe that they have found Atlantis and what lead what had what had happened to it just is this Lake place was also very subject to tsunamis it's had many tsunamis before and they think that's most likely what happened was that you know these people lived on a part of the sea they had an advanced civilization it got really prosperous but they weren't aware yet of tsunamis and check along those lines like if you go a few thousand years without a tsunami it's not unheard of it could mean the like about the world because now it doesn't like what hasn't happened in a few thousand years that we're unaware of and suddenly is gonna happen again well especially on the west coast man I mean we know then some big ones have hit I believe up at as far north as like Seattle and Portland Oregon like hundreds of years ago that place got fucked up by tsunamis it's real possible I mean the ocean is gigantic and it's right there but if my point is that if a few hundred years go by and there's no tsunami that's not unusual so if this civilization was allowed to prosper and grow in a few hundred years it could have been super advanced we know that they could do a bunch of things back in you know ten thousand plus years ago that we didn't think they could do and we're more and more figuring out as time goes on but they might have been way more advanced and we ever gave him credit for they might have even had telescopes like there's there's people that believed that they found lenses that they get attribute to being ground down and some say that they're not strong enough to to actually work as a telescope but it could have been you know one of many they could have evolved if they came up with this initial idea and you found a bad version of it just the fact that they had figured out that they can make something at a crystal and look through it that's some pretty advanced shit what are you looking for what are you doing with that is you sure that's just ornamental and were they making telescopes were they making microscopes what the fuck were they doing well clearly it says there there it's an it's they're examining yes and the unexamined life is not worth living so there are philosophical people they went they were looking for answers so it wasn't enough to just be like feed me with me sex it was enough to be like I want to look beyond our world or deeper into her right now and a totally different way they did it from the way we did it we have this whole petrochemical way of viewing the world we think that's the only way to do it and it may not be there maybe that there's some civilizations that have reached some staggering heights without the use of that and we just don't know how the fuck they did it we mean we don't know how they moved a lot of the great stones to make giant structures throughout history that's this great this guy Graham Hancock that's like his his specialty on this thing and he he wrote a book called supernatural all about his experiences with this ayahuasca this drinking his brew and all his experiences with psychedelics and how empowering they've been to him and how he believes that it's very likely that they are this source of human human culture and human knowledge and human growth and it started such a source of self-awareness that it probably started with psychedelic experiences and its knees not the only one to say this McKenna believed it as I said before and a lot of people echo it but I just think I think everyone who's creative everyone who is an artist everyone who is a thinker you deserve to go through an experience with someone who knows what they're doing you that's why it should be legal and there should be shamans and there should be someone who runs the center that can evaluate whether or not first of all you're psychologically capable of handling such an experience but give you the proper dosage keep you supervision it should be something that people encourage because it makes you a better person I mean back in the day that person existed it was the medicine man shamans existence yeah in the Amazon right now the guys that make the ayahuasca well I can't well I'm I guess there's no money in shamanism is that why that's too tricky no there's no money in it Geneva if there was money they put you in jail if you sort of getting money for being a shaman they'll fucking lock you up what are you doing shaman what what are you getting we buddy given these fucking people lock him up shit moe check his house come on what uh yeah I guess you can't practice now with medicine even especially holistic medicine they get weird first of all I guarantee you on Twitter tonight you would be getting thousands of people telling you to do mushrooms yeah no doubt that's can happen yeah I'm telling you've got look I'm 41 you've got me a lot closer than anybody else and my wife who I've been married to and fucking for 12 and respectable 13 Wow you argued late everybody Bobby told me years ago she's like you would really love mushrooms I can't believe you've never done mushrooms she's like we should get mushrooms and do them together one day I don't think I could you're a very unusual thinker and I think it would only aid in your thought process it'd be fascinating you're so down to earth as it is dude you're such a normal guy like I don't know how you managed to navigate the entire system of an ear in the movie system which i think is even more ridiculous than my system my sister is yeah I'm on the fringes I mean like fucking I mean you know sports commentary and stand-up comedy that's really what I occasionally Fear Factor that's my way I'm fringed you're deep into the belly of bullshit but it's amazing that you've been able to do that it's amazing been involved with a-list actors you just have to give up ego and you have to be willing to accept less you got to manage your expectation something I learned by being my wife all these years this was a chick who didn't want to marry a fat guy but she met one who she really liked he is good in all other ways except for that one she manage your expectations and it all worked out for you no Gallic I can deal with that but the rest of the package is good you manage your expectations and you can do that sort of thing so for me I always trying to keep the ego in check manage the expectations expectations in this business or everyone should be pay attention to me I should be at the epicenter of everything and I'm what's hot and blah blah blah and I've always accepted the fact that that was never going to move me so it was always content to just dwell out here on the fringes and when you're on the fringes it's I wouldn't say you're incorruptible but there's people aren't that inch stood in corrupting you and and you can also watch the corruption go on deep in the center of the bullshit as you say and so while you're kind of not above it but just outside of it it's a lot easier to see it happening and stay away from it when you see a movie like Conan do you go oh there must have been a mess to work on and now when I see it I was just like I see I Manion see it but if I saw a movie like Conan I would be like oh man could you imagine how many people put in so much time into this and then it didn't take off like that's I see the expenses all I see now is the money i watch any movie and I'm just like the dude was a perfect Conan too though could have done it should have done it why didn't that work dude I saw that trailer and I was just like all right I'm a huge fan of the Arnold Conan that was my Conan I didn't even I wasn't aware they were making a cone a movie until I saw the trailer I was like what the fuck why would anyone bother and I watched it I was like oh you know what this is a lot closer to the real Conan than fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger it was very close it just got stupid too many times it just lost it went off the track and into the woods too many times was everything dude as a character was great he would have been an awesome Conan in the under the right direction with the right script but I wrote a read rather something that the guy who made it wrote and he talked about yeah original script and how it got butchered all the way and that's make sense like when you see something so disjointed where so much so many parts of it were awesome like the little kid in the beginning that was fuckin badass the didn't say about the new Coney yeah you didn't do something to save it but if you do see it this part is what I had here this fan of the old Coney - I'm a Robert E Howard fan man so you go back yet deeper sorry so as a Howard fan did you see was that movie about him with Rene Zellweger and you know what I didn't offer you bought that movie I have it in the back of my fucking shelf my DVD shelf and I've never watched things on the world I forget but anyway if as a fan as a Howard fan did you like the Arnold Conan or did you feel like I sit like reading The Shining book versus the pooh brook shining it's like they cartoon to find it for sure the Conan was much more ruthless and brutal and bloody and it was way crazy like I say softened him you feel oh yeah both of them softened him yeah I mean he was he was you know like it was a compassionate guy and he always did the right thing but he was fuckin hacking heads off left and right I mean it was just a mean he was just a barbarian making his way through magic and sorcery and monsters and fucking hordes of ogres and I mean there were just crazy ass fucking wild stories Robert E Howard was a bad motherfucker but he was ultimately crazy and one of blown in his own brains out I think he was like 36 or not the whole wide world that's the name of the movie I think the whole Zeller s yeah he killed himself yeah yeah yeah he just was so into his fucking his world of fantasy he was so good at but his real life just sucked man his real life he just was miserable he hated it and he made this character this thing with whatever pain that he was going through in his real life he poured it into this character being powerful you know it's just them he they weren't just straight sci-fi fantasy books they were so consistent you know there were some great ones man I fuckin loved him he would buy him the paperbacks with the Frank Frazetta fucking oil paintings on the cover of him holy shit yes you know I mean those were books man that was an amazing shit that you read the comics as well yeah I did one of my saddest moments of my life is when I was so poor when I was a struggling comedian that I had to sell all my comic books here which was gonna sold everything I sold my spider-man is like my Conan's mostly Marvel I had Marvel and then I had a lot of like creepy and eerie you know those independent Maggie's would you make rent just rent for a month early I probably got some food got 150 bucks or everything I mean talking years of collecting the yeah totally screwed me but I needed the money it's probably hard to sell man you know I mean it's probably got to go through a lot he needs to make some money off of it I put together we're trying to make clerks I knew I was gonna money to make it and I was a big comic book fan I didn't been collecting hardcore for that long was born all modern age stuff I didn't go back and buy any gold in her silver age but still I did an evaluation the collection man it was like 20,000 and change or whatever $20,000 with the comic books based on the book value book value so I said okay please hurry I'm gonna go in the yeah of course over over maybe Overstreet I might have used on Netflix so I I go okay this collection then I'll sell it for 10k and so I go to a bunch of comic book shows and a bunch of comic book dealers and stores and this is 1991-92 let's say 9 no 93 94 cuz no 92 93 92 and I give them my full catalog of everything I have with all the prices next to it although you know the guide prices and then the wrap-up of 10 thousand bucks like you know and it's a collection that's worth more than that you could have for 10k and nobody of course bit the only people that bit was this comic book store in Middletown which was called blood holy crap I'm getting old and I can't remember but in any event they took they took my comics they gave me $2,000 to wait for it in store credit oh so what I would do is sell my store credit to my friend Walt Flanagan I'd be like you go in comics plus that's what the name of store you go in comics plus you buy $100 worth of comics use my credit then give me 80 bucks cash so he was always getting like 20% off so I wasn't even getting the full 2k Wow god damn no but it made it paid for clerks so there you go pay for a few bills that paid for clerks until Miramax pick clerks up and then there was that so you know I never felt bad letting go to collection because it ultimately financed the thing that made everything else possible and then years later you know I just figured like if I want the books I go back get them and I collected the ones I did one again for then years later I just bought a comic book store and that was like buying an is he bought a comic book store yeah I got one in Red Bank New Jersey called Jaynes on Bob's secret stash we have one out here in Westwood for a little while but my friend got bored of running and then we wound up shuttering it but the one back east has been open since like 97 that podcast tells Steve Dave that my friends got the show of on AMC that that that's they've record that at that compost how much better are comic books on weed I haven't really written I haven't read one yet I've written a bunch and there's so much more fun to write on weed so you haven't read any since you've been smoking weed no I mean I've been in a real non audience mode for the last few years I don't I don't read as much as I used to I don't watch TV as much as I just create your own check I've been on a real creation jag and you know comes and goes I think in cycles the old long you stick around the more you realize it like creatively fertile like in the early part of my career and then I get in a career management middle a career in pay perhaps not as fertile the ideas aren't as cool maybe you start thinking more about like well I got to eat I got to make sure I got another job into this but now I'm back into a creatively fertile period where it's just like i'ma try this let me try this you get a certain amount of respectability we really do whatever you want yeah I think that's what you hit that's why I'm like you're crazy to say that you're not famous but if it's the name and I never thought about it doesn't matter man it doesn't matter it's all nonsense but what's important is you're doing something very different though the whole way you're doing it the way you're doing it with constantly being putting out these podcasts I mean you know just doing a podcast like this you realize like how much of who you are you put out there I mean you just you're putting it out there every day like that it's not about how bottomless we are in terms of like if you can think of how many podcasts you've done couple that with all this stand-up you've done couple that with every real conversation you ever shared with somebody in your fucking life and you're still not done you still have so much more to say we're unfathomably deep human beings or deep creatures who can keep finding things to talk about we talk because what else is there if we're not communicating with ourselves with each other what are we doing especially now with with the Internet I mean that's the big difference between now 12 so that's why I say 20 years ago I'd be fucking freaking out that I didn't have the internet because the commute can choose the community yeah choose a communicator the community that you interact with and I bet you find even though you have a lot of fucking people in your Twitter I bet you find they're predominantly cool aren't they yes across the board is an amazing I love Twitter because it's so positive if you are a fan just feel good yeah yeah you have 1,800,000 plus of your fans tuned into you we could tell them things and you could clue them in on stuff all the time and they're excited and happy it's all positive and they're predisposed to say something positive yeah like everyone so of course you get a random sniper jackass but generally it's just like oh my god I just watched clerks and it was great yeah you know I've never seen it before or I had a real shitty day listen the podcast feel great thanks or vanilla today has been the last two days well I mean last week two weeks ago with the Canadian tour but the last day like not even full day last 12 hours red-state been on VOD since I woke up this morning which was about I think I got up a fiver ironically I wake up around 4:20 every day I got up around four-ish and it started reading positive feedback because people can watch it on VOD at their fucking house on their computer people are watching it tweeting me while they're watching and dude it's like it's like a never-ending series of great job patting me on the back like I said I was saying before he cost nothing to encourage an artist and the yield the potential yield is it is indescribable think about it you you encourage an artist one day they write that song that becomes that most important song in the world to you on that day that your parent fucking dies the song that says it all that you'll always be dialed into they write that person maybe writes a blog that ouputs the shit you always wanted to say right into perspective and you meme it out to everybody it's your becomes your mantra or they make a movie that you know is that movie that changes your life whatever man there's all upside to encouraging an artist nothing good comes from the flip side discouraging an artist now people be like well you should discourage some fucking artist like you Ebola or some where Kevin Smith is bullshit you know what I'm saying there's nothing bad nothing good comes from they eat salsa motherfucker you stink don't do it anymore what they going to do they stop and maybe they don't us maybe you don't like them but maybe they don't inspire somebody else or make somebody else think hey I can try it you say that but what about the concept of the salmon needing a waterfall to climb up to ensure that the strong gene survive now forever pretty person I told you oh fuck Kevin Smith those haters fueled you and gave you extra inspiration to push further like that do you something Li work like that no I try not to it's definitely a negative way to do it I know a lot of fighters use that as motivation I think you have to in that a lot of sliders like tears and also but think about it as a fighter you have to get over I know you say there you know primal brain somewhere in there you got to get over the brain that we've been dealing with for so many years which is like don't get hurt don't go in there don't don't don't run from danger protection so yeah so right then and there that's why it's so exciting differently than anybody else they're going over their program like right there rewiring going in a different way and they have to try to stay Zen in the moment not freak out and let it adrenaline and everything just overwhelm them I go into full panic we had Shandling Garry Shandling was on the honor show at the house one night and he was talking he likes to box the big boxer and he was talking about almost the same thing you were in terms of like you're they're not there it is so it's about being there and letting go and it's an accounts out of you yeah or he was describing I forget how I described it in terms of like just not being where the punch is going to be and knowing that sooner or later you will get punched but the more you're in this moment like it once again it's so what I find fascinating about is people who can fight or people get in a ring physical and not just like oh we play some pickup basketball ship but usually people get into boxing fighting they could be so poetic about it because you are channeling into something I guess that most people don't we don't live in a world we're going around fighting people we're getting into physical altercations involving our body so I think you guys do dial into something cuz everyone is when you describe it for just a second I go like yeah man I should fucking fight but I know I am NOT that guy like in a minute I get in the ring he fucking taking you know I would the thought of getting would make me queasy and I pass out but fighters people that do it people that you know who've actually a been in a ring and fought or continued to do it are so poetic about it that they can almost sell you on it to the point of like wow I should get that shot but I know I'm not made for being hit I won hit and I'm gone it's not for everybody nothing's forever man right but what it really is like you want you want it to be for you because you listen and go like oh my god like could you imagine being Zen with about the fighting about being there and not being there in that ring about having to having to zone out but be very present so as not to get fucking killed mm-hmm yeah my choice yeah and you have to learn how to harness all of your potential everything together psychological physical you got to tune it all together you got to make sure that your mind doesn't overwhelm your body with information you got to make sure that you keep your heart rate steady and stay calm and see things exactly as they are not exaggerated because you're under some adrenaline heightened fear you got to keep it together man but what it really is is a vehicle for developing your human potential martial arts or something anything that's really difficult man I think anything that's really really really fucking hard to do in doing so you learn a lot about yourself while you're doing it and you learn about your potential you learn what you could push yourself through you learn how much focus you have in you you learn how to project it how to keep it strong how to keep it going how to stay you know stay heightened stay in a heightened state and that's what you you get from that you learned excellence you know for anything whether it's martial arts or fucking playing a violin or anything when shits really difficult to do you you learn something about yourself in it mastery of it yeah leads to mastery by the things anyway it's not matched with the quote you said once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things oh that's beautiful yeah especially from a bad motherfucker chopping people up with a sword yeah I mean normally you get kind of that that homespun wisdom from you know a bald man who sits who's chopping you sits on a hill but this dude's like no I I know a lot about life because I ended so fucking many of so sweetly a slice of a razor like soared across the neck and watch the head separate from the body and like a fall down lovers kiss the body twitches before it falls in a couple spurts of blood come out of the blowhole at the top and then it crumples clunk you're you're making things awkward that's it that's the end of the podcast folks this is the longest podcast in history of podcasts how long we go you really get through it all four hours if you really get through it all ladies and gentlemen god bless you you're beautiful I tunes were probably gonna have to chop this up into part 1 and part 2 it's gonna take a while yeah we can edit that big of a file I don't want anyone on etre while we just show monitor lay in terms of can you read feedback to you ever no we did that before but it was always nigger cunt nigger cunt aah laughter Wow a lot of people just trying about Twitter I use Twitter it is awesome yeah like Twitter I'll monitor while we do this but when there's a chat and you want people like people want to like send you something that you'll read well just say the most obscene ridiculous retarded shit so there was like a lot of people doing that flooding things I was wondering if any here we go just listen to Kevin Smith and Joe Rogan mind-blowing podcast that's can I get my old song back man no
