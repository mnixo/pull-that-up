Sam ladies and gentlemen we are live goddamnit we are live with the man Jason mayhem Miller yes I'm Strikeforce fame bully beatdown bully beatdown Fame for sure man I can't go anywhere I for him to make you fall for the fucking title yeah that's true but but you know like strike forces in the process of building like I can fill them like get the ball rolling before we even talk we have to thank our sponsor we're sponsored by the fleshlight that's the butthole version I think that's what other version is there there's a mouth version and a vajayjay version now do the bounce come in different races dude that's a fucking excellent point because I was saying how come there's no black ones because all the vaginas are pink if you go to the website we got to talk to them about that and the funny thing is to do to hook this up dude who started this whole deal our friend Chris seems like he's a mixed heritage right doesn't he he seems like he's like he's got a bunch of things going someone's had some black something somewhere along those entities a spiritual traveller you can tell by just talking to the guy I can't believe you guys doesn't have like Indian he's we're gonna have him on the podcast if he'll do it he's I like that kind of girls vaginas like porno stars they'd like they literally mold their vagina like the outside take a flashlight opener and take them all but there's no like poodle I guess they put something on it you know and they make an impression of it one of those is an official vagina there's like or maybe there's just some fat chick who's right she's like some designer she went to art school for three years you know my point about the flush that has always been it does not have to look like a vagina because I'm not looking at it I'm just shoving it on my face I got a free fake vagina one time if you stare at it while you're fucking it like wow that looks like a real vagina there's no way you're gonna be turned on if it was a real vagina okay why is it by itself nor is its fuckin body I mean that's creepy have you just fucking a vagina like some someone took an apple corer to some chick just pulled it off and we're talking personality-wise most chicks that I've ever dated are pretty much you know just a vagina I just see that part of it oh you've had some cool chicks well yeah that's true but you know I've gone through a rash of psychopaths but well there's no that's the lifestyle though you know that's how you're living you're a fucking wild man like professional there's a lot of people out there claiming wild man Jason mayhem Miller is a real fucking wild man all right I can't house shut the fuck up you're talking about a dude who as long as I've known him been living in hotels he doesn't even he's now he just got a fucking house now he has to know he's got the up TV star who I have to just because like I feel like with your eye like I'm damn near 30 like I better like buy a house well you're a TV star now you're legit TV star you're the host of bully fucking beat Palace that's a giant show man that is a popular fucking show cultural they could do that to Anthony Bourdain they can do that to you you go to in like MTV parties where you hang out those guys and they separate me from Jersey Shore dudes I really think they separate you for it but you might smack him on this is the thing about mayhem like I've known mayhem for a long time now and Mayhem's one of the coolest guys I've ever met he's a down dude he's totally straight you never know you there's nowhere there's no guessing where he coming from what ma'am but dad said homies got a switch and every now and then he just decides this is classic mayhem and granted this is years ago before he had matured you were very bored so even yeah well you get crazy you get hyped you know and there's nothing wrong with that that's what makes you a great fighter but when you got we're at the sky bar and we're just having a good fucking time all right we got a buzz on we're laughing the telling jokes it's like mayhem and Brian is there and Ari was there it was just me and you and it may have I think there was a new hate around the corner it was like I thought we had one other dude with I know anyway bottom line is okay say it's all just us three so we're having a great time laughing our asses off and mayhem gets hyped and decides to skydive on this bed filled with people drinking nice people they have these like the waist guy BIOS dive bars why it's got this killer view right it's at the Mondrian it's got this killer view and they have these beds laying around and people just chill on these beds and they lie down and drink well these people are just lying feet up hard day at work you know I'm saying oh girl okay you got the you got the basics Rogan told the his version here's my version in my head okay I'm standing there we already been this guy bore the day before I went with you day before and I had a blast like it was like girls this time it was like some people there but it wasn't popping off right we were talking to having a good time but it wasn't like it wasn't like the Hollywood party that you get you imagine right and I've never been to Hollywood that was like my first time okay so I wanted the Hollywood party like I was like where's all the hot bitches you know like what is what is this so but you know you guys are used to it so you were like whatever Meow's keyboards like I was like man where's the chicks yesterday where I was talking with chicks and then I'm looking around like this and then as I look around there's a lull in our conversation I look over and there's a hot chick and she's looking at me from the bench now be it I was on the second level of this little area and we're sitting there talking there's a lull in our conversation I look back in a chick she was smiling something my head said Jason she wants you to jump on there now I have extensive experience jumping on a couch I had a little sister all growing up I could run and jump perfect and land perfect on the couch as I ran and jumped in midair I went this is a bad idea like why did I do this but too late I could not take it back so I jump in smash into these all these hot chick flick bottle chicks like a bunch of rich dudes we're Rolexes guy with spiky hair he had the faux hawk before people had faux hawks and I smashed it knocked the drinks everywhere and whatever a man I popped up like Bruce Lee like jump back up whoa and I was like that was stupid I saw the bouncers running and I just went I know I know I'm sorry I know I know and then so this is my first Hollywood thing and I was hanging out with the famous Joe Rogan and I was like damn chill Rochas gonna hate me man she's got a hey B I I guess my phone rang and I saw Joe Rogan and I was like oh god I answer the phone and either you were laughing so hard that I was like oh cool it's cool you know the difference between someone someone who's capable of doing crazy shit but is a cool dude and someone who's just fucking crazy and annoying there's a huge difference and you're just a dude who has a cool dude who will do some crazy you know you get labeled in with the other group aw yeah you get underestimated in my opinion you know and it was really funny the as a fighter as well the EA game they put you at a really a low skill level and it was a fucking hilarious video I don't know there's a hilarious video of him on the internet punking the EA guys he pretends that he's fucking pissed off do they put him in a low level of skill away look it's so good what find it find it on YouTube google it what is do you know the name of the man or just bay ham mayhem mayhem freak out something like that it's actually one of the this developer is in on this okay no you're doing so so if you notice this video now [Music] there was this one dude who was there was a swan dude who was talking who was really it sounded really freaked out when you when he got violent physical he wasn't in on it that was really his freak out the whole floor of people came to the door and everyone was like acting like they're gonna do something I'm like whoa listen to that guy's voice can you rewind it to that one spot with that one guy wigs this guy this is some primal shit dude you got to listen to his voice that the terror in is that guy sounds like a dude is getting attacked by a bear well I never think about it you know and I have no like fear of physical altercation yeah I have no fear of physical altercation so to me like I'm like okay whatever it's a dude you know like and I don't really think about the consequences anyway I got my well if I get beat up I get beat up you know like did you think well the designer wasn't gonna tie you up I mean you would even attempt that for because you're mad at him for that but yeah you think my game sucks fuck you like what you think he's gonna attack you no no dogs in that race no worries that was very funny though mayhem Miller I enjoyed the shit out of it now we can't have you on without talking about that strike force brawl oh yeah that is the most ridiculous shit I have ever seen on television this is one of the problems and we talked about it on the show right after it happened with organizations that they don't have enough experience yet there's little things that haven't covered little things like watching the doors like you can't just let anybody in and the UFC knows that so they have people watching the door yeah yeah it's just it's just but this like a little hole missing in their game and the hole missing was you got to watch the door you can't just let anybody in the cage well they just fucked up well you know and I thought it was an appropriate time to get into the cage smart oh yeah for sure what's the worst that could happen well the worst that happens so well it wouldn't have been bad it would've been bad what happened was you came in and you like interrupted in the middle of a speech yeah here's the here's how that way he looked at you I saw what happened he looked at you guys made eye contact and then he just went with ya it was like awkward at that point cuz I mean step into his frame and that he looked back at me and me and me and uh me as shields kind of had made peace already because we're both cutting weight at the same time and we're in the same area and we both like oh and we're like we kind of looked at each other like yeah we're doing it again like what's up dawg like that like we were like all right it's cool yeah you beat me that last fight give me those shot nah you know I'll kick your ass next thought you know there's mutual respect right have you respect me and and and so we kind of made our peace and it the way and we still were cool were like what up then I want my fight and knock the guy out which this would make a lot more sense if on the video I mean on the CBS broadcast he showed my fight but they had five 25-minute fights and went over their time slot anyway when way way way way over their time they went over by like over an hour Wow for them anyway so I go in there and I didn't mean to step in the frame I stepped in the frame of the all whoops I'm already and he noticed me about say mom and I say well I gotta talk now right because he asked me well you are you rematch now and I said then you said that off the off the mic and I went yeah where'd my rematch buddy whoops because then I just proceeded to get to stock the dog pile and if funniest part is is imagine if I just want to fight and my camp was in there okay my crew if we jumped on somebody they would be fucking hurt I got up like hahaha oh my god like I never get hurt on that even get hurt you know I was shocked I didn't even have a scratch on me and and during the little scrap I shot a double leg on somebody because I was like man let me just take someone on the ground and then I can probably you know get my way out of this and and because I was thinking at this moment you're right when you fight and my adrenaline had already been pumped up earlier that night I wasn't even hype when that was happening I was like woah oh my god and I'd get on the bottom of a dog pie out of like hoho I'm getting jumped on national television right now kicked in the head I didn't feel that as I'm thinking in my head man I'm getting jumped on national television the freakin idiot Gus Johnson goes Mike Chappelle oh are you fucking kidding me Gus Johnson all day he sounds like a dude who's in a mold like a sports guy I think ma'am just got me pregnant I wrote a preface for a book this is kind of like a college textbook was anyway it's about the mentality of fighters and he did case studies long interviews with Gus Johnson a friend of mine he wrote this book and that's a book oh wait a minute wait it's coming to me it's too complicated that's the problem yeah it was just like fighting or fighting and art you know it was it was about in fact it's actually you know a good book you know book you never know I wrote this thing where at the beginning and I I drew the parallel all but mascara probably come here we have a technical difficulties with the wiener dog yeah you got a my cats in the room everybody but cats hide in the closet I mean a dog found them we got goddamn problems what kind of a fucking professional studios yeah but I had nobody you can't go down there hey gentlemen we apologize but I you know it's got to be a pretty big coincidence if if he just he just sorry guys so much better yeah like this job yo yo check it out Rogan podcast sign hold it so anyway for the people who haven't seen this is what happened there was a the the fight is over listen to this there's people that listen this podcast that don't know shit about mmm oh I bet there's there's most the people that listen this podcast I would say probably 50 percent at work this I just just for the people who are not MMA fans we just have to clean it dinner get over here this is very distracting anyway sorry why don't you guys talk for a sec I'm gonna shut this door yeah please shut the door by the way remember that couch story are talking about the sky bar yeah that was like my first month in LA it was like my first time at an LA bar and then I meet you and then when that happened I just remember it turned into bullet time where I just see girls like fucking glasses of wine I like to call that Saving Private Ryan you're like looking around everything is it black and white slow motion yeah and then I ran around the corner me and Joe hid from you I do stupid shit all the time but this is really stupid and I was like man I finally have a famous friend in my entire life and I just tell him to fuck off you see inception oh not yet everybody says off see we got to keep fortunately I know you're ready I'll go see it tonight though for sure do it why partially because at red band tweeted like man he was stroking himself why he was right in this review like 140 characters up Oh inception oh look before before we get we got to go back to this so Strikeforce thing or you dog show my cat bitch so the the Strikeforce thing so for the people who haven't seen it this is what happens one guy wins and this guy who want Jake Shields mayhem and Jake Shields had fought in the past very close decision as a matter of fact at the end of the second round was the second of the third I don't know at the end of the second and third he had him locked up and a rear naked choke homeboy was going to sleep yeah hold him after the bail was cuz my last fight I illegally kicked Jacare in his head yeah and I was like oh I don't want to get the everybody hates me because I'm a dirty fighter you know so I didn't even hold on to it beyond the Bell cuz I was like I'll get up he would it went to sleep he was he was a couple seconds away from going to sleep it was what a bit of shit of deadlock time anyway so the point is there was a they had a big very close fight it was very it was exciting and mayhem doesn't feel like he did his best which no fighter ever does know so he wanted to have this rematch so when Jake Shields won in a big victory over Dan Henderson mayhem says well this is a good way to hype this fight up this would be a big name fight you know I'm a heme Miller from MTV and bully beatdown and we're on fucking CBS right now you know I'm a famous MMA guy you're a famous MMA guy you just had a huge victory let's make some money yeah let's make some fucking money that's exactly it come on let's get crazy come on let's hype this up you gotta get mad at me but the the problem is everybody took it Street everybody went goofy like come on man so you guys have to have some sort of an understanding that there's a certain amount of shit you should be able to talk before you throw down because it's good for business it's good for business what's not good for business is punching people in the head when you're done just I understand where you're coming from you want to back up your boy but you can't do that on TV you got to realize that a lot of this disrespect and the shit talking it's not real okay little bit like I said we suffer together but this is reality like the reality as you know it was a great fight the reality is you know you would like to get back in there the reality is you know you think you can beat them you came close to tapping them so so there's a lot of real hype to it but there's always respect like the the bullshit and the shit talking and everything like that where people have to understand is that makes you money that sells the fucking fights that's a big big thing like we're shot and rampage man if either one of those guys said a word to each other they wouldn't have been happy unless you're black I thought who cares but I'm just saying they hyped it up yes yes there's some reality to it but they kept this shit together they got so close on that ultimate fighter show man when they got in each others face and the Australia I'm friends with both guys I'm friends with both those because they're cool guys they're both great guys I grew up with rampage basically when I moved it to California in my damn van I like big I lived in the parking lot down the street from his house and would drive to go pick him up to take up to another gym to train every day we hung out every day in which one conversation that he remembers I went man he should be mr. t on on the a-team was like and then he started spitting bad I'm pitiful like that and I was like hold my your see I told you and magic mayhem five eight years later Attraction type shit son exactly anyway maybe I'm just magic Joe Rogan maybe it's just black magic to me anyway so uh we're not Australia and those guys are both out there and I'm kind of kicking it with both going around to Australia's nightlife and I'm but I'm kind of hang out more with rampage I known him for a way longer and whatever it and I kind of you know I haven't seen him we were catching up and and anyway he Billie's guy suddenly I'm in the nightclub with some hot chicks I'm looking around like wow hot chicks cool this is what life's supposed to be right and security starts running asked me and I'm like where's rampage and I like looked over at where were shod with city where's rut Rashad and I was like dude they're not here and those guys are running I run down to this little tiny hallway where the bathroom was and who's standing there face to face in this hallway that I could barely fit down they are face to face of this thing just black guy talking like all I can hear is like a bitch bitch here we go ah dude these be security is like lots that they know who these guys are they know what can go down right now they're just like ah fuck could you imagine to the referee at a fucking Club Sydney people are cool as fuck you know I can't people are nice here how hard is it to be a bouncer you know no big deal and then one day to fucking cage fighters happens one of the biggest rivalries in the history of the UFC and these two guys are in each other's face in your bar I'm gonna do something you I sprinted down in there got between them and explained to them in the language that I'm accustomed to black guy because I talk black guy give us we give us an exact interpretation of what my normal black guy is this black guy like I my formative years were spent with all black guys right my from 12 well I moved to a less black neighborhood when I was 12 and whatever it was still does still hung out with black kids because I was already used to that like I was just like you know that was just my normal guy what's it feel like get out of here so anyway I get in these guys faces like hey man let's do this on TV huh why you guys gonna waste it right here cuz the international incident they kind of like broke off and kind of like laughed the fact about screaming about an international incident right and disaster averted but like yeah like I was like you guys are really a couple drinks these guys get fired up well there's the the psychological advantage of not getting the other guy you know not backing down at all it's so important to those guys and they understand that I mean it seems stupid and I think it is kind of dumb you know but I I understand it 100% and you know look when people get heated into each other's faces and you know and there's this especially with two guys that are about to fight that these little tiny battles are real these little tiny psychological battles like who gets to tell who to go fuck themselves laughs who gets to see the last word you know it's like fuck man we might be here all day I'm not going anywhere fuck I don't get in that road man so nice why would you want to get yourself it's true it's true but if you're a cage fighter it's a different situation because it's a psychological warfare it's very important it's very important your mindset as opposed to where their mindset is when when the fight starts you can fuck someone's head up in the pre-fight but there's a lot of fighters that are also believed in just like I love good but everybody's got their own style you can't hate on someone's shit talking stop because it really works man there's some there's some shit man when you get inside someone's head and get them emotional and I'll riled up and start talking shit about their girlfriend talking shit about their kids talking shit about their life you you start fucking look some people can take it some people you talk shit up and they think it's funny and it doesn't hurt them but some guys go crazy look at fucking Frank Mir when Brock Lesnar got in Frank Mears face after he beat the fuck out of him after he beat his fucking face into the ground too smashed him then he gets in his face talk some fucking shit that was real man that was that was a real anger you know that guy got fucking furious because then it backfired on him but it works on other girl what do you talk about backfired well I mean as far as his performance rock star as far as his performance all the grief but what I'm saying is it didn't do any good I actually got him more of a beating well you know I'm saying I mean he got really you got there was let me off easy you know I I wonder if I lost I had law I want to lose I don't want to like oh you hugged me into the damn bat I wonder like yeah did you see the IFC the Josh Barnett Geronimo daughter quick stoppage man I mean Josh Barnett was crushing them no don't get me wrong you mean it's definitely just but I was thinking like wow I don't know I think Brock Lesnar took more shots than this guy and the guy got up but he was really pissed and he protests was like what the fuck and granted Barnett was killing him don't get me wrong Barnett looked awesome I mean he Burnett's fucking song Barnett song as I love the officiating and be Lesnar fight go right I'm a fan of anybody who can win yeah Brock Lesnar showed his character and coming back for that second round but he took a lot of shots where I was looking at Big John who I think is the best of business I think Big John and Herb Dean of the very best and Big Big John stop that fight in Australian I was like I wonder who would have stopped the Lesnar fight people would have stopped it yeah Rosenthal is the shit that guy is we want to lose that Rosenthal Rosenthal is the shit he's a real fan he trains he's a brown belt in jujitsu what about nerves Dean what herb Dean is the shit he's my hardiness tell like dancing coolest motherfucker on the planet to both guys are and you know but I don't think either one of those guys could have stopped it maybe maybe herb herb out a stop no I don't think you would have but somebody might have no one from that matrix is going to stop their evil Devine is a great referee but he might have stopped it yeah you know I'm saying there's a few but all I'm trying to get at is that on moments like that you realize how important a referee really is you know I don't think you should have been stopped because he was taking a beating for sure but if you look at the athletes face you have to like pay attention to their facial expression there and there if they don't look like they want out of there right why stop it right you know it's like I never once can remember I remember get my asking a couple times like I like getting kicked and I was like remember thinking don't stop this fight like don't stop and I'm still here don't worry I'm still here and keeping my faith but that's an extra thing to think about right well yeah be but I just know in my head don't stop the fight because I could tell in a couple bites I've been and what I might get my ass whooped I could tell like I'm like whoa I'm getting kicked I've get my ass kicked right now I gotta hurry up and get out of this situation and I but at the same time I'm thinking don't stop please don't stop fight cuz I'm still here have you talked to the Diaz brothers or Gilbert Melendez anybody that involved with Strikeforce brawl yeah he's cool like me Melendez been cool my buddies all and I was actually kind of friends with Nate Diaz despite me and Nick never getting along because you think you guys can all squash oh you don't get along with Nick whoa what is your problem dude no because you know what I feel like he was a driving factor in that whole thing he's the first guy to throw a punch he started that whole thing and it it's almost not his fault because he's retarded but at the same time he embodies this cultural ship that we had and and we really really started with dr. Dre selling us NWA and it did and sent us this culture of gangsters is cool yeah gangster is cool in a way to watch a movie but being gangster is just being a little kid you don't I mean and and starting a big brawl because what I talk some shit to your homie that is just ghetto and that that that thing embody is what's wrong with America right now people don't take you like when they asked him about it I came out and apologized right after that whole thing went down cuz I was wrong I stepped in the cage but no one stopped me I figured and they won't mind it'll be cool there'll be a few way to hide there what are you doing Amanda come on doing the Sun man you freak myself sorry anyway so you know I got I got it there he they jump on me that that's not the proper response like you know you don't act like a damn yeah so I mean you you had talked to Nick in the past though you guys is that Nick well after one fight I did fuck about pretty good because after one of these fight one of his fights I was doing the post fight interview up Jason mayhem Miller with Nick Diaz I don't know that's usual I didn't I didn't know setup it was like a silly and it was just a joke like he didn't get the joke though that's the probably right I'll just fuck what he's like a serious dude yeah oh you know he's like I do bitch dude is that surprising look I like Nick Diaz a lot I'm a big fan of him as a fighter he's great you know what is it what is it about him that hold no no fun no fun and games that's that's a weird way to live because he's I don't know he's just angry with himself so he just it's rare that someone is so disciplined like as disciplined as he is I mean Nick Diaz is in tremendous yeah just running yeah and he's so good now two men his last few fights man the fucking Scott Smith fight I was really impressed Frank Shamrock I was like god damn he's like he's fucking putting it together he's putting it on people I like that but but as like a dude like that whole like always angry and always fighting it's you know it's unfortunate fortunately I look at whatever you know that's just the mentality of some people and I think that you know it's weird you see that in someone who's so good every day yeah but to be smart you there's there's a certain there's a certain amount of power over your mind and over your will there's a certain amount you or whatever will man whatever will and discipline those who are a dumbest shit who would just go to their construction job and work hard as hell every day it doesn't take no listen Nick Diaz might not be like you you you might not think he's a socially most inept guy in the world but physically that guy's very intelligent look how good is jujitsu is look how good he fights that takes intelligence it's just if he's not you know focusing it in other areas you know of his life it doesn't mean that he's not intelligent no doubt that guy when you're that good you're super intelligent yeah it's just I mean I understand where it all comes from I mean it's it's like it's a programming that you get when you're really young and you think that that's the way to behave and act but I think you've got a real good point you know you got you got a real good point about I don't want to drive culture I like to have fun yeah act wild I do crazy stuff but you are always cool to people I've never seen you picking fights never seen you start arguments for no reason you've always been cool to people I've never seen you bully people or fuck with anybody which is really funny that you wind up getting this anti-bullying show yeah the same job that I do it now man I did the same thing all growing up it's so funny that I got cuz I played this role my entire life because every time there's a big kid picking on a little kid I can remember like three incidents you know yeah I would be like cuz I like to fight I always like to fight since I was three years old like I just like uh I think my dad was in an army a box and stuff and he he like so you weren't afraid of it you wanted to get in there and do it yeah bullying some kid I remember walking seeing it going down and he was pushing a little kid around and I was like I remember I like I don't know I guess I was like 9 or 8 I walked over there and got in between him and then I beat this kid up but but I start boulogne bullying bullies yeah because bullying bullies though is a very common practice a lot of righteous people do that I bullied a bully the other today are using blue torture calm my bully in high school he used to always fuck with me so what 15 years later I made a website where I used to take Listerine strips and put them in animals mouths that I would Photoshop like them have blue lips and stuff like that and paid PETA or whatever got so pissed off that they're like we're going to go to this person's house and protest them so I found my bully's address and made this big flyer like got five new puppies gonna give them 200 Listerine strips live on the Internet and you should stop right now stop right now don't be admitting this on the Internet what's wrong with you huh stop what you're talking about no it's fine I've already admitted it any time well not on this fucking podcast everybody else listen to sorry Peter sorry Peter didn't mean to do it huh doesn't matter I got the wrong address okay well never address God you said psycho PETA people there's some random person sighs no worse dude let's stop talking Jesus Christ Akala t no let's but while we're on that subject tell me mayhem the story of your your assistant that did you wrong and justice which i think is a hundred times worse than what it's not because you dude you gave a waste where someone live huh that's where someone yeah that's where someone sleeps this is just a phone number a phone numbers not nearly as bad as the place where the rest of the story was what was weird about it is that he was arrested the same week that this happened for torture to an animal he left his dog in his house for a week weeks at a time while he was out doing other bad stuff and so it just happened at the same week which made it a million times better about doing other bad stuff I'm trying I'm trying not to get the guy in trouble welcome revenge was served so you'd have to worry okay good so now we can all sleep knowing that you won't be no it was weird because actually he was abusing animals the whole thing is funny if someone tries to do a scam and gets busted you know an interesting stories the guy who you know people always ask hey can we take a picture where you get me in a choke or I'll get you in a choke and I say we can't because the UFC specifically tells us we can't because two guys were sued Chuck was sued and Matthews were sued for taking pictures with dude but then why did Jim Norton just get choked out the other day on opium the video videos totally different there's a video no no listen a video is very obvious what's happening okay you know and by the way it's Jim Norton Jim Norton's not gonna sue Randy KOTOR just random fans and thought they could make some money and they pretended that Chuck hurt him they pretend that Matt Hughes hurt them well the guy who they pretended Matt Hughes hurt him apparently they investigated this cuz there was always people that said like come on man it's bullshit Matt's a nice guy he was taking a picture with you you asked him to do it this guy turned out he was a dirty cop oh and they started investigating I found out some shit and now he's in jail I was doing a long stretch he's doing like 10 years or something you know why because Matt he's a Christian and Jesus did it Jesus fucked I do the ass that's what happened right there my god the worst thing ever said on a podcast thing to get raped by as you get raped by Jesus man Shiva the destroyer that's a way better yeah so tell us what happened with this this mayhem is like I said one of the nicest guys I know

what the hell finally I called a guy I what are you doing oh he's just stupid okay we will establish she's very poor it is Jeff okay but so witty big fucked you over let's get on track you know when I was dealing with here okay so I'm keep giving him another chance every time I got my cousin so he can't pay my credit card bill it take me two minutes to do it he has all the information still couldn't do it he can't figure out Travelocity he booked me an hour away from my family reunion like either he's terrible at his job okay okay so he then goes to one of my close friends and just lies about everything like like it's a girl okay one of your close friends yeah this this guy found her information and contact hi he wit somehow he got her email mostly because he had to be hating he's only one reason why God does that guy goes and talks to a girl I talk shit about you yeah that's a hater yeah I know don't worry well aware of that so uh you know this guy frickin calls her it just starts making up ridiculous stories the girl believes it like she's like believes it totally believes it event is like totally I'm like what the hell so he says a bunch of bad shit about me you're very I'm getting this out yeah yeah it's fucking dead socks man fuck you over yeah finally I get the story out of her she's tells me why oh my what like he's made all that shit up like really she fight we make up he told me she dumped me all that I'm like man I suffered for like a week or two where she's just giving me the boot like no reason and I don't know what and you didn't know what it was and I know what it was that all stabbing you in the guy that I fired the week before because he's in up that his job and I was totally cool with them too so you had already fired him and then he did I fired he did all this oh I was confused I thought he did all this while he was working so okay so then so you fire him and then what do you do you put yeah you were making your phone numbers so intense because that's like something that you have so many like a hundred people that know your phone number and once you leak that like Dana White just leaked it on Twitter the other day you lose that funny thing I did with his office number so they'll changes oh that's not bad but your cell phone that's pretty huge number for a long-ass time you're gonna forget how many people have that number when somebody down the line you're like good I think this is breeding reaches a decree just reaching back and trying to grab a hold the people from the past don't let that shit go son it's kind of fun better I'd like to go I liked it now I can't even turn the phone on I turn the phone on it just it just reboots because it gets so many texts because I turn it on like every day yeah like 5,000 texts and I can use it I try to make a call or I get calls in on it I try to answer the call and while I'm answering the call it's just constant buzz buzz buzz of text coming through buzz buzz you're saying people keep calling you now on the other line and then reboots is that red band is basically turning the phone on sitting on it I'm putting it back to do but up so unfortunately you put this guy's phone number online but I don't think anybody's gonna call it nobody who calls number right yeah yeah and it's not like you're like there's a loved guy and that guy fucked you over well I am an official mayhem monkey I'm a member of like number 420 that's as cliche as they make it folks so how to take it it's perfect right yeah bro come on somebody had to be foretold yeah mayhem has a cult called the mayhem monkeys yeah I'm down with that shit at least a general Prime Minister well you know what I'm saying how about this how about a I have a cult you have a call and we'll be like fuckin favorite nations and shit I just want Michael to be people were saint of the same mindset right you are because we're all monkeys spin around a rock in space right tubes in tunnels that's what we have boys have tubes girls have tunnels Wow I love Brian you know why cuz Brian is a grown man with a beard but he thinks like a 14-year fuck did you ever get your mam monkeys like all together like for kind of like a rollerskating party or anything like that it's always awesome but there's almost always one dude that's creepy in real life all right one dude that just Jack's the party remember we did Houston back in the day yeah there who was a good example of that where it was a couple dudes I don't remember the names but me anybody did I wouldn't even say it right after meeting them they stop they just drop off the right board they stop coming to the board and there's been there's been members that wives have found out that they came to these Circle Jerks and remember this been Affairs there's been yeah there's deaths yeah I mean our friend outlaw that was a legitimate friend of ours yeah that died he heart attack he's overweight there's a cool motherfucker we knew that guy from like 2001 was woman when we first met him in Houston right and he was always on my message board just a funny dude there's a cool dude so you can meet cool people off the internet but the problem is man for every cool dude you know for every 10 cool dudes there's one or two just creepy fucks that will show up for your yeah it's pretty fucking good I think you know you get to know people very well from reading the shit they write on the internet that's why Twitter is awesome because you get to see is this person a negative person you're positive funny you could see through their tweets because they can't help it they put themselves up know who I love I love black dudes that give motivational talks you know Tyrese that actor that dude who's always like women stand up for yourself all caps no make that man respect you baby boy love yourself before someone else will love you girls like you like say all this like crazy super positive love pimp shit and you know he's just slinging his I'm a good guy game you know I mean it's like I his fucking avatar on Twitter is him making out what's up check magnitude is built like a fucking Greek god who's a movie star sexy motherfucker I mean I don't hate him I'm not hating but but I find it hilarious but he's talking all this superpower Pro God love game like you could tell when someone's throwing a game you know I'm saying you can tell when someone's real and that's who they are you can't yeah but a lot of people are not as bright as you are Joe Rogan isn't it fascinating when you see someone's throwing a game and other people aren't seeing it like Scientology oh you know like anything like that like I had this neighbor who's a cool guy I still love the guy where I used to live and he was talking to me about buying this piece of property and then I said well I can't do it right now but I really want to pick this up because my wife is about to go clear so I go what are you talking about he goes yeah well we're in Scientology and she's gonna go clear and across $50,000 otherwise I would pick this piece of property up I go whoa whoa whoa I go what it's clear like what are you talking about so I'm just you know as a comedian automatically I want to start laughing at I'm and mocking them but then my heckler skills were taking me give him some rope let's talk here let's let's find out what we got going on here so I'm listening to him he's telling me that his wife is going to become someone who cannot be influenced by outside forces cuz I'm not fucking with you what did what did they they get them to the point where nothing negative that anybody does to them or sense them can affect who they are it's really fucking some pretty strong pimp shit if you think about it you know someone tells you they're gonna bitch you so nothing's gonna come in its what's uncomfortable about it you start thinking you could do that too you start thinking I could do that to people I could get start right and shit like oh my god it was shit oh man it was a crazy feeling know knowing that I'm living next to some dude is just getting ready to do ceremony on his wife so that she won't get affected by bad Buju anymore here's a South Park episode what about the whole Scientology one of the best oh yeah you know when they went over the whole South Park the greatest fun okay the way it is is my friend has a grandpa from Japan lived in Hawaii but basically at for the last 30 years been in the house cleaning the house she's the nicest lady she got one of her friends from I don't know whatever old Japanese ladies do she doesn't speak English but so they go to a Japanese Church a Christian Church and they go they are telling the story of the virgin birth and she suddenly has a freaked out she's 80 years old she's kind of like an old lady like saying you believe this she went you in the middle of the sermon like you all believe this this is what the really cuz that's to her first time in a Christian Church she didn't never she never heard about it really she didn't know the story oh no it's not you know she freaked out she was like do you guys believe and and fucked up the whole sermon and left in the middle of it but if you draw the parallel it's the same thing it's kind of hard to Scientology is the same thing as Christian it's just it's it's a yeah it doesn't matter anybody telling you they've got all the answers they don't know we have this weird hunger to figure it all out but I just could because now we got the Scientology you know oh sorry scientists real scientists and I think it's messed up Scientologists put it in there to sound I know right that is kind of their cult was signed because people who don't want to go to church go oh wait sighing sounds better yeah you know in psychology messed up exactly but but you know we we all we all have this need to know everything that's cool these smart scientists are figuring it out you know they know through the world's around definitely shot here's the reality here's reality they're they're figuring out things about matter they're figuring out things about the nature of reality more but there's way more though the real big question isn't like how does this work what makes this explode what makes an atom what makes the Big Bang a lot of real question is what the fuck is all that that's the real question that's impossible with just science it's gonna take evolution in science there was a real thing that's going on is that we have all this incredible power right now as a human race but we're still in this crazy adolescent stage of figuring out how to behave and think and raise children to be normal humans you know I mean it's a fucking very strange time when you think about the power that people have to to change the fucking world that we live in like with explosions and all kinds of crazy shit that people have invented and how dumb people are as well at the same time so many dummies well yeah but you know that I mean that's the way the world is you know there's smart people out there and those smart people boss idiots like be around but has there ever been as big a disparity between people who are intelligent involved and the people who aren't all living the same there's actually a lot of all right there's so scientists scientists are talking about how things are gonna go in which direction they're gonna go and they're talking about the elite class of people the smart people we're gonna yeah evolved just like the time machine yeah there's gonna be some Goods and there's gonna be the super smart great like crazy genetically enhanced robot people I don't know why people wouldn't think that's possible you know people want to think somehow other human beings what we are right now is what we're gonna stay okay and we're not we're gonna become something else you know we're gonna we're gonna move on to something else man who knows what the fuck it is but it's not gonna stop right here I just hope that I get robot arms up if you look at like other animals like they all bunch of different kind of subspecies were they branched off and the humans themselves we at one point in time are related to some other kind of primate the same primate that the chimps were related to and they all went in different directions like who the fuck are we to assume that we're that it's gonna stop the branch is gonna stop here no we're not I don't think anybody is anyone think that though some yeah no what are you talking about man most people think that we're here this is how we're stand well they can't even see that the Chinese chick I dated her parents like super-short and and and she just sprung up to like five foot eight you know out of nowhere well guess what she's like eating this chemically processed food but all sudden she get huge and she had big boobs I'm like how what you're Asian your mom is superflat your dad is like scrawny guys like a woman you know you're having more babies now there's more twins there's like some chemicals they pumped in or though like some female steroids yeah that was on purpose yeah embryos well that happens all the time but people are like they can't have a kid you know they're like god I just want to have a baby eject the lady with a bunch of hormones so she's super fertile baby pull he drops his load to inside of her and all of a sudden you pop out a litter of puppies they even put embryos that's what I'm saying actual embryos - no like old women who no longer have any eggs and their body and bodies are starting to get used to having like 12 kids at once it's now would a body be able to have 12 kids 10 years ago I was hoping to see the turtle woman who like has all her kids on the beach if it covers them up with just I think it's a disturbing idea for people to think that there's gonna be two groups of humans intelligent ones and moron ones they literally be two different species because people are worried that they would be in the moron group that's what it is everybody's like I don't even want to talk about this this is not real no bullshit people can evolve together we're gonna help each other stop thinking like that you're a pessimist really watch the fucking news really you don't pay attention to some of the crazy shit you hear people do you hear about people fucking their kids and going into stores with machine guns and you don't think that there's somewhere it's somehow possible that that might be a separate subspecies of people eventually completely unrelated to like a Bill Gates like so totally different yeah it's just a matter of time man you know what I'm cool with being on the lower end I'm like whatever I'll be like the smartest dumb guy to be all savage I'm like what 7-eleven give you food he might be more fun and you might be getting more chicks chicks it's hard to get them to commit to a relationship they're very wary of you they want it like I don't you seem like a guy who's gonna like abuse my emotions but the dumb chicks like I dumb ones are sometimes it's more fun if you want a party partying with dumb people sometimes there's a lot more fun partying with smart people want to fucking cry talk to you about the husband's do you I mean think about it if you're just a guy trying to have a good time you have two options one is a girl who's 23 just got out of college she's out with all of her best friends and they're all drinking okay there's that or she's 31 she's smoking cigarettes she just broke up with her boyfriend she thinks she might be pregnant who the fuck you gonna talk to who are you gonna talk to you want to talk to this smart chick who just graduated from college and she's not exactly sure what she's going to do with their life and like hey hey hey I just want to dance can we just have a drink and have some fun no no so you got me we have a point if you want to have some fun just fun study studies disagree with you what was right at from age 27 at a 45 is like a woman's social property for sure sexual problems all I'm saying telling me a twenty three-year-old is not blowing up we're talking about dumb and smart oh that's what I'm talking about I'm not talking about necessarily the the age I think the chicks are hottest when they're in their 30s because they became women and they know each other I'm just saying in our theoretical world of two different subspecies you might be better off being king of the retards because you get a lot of hot chicks that are just like really easy and fun to hang out with whereas opposed to you hang out with a lot of smart chicks like they're gonna want a lot of commitment is the future now and I am the kick of the retards I'm chubby enough in Texas that I'm a supermodel yeah Texas you fit right the fucking pocket dude there's like a man with a guy a girl's like a man with a little gut in Texas that's a man who's living bigger is better look in the old days man fat broads were attractive that's why those old paintings like fat men yes oh yeah she's so luxurious look she gets to get fat because nobody else got fat man you know when you look at those old pictures of fat bitches and you're like why is that sexy what the fuck was wrong with them what was wrong as it was hard to get food that was their bling they were bling bling and all that shit right here I got all fat hanging off my arms and shit that's how much food I got bitch that was those pictures were the that was the equivalent of dub magazine that was the equivalent of MTV Cribs they were showing their bling this is my bling with all my fat I just be eating shit pigs and shit all day eggs yeah you could be fat and fucked up and you looked like royalty whereas everyone else was sinewy and they fucking worked all day they would built like mayhem I go back a time I want to plow some hood rats that you're saying well you go back in time you know maybe fat chicks you fall into a world life maybe maybe the only reason that guys could get fat chicks is because they had those gay powdered wigs on and only fat chicks would well that's the same era I think it was getting out of that with Jerome painting people to wash back then they wash like very rarely while you wash our pits and your and your junk you do like the Irish shower real quick god damn how much did people stink back but I think that's how we're supposed to be yeah we're always trying to kill our pheromones off of each other do you think that if people just walked around all day funky that you get used to no getting used to the cat litter box I smell it every day I stinky smelling I don't mind no you don't mind it I Jude are locked up with this guy the other day and as soon as we started wrapping his shirt smelled like pneumonia maybe leave their shit when people leave their ghee in their in their in their bag and then they put it on again a second time it's got that smell this guy his rash guard for sure he wore it twice you know that's what happened for the last ten years asshole it's like yeah however and every girlfriend I've had whether she knew it or not I smell her armpit hard really yeah every time I can't help it my nose doesn't work that good sometimes during when I get warmed up it works just fine isn't amazing how repulsive stinky pussy is not and this is not a woman-hating statement at all I understand no one's perfect it's just a health problem so it is it's it's a you know a bacterial infection or whatever it is it's just it's not nothing wrong I mean it happens to be both but the the smell itself is such a warning sign to men there's whatever the fuck it is pussy always smells awesome when you get down there you smell the hormone and the the moistness of it it has like this glazed fucking scent to it like you just barely pick it up it says if you smell a woman through her pussy I mean it's a clean fresh pussy is a fantastic odor but when it's nasty when she's got some sort of a yeast infection or something it's horrifying like all of your synapses are firing all of your senses you go away from that the last thing you want to do I mean I will eat a girl's ass after she gets back from the gym way quicker than I would ever even think about going down to grow as a yeast infection has anybody ever gone down the grow as a houston salutely cottage cheese but you know what's really you know it's bad also is so pussy when they don't clean out the soap enough and you're licking you're like this tastes like I'm fucking watching my soap have you ever gone down on a girl when she used infection what level does it become a yeast infection I mean at one point it's like getting there and then beyond it then it stinks but I'm sure you know it's not just period blood this period blood bug you blood now from the girls I've recently been turning into brave are you know putting fucking stripes underneath my eyes fucking drinking that shit I think if you turned on enough you don't give a fuck for sure that's what it is like whenever I hear like girls will complain they will tell you stories about their you know their boyfriend won't fuck them when they're on the rag and he's disgusted by it yeah like that guy's not that into you let me tell you something if a guy wants to fuck you he doesn't care if your pussy's red that's nonsense what is the difference if it's it's it's slippery and red or slippery and clear I don't know if I have a odor I don't give a fuck that's just blood if I'm horny and that's it oh there's gonna be some blood I don't care eggs my shit is ready to go and I go into gorilla mode fuck about I don't care about I would now Redwing time 20 right now yeah if mrs. Rogan is on their period I'll eat that pussy I don't give a fuck I like it okay I'm not scared of blood dude I got this werewolf fucking fixation yeah I don't like those when I feel want to wash it off and then you have that cocoon shell on your dick the next morning where you pull it off like a lousy forget yeah yeah it's a good turn man because that's a primal thing these are all like primal messages that nature gives you these are all good things it's good for the chick it's good for you you know when you go down on a chick and you smell her and she smells awesome and you want to eat a pussy that feels good for her to that's like extra excitement like you're into it she loves it and this is just bursts of positive energy that's all good stuff man ain't nothing wrong with that you know in the fact that somehow or another you're not supposed to talk about this or it's supposed to be something that's you know discussed behind closed doors that's just because people are afraid yeah they're afraid of their feelings or afraid of emotions they're afraid of looking ridiculous well that's our whole culture to have like a whole crash stop on sex like oh my god sex like a lot of us is here because two people fucked yeah that's the one come you can't talk about eating pussy on the Today Show why can't I go on The Today Show and just you don't want to see those what Katie Couric warning oh you don't want to see that you're trying to protect you they're trying to protect you from gross women getting horrified caught Katie Couric ten years ago and we if you want some if you ever had some athlete's dick you have some MMA fighter dick you ever have some gladiator cock Jason mayhem Miller is ready to throw down do you want to be mayhem monkey number four two one you want to see how operations available you and me in the record books yo I'll rope with a boner doing the weather do you want that why would al roker get hard do you think our Roker would get hard from Katie Couric it's like a sister that gets more money each other you are fucking Hawking on my screen time I bet they get all shitty with each other I don't like to what you through to that piece fuck you Katie you made fifty million dollars in CR you fucking whore you you read the fucking weather what do you do what do you do you pointed shit you think you're talented I'm a conversationalist you're a fucking sideshow people tuned in to see how much weight you lose know that their managers do that not them do you think they'd bang a massive Katie Couric and see how all bang oh my god oh my god George W Bush like a mess hilarious guy ever I love him more than I've ever loved a male celebrity yes because he said he's a train go he's a train wreck but everybody gets to see it so he can't he I'm sure he must have been a fucking nightmare to be in a relationship with but I don't think we're getting all the fucking details out of her either I think that bitch is fucking cuckoo because yo the chicks always will do dog that's why because she's already done all the work now she's collected dividends by recording them here's the deal ladies please if anybody talks to you like that don't talk to them just hang up don't ever engage in because I understand she's got a kid with them but let's be realistic this 2-part yeah but this shit didn't start recently those kind of screams that motherfuckers been ramping up for years yeah that's years worth of build-up to get to that point where that kind of crazy is acceptable you know I mean like you can't release that Kraken on the second day of the relationship right you get that kind of crazy you gotta get to know each other for a long-ass time to the point where you feel like you could just be completely insane with her go fucking cunt whore I hope you get super crazy chocolate that's been building up I was like a sex thing between them and there was like role-playing and that she took the recordings of and this is like and a breath going you know what I could say if he was like a jock queen Phoenix type dude he could say this is all performance yes yeah that's all he has to say - he can have a public apology and say none of this was ever meant to get-get out and I definitely took it too far and I definitely think I got to in a character and said some shit that was offensive and I never wanted people to hear it and all I was doing was exploring this character that I was creating for a new role yeah about a guy who was this very wealthy man with a Russian bride who was trying to kill him and he crazy yes I was exploring this character and she took it it's way out of context and Mel call me we could work this shit out son hey hobby I wanna fuck mayhem and I got it dude we're gonna meet you in Malibu we'll get some sushi at Nobu holla -

Drew said he was talking about recovery and the fact that I was in recovery for alcohol and then he might have like fucked up and fell off the wagon so he might like legitimately be crazy yeah you know sounds like it sounds like you're right like cuz that's not normal guy psycho he would hog up after he said his piece Brian you ever met anybody that crazy yeah it's usually thyroid conditions and shit like that but maybe he just got so stuck into the like lethal weapon somebody crazy huh you mess up you who do you know that's that crazy I made a stripper that we don't have to say names an ex okay no girl I know the work okay oh that girl what the one with the hair yes and that girl would get that crazy huh well you could tell it was a irritation brought on by you know some chemicals chemicals stuff you know yeah and and you could tell it was just one day was awesome other day it was like the worst story but they don't have any medical issues or so quick to dismiss that shit right now the bottom line is man the body fuck's up and sometimes doesn't produce this shit it's supposed to produce right totally anytime somebody has a you know whatever a mental condition and then he and then exacerbates the with alcohol alcohol drugs or whatever it means popping them adderall right a lot of guys who write to adderall or super focus that right I tried that and I had a football like that because the doctor said oh you have a BB oh really I've a TB I'm just hyperactive really and then he gave me that stuff and for a while I was writing blogs right or whatever man I don't know where to start flipping out like losing my mind well it's like speed speed salts that's what's called they didn't hide the name in a different name I mean song yeah that's what it's called the generic is you get generic it's methamphetamine salts generic for adderall like whoa they're selling this to kids Brian look that up may be crazy I was like chemical term is that's insane yeah adderall I've been in Wikipedia probably yeah they just walk around super scrawny and ripped up oh my god that's so crazy at least be 12 do you take per day I probably take a 500 milligrams sure about that but I have a buddy who's a comic who's on the adderall and he says it helps him tremendously he said right for yeah well he's a dude who's he doesn't take care of himself he his body he's in his 40s and he looks like he's falling apart he's just one of those dudes it's just never been real health conscious and and he was having issues with energy and focus and they got him on this adderall shit and now this motherfucker just works his ass off he just sit in front of the computer ten hours at a stretch to the fighter the soldiers in his army help there's greedy's the Vietnam era the Greenies the guys are taking it and going on ruck marches for like two or three days well I thought the Japanese invented it I thought they invented it for and then they tested it out on kamikaze pilots that's what I had read or maybe I'd seen a documentary I don't really remember totally but there was something on the the creation of methamphetamines and it was connected to kamikaze pilots that that's how they talked those guys into going crazy and slamming their plane into boats I said they were all messed out of their heads totally make sense being in war do you imagine being over there oh these are me being in war and being left out of your fucking mind surrounded by other dudes meth out of your fucking mind and everyone's got guns yeah but you know what Jap dudes are like real serious I lived over there they're like very like focused on everything like warrior culture you're a huge star over there to Europe you're a much bigger star in Japan than you are now I wish that I you know they I could fight over their boar but right now they love you you know why because I make an effort actually my real charter by Lee you know my best buddy I called Mikey that beats like Big Brother and he's like my guy and I lived over there and is like because of the limited Japanese I could speak I assimilated with Japanese fighters and I would just be be and you know 18 Japanese fighters eating at a sumo restaurant like that is me and a bunch of these dudes and I kind of got used to their culture right it kind of got into it like japanese dude right now they're so serious man you know i don't mean about not joking around oh yeah I mean about like their their their energy like their warrior spirit they're so fucking driven with it you know it's such an interesting culture the culture that like really appreciates the effort like dudes will lose and get so many fans you know dudes will just fight like like a warrior go out if she show heart in in losses you become more and more popular look at Sakuraba it didn't matter how many times he lost nobody ever gave up on him it's like like boxing like if De La Hoya gets knocked the fuck out two times in a row nobody would go same fight everyone's gonna say hang it up to a lawyer but Sakuraba dude it doesn't matter how many times he got his eggs scrambled yeah people showed up to watch him fight again and they cheered him like you they respected him yeah those like lesser versions where he's getting his ass kicked to come back and win I love Japan just for k1 I just love that they put on k1 because if it wasn't for Japan like real high level kickboxing especially those big heavyweights and shit there'd be nothing man we're the fucker anybody putting on shows in America mean there are Muay Thai shows and shit like that but there's nothing there's nothing like that Steve built like the UFC from their negative side where no one had that Steve built about kickboxing that anybody care to high level guys know man it's so fucking exciting man the pka that PKA karate shit in the eighties ruined chaos in America because everybody got the cuts the bad Brad Helen and shit flippy kicks oh yeah it's like super like D level athletes do it there's such a big difference between kickboxing above the waist and kickboxing with leg kicks yeah you add those leg kicks it changes the whole form gotta be way stronger like you have to be like a strong tough dude mentally could take it yeah my legs are sore right now from this morning's training and only took like two with-with-with shit pads on did you see the his own shamrock Frank Shamrock got smash come on though but he finished him on a leg kick the final leg kick he's so let it is so hard to watch man you watch you just go you could feel Pedro with those tree trunk legs just the bone just slams into Ken's leg and if you look at four years four years the ready to fight Randy how to rehab his legs for six fucking months I know he has like a weird vibe from that fight so does random men from here Pedro his both guys from his own cuz his own would chop at you so hard with such good technique and he's so fucking big he would jack guys legs so bad they would literally never be the same again I'll tell you you know you as a fighter one of the rare awesome things I've seen in my life like I just remember the first time I kicked somebody real good in the ribs I kicked them hard with my shin bone was one of the most amazing feelings because I never new boy-toy I moved to California trained boy time for real and kicked the bads real hard and then I remember the guy came and he threw a left he threw a jab and I turned and kicked and with my shin with my it went into his ribs I could feel everything move right in there man almost unreal feeling my life because I felt his body changed because what I was doing and I was like man and he was he was after that point of the fight he was kind of done like he was like uh and then he let me beat him up cuz cuz I kicked him I got him a good one in the ribs and he was done after that because you know your body your body's to go that way to go there's there's some kicks from from Taekwondo that are really effective the guys are using now at Connolly's bringing back there they're like you learned how to kick where you're like like it's a hard one but it's so fast right it's not the same as a boy Thai kick where you digging through with the whole body yeah they're the best guys are the guys who have the combination of both types of styles you have the ability to throw like Taekwondo fast kicks side kicks and turning sake but they also have the Muay Thai leg kicks and the more tight defense is important too you know you you you you got to know how to fucking deal with those shin slamming into your arms because those pka guys they never got kicked like that very rarely did guy get his arm broken the pka but in like k1 lebanner broke his arm I mean Frank Shamrock on his arm because I'm to be aware of the leg kicks - yeah so like you're like worrying about all this guy's gonna kick me in the leg well you're right prime range from the kick your arm off its side it's that but it's also the shin you know if other guys just did not understand the power of the shin everybody was going instep well I understand the power yeah but you know here's what but if you take away boy Thai guys leg kicks right and make it by pique that style of above the waist lends itself for like slap fights yeah it doesn't turn it to like a real kickboxing match where you got another huge element when you add knees and yes huge huge huge cuz you know why I thought about a lot and I visualized it a lot and I always like in my fights always feel that okay this is the end of my rage with my hands and I go I feel about my legs ago okay that's the end of my range with my kicks and I figure that out the first minute or two and I go okay that's where I could play okay so then you know I with that kickboxing thing you got a stand so close to each other and whatnot you can't really get a good dig you know you can't really get there there wasn't exciting back out there was like right a lot of times guys standing like Rock'em Sock'em robots just up kicking I mean there were some exciting fighters like don the dragon Wilson was really exciting I was like a little kid who what's that Dennis Alexio he fought when they had like leg cake style that was that was leg kicks time yeah but that was a there's a transition where they were trying to put like leg kick fights on TV I remember Don Wilson fought Alexio man was back in the dizzy Sun but don don the dragon Wilson fucked up Dennis alexia with leg kicks yeah that's how he won that fight yeah so but once you take that away mm-hmm there's not a big like spot where you can set up to make a hard kick to the up aren't you surprised though that someone hasn't figured out a way to do some sort of a k1 thing in America I know k1 has had a few fights in America but how the fuck is that not on TV age so like whenever that shit's on like the k1 Grand Prix I get fired up you see Badr Hari but you know it's for Mark Cuban and that HDNet man I watch more MMA because the HDNet that's a great network I'm just surprised that no one's got a kick boxing I think kickboxing chuckles got a kick I got a hug by Chuck Norris yeah one of the proudest moments of my life and I was so pissed I didn't want to go back and say can I take a picture with you and be all cheesy but Chuck Norris when he met me he reached out his hand and gave me this big giant hug and he like slapped me on the back I'm like I'm in um and do you understand me I just got love from Chuck Norris do you remember any details from that day like that a certain smell or like love I remembered love was in the air no dude we were at Vegas and we were at a wcl one of those world kickboxing leagues or whatever the name of it was it was Vegas or Atlantic City I think it was Vegas I'm not sure anyway um I just went up and I said to one of the guys that was working there I said do you think I can meet Chuck Norris and the guy goes yeah I'm like fuck yeah come on man and he just brought me over to Chuck Norris and I was just gonna say sir I'm a huge fan very nice to meet you and but Chuck Norris fucking opens his arms gives me his big job giant smile and says Joe what's gives me this big Joe Rogan to the wall he got a hug from Chuck Norris and lived to tell the tale I wish it did dude I was for real man as a kid I was a huge corporate Chuck Norris fan and to the dragon that fight with Bruce Lee all the fucking missing in action movies I mean it's dumb as they were it was that lone wolf McQuade that was a shit son come on man with a little David Carradine extra points low multiple K to Chuck Norris was the fucking man so for me to have Chuck Norris recognize me and give me his big hug and call me by name I was like oh shit it's like the best birthday present ever it's Morpheus you know you'd only do audio he was he was ready to fucking he hates squirrels birds and cats he will fuck some shit up if he could get ahold of it he'll run I've seen run into this into a busy on Fairfax celebrate I mean Fairfax said third he and how into the street after a bird let me ask you this what do you think about Strikeforce you like working for them yeah everyone's cool yeah you know I I feel like they just have certain problems that will be fixed as time goes on but you think if it wasn't for this battle with the Diaz brothers this this thing and post fight thing with Gilbert mothers anything do you think you would be challenging for the title right now because Jake just abandoned it yeah the toughest fight with your fight with him was way tougher than Henderson you know I guess I guess you know what I shouldn't say that that's not really fair because Dan came really close to putting him out closer to holding him out really good fighter he like he just gonna keep going but from that point on it was a rout it seemed like Dan was having a hard time making way it didn't seem like the normal Dan he looked he looked sick dude I think him making 85 but he doesn't like cutting that weight yeah well of course because duties fucking forty years old yeah but that's what I'm saying I'm saying that that get over it I'm sure what are you doing no but when he gets forty that's really hard to do yeah Dan if he catches you with that fucking right hand okay Sam you got problems we all know that dude's got one missile man he knocked out vanderway ventilators left oh you thought got a strong core yeah oh yeah super hard punch yeah you got fucking problems no I mean he's not like you know a Masato technique striker yeah yeah but goddamn he's got haymakers but uh you know yeah maybe I kind of gave Strikeforce a black eye you know I brought some attention to us but I gave Strikeforce a black eye a little bit bye-bye cause of that whole drama but you didn't want to start do you want to start a fight of course I wanted to hype up a rematch and everybody's on CBS let's make some money let's let's get everybody fired up and enthusiastic about this and everybody wins it's not like you were going in there with a an angry mean face on look would fight him right now what it was was it's like I don't know the CBS not get it you know everybody was bad at me and I'm like guys what happened negative here I I got jumped on I didn't get hurt they totally did not understand what you were getting all the blame for that I know the people who should have got the blame with the people who let you in no one should have let you in that was an oversight they know that now it'll never happen again that's what you know running a business is all about no one's perfect but once that said you know what it was was there was too many fucking people in the Octagon there was you who was an unwanted person in the Octagon and you were interfering with someone who was getting their glory the whole thing was just badly run it was chaos you get a bunch of fucking dogs together okay and dogs start growling and shit happens you can't get mad at the dogs you know you just can't look I I think those guys should have done that but fuck man you know emotions run high after victories things happen people get crazy and you know and what's the worst that happened may have got jumped on TV yeah you got fucking kicked in the head for how long this is plenty for three months three months yeah but if I were to argue with it it would have been like dive-bomb you can't win you can't win if you win it sets a precedent I know when is the last time anybody ever like try to get a fight overturned or protested something ever and it came from any steroid test anything stoppage or any worked no nobody yeah Benjy Braddock protested the Scott Smith fire resident yeah I think was you thought it would stop too soon yeah you know what man that people fuck up and it's a terrible thing that people fuck up but once they fuck up it's very rare than anything look straight to the future with a positive mindset usually you know works out for me so who do they have lined up for you in October I'm not sure I bet we're trying to put big deals together oh yeah little grudge match so so guess what I started a grudge back and it ended up now they're gonna use it you know like okay now we got a grudge match well that would be a hyped up fight right so that would be in October do you know where it's gonna be out no I don't know anything I don't know if it's happening yet but you know I like to rub my mouth off and hopefully make it happen are you bummed out that you don't fight for the UFC ah no you're fine you know I got a good deal whatever I'm cool yeah the UFC the biggest show in town and and I understand that like when you see like you know like Chael Sonnen challenging Anderson for the title if you look at that shit that could be my wish yeah cool if if something gets worked out where I could work with them in the future okay cool but you know right now I I have a contract then and you know I'm generally pretty happy and you know whatever I'll cool you with Dana you and Dana cool I don't know about no but she doesn't say hi to be so damn crazy made me worry things up crazy and I don't blame them because my you are crazy yeah I'm crazy but but not pretty controlled again if I can get on the same page is somebody we could be crazy I'll be the crazy guy and you make some money we'll both make money how long do you think Billy beat down way too long god I I thought it wasn't and then I did the third season I recorded it all and it'll be released it you know crazy it would be if you were on bully beatdown and good fighter at same time people get sicker baby no one's gonna get sick you ma'am don't worry about that we're here for you all right just take a little bit less b12 what is it about the b12 gives you energy nice and fucking freaks me out I got used to it now and I like oh like it's burning my whole body but I like it Davis girl got me all the vitamins of what not at man I'm like this is the best thing that happened to me that's very important man supplements it to me nobody yeah you know what I just started taking supplements like this year whatever wow that's crazy it's stupid to what it is yeah yeah I didn't think that it was that important but bad I feeling a market difference well you know what it is is its market its marked marketed rather if you you know listen to like people like doctors to tell you all you need is a multivitamin all that stuff it's nonsense you know why it's cuz it's not FDA approved oh it's not approved well it doesn't mean just because it's not approve doesn't mean it doesn't work alright there's a lot of anecdotal evidence for people that are taking it that are having pretty positive results there's like nootropics that I take that make your brain work better there's a whole bunch right you don't a list of all the different shares resveratrol but there's a bunch of different things that are designed judge nootropics designed just to increase cerebral activity you know you're talking about that and I think that we live in a culture where it's not about living better really it's about just living above the death line like nobody wants nobody wants to really think about it fantastic yeah yeah it's like you know I you know feeling fantastic is bad long well why you're not allowed to smoke pot and anywhere but California well there's that you know how about mint how much does it drive you crazy when dudes who don't work out will talk shit on exercise and the importance of keeping your body don't ignore it view where a lot of people are ignorant and then they take pride in their ignorance that's like dude when your body works better your brain feels better it all works better the whole thing flows better so true Jews but nobody wants to admit that that's their issue you know nobody wants to admit that their their lack of exercise and everything no no I don't need nobody needs to work out what I don't want to comics are fucking famous out of that right comics are always bitching and whining and they just want to sleep till 3:00 and don't do anything constantly that that shit is so important for you man yeah well I just think that people in general it's easier to be lazy and that bitch about it cuz that's funny you get positive reinforcement from people laughing at that like haha yeah I hear you work it out too yeah there's a little bit of that misery loves company you know but I had a conversation with the dude once we was talking about like what's the point in exercise and what's the point working out I got alright if I could give you a pill and this pill would give you a super powerful body like ridiculous much more powerful than normal person you could literally take the normal man and strangle him at will you could take him manhandle him treat him like a girl and choke him to death if I give you a pill that would give you that wouldn't would you take it listen what do you want to have that power I mean would you want to have this superpower I'll give you a pill and it turns you into an assassin and I'm like well you can have that stupid I have to do is work out if you train and you through some kettlebell [Laughter] Jitsu affiliation program I'm trying to sign people up you enjoy working out though where a lot of people don't enjoy you know what I enjoy I enjoy jiu-jitsu because jiu-jitsu to me it's like it's an awesome distraction I got so much going on in my life when I get into Jitsu and I'm rolling some dude and we are just trying to kill each other you know I'm trying to choke him he's trying to choke me we are battling we're pacing ourselves I know what this motherfuckers doing he keeps going for the deep half sweep I got to keep that under hook I got to stop him there's like this battle going on and when that battle is going on man I don't think about shit else I'm not thinking about I need to clean my office I'm not thinking about I need to call that dude about this thing I need to get my shit together and write this new material no I'm just doing jujitsu I'm in that zone is it so difficult to do it puts you in the zone you know and it's like a fun fucking game yeah why were on it you need to clean your office bro a little bit right yeah if you only had the passion with you're telling me that mr. cleans out on juice look at that guy lost all his hair tattoos all swollen shit Kristof is a fucking sculpted damn specimen whoo cool motherfucker - yeah him and his girl hung out with them in England shit oh and Krista I was on The Ultimate Fighter for people who don't know super nice guy that's the thing about MMA the people don't realize is how many nice people there are that are involved in it and then martial arts in general like some of the nicest people I know are dudes that have fought and dudes a train because you have like a better control your ego you're like you know you're just you're used to getting your ass kicked you used to used to finding out your real boundaries by breaking yourself down you know by getting to the point where you know you you you literally can't fucking breathe you literally are in class and when and when the everyone says time and you you dropped your back you know you literally you're broken whereas other people they hardly ever experience that they don't experience the boundaries of their of their Drive the boundaries of their discipline you know so like the people that I've met that are like fighters like some of the coolest fucking people you ever meet in your life you know they have to show their ass the world man it's definitely you got a drop you got a whoever you are comes out if they like you have to really be yourself per se and you have to deal with the pain you're like oh my god I don't want to be a bitch and dad you never loved me and shit like that goes to your head you know okay it's not you know you you have to confront these real fears of real you have to confront everything and I say all of you guys out there in cyberspace be a cage fighter just for a day and there's there's growth in that there's growth in that confrontation you know when you understand your boundaries and you hit them you know you you get to know yourself better you get to know yourself better than the average dude who doesn't do shit with his body you know there's something about doing something really difficult willpower wise with your body like training and and especially training in jiu-jitsu and shit where like there's there's battles man and sometimes you know you a guy's got your back and you're defending and you know you could just tap out and this is gonna be over but your other center hot you know the other side your brains going no we're gonna gut this out as long as we possibly can and there's that like fence that you're you're dancing on where you're like I only just tap right here fuck this kid but it's so uncomfortable and so difficult to get through but your willpower allows you to survive and then you get through and you're like motherfucker I got through that I thought I was gone I thought I was gone and now I'm on top oh shit and now I'm passing you know it's like this over coming of adversity a lot of people never experience that especially it's like physically well your mind has to control your body through some uncomfort you know yeah yeah I know I guess you could get the same effect from like I don't know run a marathon or do they you know do anything physically but you have to push your body the mind and the willpower have to control the body I think it's much more difficult when you're doing it in a competition like MMA or anything like sing or true Jitsu anything where it's a dude is trying to kill you think about the kind of willpower that's involved in Tour de France I know I believe legs just do the same movement discipline yeah damn when I look at like Lance Armstrong I go that must be the most boring intense motherfucker alive boring ass shit he's just pedaling I mean is not boring I mean obviously they're racing and it's awesome countryside and shit and there's all this attention and alls energy but they're doing the same thing for nine days yeah that shit takes days it's like who's the most boring intense motherfucker on earth let's find out everybody get together get on a bike they were like a County counting Olympics guys just adding fucking bills up for fuck it's six days straight yeah there's something about there like sheer test of discipline that are so uncomfortable for me you know I have you know because there's a fighter I have like you know some seriousness but to get inside the room and fight with other guys for you know at least an hour like I'm doing that for at least an hour a day and pretty much my entire life I've done that the other side I can't fell outta fucking form without get distracted like I'm like sitting there house application was the funniest thing I've ever done because I'm sitting there like motherfucker if you put one more paper my face I'm gonna slap your fucking notary public face like all day just staying there I hate I hated it that's funny yeah Barry like when I look at a lawyer or whatever I'm like wow you fucking look at papers that read shit all day like dude I am the exact same way I'm a retard when it comes to like filling out forms and shit and I get under like page ten I feel like someone's hitting me if someone's it's that someone's drowning me like stop this is boring and I think what it is is like you don't want to think you don't want to put your brain on that low and RPM where yeah I'm eating this and reading that look making sure this is okay and making sure that's okay tell that to every teacher that I've worked with square pegs in round holes man that's what it is you know the big fucking problem with teachers is they're trying to turn everybody into a robot that assumes a job out there in the world and there's people with unique personalities that could be artists and no one recognizes that whether it's a martial artist or a fucking singer or comedian no one looks at that as a viable path for you know a job you know so teachers want you to be able to get a job but they want you to do you know what it takes to get a job at some company and and move on let's be honest that both people what do you have to do you can't cater you can't cater most school work to anyone who's an artist but there should be some way to recognize when someone's unusual there should be some way to recognize and part of is that the kids don't have any discipline and that's why they're fucking going squirrelly and that's why they can't read and probably their home life but you're not gonna fix that okay you could try to square out that fucking round peg and and shove them into that hole but you're only gonna get so far you know it you're but then you're trying to say okay let's take all the wacky kids and put them in a special class and I think all these kids who are definitely gonna be construction workers put a biscuit now I don't think that I think there should be other opportunities or she should be like some people don't want to be comedians you know some people don't want to be singers but there should be some sort of like an avenue that you find is interesting and you can go towards it in school you know I'm saying but there's no viable option for class clowns no viable options for disruptive kids but disruptive kids have something there's something there first of all it's a terrible thing it's undisciplined it fuck's up to school for the rest of kids and maybe it's because one kid is imbalanced because one can probably didn't get enough attention at home or one kid had an abusive family and this is the way he learned how to get attention by lashing out and focusing attention on himself that said you got a kid who's willing to do some crazy shit that other kids aren't willing to do now yeah okay so you're not gonna fix them you can you can teach him you know the consequences of him doing that and how he's fucking it up for everybody else and that creates bad energy and this is where we're gonna focus your energy but you're not gonna take away that energy that crazy energy that some people have it just needs to be fine that was me man I was the kid in high school that was like if you just applied yourself Jason yeah it'd be just a little I did a completely different direction I did fighting yes people donor stand you apply yourself in that way somehow or another that's not valid like because you know some part for me was a yeah for me was art I used to draw a lot and in martial arts so those were the two things and neither one of them seemed like any sort of a viable career option there was no money in martial you didn't think about the animation being a cartoonist because that's what I thought either a cartoonist or doing radio so the whole time I'm going to school I'm like you know I don't fucking care about math history I'm not I'm just gonna sleep because I don't care about any of this I'm never gonna use it I kind of knew that because I was like a huge Disney fan cartoon fan yeah I mean I was more comic books I loved comic book yeah comic books too that's how I got into it yeah I definitely had aspirations to be a comic book artist we talked about this on one of the earlier podcast but I just had a really douchey art teacher in high school and he had me convinced that I was gonna have to draw like diaper ads and shit and really many people have bad teachers yeah I mean he wasn't a bad teacher he's just a bad socially he was a beaten man with no spine he was he had a weak will and he didn't like being around me I was this martial arts fighter this kid who was fighting in you know Taekwondo tournaments I was I liked Taekwondo championship t-shirts I'm so so proud that I won all these talk we know tournament so to wear Taekwondo shit everywhere it was the first thing I was ever any good at you know in high school I do that kid cried a champion bro I beg back I was like 16 I begged him to spar hey man Cruz spar and I didn't realize that I was scaring him cuz he like I like yeah yeah don't we're gonna fight you just you could kick me and use your karate and I know how to wrestle I'm gonna try to fight you and then we'll see who wins and I'm telling this to this kid who'd sit there like a bunny like fuck that I found out the future of MMA when I was 15 years old I was a sophomore in high school actually I think was 14 my friend Steven Arduino was on the wrestling team Resler yeah and I wasn't wrestling I was just doing talking knowing we were really good friends we were always talking about like you know like if you photo just focus on a punch in the face I bet you can't take me down yeah we went out in the grass and this motherfucker took me down over and over again it was so sad yeah because it was so easy for him it turned out I had no wrestling at all I had no I've never even thought about wrestling someone except like fucking around my friends and he just would fucking Stannah finally put his hand in my face shoot a double bang I'll be on my back oh no no no no it was just me stop that we're friends it was just me stopping him from taking me down whatever right my fat chubby friend named Pierre showed me the UFC the early ones with the fucking head butts and everything and showed me like Vala to Dover Zil and he's like it showed me the newer ufc's at the time like is maybe I don't know ninety five or six he showed me those and Ike Pedro II era Marco who asked first Paul Barlow oh and I was like yeah yeah exactly so I was like man I was like oh I could do this anything do you want to spar me and I'm like you mean fight in the backyard and he's like yeah yeah yeah well smart you know we're production it was this kind of martial artist I'm gonna kill you like I I thought or you see you know bubble I beat Bubba's ass in the front yard it's giant fat black kid he's like 300 pounds like the scariest dude I beat the shit out of him cuz I knew how to fight like a man I would I would always spar around with my dad so I knew had a box and stuff and and whatever he we go out in the backyard we said I had this breakdancing mat that I had we laid that down on top of the grass so he had it some padding because I knew I was gonna fuck him off man we squared off with our hockey chest protectors he fucking spin kicked me in the fuck in my breadbasket I've never made oh my god so I went to the Miller the Miller standby and it's the move I always did my dad taught me in it worked all time one two and if that never had knock him down on the ground you grab his head which I did and threw him down on the ground I did that and started fucking wailing on it like I was like I'm winning I'm winning he starts wiggling around and shit and the next thing I know he locked me up I'm fucking waking up in my backyard looking at the trees like quietly car and he's looking down at me you know like oh my god he's like wow that was a triangle choke about I learned that Gracie jiu-jitsu that was the first time I ever did that to somebody I'm like fuck I can alert this shit he's tiny just decided to fight yes I was looking out the window laughing you fucking idiot all

to become a Jason mayhem Miller dad I know you know what I remember the Brazilians when I was doing tournaments all the time when I was really young 18 19 the Brazilians got a crazy story of me because I would always tell these stories where me and my dad will fight whatever and we'd get into it and or we'd spar around and we did get a head start off as a joke and it would get real like we'd fucking really fight and I would tell those stories to the Brazilians and then it got a story like and I heard the Jason Miller his dad would hit him with beer bottles to make him tougher that's like

man shit mustard like Ted and he's laughing because I my mom's like wait you know like dad took me out is this an actual fight fight o players playing who would plan but this the man and redneck culture you have to understand that if there's a line that's drawn like your plan and then you're not really playing anymore and then it's a it comes from one step for somebody biting somebody's shot exactly you know I'm proud I'm proud that I came from such a strange background like I don't care like I'm a professional fighter I'm not a goddamn kindergarten teacher one time my dad threw a Jolly Rancher at me and hit me in the eye I be fucking stung he missed he totally overthrew it wait he was throwing it too you know there's no even abuse at this store his dad's got a hard-on it hurt son vicious wrist action Saban college right you ever see those chicks that throw like a wet ball I'm gonna be the rubberband thing that makes them throw harder yes on late-night TV yeah always who the hell why our softball players watching ESPN how fast I throw that underhand I don't know probably like 60 miles an hour but the thing is they could do it all day it's like a way more natural movement than like a regular pitcher like a pitcher that shit blows your your shoulder out at all I don't know if it's that they're throwing it harder I think it's the mechanism wait are you saying that they'll be sub kicked from Little League up who's been taught under head and think about this with a big juiced out arm he could throw that shit super hard wonder I wonder because it doesn't seem like girls can do that shit all day and it doesn't blow their arm out but I think there's something about throwing like that that's I think you'd get more velocity yo especially me actually but I know it does why I have like flexible tendons chip like a real flexible when I throw a fucking baseball my our buildings gonna blow out of its sine missione my dad is big he got out of Ranger School he didn't make it through Ranger School he couldn't throw the fucking grenade right same shit Wow the bad children when he talks about flexible Tenon's you could see that shit online if you watch this fight it was a super wrong anyway oh my god he's gonna break it up and I just kicked up spit out and I and I and then I got up oh it's good and I just went and bass the guy with that same hat that he was twisted it's the most ridiculous Kimora defense ever get anyway egon anyway who's this badass jiu-jitsu blackbelt bad motherfucker die haole die oh but dude you know Hawaii is a crazy-ass place yeah psycho people ever Hawaii yeah wines are all just all about Aloha they're like hippies in the that live in their own islands beat the fuck out of each other okay do it they do in movies videos in real life there's definitely definitely parts of people but the Hawaiian community as a whole I think people are friendly people beating the crap out of here every day know what I'm saying so why people on Hawaii are notorious for wanting to fight yeah it's like a part of their culture yeah if you go online there's all these backyard fights or Hawaiian backyard fights dude there's so many of them there's thousands on beach fights and backyard fights what dudes meet after school kids mean after school and they just have MMA fights bare-knuckle they just Duke it out on the grass Hawaii yeah but would you would you say that if you talk to most people like how was your trip to Hawaii they brought up but you go to the resort and you know it's first time I fought SuperBrawl here's a perfect example okay the first time I fought super bro I got cut above the eye it was walk around Waikiki that's some kid with like a dad you that guy huh from super bra and I was like yeah yeah what's up dude he's a Oh what's up I'm tough and I'm like oh cool bro he's like 60 years old 50 years old some fat white Taurus is walking bad he's like what Bob what he what's this and he walks over it bends down like he's tying his shoe and he's like looking at his peripheral vision see this guy walking he stands up and the guy bumps into him oh sorry man this Hawaiian kid starts beating the shit out of him this you know he's young he's so young but it's not really hurting a bike not really hurt the guy but the guys like all stop and he's got a buddy with him doesn't help about all the kids starts in Hawaiian you call it false cracking the guy it's a sucker punch he like gets up it's sucker punch the guy ah he grabs on his backpack at certain jump kicking him jump kicking up Chum the guy starts right up he goes oh my first trip to Hawaii Hawaii people are great remember Forgetting Sarah Marshall I think so the movies forgetting sarah marshall there was the bartender who was super cool yeah that was a part of the movie I was talking about afterwards maybe from the movies that's what I was talking about nobody that's like real life yeah well I mean why is it I've never heard any of my anyone ever say go I went to Hawaii do this fucking fight you're talking about going to Hawaii where you go to resort I go up to Tijuana I bet you the trying to gut me when you talk to BJ Penn like BJ Penn talks about growing up in a wire it's always says there's nothing to do everybody just fights I'm just saying if you're in that road it's definitely more you know in your face than you like if most people going to the store and a suburban neighborhood in Hawaii's you know or some dude no one's saying that Hawaii people are douchebags no one's saying there's a bad bit there - oh boy you want to throw it on so there's a mutual like let's fight nobody shoots each other right right let's fight we'll fight and then we'll end it out all he kick his ass yeah then you get the coconut wireless everybody knows about it you know that it's just the culture you know Penn came out of you know the BJ Penn came out of that that's sort of you know fact that kind of competition is what started as MMA career that he was his bad motherfucker that would step to anybody to fight anyone yeah he took pride in that you know is why he became an MMA champion when you're stuck on a fucking Island like the Big Island and ain't that much people and everyone's just jammed in together on this rock you know tensions run high oh man I lived there too it's a strange strange different place because you you're on this tiny island and it's small because even though it's a million people whatever they whatever circles you run it are tight-knit because everybody knows everybody right it allows me a lot of bullshit between like dudes and girls oh my god epic about like because everybody knows everybody like that dudes Falconer like when someone breaks up you know high school with other guys it's weird that causes tensions painful and you lived on the Big Island isn't it crazy that though the smaller it's another big island it's not that big the boat I don't know why it's the it was the biggest one that developed quickest it's so weird most of the times when I gotta why I went to the big island I went to Maui I went to Kauai but when I went to oh I want to see the other one there's a little small one I feel like I know but when I went to Honolulu I was like paradise though yeah America it's the weirdest city ever it's like a fucking Blade Runner moving yeah it's like here you are in this city with this incredibly beautiful weather with this amazing ocean like you are right there it's a city somehow another but it's not that polluted yeah you know the oceans not that this is washing oh fuck you think why is the best quai Kauai is like Jurassic Park yeah it's all like it's like lost you know yeah like lanai was gorgeous to Lanai it's really small yeah well I imagine lanai is even less developed it quieter and quieter yeah there's one Road I think I only has like three thousand people that live on our thirty face or some tiny it's a it's all like a little fucking spaced out when I was asking for directions there's a fucking three roads this bitch couldn't tell me how to get to the hotel no I think what she doesn't know what here's the thing is that about that when I lived in Hawaii bro I can't tell you what street to turn on I could tell you to get to the Waikiki you got to go down there's a there's a 7-eleven at the end of this one road you take a right there you keep going down and turn just do it one way and you take a right as if ease and then there your urine white oh I see you it's not you nobody knows the world names because they're Lala Mele Kalikimaka and kind of oh ho hey like what like oh the fucking nobody even knows the name of this road how crazy is it that Hawaii is a part of America but it's five hours away on a fucking plane Alaska hey man Alaska is not as crazy at least it's landmass you can drive to Alaska something in the middle of it you just like there's land in the middle and that makes no sense we got attack we got our ass covered on all sides for sure but I mean it's it's incredible that we can call that American it's five hours away on a fucking plane and then Guam is like sort of America yeah peace so is Porto Rico but yeah what are we girls like sort of me like supporter Puerto Rico is like considerate of America though they don't know about axis so they don't want to be part of it but are you allowed to be from Puerto Rico and just immigrate to America thanks thanks I think so too right yeah that's why there's so many Puerto Ricans you know especially if you go to New York oh yeah oh for sure Don Gavin's his fucking comedian from Boston an old-school legend used to have this joke about he's like a real fast-talking am boston guy he's like a fact went with the Puerto Rican that didn't didn't like Puerto Rico to me fucking Puerto Ricans I mean know how thankful for this so expensive mayhem you've been doing stand-up comedy lately where's the great mayhem doing I know I know you did

board mayhem Miller everywhere you don't use myspace anymore do you know I know there's chicks out there they want to ball me up I don't go out there I can't even go out there like yeah is when you see a girl that's still on myspace like this is my myspace but that might be a girl that's retarded unless unless she's picking up this she's king of the scraps there might be like dude I am the most popular person on myspace Tila Tequila part three I've got four thousand friends four thousand active friends a lot of girls claim four thousand friends buy it really yeah I got no BOTS not buy yeah who the fuck is left on myspace only think those computers ok go backlog that are so old they came a work Facebook our friend our friend just quit myspace or work there and now I could finally get rid of my myspace I don't feel back so I only held on to it I think I hope that myspace is gonna make a comeback because I back in the comedy store days MySpace pack that fucking place all the time that was responsible for getting you know it's harder to pop out on Facebook no no the best is twitter twitter is the best yeah Twitter's fun dude I like talking to people I like people send me some shit and I send it back yeah your fans are way smarter than mine because you always get cool shits that do you and I'm like no way a cool shit to them too though whenever I find no you always tweet it I always tweet it so they tweet shit like that back to me but I find out all about a lot of cool articles and cool science developments and shit I find out a lot of that stuff and people on Twitter you know I met you usually we all Sharon I'd like Stoke there exactly you come up with oh cool Joe Rogan put an article and I click gonna read it there's always so much cool shit on the internet man have you seen the Deepak Chopra Sam Harris debates oh yeah I'm with him I forgot the dude's name and Deepak Chopra had this crazy cat lady with him and they're debating God and it's some brilliant shit man Sam Harris is a brilliant brilliant motherfucker he wrote that really good book letters to a Christian nation he's just like skeptic atheist character but a really reasonable day obviously Dawkins versus he did he did a few where he was like kind of Bob Deepak Chopra but I didn't like his arguments against Deepak and it was very short the clip that he used online or in his documentary is very short it was just mostly mocking Deepak but then when Deepak talk to him Deepak was actually pretty reasonable about what he was saying they were talking about the states of mind and mood and the ability to help diseases and caused diseases like bad states of mind quote which I I definitely think I agree with yeah I think I think negative people like negative energy is manifested itself in stress stress manifests itself in misfiring so I had injuries before where the injury it keeps I don't even notice cuz like I just got caveman brain where I get hurt and I just ignore that part of my body right I'll step on something to have a bloody foot and just keep ignoring it until that's good Hospital you know and then so I kept doing that but I didn't realize to put stress on your body and then I got super sick and I'm like why am i sick and got a hurt knee beats because you get in this mind state of being just totally like feeling bad irritated and hurt and then your body breaks out yeah you need positive energy and a good feeling of enjoyment of your life appreciation for everything all that good stuff makes you feel better makes you lighter it makes you have to work less hard makes life less taxing when I'm going through a lot of bullshit in my life ma'am tired all the time you know it's a lot of energy gets used up by that don't you find that like if you're in like a bad personal situation - you're fucking tired all the time Oh totally it's depression usually you know I mean it's depression it's depression but it's also energy just bad feelings well at the risk is not like a hippie energy yeah it's totally sound like a hippie the problem is hippies fucked up a lot of cool shit it a lot of thought of a hippie okay because I bet awesome hippies yeah okay but a thought of a hippie is this silly week yeah like just like the all he does like to lay around in the fields in Boulder when I was in Boulder I got annoyed with a lot of hippies this idealistic stupid point yeah like a trespass on your property and go are you denying us access to the woods I'm like you fucking douchebag this is my yard I bought the word it's our big yard it's my fucking yard how about use the woods over there it's just the woods yeah that's why my bill Mastiff is a nice dog he's cool he'll let you know when people there but he's not like scary I like dogs my pit bulls when I
