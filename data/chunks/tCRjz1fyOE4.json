and what's happening brother how are you hey Joe yeah it's great to be here thanks for having me I've been following your exploits on social media and the yellow caiman yes dude that is a wild looking creature isn't it it's unbelievable it was thought to be extinct yes so this one's it's a little confusing it um it's a species that was last seen in when the last one died in a zoo in the 80s and because of the region that it occupies in Colombia which has always been controlled by FARC rebels nobody had been back down there to look for it and myself and there's actually this amazing Colombian scientist named Sergio Rianna we're both kind of going and prodding and trying to see if we could get in and we both found it within a month of each other oh wow yeah now it was a beautiful looking creature look at that thing right it's such a wild green yellow color so wow it's you super unique didn't just holding that thing by the neck yeah we just had a little wrestling match him and I so you don't even have body control don't you want to take Mountain here maybe get a back mount get some hooks in you know reptiles they tire out so they're not like mammals once they expend all their energy that's kind of it but yeah absolutely amazing are they similar to regular crocodiles alligators and that they don't have to eat for like a year yeah though so caiman I mean caiman don't have the as slow of metabolism as certain other species but they are they're a member of the alligator family so to speak and they can go very long times without food what a crazy animal like looks like a monster yep I mean look at the teeth on that thing swallows things basically hold yeah it spins to take chunks off of things swallows them whole it doesn't have to eat for a year can go underwater for how long without holding it's like 4045 minutes some of them yes no ideas there right this is waiting for you and they're fairly small right there's like a 90 pound animal when it's fully grown well these ones it's so little is known about this particular species of caiman that it's hard to say I would say yeah a hundred pounds is probably about right there's a great photo Jaime from the nature is metal Instagram page from yesterday that's nuts I love that page there's a great one of a Jaguar with a caiman in its mouth that one look at the eyes on that fucker yeah go look at that look at those bangs right in the throat like just death grip and then you can see that that came in is death rolling in that scene right it's trying to get away it's rolling and that jag is just locked in the eyes on that thing my god unbelievable it's like Nature has created like in those kind of eyes that's the perfect that's the the perfect vision of terror yeah like those eyes like locked into those eyes like there's no forgiveness there's no emotions there's just ferocity and aggression and death it seems like nothing but testosterone is behind that you know I mean testosterone is probably the wrong wrong chemical but it just seems so focused and motivated and like you say it's just it looks like death yeah I'm sure there's some testosterone involved in that equation too but it's a bunch of other cat shit literally apparently the thing in the caption was saying that the caiman has one of the greatest bites per pound of any of the big cats and they regularly eat these the Jag yeah Jaguar rather has one of the greatest bites and they regular eats these these Caymans yeah no they're amazing and and you know back to the one that we found it's so great because like I'm the hide-and-seek guy right like I look for them and now there's a scientist Sergio Rhianna down in Colombia who's gonna manage that species ongoing existence oh wow it's really cool so what is involved in that like managing their existence what is he I mean you know it's wildlife management so it's it's getting proper population dynamics trying to understand them genetically figure out what their food sources figure out how much hunting pressure they can take or cannot take those kind of things and that's not my department you know I go in and look for them that's someone like Sergio who's in the field lives in Colombia can work with the species it's really cool I remember there was a documentary about this guy who was a scientist who was obsessed it was a biologist he was obsessed with the giant sloth and he was spending all of his time down the Amazon he had been down there for years and the the the documentary was following him at this stage where he was getting really frustrated and not sure if he's wasting his career right like there was this feeling like fuck this thing might not be real yeah like cuz they were telling ya I saw it it's over the hill you sure you saw it right and they you know they bring these people in they would speak their native tongue and they'd have this discussion of this thing that they saw yep two years ago yeah big like a bear walks on its hind leg megatherium yeah there we discussed this briefly last time I saw I think it's funny we go straight back to the same let's say well ha life stuff but ya know it's who knows right who knows if it's still out there there's definitely ongoing reports so much so that I forget what university but some university actually launched an an expedition to try and find the Megatherium so really I'd have to look it up probably 10 years ago now not that long ago but but you know if an academic institution is putting resources behind an expedition like that there's a lot of faith and maybe even Intel that they're not releasing publicly to say this animals still here wow that would be crazy that big was a giant sloth well there's a couple varieties like there was a North American one that was enormous like bigger than a grizzly bear Wow yeah but so from what I've been what I've heard what I've read you're talking about saying that stands 14 foot tall walking around the Amazons like like the 14 foot tall like winter here's then a Kodiak grizzly that's what the reports say that's exactly I mean you got to take their existence with a grain of salt like but this page whatever this page is a Bigfoot cousin and look up there Megalodon sightings is the mega dog shark still alive yeah and straight away that's like discrediting you're a you're like okay what is this website you pull up there there's a article from in June about just lots of information about them it's not even saying like it exists it's just saying this is all the information we have about this this a mapinguari sightings people love finding undiscovered or mythical creatures to turn out to be like the tasmanian tiger right like that's a perfect example but people they love to try to fight what is the thylacine I'm saying yeah people love to try to find that thing idea that it's out there it's like what is it about people where it's so compelling to find a species that we were we thought didn't exist or we thought was extinct like whether it's Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster or the thylacine which we know used to be real right right I mean what do you think I think that people quite you know they long for the unknown and there's this big question mark surrounding cryptids or surrounding extinct animals as to whether it's still out there and that's so much more inviting to the general to the general populace to get an answer to then knowing oh you know there's 700 of them left and we're trying to get them up to 1400 or whatever the species dynamic is for some other animal as opposed to being like there could be one out there where is it and I personally I've been on two different expeditions looking for thylacine really yeah yeah yeah I did one in northern Australia up north of Cannes and then one I spent a couple weeks in Tasmania with a amazing biologist Nick Mooney who he's adamant that he's seen thylacine and he's a biologist this isn't you know someone who worked as a biologist that was out in the wilderness going yeah yeah I've seen thylacine and he was terrified to tell everybody and that that tells me that it's more credible right if you're scared to tell people because of your reputation as opposed to like going out there going I saw it I saw it I saw it right that becomes more credible than the people who are just waving their arms in the air go and I told you it's here when did he come out of the thylacine closet I'm scared to tell people when I'm not sure if he told us first or if it was public right before then but not long ago I mean maybe 10 years ago yeah that's such a cool-looking animal too because it was a marsupial tiger right yeah sucio predator it's like a marsupial wolf with tiger stripes it's so bizarre and it had this amazing jaw that would open like like a snake's like way wider than its head should stripes on the back just such a cool animal yeah and the last one died in a zoo right the last one that we think yep in Hobart in Tasmania but let me let me lay this on yeah so my next expedition for that animal cuz I'm like all those other people that are kind of obsessed with it my next expedition for that animal is to Papua New Guinea so this species yeah that's right this is this species used to range all the way from Papua New Guinea down through mainland Australia and into Tasmania when people came over and settled that area they brought with them dogs dingoes and dingoes out competed them in mainland Australia and possibly in Papua New Guinea 4000 years ago but the the thylacine remained in Tasmania where there are no dingoes to out-compete them but in mainland Australia you've got a diversity of habitats so there are places the thylacine could still hide but in Papua New Guinea the terrain is so crazy that the idea is that in certain regions dingoes could have never made it there so perhaps there's these isolated regions where thiolate very small thylacine populations continued for the past four thousand years have there been sightings many but just the same kind of sightings is a giant slot you know what I mean it's all hearsay we're so full of shit yes they are such a problem if you're gonna be a guy like you actually looking for species yeah you got it you got to wade through so much bullshit you know it's just and it's funny because one thing can discredit the entire story that maybe it shouldn't because they're embellishing or or you can be on the hook for someone's story and be like I totally believe this guy it's it's all real and it could be complete BS and it's just so hard to tell you just have to go with instinct but it is incredibly compelling I mean if you really did get an absolute photograph of a thylacine and you knew it was real or captured one yeah I think I think it would be the you know discovery of the century and I think it would kind of shift the scales for people that are on the fence about why do I care about conservation what I care about wildlife management you know those kind of things to be like check this animal out something that you know last saw when we put a bounty on its head and now it's back like it's hung on by a thread like that's such a message of hope you know let's save it let's bring it back yeah well the whole environment in Australia is so strange and now because of the wildfires you know there's a lot of species like those we were just talking the other day about the koala bears yeah that the koala bears a lot of their habitat got burnt you know a lot of fires really sad really said there's on fire and they're like losing it's awful but there's such a little cute little animal they are but and I don't have a lot of first-hand experience with them my understanding is they're actual jerks like they're really cute and cuddly looking but their behavior is pretty aggressive and jerkish and I don't know enough about them to really comment on it but my understanding is it's kind of like sea otters right do you know about this thing with sea otters what about them so like everybody loves sea otters are so cute they're so cuddly sea otters are super destructive they rape each other like they're they're like gnarly animal they're like not that sweet at all isn't that everything with pandas too like pandas are ruthless yeah totally yeah but you look at him you're like oh yeah miss sweetiepie my youngest daughter is really into polar bears oh yes polar bears are adorable and she wanted to get like a stuffed polar bear and I find it so fascinating that that animal which is the most ruthless of all bears for sure we associate with Klondike bars and coca-cola that's everybody's buddy and they're sliding around the snow and I almost want to like show her like this is what they do to seals right go on go up there and just show a video I want to show her I know she's not looking it yeah yeah like that picture there's this image of this seal and the they all have red faces from blood what did they ever do they ever figure out that one polar bear that was in Russia that had been sprayed it said like t-34 on it you see it in that image right there that one Jamie I don't know about that right there someone had spray-painted T and the number 34 on the side of a bear's body and they don't know what happened that's extremely ballsy it's a spray-painted polar but how do they do it and then the real concern is that this bear is going to have a real hard time hunting because they're gonna be able to see it much better because of the fact that it has the spray paint on the side of it I've never I've never seen this story before it's really yeah they don't know they have no idea what happened here it is Russian scientists search for polar bear with black t-34 spray painting on its side cruel joke can turn deadly for a predator now too visible for both prey and poachers right yeah do they have a hard time with D they have a real issue with certain towns in Siberia that elect on the outskirts where polar bears are invading mmm and they have like dozens of polar bears entering their towns they they've even evacuated towns because of so many polar bears being there from what I've heard would you imagine just having an army of polar bears roll into town you have a town of like 150 people and in come eight polar bears one day it's like what what can you do it's nothing they're gonna kill them you're gonna shoot them with rifles are you gonna get out right you probably should just get out yeah you should get out yeah I mean it's polar bears estranging I like bears in general or strange animal because people love them because we grew up with teddy bears right and we see yogi and there's like they're so lovable yeah on television and the movies yeah and so people have this idea of them like they want to take bear selfies like hey take a bear selfie like how many people get Jack taking bear selfies yeah no that's a real thing I have been contacted by people being like hey why don't you like not pose with wildlife because it's influencing other people to do that I'm like I'm a biologist it's my job I'm gonna have another option here like I have to pose with wildlife like I'm working with it like I said post it you are the guy the guy posted like maybe instead don't do what I do you know don't just jump out and try get a selfie with say that's gonna kill you I think it's common sense you have that whole idea of like that what you're doing is influencing people to do the same thing like alright well you know come on I think it's nuts I mean yeah do you know how many pages on Instagram are there where people are chugging vodka and jumping off roofs and slamming tables and all this other stuff so yeah is everybody looking at being like hey I'm gonna jump off a roof onto a table yeah there's so many of those pages yeah so many of those videos right people breaking their legs jumping off balconies like oh just don't do it yeah I think it's probably good to see people do stupid shit right you don't do it right yeah and I got the scars to prove it you know like there's their shots of me getting bitten by sharks and also I was like this is why you don't do it he'd been bitten by shark just this year I mean it's pretty minor but just this year I took a single to eye I'm a lemon shark while I was working in the field with one dude let me see that fuck it's actually it's on my Instagram page I think what's the scar below it oh that's not a scar I burned myself cooking crab last night on a pod I should have only rolled this shirt down here did I burn the top of my foot cooking spaghetti yeah I was moving the boat such a moron I was moving the boy was cooking barefoot I was moving the boiling water with the spaghetti in it to the sink you know the put it in the strainer and I spilled it on the top of my oh wow and I had to keep my shit together because I was holding the pot I was like Chuck and I poured it in there and then we were going to Hawaii the next day No so while I was in Hawaii I had to have like pointman over the top my foot a bandage on it and I went into the ocean with my my chucks on yeah they were my converse all-stars in the ocean I was like look I have to cover it like I'll just do this and they'll just clean it after I go in I'm like I'm not gonna not go in the ocean man I'm fucking you know why I'm like if it gets infected I'll I'll figure that out but how cool did you look down in the ocean Chuck's on I look at their loser yeah the next day there was a they had some sort of an issue with bacteria in the water where they told people to get out of the water great and she's got an open wound yeah well what is never open fortunately it just it just the skin over it like was it was all totally red and then the skin over it bubbled and then it eventually after a while it healed and scratched up now I just have a big giant red mark so that's a bit yeah it was totally my fault and I was being an idiot and we were working off the back of the boat we had all these lemon sharks around and we were working to get tiger sharks and I just dropped my guard for a second and as I looked back to where my hand was in the water I saw this shark coming like that and I just pulled my arm back and I literally just clipped a single tooth but I think if it had been a fraction of a second later that would have been the hand fuck how big was a shark that's probably like it's um it's probably the next page over it's probably an 8 foot shark so it would've gone me and I was lucky it just oh my god do you could have lost your arm for sure oh this is it this is a different it's a tiger shark but it's pretty cool nonetheless don't they have like Kevlar that sharks can't bite through they do they never wear that everywhere you go that's a good question when you go to the mall so I'd look about as cool as you with your converse in the ocean well you couldn't see the converse until I got out of the oh that's Jared you can you can see my Kevlar in the wall no matter where you are no I don't know I don't like anything that inhibits the movement like that and does that stuff inhibit the Kevlar stuff I've never worn it yeah those sharks behind and that's the situation I was in I was on the back of the boat like that apparently Catalina like off Catalina there's a high shark population yeah white sharks and they're increasing every year really mm-hmm why well because we used to we used to hunt them first of all and we used to hunt seals and sea lions as well and that's all been banned for a long time so there's way more seals and sea lions now and there's more sharks reproducing and I think you know I think there's something to be said for them the water being consistently warmer and them staying further north than they used to as well or south depending on which way they're but like where I live in Santa Barbara there's a single Bay where my buddy and I have been going for the last four years and it's it's only for like three four weeks in the summertime that there's like six to eight juvenile great white sharks around and when we started going there four years ago they were like six feet long and then the next year they were like eight feet long this year I I didn't go because I was traveling but my buddy went filmed them he's like dude they're getting up to like 10 feet and it's the same animals in the same spot what happens when those are like 14 foot animals it's a very popular swimming Beach oh yeah so who knows maybe they'll move on maybe they would eat people maybe they'd eat people well somebody got eaten in Santa Barbara a few years back right I believe there's a beach one I don't know about Santa barb it happens it's like once a year you know there's some kind of attack a bite usually in October do around lobster season or when the swells start to pick up somebody gets chomp so I sit around then I think October I'd have to check on their ecology I think it's right around when they start breeding so they're they're little hold up but October is also when lobster season starts so all the free divers are free diving in and out of caves looking like a seal the waves start to kick in for the winter swells so you got more people on surfboards it just seems like the perfect cocktail of timing from for miss ID that makes sense yeah that makes sense it's uh it's such a beautiful creature and it's so cool that they're there but it's also you're like this thing can kill people and it's right there and and we go in the water yeah and we swim around like yeah we have we're so helpless out there completely and you I think that's just the you just have to know that going into it right it's it's not like you're gonna you know kiss your life goodbye every time you get in the ocean but I mean you're playing some audio yeah what is it from that shark attack and said it's not this was two years ago this guy caught it on his GoPro attack remember oh my god dude you're so slow in there yeah that's what's oh Jesus so is he prodding it get away from him mm-hmm swimming backwards I think and that's the right move you know give it a poke keep it off you it bit his toe Wow barely that is a best-case scenario oh my god the best-case yeah cool scar yeah take your shoes off to show fuck he kept his little toe little toe just sliced by there's such cool animals they deserve a ton of respect you know and I think you just have to realize they're they're like yeah it's just a part of it there's also a way to be smart about it right don't go in there's bait balls and tons of birds diving and tons of fish in the water you know stay out of the the immediate surf zone and low-vis in a high sea larrya you know there's ways to like really reduce the risk we did new year's in Hawaii last year and we got to see some whales nice dude that is we were real close yes so wild man they're so big aren't they they're so big and so beautiful it's like it's it's you're so happy that they're there right you know right and it's the the whale one of those weird ones where you looking at me like am i seeing this this is really a whale in the water like they're so magical yeah and so intelligent that's amazing like they're you know the general consensus is that they're restricted by their morphology like their body type doesn't allow them to share with us how much more intelligent they are than we really realize but we know a little bit you know we know how they can sing across oceans and communicate and all get together and yeah it's amazing synchronizing the way they swim yeah mazing creatures well and then there's orcas who eat them yeah she's even more fucked up because we love orcas do you see when you see an orca killing a whale you like oh well that's where they got their name right mm-hmm killer whale yeah it's because they kill whales yep and they are a whale they're in that family yeah they're marine mammals they killed dolphins too right yeah they're they're dolphins whales fish stingrays are seals sea lions sharks like they're they're amazing predators yeah they really are and it's like that polar bear thing we're talking about earlier they're like you know Shamu like cuddly or stuffed toy they're smiling in every cartoon but aren't they pretty cool too people in general in the wild yeah that's strange I believe there has never been an attack on a human being by an orca in the wild period there have been multiple in aquariums you know well there's been shows going on that kind of stuff but I believe there's never actually been a recorded case of a death by Orca in the wild that's kind of crazy when you think about it what just shows their intelligence right it shows they look at you and go nope that's not on the menu like that's not that's not something I need to eat they must be hungry sometimes well what's interesting about orcas is there's really two sexes of their diet there's there's orcas that only eat marine mammals and there's orcas that only eat stingrays and some other fish species and so I think you know for those people you see some of those incredible photographers like Paul Nicola and stuff like that that get those images of them underwater they're diving with the fish eating orcas I think a few people have been successful in diving with the mammal eating ones but that's I feel like that's a dice for all our position mm-hmm they might miss thank you well you you're a mammal and you're not your seal sighs you know Jamie who are we talking to about orcas and the the population that lives in the north the Pacific nor West like around Seattle that only eats the chinook salmon remember we were having this conversation the other day with somebody filled DeMars was it Phil I mean I was a clip from probably yeah okay so that's a crazy situation right you have a population of orcas that only eats chinook salmon and then there's a decline in the population of chinook salmon so they're trying to figure out how to get them to eat seals right they try in there like they won't do it right there the local population but then they have these migratory populations that come in and do eat seals seals yeah and they're like hey you assholes are starving to death fucking food everywhere right but they won't do it they were I switch over it's very strange isn't it and you got to wonder how much of that is learned behavior right how many parent orcas are passing down this is the food you know this is how you hunt salmon this is what you eat right everything else is off the menu versus what's instinctual like how did that one group of orcas learn to eat seals whereas the other one is so dedicated to salmon it's it's amazing well it's amazing that they didn't adapt right they're starving granny don't branch out right or maybe they're just unsuccessful mmm you know maybe maybe they've never learned how to hunt seals because it's definitely a different behavior to scooping up a fish right so yeah it is amazing you'd think they would get to this kind of tipping point where they're like there's not enough to eat we need to make a transition and then are they unsuccessful in that transition because they can't figure out how to do it are they just not doing it they just don't know about it it's who knows it's a real bummer man when you hear that they're almost starving to death out there and they're trying to actually bring chinook salmon to them you know you know it's it's one of those things it's like that whole kind of micro environment is a game of Jenga right you pull one piece out yeah I got a tower still standing pull another piece out and tower still standing you know it just takes that one piece till it all collapses that is an interesting way of looking at it right you know they were talking about Hawaii you know and all these different invasive species that live in Hawaii and there was this discussion about pigs and they were saying you know like we should really take the pigs off of Hawaii and a lot of the people in Hawaii like hang on right we've been here as long as the pigs right so like are we invasive right what's invasive now right when does it become because obviously like luaus they're synonymous with like eating pigs and wild pigs are a big part of you know the people that hunt in Hawaii this of their food source yeah so they're like well would it but then you have a situation like lanai where I go every year the access tier yeah which is terrible environmentally it's a disaster right like it's it's all wrong there are 30,000 deer on this one island that many 30,000 they don't know really they're dead guessing this the estimates between twenty and thirty thousand right and there's three thousand people yeah ensued you ain't never seen anything like it because it's a little ass island around the whole thing in an hour uh-huh I mean maybe a little bit more than that but not much sure it's a tiny fucking island right and there's so many deer yeah that's you'll see them on like you'll you get your binoculars out and you look at this huge field and you're like oh my god don't you see a thousand oh you're kidding no wow it's great it's so unnatural no predators only humans plenty of food right right and they're just populations exploded everywhere yeah and they're damn delicious people who live there it's amazing you know like if you don't have to have much money to eat really well right you get a rifle you go out there bang you got a deer and you could shoot as many as you want right you choose seven in a day and stockpile your freezer and have all your meat for the year and they're that abundant like if someone stock yeah the only thing that keeps me from killing a ton of them is that I use a bow and arrow it's really hard to do with the bow and arrow because they're so fast and they evolved in Asia to get away from Tigers mhm they're an Indian animal right right oh it's super fast it's it's a tough argument that could because you're right like Hawaiian people Pig is culturally significant to them you know just like probably access to yours to the people of lanai and has been for however long the deer have been there but I guess it's like at what cost right at what cost if and I don't think this is the case but if someone said look if I know these pigs are culturally significant to you but if we leave them here the whole islands ecosystem will collapse there'll be no birds no fish you know no lizards nothing is it worth it to have pigs right like that's and it's delicate the pigs in particular wreck is eat everything the nesting birds still devastate everything everything of a roots fuck up every tree everything that's coming up all the sprouts and everything yeah they're super destructive here there's destructive here in California yeah it's not it's not isolated to Hawaii everywhere that we've brought pigs they've done a lot of we're actually gonna I was we're talking about this out here we're gonna film something about hunting pigs at Tejon ranch because to hone rant the place gets devastated their agriculture gets devastated by these pigs there's so many of them right and they're all over Northern California has problem in San Jose they're in people's yards they're destroying shitting because they're the if you don't kill them they just breed and breed and breed and breed and breed and breed and then they just expand right and they're they're dealing with them now even in the northern part of the United States dealing with them in the Northeast there was a New York Times article about it so you can find that from two days ago about the expansion of wild pigs is that they're starting to make their way into the northeastern states and they're just they can't be stopped they can survive in any weather yep they breathe three times a year they can they're viable I think from the time they're 5 to 6 months old they have their first litter feral pigs roamed the south now even in northern states aren't safe the swine have established themselves in Canada when approaching on border states like Montana and North Dakota fuck man if they get into Montana they'll do so much damage you know what's crazy about the feral pigs in the United States they were brought here by I believe Christopher Columbus starting with six animals so the entire 200 million or whatever it is across the u.s. I don't know the number it was like six or eight or ten original pigs that were brought in by Christopher Columbus and dropped in Florida that's insane guns you want to talk about how crazy they can reproduce and how much damage they do like think of the biomass of those animals stemming off of like six of them that's insane and they're so tough you can put them on a boat and they'll make it across the ocean oh yeah no there are may and and they are terrible for the environment like they do so much damage to native species to riparian habitats I mean they're I like you said we were talking about it out there briefly and it's it's a good thing people should realize that invasive species like that should not be in an ecosystem well they certainly shouldn't be in an ecosystem when there's no balance right if they're warthogs and they're in Africa there's a system for that exactly but they're all they're supposed to be the warthogs are wild looking you've seen one up there I grew up in Zimbabwe oh that's right yeah I actually got a pretty funny story about a warthog my uncle my mom's brother we were out on Safari one time and he was he was young you know he's much much younger than my mother so he's maybe a teenager or something and he grabbed this plum and started going for a walk across camp and anyway this warthog decided it wanted this plum and so it came trotting after my uncle and started chasing him in circles around this tree but my uncle was so panicked by this thing chasing him around this big bay of AB tree that he wouldn't drop the plum so he's just in this perpetual cycle of being chased around this tree until he eventually threw the plum and the warthog just veered off and went for the plum lucky did one him yeah they're very funny very mischievous I love the way their tails stick up through the grass when they're running around they're weird-looking very they're there they're related to pigs right some sort of way yeah oh yeah yeah they're all that same family speaking of weird pigs are you familiar with the Barbarossa no this is one we should pull out you're gonna love this animal yeah you're gonna love this it's one of my top bucket list animals to see in the wild it's a great name yeah Barbarossa you got I don't want to tell you what it is till you see the answers you're gonna be like no way that's real it looks like something out of Star Wars really mm-hmm and it's pig where does it live Indonesia how BIG's you get uh maybe 200 pounds I'm not positive on the sighs wow look at that thing look at those tusks what growing out that's good those things that grow out of it's the middle of its head yep that's crazy yeah look at that one what the bro that does not look real right does that look like something out of Star Wars yes that's a real animal that looks like an avatar creature that's that looks like is that fighting something looks like it fighting there oh my god well Bruce is going to war if it's a big deer they call it a pig do you know this is Barbarossa or a pig deer just might be somebody just let's guess like their nickname of it I think they're Oh getting it all that's not fucking more that's just shitty Barbarossa jujitsu yeah that's the kind of fighting mommy and daddy do late at night mommy and daddy were just playing don't worry no one's getting hurt mommy was gagging yeah well who are you cursor is click on that one what the fuck man isn't that a wild pig the things coming out of it the tusks that come out of the middle of its head are so strange like where did that come from I I don't know why you evolved that maybe it may be like a peacocks tail you know for a showmanship but what's really crazy about them evolving those two two teeth their tusks out of their their bridge their snout is they if they're not broken in fights and rooting around they can grow long enough that they will puncture the animal in the head and kill it I've heard of that oh that's why cuz I put an image of it on my my Instagram it was one of those Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself memes oh yeah Sophia does he threw up and it was a Barbarossa skull actually oh saying that it would can do that actually was driving into its own head growing into its own head yeah like that yeah insane that's crazy like maybe that's nature's way of saying all right enough yeah check please yeah live forever everything in front of you like that one look at that yeah okay there it is growing into its own brain imagine what a like one day you have like a little bit of a headache and the next day just gets a little worse like what is going on and what do you do it's like if you go and you know get down against the ground it's only gonna get worse right it's already in your brain yeah yeah you'd have to get it you'd have to be smart enough to find a branch we could slip that over and torque your head yeah I don't think I don't think it off I don't think that's happening if you're a pig is this awful I mean often that this happens where they kill themselves by growing that tusks into their brain I don't know that looks like two of them heading that direction bark a crazy animal what a beautiful animal so there's an extinct subspecies of those called the maloca and Barbarosa which in the single island near Sulawesi they used to be and then they think people have hunted him you know to extinction localized extinction within that island and that subspecies but some people I know that worked over there 8:1 so they're like yeah no we ate this wild pig with these crazy horns really I was like yeah this is like two years ago you know and they have no proof and they don't have the skull and they don't have the picture they were like they were traveling and they're like yeah we got back and we ate this pig with these wild horns on this particular island and I was like wait is that possibly a Moluccan Barbarossa I was like I don't know and you look where they were and what they said and what they ate and it's like oh that could be an extinct and extinct subspecies that you guys consume well how many biologists are actually actively out there looking for these creatures well those I would say zero currently that species but with regards to this field of presumed extinct animals it seems to be a movement that's expanding you know and I think one of the reasons for that is we have a rate of something like 2,000 species a year being deemed extinct right so when you have that many animals being deemed extinct every year there's there's Flags being put up is it really extinct have we looked everywhere and so this you know I don't want to say I was the first but I feel like I was in that wave of first people to start looking into extinction as far as an ongoing animals wrongfully deemed extinct and now it's like it's like mainstream in the biology world it's like there's a lot of people that are like I'm gonna go see if I can find this thing is it because it's a romantic sort of thing there's a lot of cash like if you can find an a seem to be extinct Barbarosa I think so I think it's very romantic yeah you know as opposed to just setting out to study something that we know that's there this like harrowing journey to find this creature that the world is written off it's very romantic you have you ever heard of the are wrong pen deck what is it this is like this is a cryptid right yes what is this funny monkey person that's right did we talk about this last time we might have yeah I'm very repetitive that's okay I don't like it it's still fun it's not in my wheelhouse you know like the cryptids the lock thing I think is in Vietnam I think it's in Vietnam and maybe some other parts of Southeast Asia and the the the most people thought it was nonsense until the homo Florrie ANSYS until they found out about that Hobbit person that lives in the island of Flores and then they're like okay hold on or lived right so right as recently as 14,000 years ago right so when they found out about that thing like well me maybe these little fuckers are still hanging around out there somewhere yeah just you're dealing with incredibly dense jungle and they're very wary if you're a person stomping through the jungle something that lives there hears you a mile away for sure yeah you're not sneaking up on donkey no well we this year I went into song dune which is the world's largest cave that was only discovered in 1995 it's this massive opening six miles of underground cave you know you don't see daylight for two days six miles it's you should look at the pictures of this place you'll love it I mean it's just this me it looks like something out of a vut R I mean this cave you can fit New York City skyscrapers inside of it it's so big it has its own weather system what yeah it's it's where is this song and so it's in the Anna might mountain range between Vietnam and Laos and we got to go into it this year because we were looking for this habitat in fact this is my show that comes out tonight we were looking for this habitat ours it on so people can hear Extender live tonight at 9 p.m. on Animal Planet we go into song dune cave say your dvrs kids plug but let's see this oh my god yeah there there's you know hang song doing that's the entrance to it and like look at the size of it the scope of it is compare it to what am I looking at I'm seeing the little tents oh those are tents there's full lake systems in there and my god that's inside the tent I mean that's inside the key yeah look at the wedding cake that one right there that's called the wedding cake it's yeah that one it's these pyres I mean it's just it's the most fantastic looking thing there's a person standing on top of that little pyre right there oh my god yeah that's insane it's insane more people have summited Everest than have been through that cave Wow well people summit Evers every day now Wow that's why but yeah so we that's the wedding hang my god that's incredible picture just like that that I'm very proud of god that's so spectacular but what's amazing is about two-thirds of the way through the system you can see where what you're looking at is areas where the cave roof has collapsed and there's isolated pockets of ecosystem right so we were talking about the the pygmy people that could live in the of Vietnam this is the kind of my point is this giant six mile-long cave with these huge openings wasn't even discovered until I think 95 so what's to say a tribe of small people couldn't hide in something like that and move in and out and never be seen I mean it's it's fantastic there was a stupid movie about people that lived underground that ate people remember that this is Becca chicks was that duck cave team watched we spent like we were going like leading up to this expedition we're like all right let's lucky a bunch of bad our cave movies before we go the first ones bad the second one is so bad it's it's funny yeah they did a descent to bringing that up I stumbled across a video potential it's obviously probably not real of an orang pendeks no it's totally real Jamie I know but have you ever seen this these guys are on my dick and this thing Strunz out in front of them it doesn't look like CGI is the only thing I'm going with at the moment it's obviously probably that's definitely a person it had a tail or some points it would do like freeze frames of it what I stopped watching because you guys took me on the cave thing but huh it's a ten minute video I just side if you neither of you have seen this before that I've ever seen we are doing a new there in Vietnam I think so row if they were just out riding their bikes and this thing they caught it on their GoPros and they're trying to find it let's see they could also be trying to troll everyone internet I don't know these guys have a troll video I mean what is their their YouTube page we got any two pages it's on uh it's like on a Bigfoot Webster Sasquatch complices but that's the problem is it remember in men in black how they used to always check the whatever it was called a check like the National Enquirer for like tips on aliens yeah because where else do you go to get this info alright you see this again I'm not right right here that's definitely a person or a humanoid it's really tiny whatever it is yeah it's running pretty fast yeah it also could be like bullshit yeah yeah could be bullshit but it could be a little monkey person like me we know those little monkey people were real yeah exactly goddamn imagine if that's real and keep in mind and again I'm not like a huge cryptid guy but keep in mind you know as a homo sapien they have a higher intellect which means they're better at avoiding people right so it's you know it's it's not unreasonable to say if there was a group of small humanoids out there that didn't want to be discovered they could stay hidden yeah and if it's really small you know and and also some sort of a hominid that has intelligence right it's probably got a pretty decent food source in the jungle yep but they would find a dead one wouldn't they that's always the argument right why isn't there a roadkill yes or why yeah but the thing is like there's a lot of mountain lions good luck finding a dead one yeah yeah there's that look at that yeah that's like the best screenshot I don't think that's a tail that looks like a spear yeah yeah I mean who knows who's what's to say that isn't a short guy who's been poaching and he's like crap I'm getting busted Yeah right but doesn't mean it's not fascinating and this is the kind of stuff that we wade through in droves to try and figure out you know are these animals are these creatures still out there that's so weird god I'm such a sucker though oh that thing looks like it's wearing shorts dude doesn't it yeah yeah I know and it's running exactly like a person that's a little froze but it's so little right kid that's the thing about though it could be a little kid yeah but that's the thing about the orang pendeks is that they think it was like the homo florensis I think they think it's really the same thing in the homo Fleur ANSYS was really a three foot tall human whore feet yeah right some yeah some subset yep there's another image good oh wow yeah that looks like a little person that looks weird though it's got a hat yeah it's wearing a hat we're we're in a Disneyland about the ears because it matches the roaring pendick images of that Sasquatch type head or something dude that is a person with a stick and there and there that creature looks naked it doesn't look like they're shorts on yeah it does so how tall do you think that is that looks really short and moving fast I mean short in like three feet tall girl going into tall grass right what's that 3-foot grass 4-foot grass that's so okay so here's size comparison see I'm such a sucker look a lookout look there's a size comparison that is fucking tiny miss tiny it's really tiny oh my god it's real such a moral it's such a moron when it comes to stuff I believe in Bigfoot for so long between 80 and 150 centimeters which is somewhere between 30 and 60 inches tall that's amazing I hope it's real yeah I do too I need to yeah I mean it's fantastic do you hope would you rather not knowing and it lives or someone kills it and you find out that it's real I'd rather not knowing and it lives meat for sure yeah me too but I feel like a bitch right right you know what come on man just tell me and how blurry does the line get in that situation because it's it's humanoid right so it's like right it's not like you're catching them putting them in zoos you know what to breed them and keep the population up like like that gets really dicey super dicey yeah and they do that with an African man in the Bronx Zoo and like the turn of the century they put an African man in the Bronx yes they did yeah they have an African man I believe it was the Bronx Zoo in like the 1800s or the early 1900s you know paid me yep bottom bingo what year was it 1906 oh wow yeah it's they had them in the zoom it's insane look at that Wow dudes in the zoo yeah well you know what man people were just figuring life out back then right right this is the reality of human beings is that we have not been alive that and we have not been civilized in terms of how we view the world today with inclusivity and objectivity and care and you know kindness towards others like this compassion and altruism this is on a global scale this is fairly recent yeah we're figuring things out there we go I mean the history is a perfect it can show you how we progressed yeah it's a document documentation of how we progress but yet still that 150 years after slavery yeah right that's crazy yeah 40 45 years after slavery what the fuck guys so Bronx Zoo you know speaking in our like weird cryptid realm reminded me of something so get this Chewbacca bruh has been attributed to the possibility that there are thylacine in North America and here's what supports that there is documented proof that however many years ago I don't remember the dates there were two breeding pair of thylacine bound for the Bronx Zoo and they boat crashed into the shore and most of the animals escaped including the two breeding pair of thylacine fast forward 10 15 years you start having these Chupacabra sightings pop up in the Northeast and these animals were adapted to living in Tasmania which is a pretty similar climate to the North America and North East and so there's people that have kind of drawn these parallels and said oh the chupacabra that we've reported running around you know the United States is actually a tiny remnant population of these thylacine that were brought here for the Bronx Zoo that escaped what you buying this no not specially though right but it sounds it's an amazing story he had me if you said yes stuff you talked about if someone could get one for the Bronx Zoo then what a rich person have been able to buy one like a rich guy in Texas for instance a thylacine been able to purchase one privately yeah you can probably get one today what I'll see ya go to Bubba's house but especially back then there were no like import-export laws about wildlife you know you could just bring in whatever you liked if you had money you know what's to say that everybody was in a race to collect stuff for zoos and museums like what's to say somebody didn't bring some in Texas and there exotics it's so strange I mean I had a bit about it in my act in 2016 my Netflix special that there's more tigers in captivity in Texas and private collections then there are and all of the wild of the world isn't that insane just Texas and that's like in guys living rooms in you know a cage yeah yeah a mistake yeah it is not their rules they're so strange it's also that's one of the rare states where the vast majority of the state is private land oh really very little public land in Texas so like for yourself and you go hunting there it's all private yes you're gonna hunt in Texas you're gonna hunt most likely on a private ranch there's some small patches of public land but in comparison I think more than I think it's in the 90% range interest yeah that that's it's all giant ranches right and what's really interesting is I I've been reading a lot about over the last two to three months I've been obsessed with Wild West stories from put that bug away Empire the summer moon SC Guin wrote this fantastic book about the Comanches okay and they're the the battle with people in Texas and the Texas Rangers in the 1800s and trying to trying to take over that land from the Comanches it's crazy yeah this stuff happened just you know 150 years ago right it was so insane and really sad really sad because there's something incredibly romantic about their lifestyle there was just 150 years ago when all of Europe they were you know having horse driven carriages and people were living in these fancy buildings but right here in North America people were living like they were in the Stone Age right and they had this incredible nomadic nomadic life where they were following around the Buffalo and killing the Buffalo and they they they were all just about war there was this wild ferocious tribe that was about war and hunting buffalos some it's fucking amazing man and that's like well our great-grandparents walking the earth yes really recent you know I mean they they kind of they they put the kibosh on it all by the time it was like 1870s in that range that's when they they eventually moved them all into reservations but he fucking and not the Comanches the Comanches they never moved into reservation right right they just gave them plots of land they'd to this day don't have a reservation but and bad land is my understand terrible assholes yeah yeah but they were assholes to each other too right that's what's really fucked up like he you get this idea that like the natives all lived in peace and harmony and the you know you know the Europeans came over and they fucked everything up right they were killing each other left and right right they were the tribes would raid on other tribes and they would I mean horrific things and this guy goes into amazing detail about the way they would torture both captives from other tribes and Europeans and anybody that was over they cut their legs off their cut their arms I'll throw them on the fire watching wiggle around while they were still alive like wild shit man and he said that even left some of it out that it was so distasteful really yeah he was trying to figure out like how he could put it in a book and literally not have people vomit unbelievable yeah so it's fucking amazing no but that's this whole country this whole continent used to be this wild ecosystem of human beings riding horses chasing Buffalo all these animals all over the place I mean during the the hundred and fifty plus years or 250 plus years they eradicated so many animals they have extra pay to them from so many different parts of the country and then market hunting came in and they just just almost wiped out like so many different species of North American animals and not just almost but did you know like pre human settlement they say that the North American continent had more biomass like larger game and more abundant megafauna than the plains of Africa now huge animals are ain't roaming around and and you know European settlement and Native American settlement it's all it's all attributed to the decline but things like more recently like the passenger pigeon yeah right billions billions billions it would black out this guy yeah and down to zero how the fuck did they do that I honestly like I know by reading but I personally don't know you know what I mean how do you feel billions of birds yeah and that gets intricate because the animals ecology is such that it needs many others you know their their tactic is confusion like they don't they don't run away they just get in a big giant flock and then you're like oh I don't know which one to pick but so that it made him easier to hunt and there was commercial they'd actually hunt them commercially for meat it was cheap meat ba-ba-ba-ba but it just it's crazy to think that we're able to wipe out billions of anything in such a short amount of time well we came real close to doing to the buffalo yeah and some of those well the bison I should say some of those images of those bison skulls like stack tiles yeah like a mountain it's really disturbing it used to be you know considered entertainment to shoot them from the railway as you were traveling across the country for fun once kind of hang out the window man boom got one well the other thing is that they would go and they mostly what they would take from them as their tongues which is crazy it's the best meat in the world and they wouldn't even eat the meat right they would shoot them and take their tongues and they would pickle their tongues right and they would use the fur they would you know sell the hides and make buffalo capes all this different shit it just shows what abundance we had you know I mean nowadays not that I'm Pro wiping out anything but nowadays you have a small population of whatever this the animal is and most people are utilizing every part of it right because we don't have that crazy abundance like imagine if you just went out like like you for instance imagine if you just went out to shoot out for the tongue it doesn't make any sense right like why on earth would you ever consider doing that but if if you looked out of the studio here and you saw two hundred of them you'd be like yeah right I might grab a tongue today right that's the difference hawk oh yeah it's the difference of the abundance yeah well they were basically two elk right a bison is like twice as hard yeah yeah they're enormous so ridiculous that they just cut the tongue out it's awful yes yeah and it's also crazy because it's such a it's such an iconic symbol of the American West my friend Steve Rinella wrote a great book it's called American Buffalo and he actually did the audio version of it too and he's a really good narrator it's it's excellent book but it's all about the history of the Plains tribes then North American Buffalo and sorry what'd you say it's calling her called American Buffalo American Buffalo they get the audio version if you're into audiobooks yes he reads it he does an amazing job and it's his book and he actually had sold it and then someone else had got the rights you know that whatever the book company had decided to have an actor read it okay and is terrible Steve yeah yeah he was like it was terrible and then 10 years later the rights he got the rights back and then he was able to oh great with himself it's awesome yeah I fly so much audiobooks for my best man I love them I've been I haven't listened to podcasts in months in like the last two months have been mostly listening to audiobooks I mean I have a little bit but yeah mostly just audiobooks yeah you ever done the power of one oh yeah I've read that was a couple of years ago yeah my favorites yeah it's great audio book - who's read it who's the author of that again I don't recall I think he's kind of a one-hit wonder with that book I can't remember his name but love absolutely love the story pull that up Jamie see what's up a movie they made a movie probably like some kung fu movie yeah Bryce Court that's right Bryce Court can you pull up the image of the book what's the description of the book what does it say is that it the power of one is a novel expense no I don't think that's it no that's definitely not it no no it's the Bryce Courtenay one for sure it is about it's about a young boy growing up in Africa so there's a novel yeah I've okay I read it first and then I then I listened to the alright I'm confused so I know I have not read this okay it's very good there's a there's something that has a similar title that's like a self-help book oh no this is not a self-help book this is this is about a young boy growing up in Africa during apartheid he's very like ostracized from his peers because he's not I believe I'd have to listen to it again because he's not you know Bora he's not a Dutch African he's English African and it's just it's his journey through life basically and it's really good yeah but it what reminded me of it is we were talking about all the wildlife and he grows up very much so in the bush in Africa and around wildlife and you know he's juggling that and a kind of defunct social system and it's it's really good Africa is so special it's such as whenever I watch documentaries on Africa and African wildlife is like what a crazy place yeah where all the nutty things live pretty much and a lot of them too that's what's great you know we have some nutty things here we have mountain lions and Grizzlies and stuff like that but it ain't shit compared to what they have in Africa there's no you know having walked kind of through the wilds basic in a lot of different places there's no where I've been like Africa where you're so like okay I'm just a part of the food system now like I'm not at the top anymore like I'm in the food web you know lions can be hunting me elephants can charge there's leopards in the trees you know I mean you're just like you just fit into the food web you're not at the top of it any longer yeah it's such a weird place to when it comes to wildlife when you know they brought so many animals back from the brink of extinction only because they have value for hunting right so it's so told you everyone's so torn on that because it's on one hand like you would you would love it if people had donated enough money to keep these animals healthy and keep them in good populations because we appreciate right but that's not really the case it's mostly people that want to shoot them that are paying money and because they have value now the populations are so large yeah and so everyone's like really torn on that like oh this is weird and it's even hunters are torn on for sure and it's a full spectrum sorry I don't mean in here no it's okay because they're all fenced in I was right right it's not like when you think of hunting you think of I'm going to go to the wild right and I'm gonna experience these animals but know these animals like they're making sure there's a large population of them because Mike from Cleveland is coming over there with his Creedmoor and he's gonna you know shoot something yeah and it's such a spectrum is what I was going to say because you have these national parks that absolutely do work people pay enough money for tourism ecotourism dollars to do photo safaris and the Wildlife's manage you have these other areas that are managed by hunting dollars and they're managed to flee well they're sustaining animals there they're reproducing them and they're they're putting them in other habitats and ecosystems and parts of Africa and then you have ones that are supposed to be managed properly both from ecotourism and hunting dollars and they're just they're funding people's pockets the animals are getting devastated it's super unethical and it's and everything in between and that's the problem with Africa is like you know I'm all for hunting as a tool for conservation if it keeps the species around and keeps the animals up but you got to be careful where you're going where those dollars are going because it's so easy to line someone's pocket and it never returns to the species yeah there's a giant issue with corruption they're huge huge yeah I mean ever you have poverty right yeah where I grew up in Zimbabwe the Mugabe regime I mean it's it's notorious for being as corrupt as it was and you know created violence and uprisings and that's why my family came here cuz we got thrown off our land and like crazy stuff it's it's very very corrupt yeah it's it's a wild place man yeah my buddy Justin Bren runs this charity do you know who he is I don't runs fight for the Forgotten they build wells for the pygmies okay we work with them with the cash app and he came back with a terrible disease I heard that on your podcast yeah doesn't know what it is they don't know what it is he's got some crazy parasites they think it might be in his brain oh boy not only that he goes so deep into the Congo that they feel like it might be an undiscovered parasite yeah like he might be the first one this shouldn't laugh it's like that's the worst way to find a new species ever yeah it's been going on for six months and he's like in really poor health he's all fucked up yeah and he's a fighter for Bellator he's one of their top heavyweights yeah and so you know he's in the prime of his career and he can't really work out right oh he'll work out then I'll break out into cold sweats and they have to get him in the shower and and you know heat his body up like it's it's a mess it's really bad and the you know the drugs that they put them on the other thing is when you're on antibiotics one of the side effect of some antibiotics like cipro is that your ligaments get weak oh yeah and so he's a fucking cage fighter right right so I'm carrying his shoulders like both of the shoulders are fucked up now because your your connective tissue is just not as strong because of the you know our whole system apparently I mean I really don't know what I'm talking about but apparently our whole system is fueled sort of it's it's one gigantic unit and so when you do something like you introduce antibiotics and you crush all these invading diseases or these invading bacteria or whatever the fuck's staph or whatever whatever is fucking it the microorganisms yeah all the microbiome the rest of your body gets devastated as well sure including like people who are prone more prone to depression afterwards and dr. Rhonda Patrick was talking about that she had a staph infection and it screwed her up for a long time really just because her whole body was out of whack from the antibiotics because you know you get staff they're worried about you're gonna die oh yeah so they just pump you full of anything that tries to kill of course it Marla's story no no good deed goes unpunished don't try help people he's got malaria three times - oh geez yeah yeah but I bet he's passionate about what he does and you know he's made he's made an impact so the most passionate yeah he's like the most generous person I've ever met my life and every time I talk to him I feel like a selfish piece of shit he's dedicating his whole life and everything for other people everything is for the Congo everything is for the pygmies it's amazing it's fucking amazing it is it really is very admirable however he's fucked yeah like you said like they don't know what end they think it might be in his brain well which is a giant issue over hoarsely yeah she's mean and obviously if it's in his brain I mean depending upon what kind of parasite it is it could be growing it's just I hate parasites it's like the one thing that makes my skin crawl that's weird cuz I love them yeah parasites I mean birds are cool but not a professor like that in college actually really yeah it's parasitologist he loved him well he's obsessed field of study yeah yeah yeah so the last time I saw you I think was right before we headed to the Galapagos I was telling you about that crazy Island we went on we found that tortoise do you know that Lee yeah first only one specimen has ever been found before 114 years ago and we found the second one we the the biggest discovery my entire career was the week after I saw you last Wow yeah it was amazing what kind of tortoise is this a Fernandina island tortoise big galapagos tortoise on this crazy active volcano on far remote galapagos we had gnarly sunstroke heatstroke i mean everything and after a few days of hiking up and down this volcano we found scat and we found a dig like a tortoise had been digging and 15 minutes later we found the animal well I mean how many of them are in the wild there's a return trip that just one more turn trip just went right now and then another one will go in January but what's great is on the first return trip they had to bail because of weather and the weather is very harsh there they found evidence of two more animals so things are looking really good so there might be like four alive on the planet Wow right now there's one the one we found she's literally the rarest animal in the world let me do you have an image of this there's it's on my Instagram but it was on Forbes Times New York you know everywhere it was like big big stuff so you can look up for an Indian island tour when you find something like that what gets done to ensure the the population remember she is Wow how did you know what's the distinguishing factors like what what's the only animal on the island is the only tortoise on the island so because you know tortoises can't swim at least not across the ocean well so because of because of where they were if we had found a tortoise it was going to be the Fernandina tortoise now that being said the unique shell ridging the shape actually there's yeah it's a video yeah there you go there she is so cool there's a video oh I think it's the one in the top right of your screen right now I never carried it away yeah we put her in she was super malnourished underweight dehydrated she was stuck in an isolated pocket of Education because there's nothing but lava around her now this video is boring but there's there's a cool one where you actually see me like find her in the bushes and yeah it was baby I was pretty happy just such a big find and such you know the tortoise like lonesome George the icon of conservation so to find the species that the world had lost for 114 years was pretty pretty great actually being a tortoise just chilling on this fucking Island hanging out some famous biologist flies from all the way around the world to find you trying to find some plants bro but I think in this case she was stoked and I'll tell you why she was super dehydrated super underweight it's terrible living conditions and she was stuck right so it's not like she could roam around the island and find lots of food and water and there's five foot shards of lava rock surrounding this little pocket of vegetation so we moved her to the fossil Lorena breeding facility which is where lonesome George was kept then how their famous tortoise she put on like seven pounds or 17 pounds in like three weeks cuz she was so happy to eat she didn't leave her water dish for like ten days because she was just so happy to see water like oh wow he was stoked and now they're now they're trying to find a male and trying to some freak oh yeah trying to get the freaking thing and they're this is this is spurred like a ton of you know resources conservation dollars returned efforts like it's just it's really big for the Galapagos so how does that work if you do find a male if you do find what if she's an old lady she doesn't wanna fuck and you bring some mail and he's like hey baby and he's like 15 and she's 80 that's just like come on dude fortunately rainfall water yeah fortunately reptiles breed until they die so so we should be good and and even more interesting than that is tortoises can retain viable sperm so what we had hoped when we found her was that you know maybe she'd copulated with a male 10 years prior and had been under such tough environmental stress that she hadn't had the the biological energy to lay eggs and we're thinking oh let's get her some food get her some water who knows maybe she'll give some offspring so she might already have fertilized eggs inside of her from 10 years ago yeah they can confirm can live in them too like up to 20 years that's some serious berm yeah serious what god damn what fucking what longevity yeah amazing really yeah so if they find a viable male and then they bring him to the facility and introduce him to all the food and water do they have success in taking these wild tortoise tortoises and getting them to breed absolutely any you know I think when you hear this yeah and I think when you hear this you're thinking they're like in a box you know what I mean in the zoo they're in this thing that's bigger than your studio here I don't mean this room the whole studio you know I mean it's all natural vegetation basically we just moved her from one island to another where there's less stress and now if they get a male they'll just have them together hopefully they'll be offspring then they can release the offspring back on the island the population can remain stable that's awesome Wow so that was cool that was fun but I remember I was sitting here and we were talking about so yeah you know tomorrow I leave for the Galapagos it's gonna be gnarly it's gonna suck and then we had this amazing fine so it was really cool now that the Galapagos is so protected that don't they make you like put fresh shoes on like you can't bring shoes that you war somewhere else that might carry seeds yep we had to go to quarantine for 48 hours everything we brought with us had to go into a giant freezer yeah freezer and sit there for two days and we kind of had to twiddle our thumbs just waiting and then we got all our stuff back got on the boats and went out to that Isle so the giant freezer supposedly kills any sort of spores or you know it gets really cold if I remember correctly and they go you know you go through everything they look I go through your boots you look for any seeds you go through your underwear like literally everything to see if you're bringing any contaminants in god that's so fucking cool it is so the Galapagos is really the place where Darwin started formulating a lot of his theories of evolution right with the finches and the tortoises yeah that they're crazy skeleton what is that from some kind of marine mammal sea lion possibly whale it's hard to say they got beach there or something hmm Wow and then that's Fernandina that's the stark island in the background actually where we found the tortoise oh wow yeah it's a big-ass island man it's behind one turtle notice it's all good I have a hard time with that get lazy and just call most Turtles - Oh fuck's the problem yeah just swim better ya know so that was cool it was crazy it was very difficult and hot and you know all those things and just so exciting that's amazing yeah that was fun so when you do have a discovery like this I mean that that's got to like open up the door for more funding more research possibilities more trips hugely what do you want to do next well it's so there's that's twofold right one is it doesn't necessarily open the door for me more which is good it doesn't need to it opens the door for the species and what I mean by that is when it animals declared extinct that's it it's gone right extinct means vanished like no longer in existence so when you find it back that that opens up the dollars for a return efforts management blah blah blah and that's what's going on currently for that particular species it's great for me in the sense that it's like oh this guy is furthering his reputation of being able to find these things that other people aren't which really just boils down to me being willing willing to embrace shittier conditions and a lot of other people are but what's next for me I mean I I take off for Africa I think January 4th January 5th and I'll be there for five weeks working on some some missing sharks missing sharks yeah what kind of sharks there's four species that in the wild coast which is like from Durban up to Mozambique on the east of southeastern Africa that haven't been seen in 30 years or more and it's not necessarily that they're extinct so much as nobody looks for them and you know it's like that's a very gray area of are these animals still there or not and so myself this guy named Dave Ebert he's the president of the North American elastomer brands Society like big shark guy you know big other bionerd like myself we're teaming up and we're going down there too to try and find some of these animals I was reading something recently about great whites in South Africa that there's a massive decline mm-hmm orcas orcas were killing white sharks in in muscle bay that area where Hans Bahia and I don't exactly remember the reason I think they were eating their livers out of the white sharks but yeah they liked their liver right mm-hmm why do they like to deliver so much minerals full of minerals yeah because you know your liver acts as the filter for the body basically and so it's it's pretty well known that big predators orcas leopards lions you know everything they they like to target the liver yeah and it gives them lots of minerals that otherwise they can't get from flesh I was watching a documentary on wolves and there was one of the ways that the Alpha establishes itself that when there's a kill it's the first to eat the liver Oh interesting yeah and there's a guy who was living with these wolves and he was like tricking them that he was a wolf and one of the ways he would do it was he would eat a liver in front of them and shit yeah and and then the guy went away cuz he's a wolf expert and he went away because there was a farmer that was having issues with wolves and they were trying to figure out a way to get the wolves to leave his livestock alone so what they did was they set up a speaker system so they put these gigantic speakers up and they started broadcasting these aggressive wolf howls to let this other wolf pack know that a new wolf pack had moved into the area so this guy was on this project for several months and he came back to the original wolf pack that he was like conning into things and the new Alpha had taken over Oh new alpha was threatening him and so he had a whimper and knee like he was like really in danger of being torn apart by a wolf and on camera he's inches away from this wolf and it's bearing it's teasing you know I mean he's with real wolves right right and so this guy is like curled up in a fetal position and whimpering and putting his paw out like this and this fucking wolf is baring his teeth just inches from him huge bumps just here 50-pound wolf like inches from him just ready to tear him to shreds I think they kill each other all the time oh yeah yeah in u.s. no no it wasn't in the US I don't remember where it was but it was really weird like this guy's life was so strange because he was in for a long period of time when he was like running his research was living with Wolves so he's with them you know he's a part of the pack was he I gotta ask you this and don't answer it if it's uncomfortable that I've in my field working with specialized experts a lot like him obviously that's a whole nother level mm-hmm they start to take on characteristics of these animals I've noticed so like I worked with a guy who was a bear expert right and he spent his whole life with bears and this this man was basically a bear do you know I mean he was grumpy he was cranky was big he was hairy like every part of him seemed like a human bear I'm wondering if this guy was like that was he had he started to did it seemed to you like he had started to like kind of lose touch with social norms and he was starting to take on traits of a wolf that's a good question it's hard to sit yeah this is the guy so this guy is this the guy documentary from 2007-8 called the wolf man yeah I think this is it yeah so so they're like Jesus the way they threatened each other yeah you know I mean so so he would have a kill and he would drag it over and he would eat the liver in front of them and so by doing that he would trick them into thinking he was the shit see he's got the liver and tell me tell me that guy doesn't express Wolf's character it's like look at his body language and every I know he's doing that intentionally for the animal but to me that guy looks like he thinks he's a wolf look at that I mean that's insane how did the cameraman able to get this close and they're safe too very good question hey look at this guy he's little guy out of his fucking mind yeah that's my bro you're made out of jell-o you know you are literally a water balloon filled with jello and you're hanging around these super predators it's not I love wolves they're one of my favorite animals on the planet I just think they're so fascinating and now that they've been reintroduced into the West you know I I know look at that like it's growling that thing's kissing them to show that submissive so he's eating the liver in front of it have you ever been to the wolf sanctuary out here in Pawnee oh no hurts know if you ever want to go let me know I would love to there it's in credits you know that they don't do it for like the general public but they rescue Wolf's and wolf dogs and rehabilitate them and a lot of times they've been in fights and they've you know come out of terrible places and they've got a few animals that they're they're very closely related to fully blood full-blood wild wolves and you can go in and interact with them you're not petting them it's not a puppy you know I mean they don't behave like a dog but you can go in and have one come up and approach you and sniff you and it's a pretty fantastic experience really I'd like to go let's do it let's do it I'm in I'll set it up yeah not doing with that assholes doing what I was saying is that you know since they've reintroduced them into the the West there's been a lot of controversy behind that and there's talks about doing that in Colorado and people are really freaking out like ranchers are freaking out like hey there's a reason why everybody killed these things off right like don't fucking bring them back cuz you know there was another surplus killing that they found I think in Wyoming where they just wiped out a bunt like they'll just go ham and kill like you know 1415 elk cows just because they can it's a eat them there's a term for that it's hen house syndrome have you heard of that no so it's basically like when a fox gets into the henhouse they like they get in this like killing frenzy state where it's not like they're gonna eat 30 different chickens but they're gonna kill everyone because they're in this state right I don't know that's necessarily the case for that but um it's it is scary to think of an apex predator like a wolf getting into that henhouse type syndrome killing 30 elk just because they can yeah but you know what's really interesting Joe is um if you look as I've done a little bit of reading on this if you look at how many instances of wolf fatalities there are in North America for humans for humans it's like two or three it's some very very low numbers there's one in Alaska like a couple of years back there was a woman I think through that jogger and there's one other one yeah and that's kind of it you know that's documented however I have a friend who actually shot an elk in BC in British Columbia and they didn't know but the elk expired right next to a Wolf Den Oh what and the wolf's tried to claim the elk they like came out and said over it he and the guide that he was with had their back to a tree and they shot and killed three attacking wolves and he killed two of them with a bow and arrow and the other guy killed one with a rifle and they were like almost out of bullets and he had one arrow left and they're surrounded by wolves but they had killed enough so you know wolves they do this they do like a roll call they howl when they see who responds and they realized that they had lost three and so they bailed and they took off out of the area but they were in the den he said there was bones in there and they realized like that they just were hunting and they'd shot an elk and it just happened to be right right where the Wolves had a den to have one of the skulls at home on my desk of the wolves yeah oh wow yeah bad stories nuts when John tells the story John Dudley yeah there's a video that you watch on YouTube okay and he's telling the story it's like it's like you know you could see him like going back to the moments fuckin crazy it sounds like a scene out of the gray yeah they're like in the den in the den yeah like I spend my life working with animals that are considered dangerous and there's wolves bears there's a handful of others like you just don't want to be in that situation obviously it wasn't intentional but it's just like it's just a no-win situation we had Glenn Villa knew from that show life below zero oh yeah I know the show yeah and he was on the podcast recently and he was talking about the time that he got chased by wolves okay and this was also on camera like he's got video footage of this and photographic footage of this where he's living in this little tiny Shack that's right next to a lake and these wolves had killed a moose and they were in the middle of this frozen lake there was 20 of them was in a huge wolf pack that's enormous that is an enormous wolf pack yeah get all the photos of this all on his Facebook page see if you can pull that up pull up Glen villain when he wold yeah yeah it's on there's there's John Dudley with one of the wolves that he killed that was trying to do to kill him yeah steal his elk they were running at him they were running at him full clip shot two wolves that were running at him Wow he said they were charging out in full clip and he's at full draw in his lap he kills one and then another one comes running down bang they killed that one he only carries a four arrow quiver right so he had one arrow that he killed the elk two arrows that he killed wolves on our left and he's got his back to a tree and the guy he's with had three bullets she's no sidearm nothing they were just elk hunting right you know they're like fuck jeez yeah so um see this Glanville a new pic so he's got a series of amazing photographs okay that he took from his Shack and they chased him they chased him back to his cat he got close to them like within you know 100 yards or so guys take photographs okay and they started circling him and looking at him and then and then he starts backing up and they start trotting and then he just runs and they run to the fucking door of his cabin and this happened twice and then he got a rifle and just start shooting him god they were running out of me he shot three of them turn it I mean I don't know the situation but turning your back on a pack of wolves and running I mean maybe they were ready red vine Singh I don't know but that just sounds terrible yeah acting like prey is a good way to get killed yeah I mean he's a really wise man yeah and really understands the woods in nature as good as anybody but I think he was one of those situations where he knew he could get back to the cabin and if he didn't get back to the cabin the way they were approaching him if they were getting closer and closer look at that oh my god not amazed that's that is a phenomenon in itself you don't see packs of twenty wolves yes I was saying that one of the like largest documented packs in that areas was 18 right is actually bigger than that and they had a moose down so they had this moose down a moose calf down in the middle of this frozen lake that guy is so interesting that yeah I've really loved the podcast with him because you know he had just decided like I want to try to live like as close to nature as possible no vehicles nothing just snowshoes and a rifle living in a tiny little cabin eating nothing but meat really not just what he eat like that yeah Wow and you know get really close to starving at one point in time that's when I started this is what it looked like it says 2004 yeah so so he I'm familiar with the show but I haven't actually watched it he's on life below zero he was Scotch he didn't get along with them gotchas you know he's a really unique character and I think they had a hard time with his uniqueness sure he he's out of all those people on that show he's living the weirdest life right because all the other ones are like oh they have sled dogs and you know they gather salmon for their dogs with a you know one of those salmon wheels and then they you know they have a cabin and they have a fire in the cabin and then you know they're living and they're eating dinner there are plates and shit like that not him man he's he's living in this one little shack that he built himself he everything he's eating is food that he shot and killed walking around Wow he stole caribou from a wolf why a wolf kill the caribou and he ran up and stole it because he was starving I mean this like neighs and guys living as close to wild as you could possibly get other than the fact that he has bullets and a gun and some and but even he starts fires he wasn't using matches to start fires cuz you could run out of matches but sometimes using like flint and steel and shit like yeah what's his motivation why why does he just want to be closer to nature like that's it yeah you should listen to it if you get a chance he's a really really unique person and just that he wanted he doesn't have an out he has an outhouse today he doesn't have a toilet doesn't have running water today in Fairbanks so wasn't yeah so he's got a plot of land in Fairbanks he built a house there and he doesn't have Plumbing's like it's too much work all right you know you got a boat like it just goes outside and 50 below outside he's shitting in a hole in the ground I have so much respect for that I'll do it for two three four weeks at a time on an excursion I'm very happy to get back to a bed and a shower and yeah you know that's it's that's a whole nother I've never gone more than seven days yeah I've done these seven day hunts like the the one where I got this this mule deer right here my friend Steve Rinella but he introduced us to hunting and this was in Montana and it was October and it got down to you know it's 9 degrees outside we're sleeping in these tents and it was wonderful it was a fantastic experience really opened my eyes to real wild and the elderness what it's like to hunt and and then at the end of these this week we went back to Billings and we got a hotel room and I got a shower and I was like oh my a hot shower after a week in the woods like yeah that was with Bryan Callen and me and I was like how it goes that shower oh my god it's not what you think most amazing shower ever you don't appreciate showers now you're getting them all the time now especially in California because it doesn't get 9 degrees here right right oh yeah being outside freezing your ass off and then but also having the the reward of like actually shooting a deer and then we ate a lot of it that night and we're cooking it over the fire and then you know the whole trip was done on the the Missouri Breaks so we're on the Missouri River and so we took the river 40 miles oh wow yeah yeah canoes and you know and you know we had our cargo and all our shit in there and we're rowing and so just a long-ass journey mm-hmm it was pretty intense yeah and to go back to civilization after that it's like you appreciate civilization because most the time you don't appreciate like it was a janky little hotel and Billings but to me it was like a palace a totally luxury a television I don't mind if I do yeah I'm I'm on your page for that I like returning yeah like decompressing and then within for me it's like within a couple weeks I'm like all right ready to go for the next one you know I go back to not appreciating the comforts of home and I'm like ready to go again well you've probably developed like a taste for both things right for sure yeah although like you you're experiencing so many different facets of life on earth like you're going to all these different environments and ecosystems you're in the water on the land and jungles are on Islands living man I love it and living thanks very cool I admire it but it comes you know like your buddy you know who got the diseases from the Congo it comes with its costs like you know we are in Borneo this year and we were at a research station in the middle of the jungle and I don't know enough about B ecology but it was like be seasoned and I mean you you should see some of our videos on Instagram it's like I'm talking about covered head-to-toe and B's we were taking like 40 to 50 stings on average per day per person you know and it this is so miserable 40 to 50 a day there's eight hours in a day yeah so you're you're literally taking stings all day long well no it's worse than that because we were only at the station in the morning or evenings right before waking up or going to bed the rest of time we're out in the field not taking stings so you're taking like 25 when you wake up and like 25 before you go to bed oh so when you're doing this is there a way to prevent it is there it like can you use like a repellent nothing worked we you know we like put like scarves over our heads and you know and these one is not Hornets right they sting you they die yes but then when we were on that getting that came in we we encountered Hornets that put my cameraman into anaphylactic shock they were so bad oh great yeah so we it comes with its cost which I think my point was it makes you appreciate the comforts so much more when you get back see that tarantula hawk and look I did last file I did I was picking it up right right before you walked in my buddy Maynard sent me that yeah yeah he's got it from Arizona man yeah that's from his he owns a vineyard and he a farm in Arizona and he was telling me about these things and he got a dead one so it to me they're super cool look at the size of that fucker its yard and they come out of holes in the ground hunter an Chile's like you know there's yeah yeah it's hello everybody yeah so I mean the tarantula hawk it's a parasitic wasp right so it comes out it hunts for tarantulas it lays its eggs I believe in the abdomen of the tarantula and then the eggs hatch and explode out of the tarantula and that's the life cycle you beautiful fantastic complicated cruel bitch it's insane oh my god I'm sure you've seen the video of those Hornets that visit this beehive they visit a honeybee hive and just start these Japanese Hornet and they just start chopping off the heads off the bees no way you know no I can't believe I'm telling you about anti-treaty goodness there's a certain species of Hornets that flies into honeybees I think it's Japanese Hornets they fly into these hives of honeybees and just decimate the honeybees they kept their heads off with their their mandibles at the pump chop-chop and there's so much bigger so they fly in and there's a slow-motion video of these enormous Hornets flying in and decapitating thousands and thousands of honeybees so what's interesting is the honeybees they're so outsized I mean the Hornets are literally like 50 60 times larger I you see it there they're great just so maybe that's not the right number but they're much much larger and they're much more powerful but the honeybees figured out a strategy to kill the Hornets and what they do is they surround them they get on top of them and then they beat their wings they'll all generate heat and then they kill the the Hornets with the heat of their body that's unbelievable unbelievable yeah so here's this thing that's decapitating everyone in your little village right and so you have to jump on top of it and flex and heat it up yeah but the fact that they were able to devise this strategy see look how they do it man they just grab ahold of these bees and just decapitate them it's unbelievable they have these horrific faces right these giant mandibles yeah I can see that and they're just swarm in and they just look at them they're just chopping these fucking honeybees apart you you said it nature you cruel beautiful bitch three Hornets versus 30,000 bees do you know why the Hornets are doing this are they getting honey we want the larva a larva yeah yeah they probably want the larva or they want the honey they want something but look at all these dead fucking bees with no heads bizarre crazy it's not I mean it's it's just so weird right that that you know that nature devises these sort of strategies to prevent overpopulation and that there's this balance that takes place where you know the bees are threatened by something that's very be like so you see how that getting on top of them yeah so that's that's their strategy for for dealing they all get on top of them so you see a bunch of them now and he's trying to get away but he can't fly away and so then they swarm and then they eventually kill him so you think that actually like cooks the wasp something it overheats their body and it fort see it how many of them are on there yeah there's something that it does where it overheats their body Wow the size the size comparison there's so much bigger imagine if you had that Hornet you know that was six feet long oh my god I think giant insects would be the worst the worst yeah the worst I think would be praying mantises the shit out of me mm-hmm we've been on a praying mantis kick lately watch them kill rats and yeah everything hummingbirds the hummingbird one is the wildest one they sit by a hummingbird feeder I hit they're not moving and the hummingbird comes to feed they just just spirit snatch them it's crazy it's so strong yeah sighs yeah you know there was one with a mouse and the mouse is so much bigger than the praying mantis premiums just Jax's mouse it's crazy it's wild it's wild creature man yeah they're amazing really cool-looking though I see him all the time I find them all the time when I'm running mm-hmm yeah ya know they're they're amazingly cool and very diverse you know there's huge ones or small ones they're spread out all over the world they're amazing animals what is this one got a snake makes this is lots of them it's like a highlight video oh look at that it's got a fucking snake yeah I think we can't even imagine how strong they would be if they were our size now I think they would run right through walls oh yeah they would I mean look at this fucker he's taking on a giant snake that snake is like two feet long and he's a little ass huh little ass pregnant ass and he's fucking it up he's literally eating it yeah yeah they're pulling chunks out they're insane and they have such crazy eyesight and like they're literally covered in body armor with their exoskeleton they're just they're amazing well they seem like what you would think of as being like a horrific animal that lives on another planet totally totally like do you remember that movie Starship Troopers of course I love that movie love dydt and that was one of the things in the Starship Troopers like these giant insect gems the bursting out of the ground shooting stuff out of their butts and they're great I love that movie yeah Corre Corre Rico yeah yeah that was a fun movie right yeah kind of tongue-in-cheek totally but also like really gory and totally yeah Neil Patrick Harris yes like the genius yeah it's great that's such a fun movie I mean that's great stuff I said we're really fortunate those things are small that all move all insects are small we would be on the menu otherwise no doubt about it like there to like indiscriminately perfect hunters big big you know predatory insects is there a history on the fossil record of enormous bugs like isopods and things like that but I can't not that I know of like you know six foot long preying mantises it's weird how things sort of figure out what size they should be yeah just based on what the environment can support and what their lifestyle supports like Island dwarfism mm-hmm and there's insular gigantism as well right right it exists in both spectrums like if there's tons of prey and something gets there it gets bigger and bigger if there's not enough resources it gets smaller and smaller do you know do you know about the Lions that are in a very specific part of Africa where the river branched off and left them on an island with only Buffalo we discussed this last time I don't know if was on the podcast or in the back there but I that's how I learnt more about it chatting with you last time I remember we looked it up there's a great documentary for people don't know about it's called relentless enemies mhm and it's these enormous lines these lines have evolved to only kill Buffalo so the female lions are as big as regular male line it's just yeah I look fake mm-hmm they look like bodybuilder like what they do and they just all they do inputs weird this is what's really weird about the documentary there's several packs they live on this island but one pack has these enormous super lions and then there's another pack of regular-sized lines really yeah so since that pride of the super-sized lions are they dominant over the other one are they just preying on different species I don't know it's interesting I don't know but but I found it weird that one pack evolved and became enormous right and then the other pack just kind of didn't selective breeding yeah if you're big and jacked hang out over here and eat Buffalo if you're if your winning show over there yeah it's crazy also is that how recently it took place mm-hmm that it was I think it was less than a hundred years that the officer had switched and that these animals started to adapt they put on you know I mean they literally are twice the size of a normal female lion it's crazy and shoot but also they're only eating Buffalo right I bet if you ate water buffalo every day you just get jacked by default I'd look like the rock yeah you its carnivore month guys I think those things often rise and fall you know and we're in a state where we understand what I mean by that is you know so the river changes you've got nothing but lines and Buffalo lines get bigger and bigger and bigger eventually they get to the point where they wipe out all the Buffalo because it's not sustainable then the Lions collapse so what's cool is that we can actually see that in action right over over our lifespan we can see this generational change in the Lions it might not it might not collapse it could last tens of thousands of years but it's interesting that you can actually see it in taking place it's it's evolution in action basically there's a documentary from the BBC about the Congo that gets into that and they talk about how quickly the rainforest had grown and what used to be grasslands became this enormous dense rainforest and a lot of these animals that were plains animals had to figure out a way to survive right and so they adapted and they were talking about the duiker mhm I knee little animal deer looking at things Wims under water for as much as a hundred yards and eats fish isn't that crazy they've got exactly yeah I mean you just summed it up it's it's nuts a fucking antelope that eats fish right and can hold its breath in freedive God nature spray nature is metal you have you've always been fascinated by nature I mean you you obviously are now and what a perfect career you have yeah I mean I I feel like I have the perfect job and I have from when I was a little kid you know some so grams embalming my family on safari businesses that was what we did but when you're a little kid in the bush in Zimbabwe you can't just go out running around you know so you're kind of stuck in camp so I'd be the one flipping over logs and grabbing earthworms and catching snakes and the way you just said can't I heard South Africa there the heart and then it pops out yep it's the heart is mostly mostly blend in I try but ya know as I started young and and just it's just been my my driving force since I was a little kid that's so cool yeah well it's such an amazing subject and there's so much to look at you will never run out of things to study never I mean and you never stop learning look today I learned about the wasps and the bees like I've considered myself pretty well read in the field of wildlife that's all new to me I'm gonna go home I'm gonna google it I'm yeah it's just so fantastic it never ends do you know about the bees and Nepal that makes psychedelic honey I do yeah I do and how they harvest that honey yes pull pull up like some videos or some images of that these guys are risking their life to trip balls on this crazy honey yeah what are they um what's the pollen that they're getting it from what are they getting into I don't have to be sorry all I know is what you just said which is it's the the pollen that they're creating the honey out of that is making it psychedelic but I don't know there you go go lick some honey off a cliff in Nepal and see what happens it must be really good if you get honey other places but this honey makes you trip I wonder what the actual like psychoactive substance in the honey is no I never even looked into it yeah what does it say Jamie but these guys they've apparently just decided it's worth repelling bright side of these mountains because he grows off the side of cliffs yeah it's like it looks like big like shelf fungus and like grows out horizontally off these vertical cliffs yeah and these as these guys are harvesting it right they're hanging on ropes from cliffs getting lit up by bees and then pop and psychedelic honey in their mouths now when you speculation on it was that it may be the higher altitudes allowed this neurotoxin to develop called grey and no toxin moves in it it's called like red honey specifically well you could buy it I see diminishes over time so um I gotta get it fresh right yeah hmm interesting white Ronin No Oh wrote it down click on that again please we have rhododendrons probably different family here you know as pretty plants around California it's just that that's just a descriptive of the absolute it might be at that specific one in the altitude because it stays up there lack of so it's exported exported from Nepal to Japan Korea and Hong Kong the red honey is prized for its purported medicinal value and intoxicating qualities and are attributed to this grey nanotoxin present in the nectar collected from white rhododendrons the Gor rung am I saying that right go wrong people in Nepal are renowned for their use of this mad economy dude we need to buy mad huh that's great he's mad honey for sale see we goodbye mad honey the name of a band it's a good name that's a good name it's a great band yeah mad honey gentlemen mad honey if they come out frothing at the mouth yeah there it is I think no this where's the man honey bro come on safe I don't want to know if it's safe I just want to know if I can get it okay take a chance bye man honey here we go come on baby Amazon what do you go there oh god honey dotnet mad honey from Nepal order that shit son 115 grams for how much it was like 40 bucks up there on the top right strongest most potent mad honey available don't look at that Add to Cart here we go okay well order something we're gonna get some man I like that now I'm very excited I'm very excited we're not live to because that way that you assholes out there can't just steal life we would never have a chance they would sweep up all the mad honey yeah that's true yeah like that buy you a jug I'm in we mix it in coffee next time what do you think it does to you well I guess would you be willing to just sit here and absolutely something organic like that I'm totally into it yeah what do you do burr is it exactly back to Santa Barbara yeah it's uh it says it's a psychedelic right yes yeah yeah so I wonder what kind says you have to be 18 to order it I'm 18 it says they're mad honey does contain the great gray a no toxins or otherwise it would just be regular honey and it is laboratory tested to assure consistent quality and it is safe and effective it says what is effective it's not FDA tested I wouldn't matter if it tastes good is it effective right tastes good or does it make you feel weird yeah what are you saying he's a make you trip and how long does it last and also do you have to eat the entire jar of honey to feel anything right right anything else I should know they have not been evaluated by the FDA these statements have not been evaluated intended for education and research purposes only of course of course dude I'm all about education and some R&D going on and some honey over here it's these parts of the world where people are willing to harvest things like that like how'd they figure that out who was the first guy that's like you see that fucking beehive up there right I'm gonna get some of that honey dude right angle off a cliff yeah good luck my friend saying this the other day two somebodies who was the first guy to figure out caviar who's the first got to suck off a sturgeon and be like mmm this is delicious you know good just everything they can fish yeah and if you catch a sturgeon man the whole village is eating yeah I mean so I'm 910 feet long - they're so bit my friends John and Jen they live in Alberta and they went sturgeon fishing and they they caught them and put them on their Instagram page and you're looking at like that is a prehistoric dinosaur right creature that thing is enormous those big scales down the sides and down actually the weird mouth and whiskers they're bizarre yeah there's something about the way you you're looking at them you like I don't feel like you should be catching that right there's too old yeah yeah it's like you just should probably leave that thing alone I think that that might be one of the you know there's there's a lot of those North American things that they think are monsters like Nessie mm-hmm you know I like the Loch Ness monster they also have like ones in Lake Michigan and what do they call it Lake Champlain they have a Lake Champlain one and they think that it might be sturgeon oh and or see cuz you know if especially because people have a tendency to exaggerate if you see a ten-foot sturgeon you're going to think it's a 25 do you know that um this is kind of interesting they actually had documented bull sharks stuck in the Great Lakes yes I'd heard about the pretty amazing that is nuts sharks swimming a thousand miles from you know blue easy Anna up rivers and getting stuck in the Great Lakes well they're one of the rare sharks that can breathe fresh water right katara --mess yeah so she goes yeah in and out of in and out of fresh water you know they go through osmoregulation they can get the salt out or in whatever they need and then go into the rivers spend time in the rivers go back into the ocean to hunt the inspiration for the movie Jaws was apparently bull sharks in New Jersey a series of attacks in fresh water on a river system right but near an ocean I believe railing at a river mouth yeah yeah that was my understanding yes people were going into the river and these bull sharks were killing them right like in a river yeah no we're safe well they're really aggressive right yeah they have the highest testosterone of any species of shark and so they're just they're just jacked up yeah they're just ready all the time like they're they're a bullish and you know their shoulders are kind of arched over their pecs are locked and they just they look ready at any time to just snap yeah they found them all the way up and like Illinois yeah yeah it's crazy fuck like think of the temperature in Chicago right now you know and the shark swims all the way up there cold-blooded monster yeah how do they get into the Great Lakes well they used to go up the Mississippi River but I think with all the locks that are there now in place they just I think the idea was that they got stuck there when they were building the locks and then they died out over time when when was the last known sighting of one I think some two years ago no there you go they find him is been one found in Iowa Texas fuck is a shark king - I imagine yeah we lost Billie got bit by a shark what was he surfing retinol he was in Iowa right right he was plowing corn and got killed by sure there might be an asshole yeah I found them really yeah Ohio Chardon Ohio what how do they get in Ohio all those rivers are connected yeah ha damn that's amazing right nature finds away you know whenever I look at those videos of bears catching salmon and jumping up the river like what was the first salmon thinking when it decided hey I'm gonna go up these rocks right back to the place where I was born right and and and and spawn there put a target on my back yeah oh just gigantic fucking bear waiting to catch me in the air right like those images of bears catching them with their mouths as the salmon are flying through the air so I make it up to it's just but it's so weird like what a weird system it's like nature's assuring robustness they're sure assuring that these fragile fish don't make it correct in order to be able to make that trip to the ocean and back to get through the rivers and streams to survive you have to be rugged right and so they're showing it now so they're going upstream swimming against the current oh oh and by the way here's a fucking 1800 pound they're looking to eat you it's crazy it's so cool but that that is a viable system is this is the system that's been in place forever right so strange right and and that you know we can destroy that so quickly we put one dam in and that that ruins that whole ecosystem for that River and the Bears and the salmon and the spawning and you know we can remedy that we put salmon ladders in and yadda yadda but it's it's interesting that everything seems so tough as you just said and at the same time it's so fragile because we you know we do one thing like putting a hydroelectric dam and it ruins the entire ecosystem yeah we were in Seattle and in Seattle there's a place where you can go and it's like underneath this bridge and there's these clear plexiglass walls and you can actually see the salmon the way through and up the river and they were explaining how they had put dams in and didn't really understand the consequences of putting these dams back when they did and then all these salmon would go to the mouth of the river where they thought they were going to go upriver and it would be locked right there and he has died and didn't breed and so the population drastically diminished these salmon died in like in the harbor yep like really wild stuff yeah it's crazy and then supports you know like that food source that protein supports not just like the Bears and the birds but like the whole river is ecology right like the river the lg's that live in the river the little bugs that live in the algae depend on those salmon dying up that river and fertilizing the river yeah so it's like the whole thing is so interconnected and then you know one little thing and poof did you yeah that is really crazy did you see that video of the octopus that had captured an eagle that captured an eagle yes it was in Vancouver Island I know the octopus had captured an eagle and was trying to eat the eagle and these fishermen saw the struggle and released the Eagle from the grasp of the octopus suits to me is like that so here it is right here holy crap that Eagles like fuck out bro help help hello will help but to me it's weird it's like why are you getting involved in this right it's not like right like people want to think that Eagles are an endangered species they are absolutely not endangered you go to Alaska they're like pigeons up there they're they're Giant Pacific octopus they're amazing those in for yeah but that that's the thing it's like I kind of like octopus more than I like Eagles there's much smarter they're way smarter yeah yeah they're really interesting I mean I love Eagles too right but you kind of got to lay a play out look if I saw like a lion that that eagle might not make it anyway look at them right he's fuck he's it alone I'm sorry water happen what happened the monkey-people safe and the fucking and the kraken yeah he was I don't even know how the octopus got him but the like what octopus can do is nothing short of spectacular you know we're talking about my friend Remy Warren earlier and he had a show on television before called apex predator and it was basically they would study apex predators and you know the different strategies they used to be successful as a hunter and when they did the one on the octopus he you know he was in here and like he was like dude they're from another planet yeah he's like that is the way they change their texture right in their color and the way they do it instantaneously to adapt to their environment and how well they blend in they're so interesting I think they're the most alien creature that exists on planet Earth yeah I agree there's a there's a new documentary out on I think it's PBS called making contact that's just about octopus intelligences this guy he's a fisheries biologist and he gets an octopus and basically lives with it in his living room like he figures out that this thing likes being petted like it knows how to it's just it's the diverse array of things that this thing can process mentally it's like on par with like what chimpanzees do you know what I mean it's like it's just like it can open jars it can close them it can come out of the aquarium go back into it it'll swim over if it knows you it knows if it doesn't like you like it's unbelievable yeah really weird right yeah dad we got this video the octopus dreaming I just looked it up and it starts with the octopus this is my living room this is it this is super viral yeah well they apparently as the octopus is asleep and dreaming it's changing the outside color and texture of its skin in relation to whatever the fuck is going on in its head right right so wild nuts it's just so weird how they can instantaneously change their coloration and their texture and then perfectly blend in with coral right like when you see them like stopped on a coral reef and just become the reef you like what ardently - it's like yeah and it's gone the colors in this thing you know what simcha there are actual there are people that actually believe they are from out of space I've seen that I'm gonna bring it up to you that there's biologists that believe that they came in and asteroids and eggs you got it yeah that's exactly really think about that I think like look I believe in life outside of Earth but I don't I don't necessarily think that octopus came from that I think they're you know they have other stuff like there are other cephalopods that they're related to genetically squid and cuttlefish and things like that I don't necessarily think they came from out of space but I can see why there's science to support that it's a possibility and then I can also see why people think that seeing them well there's thoughts about that with a lot of different life forms like spores there's thoughts about that when it comes to psilocybin mushrooms yep there's like the real freaky psychedelic heads think that psilocybin mushrooms came from asteroids right and and the the proof and the pudding in that one so to speak is the fact that you can take mushroom spores into the vacuum of space and bring them back to earth and there they still they still fruit yeah trying to grow a weed right now to see what happens out there you guys sent a little bit of weed into something on the space station I think we're gonna test it for 30 days and see if it's viable really that's when we get the weed business us and Elon space weed SpaceX right is Wheatley LAN cent weed in the space I don't think this is the first time it's been done but the story went around cuz that's interesting because when he was on here I don't know if the game hailed no he's growing weed in space look at what they're the octopus eggs look like whoa and so they're developing those intelligent chromatophores that thing that basically the skin picks up the color and changes to match mm-hmm right there in the embryo yeah look at their little eyeballs how weird and look how many of them like an invasion the imagine if your wife gave birth to that many people no thanks you'd be like oh I have a school school full of kids hey first of all I'm getting fucking snipped look at that look how they drop off points what the matrix looks like exactly dude the matrix is not that far off and it seems like the further this further we go in time and human evolutionary time the more it seems like it's an act it's accurate you know I think we're getting more and more plugged in every yeah it's like a combination of the matrix and the Terminator together yeah I'm very concerned about the future of our species but but going back to octopus octopus and cuttlefish are closely related right and they both can change the texture in their color yeah cuttlefish have lack less textural changes they're more color based okay what was the one they did would they had him over a chessboard and it was trying to meet you ever seen that we're now this is trying to mimic a chessboard that's cool yeah is really weird because it throws a system off because there's any right angles and it's hard just yeah and the one zero contrast so when you look at it like this octopus like trying to like figure out her right what to do yeah can you see actual like lines in his color I don't remember I remember it being weird is it a coefficient yeah see if we could see it here it's very strange pictures good yeah look at that I mean that's pretty good like pretty fucking good yeah look it's got white squares man write the goddamn things growing white squares started with zebra stripes and then I think it maybe it figured out the squares after a couple that's pretty impressive I like the picture in the bottom right there where the guy looks like he's playing chess against the cuttlefish I never mind I thought there's a cuttlefish yeah just what a strange ability that these animals have unbelievable figured out I mean just how the fuck did that evolve right there they're devising strategies in order to be more effective predators while they're in the ocean and hide from other predators right and they've figured out a way to change the color in the texture of their skin like how long did that take exactly exactly millions of years yeah this like it's an endless source of fascination like wildlife documentaries to me are just truly an endless source of fascination there I mean you know you're preaching to the choir but yeah I think they're phenomenal you there's just so much we can learn and it's like it's more than just what we learned oh that's cool that's a nice fact about an octopus but you know we took how we shape Jets off of the shape of birds we've taken so much inspiration from nature into our everyday lives look at this look at this squid skin squid skin this so squid or chick oh my god it's like a television yeah like the pixels on a television I didn't know squid could do that - oh this is so weird oh god they're so strange such a stream strange animal but the ocean is so bizarre in and of itself there's just so many weird creatures on ocean it's such an alien environment to us as terrestrial mammals do you remember when the tsunami hit Thailand and then there was all these animals that they were finding that they had never really seen before washed up on our shores I remember that yeah yeah and they were documenting them there was a whole website dedicated to soon tsunami deep sea creatures I didn't know that yeah yes really crazy like some of these things that are living you know a fucking mile down under the earth and you're like what what are you and they they forget what the number was but they got like 30 or 40 new species or something crazy like that literally like combing through the streets of the cities where these where the tsunami had hit yeah is that a richer source of bioresources of the the ocean of a biodiversity I should say the ocean then earth oh there's more life in the ocean than on terrestrial land for sure yeah you mean is there more diversity in general weirdness oh yeah there's way more I I guess it depends how you define weirdness but like look at an octopus look at a cuttlefish you know look at those deep sea creatures crabs and all the way into the marine mammals and all the way down to the tiny little insects are isopods that live in the ocean I think I think the ocean creatures are very bizarre how about those giant squid that they found on that oil tanker giant squid with the crazy like crab legs yep that one legs maybe not never see that one with the crab legs is he walking along the bottom no it's got like it looks like it has appendages well with the joints yeah haven't seen oh my god oh I'm gonna show you something I'm learning a lot today I like this crazy alien looking squid I found another thing about those pictures they've been gone around multiple times after tsunamis apparently they don't have anything to do with the tsunami they're just there are real photographs of real strange sea creatures they just didn't washed up on shore after tsunami what about the thing that you'd saw that's what I said when I was her 2004 in 2011 the same photos also people are bullshitting Russians believe me go to pull up that alien squid discovered near oil rig so they had a camera deep under this oil rig and they spotted this thing with these insane long appendages look at this oh whoa yeah that's different I thought you look at the fucking length of those what are those things that dangle from it what do you would you call those things let tentacles legs what is it but look at the legs on it like an insect that's very bizarre see how they have like very like obvious bends video courtesy of shale oil company doing a good job for nature yeah right I see the deep there's another one is that another but look how weird it is how it has like a clear bends like when you see that thing underwater floating around like that like that looks like an alien totally totally that is that is our exact kind of depiction of what an alien species go to that green one right next to it oh yeah look at that like look at that that's crazy I mean if you saw that underwater you would shit your pay $150 but that the length of the actual tentacles whatever the fuck it is was really long so strange and this before they got this video footage of it they didn't even know something like this was real and there's there's like a lot of those where you get these deep-sea cameras and you're like oh there's a species we haven't ever documented before so it's in the Gulf of Mexico they caught a depth of seven thousand eight hundred feet but they did what does it say how big they think it is you can just type in 9 mag fins magnet weena the squid size just big big fin like a fucking just so weird it look like the way that the head of it sort of pulsates and moves with waves like it's like a Steven Spielberg creation yeah yeah that and then there's also a puppy right you know that's how diverse life is okay length is up to 15 to 20 times the mantle 20 26 feet okay that's one more or more yeah well giant octopus is - right giant squids were thought to be bullshit until like fairly recently rekt yeah I don't know when specifically but they've found a few that have washed up and then they got some they got some actual footage of some that's what I thought you were talking about on some rigs easy what about octopi what's the largest of the octopi the Giant Pacific octopus so the species that you saw attacking that eagle that's not a huge one but as far as as far as I know that's the largest one the fucker yeah that's a giant squid it's a big cephalopod oh that thing's huge that looks like it's more than 28 feet if you stretch that bitch I know those ones those ones are those ones are like a hundred plus feet yeah that's what the giant squid yeah a hundred plus feet they can get up to that yeah it is so nuts isn't it a hundred foot jelly creature you know and you know what's interesting is sperm whales will leave the surface of the ocean and dive down to their depths to hunt those Calamari's good look at that fucker so weird so the the large pacific octopus how big Giants Giant Pacific octopus how BIG's that guy get um I don't know and I mean you know cuz they fan out so I'm not sure maybe 5 feet long 6 feet long but heavy like 40 50 60 pounds something like that they've got a really big one at the Monterey Bay Aquarium really yeah really cool one oh I've been to that I've been to that aquarium back in the day yeah The Legend of the Kraken like they used to think that that was all total horseshit right until they found some fossilized cups they found some suction cups mhm that were the you know some fossilized evidence of enormous cups right that they think are indicative of this you know real hundred foot octopus or fucking octopus well or just a hundred foot squid on the surface you know what I like you said those stories always get embellished so even if it was a 60 foot squid on the surface say it was injured or dying and it was live and the boat hit it and it starts slapping the boat with its with its tentacles haha my tits to crack and like that's not going to turn into a crazy C fable to imagine though if you were one of those dudes that was like making your way across the ocean and you you know in the 1100s or some sh a and you jump in the water to wash off and you get eaten by a giant octopus in front of your friends yeah that's it's literally suction cups that rip you apart oh it's crazy and it's totally possible that those things were huge we just don't have the fossil evidence because they're all made of jelly right you know they're just like they don't fossilize yeah yeah all you get is like if you those fossilized the images of the the the cups is just because it left an imprint writing some sort of soils right at the bottom so you you like these kind of far out there ideas how do you like this idea there is a cut there's a group of people that say that dragons were real and I'll explain so it around the same time period so to speak and I'm not one of these people so I'm probably gonna get the details wrong Matthew McConaughey movie yeah seriously but so around the same time period in you know China South America Africa all these different Rome all these places images depicted people fighting dragons right and every every dragon was slightly different but it was all a giant scaly animal that could fly so when you take when you break that down you think about the fact that large birds had a hard time being fossilized because their bones are so porous right so because bones there have like hollow wishbones they break down very easily they don't fossilize so the the group that says this basically they're they're saying the evidence is the reason there's no fossils of dragons is because they had bird bones and they were actually very delicate animals but a handful of these more small a small population of these giant lip flying lizards existed and basically encompassed all these different countries where they all depicted fighting dragons in their own way and they were all killed off by you know Knights or whatever it is and then didn't fossilize so it's like the science is saying that if there or lizards big enough to fly around and eat people they didn't have bones that could fossilize so it would be like an eagle right and so and that's why you know that's why all these human populations around the world have depictions of them because they did actually exist now are there any stories of dragons like written like in the times of people that actually had the written word or is it just depictions I don't know not my field that I interesting because like are these depictions like ancient accounts told by generation after generally past so I think I don't know I don't know anything about dragons or whether it's real but I think it's interesting to think oh well the science supports that if there were flying lizards their bones wouldn't have fossilized and these have been passed down stories that have been exaggerated and passed down from generation to generation and some of them breathe fire but some of them don't Yap upon which culture it was significant - I wonder if what the fire with the fire supposed to represent or they just people are full of shit probably that one yeah probably made it sound even cooler yeah exactly do you think that do you hold any weight do you think that holds any way no actually dragon I mean we know there were large flying lizards during the times the dinosaurs right the only weight that it could possibly hold is that like a few of those somehow survived much later than we previously thought but I do I think that there were at dragons attacking human beings and civilizations now I don't but it's still interesting it's so much cooler if there were right and the fact that we know that pterodactyls did exist that's cool right would be rate way cores that they existed with people right 2,000 years ago why is that so much cooler it's like I would be I would I mean people would dedicate giant chunks of their life trying to find out if pterodactyls did coexist with human beings at a point in time oh really what absolutely many of you but there was a hundred-foot pterodactyl snatching kids be terrified Oh God would you know about the the MOA eagle yeah yeah the hasta hasta act like all MOA you go because they used to tag Mouse these weren't that big no but they did supposedly snatched Maori children yeah but when I googled it I remember I think the large ones were like 40 pounds or something like that I don't think they were that but that all it is yeah can evil is really light right but their wingspan is so enormous yeah I mean they're they have incredible power look I don't see an eagle snatch a salmon with its claws and fly away with this 10 pound salmon right and it's claw minutes insane it is cuz that salmon probably weighs more than it right right birds are weird right they sit on you like oh you're not really heavy no they don't weigh anything and again that goes back to that whole hollow bone type thing right that's why chickens are strange because they're fat yeah they weigh a lot like you pick up a chicken oh you fat fuck but bird like a hawk of a fairly light yeah for what it is yeah yeah I think was the biggest Haast eagle how big was the hostile but they they were hunted by people right because they they posed a threat and because people hunted the MOA to extinction that giant bird that name heard that the hasti will primarily preyed on and so the twofold kind of made them collapse yeah large gigantic ancient things ate and I have C wingspan for a female is typically 8 and a half feet possibly up to 10 and a few cases live female I'm trying to talk I just the first thing I see yeah and one about the big do males 25 pounds females 31 pounds Oh largest female could have been 36 pounds and mass yeah but still it big but a 10-foot wingspan is getting huge Oh huge yeah I mean you know talons you they've got it I don't know but they had to have been enormous yes flying knives yeah well you've seen the videos that the the Mongols use where they they train Golden Eagles to kill wolves mm-hmm yeah crazy son believe they fuck up wolves like yeah way smaller than a wall oh yeah the wolf has zero chance right they swoop down and grab a wolf by the back of the neck and just fuck him up isn't it crazy trying to get away and they just killing them and I believe maybe it's not Mongolian culture but one of those you know falconry cultures you have to like as a teenage boy or something like that you're right of passage is to go climb the cliff and take the check out of the net and it's like this crazy process where you know a number of kids died trying to get to the Eagle chick and the ones that come back that's their bird for however long the bird lives or I don't really know the hook process right now the avatar isn't that nuts right yeah that's bananas I'm gonna steal the chick from the nest and raise it uh-huh figured that out who figured out you're gonna train a fuckin raptor I don't know like how weird are people yeah they figure these things out and someone was the first you know I mean someone was like I'm gonna go get that baby bird I'm gonna you know what he probably did he probably got high off that honey climb and that's here I'm gonna get me a fucking bird bird do all the hunting that's like you're crazy man do the hunt when I was in Venice this summer there was a guy that had a hawk that he had trained that was sitting on his arm that he would stand there to keep the pigeons from disturbing all the customers that were eating in this restaurant no way yeah cuz the pigeons in Venice were so aggressive yeah that uh this place we're staying at called the gritty Palace which is this beautiful old hotel in Rome or in Venice rather and now it was like up until really recently the water subsided but it was up in there like four feet of water slowly flooding yeah shit's changing I'm sure there folks yeah but this guy was standing there as we arrived with a hawk on his arm and I think it was an American Hawk that had trained and just to keep these pigeons on check because the pigeons to see the hog foxes what do you send them are you standing there all day I don't know maybe did which would have been dope right I would have loved it to see a hawk Jack a pigeon while meeting linguini with clams yeah this is perfect yeah yeah look at this Hawk Falcons oh those are Falcons these guys are these planes they take them on the planes these emotional support yeah Falcons I think so that's hilarious it literally says plane with emotional support well here's one with a lot of them on them and supporting them or be on that flight yeah listen man I'm gonna wait for the next flight yeah I'm not flying with a bunch of fucking birds with they're wearing masks over their head they have execution hoods over their heads it does look like it's so strange but it's a human's are so weird and our ability to domesticate and capture animals but there is evidence that other animals do it - have you ever seen the baboons that raise dogs I know what you're talking about yeah there's a couple different primates that basically had pets they steal dogs and then bring the dogs and feed them and put them in the camp because the dogs will bark when things are coming so they can sleep so they can eat and sleep so the hyenas just hang out with these dogs the dogs become like their buddies it's not crazy but they steal them and they literally know they're to get this dog and bring it over here and then feed it right the dog will be like their guard dog this is my this is my pad yeah which is what we think happened with humans and wolves like which sort of fostered this relationship with people and dogs exactly yeah these hyenas have figured that out isn't that nuts what the fuck man however he is figuring that out have you uh read any ass appalled skis work on on on baboons I don't think so Robert Sapolsky is fast any guy he's out of Stanford and he's I found out about Sapolsky initially because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis that's that cat parasite that alters the behavior of rodents and makes them attracted to cat urine so that they will they it actually makes the rodents erect their their testicles and other their their scrotum in enlarges and engorges with blood when they smell cat urine they become sexually aroused by the smell of cat urine so this makes them get eaten by cats because the only place where this parasite can can grow and breed and reproduce is inside the gut of a cat so it's crazy so rewires the rodents sexual reward system and makes them lose all their fear of cats not just all their feet everything comes sexually aroused by cat urine so they run around and actually chase cats I can seem Oh cats look like trying to get the fuck away from these rats that have talked so that's insane right so then it gets in the cat and then it gets in the people okay and Sapolsky when he was studying he found when he was doing his residency one of the doctors is working with was telling them when they get a motorcycle patient and check them for toxo because there's a disproportion on earth is infected with toxoplasmosis Wow and this toxoplasmosis Gandhi apparently changes human behavior and it makes people more reckless and there's a direct correlation between motorcycle accidents and infection with toxoplasmosis and they think that what happens is look at this rat this rat is sexually attracted to this cat so this rat is like running about on this these cats look at him he's running towards them they don't know what the fuck they did look he's running on top of the crowd look at his Louise he's on his back and the cats like what the fuck is going on I give you this look at him yeah that's nuts that's so strange they have their whole brain is rewired because of this parasite so then the parasite gets in people it makes people more aggressive it makes it it makes them more impulsive well and they think that that's related to the disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents that are connected to people that are toxoplasmosis positive so there they have this infection they just take risks and they wind up crashing that's crazy dude what a crazy correlation you know those together in some countries it's the rate of infections crazy like in France at one point in time was more than 50% Oh what 50% of the population was positive for toxoplasmosis and they think that I don't know what the number is now but they think that in the United States more than 50 million people know way more than 50 million people test positive for yeah and is he everything turner's like yes cat owners or people live in rural populations where there's feral cats Wow and they step in the shit and then the shit gets in their skin or they eat something that is eaten this cat shit or you know the cat shit infects the cows right there's all sorts of different methods of infection but the thing about it is it's not fatal right but it does have these mark behavioural changes in human hosts massive changes in rodent nothing to the cat right cat seems to have no no notice no noticeable change in doormen havior but the gut of the cat is where they breed sure no we do since our cats digestive system right the only way they get in there is by tricking a rat to try to go near a cat to hump a cat yeah what what yeah it's crazy so Sapolsky did a bunch of work with baboons and these ruthless vicious baboon tribes and one of the things that they found was that these certain baboons started eating human food because they they started eating like these like at dumpster sites and they got poisoned by you know poison food like the food was bad or it was infected with a disease sure and the alphas were the first to eat right so these alphas died and so the ruthless vicious bully hyenas are not hyenas blame the weed goddamn wheat baboon sorry baboon populations are the ones that had the dogs right I said that you you got you slipped one hyena in there but I got you I was falling trying to keep up with biologists so the baboon has raised the dogs the baboons the Alpha baboons that Sapolsky worked with were eating this poison food and the alphas died right so they were left with a bunch of beta baboons right and these beta baboons changed their behavior they stopped being ruthless to each other they started grooming each other and it lasted like several generations so he would return to Africa to study these baboon populations right and there was a complete shift in baboon culture Wow yeah and he's got this really great speech on it where he goes into depth about how extraordinary it is that they you know we thought this was just how baboons existed and behaved and they completely changed right and it's it's and it's attributed down to one individual well it's attributed to several that died off because they were eating this poison food and then the ones that remained were like the ones that used to get bullied to sheriff to say let's just be cool we just soft yeah and they became the different kind of baboon population it's amazing yeah but they got like really sick and fat from all the human food that's really unhealthy there's a lot of that globally you know these populations of primates that depend on human food have you ever seen the famous like obese monkey there's a famous obese macaque they put him in fat camp they put him in monkey fat camp no he's pretty funny was he eating a human garbage basically but he there is yep oh my page yeah I've seen that picture that's real that's real I forget his name oh my god yeah so fat oh yeah and look at the one behind him super fat like they're just they're just eating human trash and getting absolutely this is like someone's feeding them cuz that human trash first shot up cooked corn that Warren looks really they are and I think they've restricted it wherever this was and it is sad because it's basically a form of animal cruelty you know you're just making them enormous but uh it's bright I mean look at it it's insane yeah the fat fuck it's got a lot of corn he's not aggressive towards anyone he just said yeah monkeys will fuck you up right oh yeah oh yeah primates or baboons are terrible I mean they can be super aggressive and all primates I mean they're they're sweet by nature but if you know you're a threat to them they can be terrible yeah but those little monkeys will steal shit from you too oh yeah steal your phone oh yeah I try to get it back they'll kick your ass my my partner in production and I have this ongoing joke where we say we're gonna make a show called monkeys or assholes and it's just a show traveling the world where monkeys pickpocket and bully people and like jump on trains and steal stuff and well they exhibit some of the worst aspects of human behavior you know we see how monkeys behave you know how well chimps you know we love chimps right chimps are adorable when you see them in movies or adorable and in concept but they're absolutely vicious and ruthless mmm-hmm including to each other they gang up and they'll do wage war and they'll go capture a neighboring chimp and kill him yep now they're they're brutal they are I mean they're they're like us they're like a step backwards from human beings you look at how they behave and you're like oh if we had no you know social order no structure no laws nothing that's this kind of what we'd be like but what's amazing is that we coexist yeah what's amazing is that we get to see oh this is probably our past right you know right like what was it like back when humans like you know Australia Pittacus we were like barely removed from monkeys right exactly around with them like how did we figure it out and they didn't yeah I mean at some point it was like oh if we collaborate we benefit more right and they were like if we fight we benefit more and it's just kind of diverged from that well that's what's interesting to me is how some animals their progress or their evolution remains stagnant like crocodiles they're essentially the same way they were tens of millions of years ago yep whereas humans is this market change over the last half a million years a spectacular change you know or two million years ago the doubling of the human brain sighs yep really quickly right special special moments in evolution but then other things don't grow at all but then you have these lions that get trapped on this island they go okay we got to get way bigger right I think we got to fuck up these Buffalo's the only thing we can eat you can't fuck up a buffalo if you're little right and the bigger survive and those are the ones that bred I mean it's it's so interesting to see how this stuff sort of plays out and that we're studying it and really over the last only few hundred years or really getting an understanding of it even less than that I mean we're really only starting to understand it on a big picture now yeah it is amazing and everything in between like you said these these you know crocodiles reaching their pinnacle of evolution on tens of millions of years ago and us constantly avoid it's just it's insane the world the living world is so fascinating have you ever seen the video of these people they're in a crocodile park and they're feeding these crocodiles and this lady's like Chuck and chickens like chickens out oh yeah and then one crocodile bites the other crocodiles leg off and does the death roll note like I'm straight even moves mm-hmm this is like leg comes off and just was like what the fuck bro yeah it doesn't even move it doesn't react in pain just nothing I know the exact video telling I went totally viral yeah he just rolls and the leg just pops right off and it was wallows his foot swallows his buddy's foot like fucking a it's it's not it's not absolutely not so that is a cleanup machine yeah that's a 65 million year old cleanup machine yep and they figured out this is a great it's like a hammer yeah you know how to make a hammer right right there's no new hammers exactly right hammer is like this is it there's a stick and then the end there's a metal thing and bang bang bang yeah hammer that's a hammer and it's a perfect tool yeah it's perfect yep I mean there's bit different sized hammers you got a came in yep you got a Nile crocodile exactly right that is a very good analogy I'm gonna use that the next time that someone asks please do explain that because that's genius it's this is a hammer it's like they nailed it there's no reason to make another knife not your knives right sharp edge handle the bottom got it right it's exactly right now I love crocodilians I think they're just so interesting I don't know if I told you this story we when we were in my anmar we were retracing the ramree massacre you familiar with the ramree massacre no you'll love this so during World War two when the Japanese were holding ramree island in Burma Myanmar the Allies came in and started making the Japanese retreat in the course of like two days a thousand Japanese soldiers were eaten by crocodiles by saltwater crocodile yeah so they were retreated days days I mean some reports say it was over a couple weeks but the general consensus is a thousand soldiers were eaten by crocodiles in a very short amount of time and it was this kind of perfect storm of situations where because there are all these soldiers they were eating all the prey all the crocodiles were particularly hungry because of that did when the Allies pushed all the Japanese back into the swamps you know they started screaming and one scream would trigger all the others just like all the crocodiles to get into a frenzy and it just wiped out this entire populace of people that ran through the swamp so we went to retrace these steps to figure it out we're like why did this happen to try and understand it better and while we were there this kid got attacked by a crocodile that was a hundred years old so probably the same animal that had eaten people during World War one or one of them right and we we saved this kid's life like we got to the village and he had just been pulled out from this croc attack his arm was broken in like 25 places he was torn up he had lacerations all over his leg his ankle his arm and we should get him out of the girl's mouth we didn't so he fought off the crocodile basically and then the buddy he was with fishing pulled him into the boat and got him back to the village what a savage that kid is cut off a fucking crocodile and a big one how did he do it we don't know we were so focused on saving the kid because myself and one other guy had medical training so we were stopping the bleeding and bandaging him up and we had the only speedboat because we had to get to this island and this is very very remote so we got this kid on the speedboat and got him back to a hospital and he lived I think he lost the arm but you know he was just going to bleed out and die right there in the village a hundred-year-old crocodile there probably was one of the crocodiles that ate the Japanese people during the massive Ratan remark yeah god damn it my friend Jim shocky was in Africa and they had hired him to hunt crocodiles that were terrorizing this one village these people had fenced off this area where they could get water and clean and do deuce and crocodiles had figured out a way to get through that and and everyone in the village had like a bite mark or a missing hand the bite on their head like the so many people had lost loved ones and friends right while he was there a woman who was washing clothes got killed by a crocodile while he was in the village and these are Nile crocodiles right enormous you have a 20 foot long plus huge killing machines and these are you know I try and dispel anybody that says to me oh these animals were hunting people and I'm like no they were not crocodiles are do you know what I mean crocodiles will hunt human beings they will lock in outside of a small village or an area that someone's collecting water they'll spend weeks watching studying the pattern learning the behavior and just wait for the perfect time where they can sink under sit right there waiting for someone to gather water in my opinion they're not distinguishing that from another prey animal they just know this thing's coming to water here at this pattern and they will absolutely target people 100% they don't care if you're a person that's a weird thing about people we feel like we have some sort of a deal right well not really after you sharks aren't after people yeah yeah you have a treaty with sharks like are you talking about man you know like people have this weird thing about animals you know and you know when animals find out how easy we are to eat yeah then it becomes a real problem yeah I mean Lions of Tsavo right those famous clients they were they were smart people it goes to the dark that's a great movie fantastic movie yeah people they knew that people were easy prey and they're like cool we're gonna keep eating him once they get a few meals like not bad fucking really easy to catch yeah the opposite of fast food with like muscles growing on the beach yeah yeah there's you know about the Sunderbans in India yes that's a crazy place crazy I I did a bit about that in my act as well about in 2009 my Comedy Central special we're over a period of 200 years they think somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 people have been killed by Tigers in the sinaitic bands isn't that nuts I mean it's just like that that number it's all its unfathomable there was a story that I talked about in my in that set where there was a boat filled with five guys and one tiger swam out to the boat killed a guy dragged his body to shore jumped back in the water swam out to the boat killed another guy did it with three different guys until he got tired of killing people that's insane killed three people in a boat of five so there's two guys lost three install shit in their pants they swim yeah oh yeah this is crazy and what's crazy about the sunder Barnes too is there's saltwater crocodiles there's Tigers there's bear I mean there's the elephants yeah there's Asiatic Sun bear there it's just like it's just got it's this crazy little habitat and I know a couple photographers that have been in there and they're like you don't see anything it's like huge tall Tufts of grass you know everything can hide perfectly and it's all there and you just don't see it coming oh fuck and bunch of people that are living in these huts and yes villages they have no protection but you said something earlier today about how your friend projected the wolf howl into the my friend that guy in that oh sorry that that weirdo the wolf expert but what I I love I find that those non-conflict mitigations are going be the wave of the future right using technology to come up with bio controls like a wolf growl to other wolves or you know an alarming sound or a smell that animals don't want to interfere because of territories I think that stuff's fascinating it is yeah I agree it really is interesting and I think one of the cool things about all this wildlife is that if we handle it correctly we can make sure that these things are sustainable and they stay around we can we can still be like just marvel at their presence yeah and and you know this it's it is possible to keep wolves here yeah it's possible to keep grizzly bears here it's possible to keep all these things here and we really really really really should because if you go back and taught me how amazing would it be if we could go back in time and see saber-tooth Tigers incredible to be able to see some of these animals you only see depictions of where you see skulls of you know they were caught in the La Brea Tar Pits or something like we have those things right now we hide now a lot of them and we can save them and we have the the knowledge the power the technology the tools the finance we have all the pieces of the puzzle to make it work well I think that's one of the really cool things about what you do is you you broadcast all this stuff and you let people know and you have a big signal and you show people all this cool stuff like that tortoise that you found or like all these other different animals and you let people know like this is this is interesting this is exciting this is and it's something that it's like it's in our DNA to be fascinated by other life-forms right and it's worth saving ya know like like we don't want to be sitting here you're our great-grandkids Joe sitting at the same table you know a hundred years from now going man imagine if we could have seen a grizzly bear yeah you know like we don't want that well we still have them here in California it's in our state flag it's in our flag the golden grizzly yeah but there's not a single one left now there's they killed all those fuckers yeah possibly I don't want to get down a weird rabbit hole here possibly in Mexico the silver is easily bear in the high high Mexican Sierras what's ongoing reports of Grizzlies so the same species that would have been here right that hung out in the Sierras traveling all the way down into the Sierra Madres of Mexico and then in these what they call sky islands if you're familiar with that term I'll explain in a second these islands of isolated habitat up in the sky where they get more rainfall and everything else there's there's big tracts of private land down there in Mexico where a couple of these farmers are like something's killing my cattle and it's not a mountain lion and it could potentially be like half a dozen Mexican grizzly bears couldn't be getting Jaguars though could be but they're saying it's not cats there's like reported sightings of seeing bears real and if you look up the Mexican grizzly bear you know is declared extinct 20 years before the another one was killed so like now they're gone they're declared extinct than 20 years later some guy shoots one Google Mexican grizzly bear I need to see this so which set I'm trying to find something like this just shows pictures of grizzly bears if so you can add the word silver my silver do they think it's just the fur color oh they have like a silvery color to them like hard to tell what those are real stuff that's in Chicago but they're from Mexico yeah so what year is this that's probably world fair time I don't know Wow 99 that says but take a look at winter the last one was killed and then if you if you can find it see where it says they were extinct and it's many many years later parade of some sort whoa look at that fucker 1960 nineteen sixties yeah interesting so it might be possible that that thing is still alive somewhere there are reports floating in and I mean the 60s it's not long ago right so you know there's reports that on these giant tracts of private land up in these mountains there's potentially a very small population of Mexican grizzly bears Wow which I think's fascinating and it's one of those things that I don't think it's like so crazy I don't think anybody's gone and looked you know what I mean like if some rancher who owns half a million acres in Mexico is like yeah I've got a bear killing my cows it's like sure you do right but maybe he does like who's gone to investigate up in the high mountain peak areas of this million acre ranch well there's not supposed to be grizzly bears in Colorado but my friend Adam Greentree who is a very experienced outdoorsman he was hunting in the San Juan Mountains and he got a grizzly bear filmed Noah on camera he's looking at it through a scope and he documented it on his Instagram page and he's like that is a fucking grizzly Wow there's a and there's sightings of them from the path that was when he was getting chased by one but that was in I believe that was in either Idaho or Wyoming places were they're known about grizzly bears his sighting of this is when he's like he's holding up a gun and a female kept bluff charge him see her standing there in the background oh yeah she's not happy not happy fuck his gun not right it wasn't no his gun he had the wrong caliber bullet and his gun so it didn't really load all the way into the pistol and he didn't know that until after this altercation so even if he had like pulled the trigger nothing what happened right no bueno but she bluffed charged him she got within like 30 feet a couple of times yeah did I uh did I show you that that lion that we were extracting DNA from and Zimbabwe did I tell you about this I don't think so dude this was pretty nuts so in late last year I was tracking this giant lion that this friend of mine had told me that he'd seen in this in Limpopo Valley of Zimbabwe like just north of the south african border and we surmised that there was a potential that this animal because it was so big it had such unique behavior in the fact that it was hunting Buffalo and even even juvenile elephants might have remnant Cape lion DNA in it because the Cape lion was his extinct subspecies of African lion it was bigger than your regular lion and they would follow the elephant migrations north and then back south but generally they hung out in South Africa anyway long story short we wanted to test the DNA of this lion to see if it had any Cape lined DNA in it and it was this one individual animal so we tracked it for over a week hung bait every night you know did the collars did everything that you do to get a lion in and then finally this massive black Maine lion came in and I darted it from about thirty feet away from a block yeah 30 feet but wait it gets worse I was in a blind so I felt kind of safe right but when I hit it I had dosed four and it wasn't even me we had a vet with us he had dosed for a regular-sized African lion so the animal takes off running as we hit in the head in the back recorders we should you know trot after it on foot looking for it and we get up to it we're like oh he's down okay time to do our work up and I start walking up to it to check it as you do when you've tranked an animal I get Joe from me to that to that television the big one right there and it pops up is like hello it's not all the way asleep and I just dropped to the ground and just go dude just go limp right because I'm like crap this is he's gonna come and kill me and fortunately he was drugged up enough even though he wasn't asleep to just kind of like not know where I was and like didn't really charge but growled and came forward a step or two and then kind of turned turned off and laid back down again there we got another track into him and he went to sleep but it was really scary how big was he I think there's a did you want to show them the picture on my on my page huge I mean I don't know lion weights or points or you know any of the hunting stats but but unusually large oh yeah biggest one I've ever seen and I grew up they're huge did you get the DNA and did they run the test we did and there was a 14% discrepancy no it's not this is the tortoise actually oh yeah why they're earning that no I think this is just an ad and I just sorry I just used the line and scrolled down a little ways keep going down you got a fucking awesome Instagram so cool you got so much cool imagery yeah that's a little fur yeah it's further down I'm sorry I don't mean to make no worries but it was huge I mean it was it was just you you'll find it it's down if he says there was a 14% discrepancy between it and regular South African lion DNA so there's something off so there's something off so we couldn't quite figure out what it was we drew blood we took hair clippings and the latest is you know it's not again I'm not a geneticist but the latest is that sample has been sent down to South Africa to run against Cape Line DNA to try and figure out what the discrepancy is but yeah there was a discrepancy so there is something unique and unusual definitely something unique and unusual got it there no it's uh let me see if I can find it but um how long ago do you think this image would be what do you mean like a year ago yeah no it shouldn't be that long ago she'd be just a couple weeks ago because it only came came on a couple weeks ago let's see if I can find it quickly it's a big big animal and I've got on my phone otherwise I know this is boring for no you ever saw that it's just this massive lion and to have him charge me on foot it was pretty terrifying so you're talking about something that's twice the size of a normal one I would say like one yeah yeah twenty-five to fifty percent larger I mean the paws were just it's just yeah I'll show you on my phone I can send it to you guys but it's just huge huge okay a black mane unbelievable animal we'll get you to airdrop it to Jamie sure if you got the image yeah I got it here sorry Jane maybe maybe I didn't end up putting actually yeah that's the first line I see yeah yeah sorry about that you might not put it on Instagram is that even possible in this day and age well you have so much cool shit on Instagram you probably forgot I I did lose track yeah I mean your Instagram is just all like crocodiles so much so much wildlife it is it's lots of fun here we go I got it here where did you eat that food that you sent me you sent me a picture of some delicious elk that you were eating dude so the elk came from remember we're talking about hex technology those hex guys are friends of mine that created that technology and I've been I've tested in the field I'm wearing it in these lion photos and you're good Jim I'll just give that to you whatever you like explain to people well hex I actually use that when I hunt now - particularly inland I guess ish so it's a screen that keeps animals from recognizing your magnetic signal right exactly right you think a 100 percent thing that's real I completely believe in it especially for certain species sharks birds that are know included water and water it's like almost a hundred percent yeah and you can measure it right like you get a meter that that bought that measures the body's electrical impulse put hex on and run your arm over it Ryan eater doesn't move but what is it what is the mechanism I go oh my god so that's when he's tranked yeah so that's it see the darn is back oh that's just a picture of a picture but that's this time he pops up when we go to China my god dude he's so big huge huge and there's some pictures you'll see in a second of him on the ground when we're doing the workup is that him right there yeah putting a collar on him Jack I mean just a massive massive animal do you guys know the size of his sack yeah he's hung Jesus guys know how old he is um we didn't actually look into that I'm not sure I'd be fascinated by that yeah so this was crazy but keep us informed on yeah that discrepancy turns out to be yeah it's fascinating you know that work takes a long time and it travels around but we've got the sample which was the main objective so there used to be a North American lion that was even larger than the African lion significantly yeah yeah significantly crazy yeah and that was not that long ago right like when the last 15 thousand years ago or something like that I believe it was definitely coexisted with human beings fuck yeah we had lions yep huge ones yeah and big Plains game and everything else but um oh shoot so the head yeah so the the Stu anyway the hex guys gave me some elk you know that they had got and hex is that that technology that blocks the bodies naturally-occurring electrical energy and they got giving me some elk and we were on that foraging trip where I brought those poor Chinese from for you yes and we picked porcini and chanterelles and we had a cauliflower mushroom and we just made this amazing stew and I was like Joe's the only person I know I would appreciate this as much as I do are you you're headed back to Santa Barbara tonight uh-huh I've silk for you I'll take you up on it any day Eiffel thank you well listen man we just did three hours yeah it's really three thirty-five no idea time flies again 30 ish minutes I know yeah I really appreciate you man I appreciate all the stuff you're doing appreciate your your social media and tell people again about your show yes extinct you're alive on Animal Planet Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m. we travel the world searching for animals wrongfully deemed extinct and we're pretty damn successful that's amazing bankrupt thank you appreciate you man thanks you bye everybody and that was I had no idea [Music]
