and we're live hey what's up hey thanks for having me on this blog so my pleasure good to see you again to say you you know when we first met I knew you were an author and I knew that Chris Pratt was involved and doing that thing with you and that you guys were working towards making it which is happening now very exciting but I'd never read into your work until now so getting ready for this I actually listened to the audiobook which is really well done the guy who reads it what is his name ray Porter he's fucking great yeah he's a little disturbing he doesn't girl's voice but no getting around that guy's doing a girl voice especially put an accent to it there's like no getting around the creates a little weird but you you take he's so good at like Russian accents and then South African accents and it's a really good book man it's fucking riveting like kids thank you it's hard to put down it's it's really good and most of it I listen to either on workouts walking hikes with the dog or in the sauna nice perfect let's do it I burned through it in a few days it's really good man yeah do you know like half the characters are the one people that were inspired by actual I know that was crazies like so many people whether it was you know John Dudley or barklow or you know half face blades like black rifle coffee icon 4x4 there's so many different things Sitka yeah so many different things that rage not me not to talk about gear just cuz I was a gear guy before I went the Navy and then of course in the SEAL Teams you're like you that's your time to shine and to like go down these rabbit holes and try to make the gear better or anything that's gonna make you more effective and efficient on the battlefield so he really gets it go all-in and then just after the military same thing I'm just a gear guy so it'd be strange just to say he pulled out a rifle you know or something like that I couldn't do it I just wouldn't sit right when you were in the SEAL team did you think you were ever going to become an author is something that you had always had in the back your head you would like to dabble in someday like yeah yeah it wasn't even a thing I was gonna dabble in it was I was going to do it and since I was little kid my mom is librarian so I grew up surrounded by books and this love of reading from a very early age and back then like so early 80s there totally anything written about seals about what there is is a lot of times from fiction so tagging us in different stories by guys like Tom Clancy David Morelle Nelson DeMille H a quenelle all these guys in the 80s go ahead protagonists with backgrounds I wanted to have in real life one day and I enjoyed reading them so much I knew that after the military then I would write so I just said wow the path so you had kind of mapped it out join the military first join the seals and then after you retire then and and how many years were you in for about 20 you were in for two and then during that time you would always mapped out that you were going to be an author when you were done yep yeah Britany thought me whitewall I was and I wasn't writing I wasn't practicing but I was reading so I'm first I'm a fan I'm always a reader both fiction and non so all those guys I read in the 80s those are like my professors in the art of storytelling and then I coupled that with the academic study of warfare terrorism insurgency counterinsurgencies and then the practical application from Afghanistan from Iraq and then it all kind of came together at the right time in place as I was getting out so for that last like year year and a half then I started writing because I wasn't taking guys downrange anymore my job was essentially to get out of the military and because it's you feel like you're the first person to do it even though people do it everyday but you walk in you need to get something sign or go to a meeting or gets read out of a secret program or what a medical or dental so your job becomes to get out of this gigantic bureaucracy so dirty that takes like a year I mean you can really do it really like Jocko didn't do any of it matters day he's just like no you know yeah I didn't do these transition classes you're supposed to do and you sit there in these rooms and people drone on and on about transition and options for you and you're awful horrible but but I did it I thought you had to is I get something side and off you go but you don't have to do it I think you do just Ronco didn't think that's what he told me he's like no I didn't lose gonna tell him to do it right no one's gonna say you have to do this good luck yeah so so you were planning all along too right and so during that time while you were being deployed and while you're you know you're being a seal in the back of your head that was always a part of the plan yeah that was when I'm done with this then I'll that so I wasn't thinking about how to set it up but no anyone in publishing didn't know anything but I knew that one day that's what I would do and it wasn't even a question but you clearly had equal enthusiasm for being a seal as well yes oh yeah you have that's why they had to be separate so I had to be 100% all-in on being a seal because you have to that's what you owe the guys under your command when you're going downrange that's what you owe their families the country the mission but when I got home from that last Iraq deployment and took a breath and looked around and saw my family needs me I've been gone for quite some time even when your training come your training you're out for three weeks here two weeks there a month they're getting ready to deploy so it's not just the six to seven month deployment it's all that time spent training up to go downrange with your team so I knew that my family needed me it's time to get out so it was very clear wasn't a hard decision I mean beside I'd gotten to the end of my time where I would tactically lead guys on the battlefield so that's a troop commander so that's where jakka was when he did his last deployment as a troop commander isn't o4 which is a major and the other services a lieutenant commander in the Navy and after that yeah you're still a leader but you're leading from behind essentially or then tactical operations center you're more of a manager type leader you're not out there kicking doors with the guys which is what we all come in to do where most of us come in to do anyway so I knew that that part of my life was over it was time to transition take care of the family so it's time to start writing did you take journalism classes or writing classes or nope is all the reading all that reading I did growing up and my mom introduced me to a guy named Joseph Campbell back in nature so he did a series of interviews with Bill Moyers on PBS called the power of myth and he wrote a book called hero with a thousand faces so back in 1988 so I'm I don't know 11 years old or whatever 12 I get introduced to him and I read that book and I watched all those interviews and I read the book that came out called the power of myth based on those interviews and I think I applied that paradigm that model of the hero's journey the monolith to really everything every movie I watched every series I watched every book I read from then on and that really helped as I made the transition because I had this foundation it wasn't just like I woke up one day and said you know what can you make money at writing oh that sounds like a good thing to do I'll go back and read and I'll go back and see kind of figure out the history of the genre no I already have that figured out because I did it in my whole life and it was that foundation that was already there and while I was in the military I kept reading for fun I read those fiction books still and I've discovered Stephen hunter and Brad Thor and Vince Flynn and Daniel Silva and and now Marc granny today so those are kind of the bigger names in the genre and but then I was also studying studying all that nonfiction stuff trying to stay up on my game to make might make the best decisions I possibly could under fire for the guys when it mattered so I'm just always studying always reading when I was downrange I never really watched a movie or played video games it was always if I wasn't out operating it we weren't putting together a target package I was reading that's interesting because I would think that most people that would venture and become a professional novelist they would have some sort of background in writing like some sort of education some classical education English literature or something ya know is all reading it was all what I liked no one what I didn't like and that's why the first novel is really all about revenge because that theme resonated with me obviously it's resonated with people from the beginning of time from telling those stories around campfires usually told in a way to pass on some sort of a lesson about something to the next generation so they don't have to learn the same lessons in blood but they're told as a story and passed down that way and I think that's that's why there's so many Deathwish movies because you can't if someone cuts me off in traffic you can't go on to something or someone you know work there's some politics you don't get the promotion over that read get mad you can't do anything about it but you can in the pages of a novel you can escape there or you can escape in the movie theater and you can see somebody that goes out and guess it's revenge and it makes you feel good because you know you can't do it coz in real life if you do it you're gonna go to jail you get the death penalty it's not possible but you can do it and if you can explore all that in the pages of a fictional thriller so I think it's why it resonates with with people and then in this particular case I got to take the emotions and feelings behind things I was involved in downrange and then just apply them to a fictional narrative so I didn't have to talk to somebody and say hey did it feel to be a sniper in Ramadi in 2005-2006 and then filter that through whatever biases I had or whatever Mike's past experience or whatever and then put it into a fictional narrative no I just took my experience and then just morphed it and put it into the narrative so it ended up being very therapeutic so did you approach an agent first like how did you get started thank goodness I didn't know you're supposed to do that because I probably still be looking for one today so I did very little research on that front because I think that a lot of people can study how to do something too much or too long it's gonna be different for everybody but you know some people can study how to do something their whole life and never actually do it because you only have certain amount of bandwidth and for me I read so Steven Pressfield who's become a great friend now he was on this show a while back you look so great it rotates a fire I'll let you two back advance the Afghan campaign and then has those series of books on creativity the war of art yeah just you gave that out to people right for a while I got a stack of them the days to keep it the studio yeah so he's uh he's amazing actually listening to him on this show before I started writing gave me the idea of writing a one-word theme down to keep me on on point so I wrote revenge for that first novel on a yellow sticky but he didn't really say this on your show he's talking about somebody else who a playwright who would write a sentence to keep him on theme but somehow through my filters I heard him say a one word theme on a yellow sticky on my computer and so I did the same thing so wasn't it's not really what he said on the show but I took it as what he said and I wrote him down and that really for the first book revenge second book redemption and then fourth book I'm or third book I morphed a little bit dark side a man but so those are the themes that really kept me on track but and you're on the fourth one right now you're on the fourth one yeah how long does it take you to do one the first one can take as long as you want because you have to have for fiction you have to have the finished product so for nonfiction you can sell like an idea a chapter and outline something like that we're coming from sports or politics you know you can sell that idea because they know they're gonna get some sales for this you have to have the whole manuscript done so the first one took about just shy of two years and you get it as good as you can possibly get it then what you're supposed to do is go to an agent but I didn't know that thank goodness because I didn't do it I did that research I talked about with steven pressfield's books on creativity war of art authentic swing turning pro do the work read those read Stephen King's on writing David's grill yeah Stephen King's book it's not a biography really it's not just about writing yeah it is his entire life David morels the sucessful novelist I think those were those are the main ones that I had that I read and then I was like okay got it and I put those within sight of me in my computer but I didn't touch him again and I but they were there so I would look to them for inspiration as far as Stephen hunter says your professor sorry Stephen Pressfield says you're a professional you're a writer you sit down and write the writer's block doesn't exist because it doesn't exist for dentists or truckers or doctors yeah I get doctors block so you don't get writer's block you're professional and you're right so just having them that close really helped with that transition and I made the decision to now once I was a seal and now I write so I think that really helped but I didn't know you needed you needed an agent and thank goodness I didn't because otherwise like I said it'd still be looking for one because those are the gatekeepers essentially a name assistants that we've engaged to them so it's it's tough I think but lucky for me a friend of mine sat next to a guy named Brad Thor who writes in the genre as a character called Scott Horvath who's a former SEAL and he's a great guy my friend sat next to him at one of these events fort raise money for a seal Foundation type thing and as I'm writing I'm about four months in and my buddy says hey you know this guy named Brad Thor and I said well yeah I don't know him but I read all this stuff and he said you want to talk to him I know you write in a book and I said yeah I'd love to talk to him that'd be what he talked to me and he said yeah I'll set it up helped him out with a couple things on in his books so sure enough he sets it up and actually I'm up at your event in LA at the time I was trying to find a quiet place to have this call with Brad Thor so I go to the parking lot at the Terranea Resort parking lot up there sun's beating down and my old my land cruiser so everything's off though the engines off cause it's so loud and and I thought my paper there I'm sweating but sure enough we have this great call and and I was like a job interview I think he wanted to know like hey why do you want to write and I told him the same stuff I'd tell you or tell everybody that I grew up loving reading and knew I was going to do this one day and about my mom being a librarian and knowing the history of the genre and all that and just being excited about it he could sense the passion and he's like alright so if you write a book what I can do for you your friend told me some things you did in the SEAL Teams and as a thank you for that I'll let my publisher know what's coming I can't guarantee they'll open the package can't guarantee they'll read one word definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it but as a thank you I can let them know what's coming and I said that's all I need and he said how long till you're done I said one year from today and so he's like all right don't call me chapters your first book how did you know one year from today you'd be done because I was because other guys that have serious characters have one book a year and so I figured that's about four months into it so I was like I give or take a couple months so sure enough I I called them back one year from the day and he's like but he said hey don't don't call me don't send me chapters I'm not gonna give you any advice and he did give me some advice on that call but he didn't bugging him throughout the year right which I totally understand now and call them back a year from then said it's done and to his credit it was so awesome he said is it done or is it the best you can possibly make it and I said well I could probably edit it a little bit but it's finished and he's like all right call me back again you can possibly do so I took another four months of reading it and editing it sending it to a couple friends and and call them back four months later and said this is the best I can possibly get it he said all right I'll let them know it's coming so how many hours a day do you think you were putting in gosh so it's not like hours I mean I would love to get on a discipline type schedule like a Jocko type schedule someday but I'm not quite there yet especially at this stage where I'm still feel life so feel like this is a startup and I can't say no to a lot of things I need to take advantage of emerging opportunities just like I would on the battlefield looking at the enemy they're learning from us we're learning from them and it's really who would apps quicker you're looking for those emerging opportunities taking advantage of momentum looking for gaps so the same things that you would do for a startup or starting like a coffee shop somewhere you have to do for writing and I didn't really get that at the outs like how so so I did you you're not just writing and sending it to New York which is what I thought up until about the time I've published the first one I thought you just went back and forth with an editor a little bit and then you start the next book well really you have to do advertising branding co-branding your marketing stuff your budgets your social like anything you would have to do with any other business that you're starting out you have to do as an author so so I kind of treated it as a startup and starting it like just like you're starting something in your garage and you're hungry and you're passionate and you're seeing an opportunity here or there you're and you just want to build this readership and let people know that you have this character and see where it goes so so it's been a sprint so point being at some point I think you get to a stage where you can say no and you don't have to sprint off in all these different directions almost at the same time and you can say okay you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna wake up I'm gonna write for four hours and it doesn't matter if someone calls for an interview or if CNN once you want or Fox News once you want doesn't matter I'm just gonna do my four hours and then after that then I'll check my text then I'll check my emails and if something comes up yeah we can schedule it out and later later in the week but right now it's just like oh really Fox wants me on BAM and then all of a sudden no I'm not writing for those four hours usually it's the first novel and these then is all the others we're really done between 10:00 at night and about 4:00 in the morning because that's the time it was quiet in our house with three kids dog wife yeah that's how you stand up to the same thing when everyone's asleep best work because there's no one interrupting does that feel like they can't work like that and they only work good if they get up in the morning and then right immediately they're right even before breakfast so I was getting up and working out like that until I've been till the publication of the first book and then things got a little crazy the publicity stuff and listening stuff and then writing late at night also working on the next one dialing that in and then you're editing one while you're writing another book a year type program that's what you're that's what you're doing and maybe I'll get past that at some point I'll have us end date and then I'll start the next one but right now it's not not quite like that yet so my mornings were taken up with getting up early and not anymore I need to get back after it but in Park City where we live there's some crazy in shape people out there yeah I happen to know a couple of them so as soon as we moved out there after the Navy they're like hey come come we gotta go work out it's 5:30 in the morning and I know Jacques has been up for two hours already but for me that's pretty good Joe waking up at 5:00 getting down there and doing these crazy trail runs CrossFit stuff in the pool do all sorts of crazy stuff that these guys put together and it's like five or six CrossFit workouts meshed into one with trail running with the endurance side and yeah what group are you in with that's doing this is it a local gym or yeah we go we meet at the local gym but Hobie darling was the CEO of Skullcandy he's like all into human performance at all levels emotional physical mental spiritual like being the best like human he can possibly be yeah you love them like and those guys are all out there they're all out there yeah yeah and Eric Schneider is another another guy big his defender 110 is used in some of my videos he's a big defender guy but those guys are animals they are animals and get up with them work out get home get the kids to school so I had a schedule like that for a little bit but then it all became hey when you're working till 4:00 in the morning and getting up an hour and a half later that's a little much yeah yeah yeah that's that's always been a problem with comedy because you have to go late you're the you're testing stuff out and then you're home and maybe I do get home and then you're right it's home yeah but then after you after you test it out something at the comedy club you come home and make those notes yeah well luckily now the weight now we can't do shit but when this crisis the Cova thing wasn't going on what I would do is I would record my sets on my iPhone and then on the way home I would listen to this set and then when I got home either I would listen to it more I would write you know sometimes I'd listen to it more and then take notes and then write and try to adjust or just write on completely different subjects okay but I just got to a schedule where the best writing I was doing was when no one was home because I'd be writing and then out here daddy or my wife would want to know something or you know someone else would need something or phones or drink it two o'clock in the morning no one's calling you exactly it's free you're you're free and then it's just quiet yes and also it's creepy something about the darkness is Creole icky of the the your thoughts are weirder yeah baby it was a real hard time to get up and do like I would do like 10:00 a.m. to get to class and when you're up at 4:00 and you crash and then try to get up six hours later or not even five hours later and then get to the gym a little bit of food in your stomach yeah it was too hard oh yeah you just listen to yours or you video I just listened but video is better I really need like Damon Wayans who's a hilarious comedian has a collection of every set that he's ever done since the 90s really yeah he films everything he brings a tripod and a fucking camera and he sets it up in the back of the room in films every set he does and then he edits it all himself on his computer I'm like no way that's nice level that is man do you ever look at is there like for people who aren't Amazon you can leave reviews of books are there like for comedy club or there of reviews of comics that go in there that's good you don't know ya can't okay it's it's all that scale right when you get to a certain number contacting you look down I'm at a place where I just I can't now it's like 9 million something Instagram followers or whatever the fuck it is it's like you can't you just post in your that yes and it's not good for you it's not good for you positive or negative like just you should know what you're doing get out of it yes sir for me I feel like I need to thank everybody at this point cuz I'm so fortunate that the books are resonating with people and really this whole thing's been at grassroots like it made this third book made the New York Times list and it made it without like a national news appearance with any of these other bigger things it was all great was hunters it was tactical shooting people it was readers that took a risk on a new author and then told a friend and then that person took a risk and told another friend that's also it's crazy and then these companies like black rifle coffee like those guys like you know veteran owned businesses or you know like Dudley like those guys that post it and II stomp like all those guys that held it up and said oh I love this but it's still grassroots yeah it's just like instead of around the water cooler at work it's modern yeah that's social I feel like I need to get on and say thank you so much I've really pretty because I do I feel so fortunate and I really want to thank everyone but I think I'm about at that stage do it any more I do a blanket thank you yeah I don't think that I'm not thankful that's not the case it's just for my own sanity oh yeah and I've seen people that do get really too into the comments and they lose their fucking mind it's not healthy oh yeah you can't do it I don't respond to anything negative if anything's like a little weird I do the block I'm sorry very and I treat it like if I owned a general store in small-town USA and I'm behind the counter I own the place somebody walks into they ask for directions some drunk comes in screaming the N word those people different yeah so so the guy who wants directions and doesn't want to buy anything I mean you're like you treat the hated here's the huge I get back the inter station so much right he has a good impression that he's there someone comes in was to buy a candy bar a six-pack or whatever you know you join him in the right direction any conversation so I treat it kind of like that like I treat people on social media the same way I would if I was interacting with them the way we are right here but just across the table at my my business local general store yeah I try to treat it like that but I'm about at that point where there's too many people coming into the store everybody yeah but but I still I'm so sincerely thankful for everyone that took a risk on me starting this out yeah well I can I can relate I understand where you're coming from and I I used to interact with people all the time online too but then it got to the point where I was like I see too many of my friends like getting mad about things or engaging back and forth and having these Twitter wars with people then I realized like the worst way to communicate ever yeah you can't you know it's just not a good it's it's also not it's just not a good effective way to express yourself with another human being if there's any sort of a dispute or disagreement about things like the best way to express yourself is in person yeah and I know you can't do that with everybody but it's just it's not you you only have so much time in the day it's not that it's not a smart way to value your time oh yeah yeah it's that bandwidth so I never worried about how hard it was to get out like I didn't worry about how hard it was to get into the SEAL Teams or get to get to buds all I knew that it was very hard and that for me that was enough so it can be done but people have done it before yeah and so even growing up even mid 80s I'm still doing like what today people would call CrossFit so I get on home school I'd run the hill by the house I'd go under the basketball hoop and then pull myself through you know these kind of pull up things you know we had a jungle gym in the backyard so I do some regular pull-ups there changed my grip but it should put a rope up in the backyard so I was doing that had my bow out so I just shoot for the heart heart heart rate and everything so I was doing all those things and then I was reading like sand in the art of archery and I was reading the nonfiction stuff on warfare and I was reading these those authors I talked about earlier that I John run writing in today so I was doing all that stuff and I wasn't focused on how hard it was oh maybe I'm not gonna make it am I good enough my poll I'm gonna get myself as good as I possibly can by doing all the things that I think I need to do and now you can type in like Navy SEAL workout program and you there's so many hard to pick which one back then there was nothing you know so I'm like well I see I see I'm running in the sand I've seen a couple pictures like that I see these guys in Vietnam with these guns and I'm like okay I've seen a couple movies okay what are you gonna do okay you gonna climb this tree you're gonna do this rope stuff do these hill sprints so I just did that and did you have like a program that you wrote out or just nope wing it nope just as many you can work out - yeah which is very similar to actually when I got to the SEAL Teams where it was pre CrossFit days and all that so you ran as far as you could as fast as you could in sand and then you came back and you lifted as heavy weights as you possibly could like that like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know 1980 encyclopedia of bodybuilding if that was the workout up until probably early 2000s so early 2000s what changed CrossFit came on the scene that was huge we adapted or adopted it fairly quickly because it seems great until things go wrong seems great until your joints start going or your back starts going yeah if I CrossFit I just kind of mean functional fitness in general I mean the actual actual program but but first yeah the program's came out and people would get on and say look look at this things this is new give it a shot with me it took a little bit of time but some guys jumped right on and and but really what it showed us and then right about that time also more kicks off and and all that and we realized okay you're at 10,000 feet in these mountains you have a rock on your radio guy you have an automatic weapon guy that has a ton of ammo then you're going you're hitting this compound and you're putting these ladders up and you're going through these windows and sometimes throw these spaces you have to get into to clear where people are hiding or they're hiding weapons so encyclopedia bodybuilding and running as far as you could as fast as you could in sand and that being all you did there probably better way so we're kind of forced into it essentially did they do any work where they're monitoring heart rate and checking recovery and you know and trying to keep you at a certain heart rate while you're working no they might now so I'm a little dated so I got out summer of 2016 and I know they were trying to modernize a lot of things as I was leaving for those last couple years but so it's possible they do now one things that they did to that incorporated a little technology was inhale week like when I went through with with handi they just pull you out of the surf and then they walk down the line I shined a flashlight in your eyes and they'd say okay this guy's on the verge of hypothermia he's about to die pull him out but then you have someone that looks totally fine and then that person would just collapsed as soon as like the doctor walked by so what they had people do is start to take these little RFID chips and swallow them and so they'd walk down that line and they'd hit you with like the zapper from Walmart and they'd get your core body temperature so it lasted curves out like two days until you passed it but for those first couple days that's how they did it so you have an RFID chip in your stomach and then you shit it out after two days yeah and so that's how they could tell with your temperature yep I don't know when they started doing that they did certainly didn't do it in 97 when when I went that's what they're gonna do with this fucking covet virus Shea baby they're gonna make you swallow an RFID chip in your put it under your skin I'm really worried about this tracking thing that they're trying to implement that they're talking about how South Korea is doing that they're giving up a little bit of personal liberty and freedom and I'm like you can kiss my ass they're giving up a little bit of privacy yeah like no no I'd rather wash my hands and stay home fuck off oh yeah they're not gonna give that back something thank you I don't know how many times they've actually given non-0 yeah there's no way once they have that kind of surveillance where they can monitor you they're tracking you okay so you can track everywhere you go and measure you versus all the other people that they know are infected did you come in contact with them this guy's got a recent test you don't like you need to get a recent test now you're registered okay now we're tracking you and everywhere you go you're gonna be tracked you're telling you when they come up with a vaccine they're gonna just drop that track and go hey go back to being completely free go back no chance no once they take those freedoms like you never laws were never Russians say never rarely taken off the books right every year we have people on talking about bills that they're sponsoring well are they getting rid of another one but add that one or you static like there's a book called the three felonies a day and it talks about how a guy wakes up and gets up in the morning goes to work comes home has dinner puts the kids to bed and unbeknownst to him during that day he has committed three felonies because there are so many laws on the books you can't even keep track the American Bar Association can't even tell you how many laws are on the books state local federal international ones that play in all sorts of different ordinances laws and you're breaking at least three of them a day to commit a felony it's a fascinating book and that they're not gonna give those back they're not gonna give those freedoms back I've read a really disturbing thing today and I'm not even sure if it's true so which we should find out right now Katie could you click did the CDC stop tracking flu deaths for this year because this is what I read and might have been some wacko right wing website that I was on you never know but I was like this can't be true because the real concern is that the CDC tracks flu and they find out that flu is lower or the same as kovat and why we making a big deal out of kovat and then you know people ride in the streets that's why people can't it's hard to tell who to trust as you see yeah to politicians and you see you don't trust either side and you see everyone trying to make a power grab and use this as a way to make power or hurt an opponent or whatever it is and even with yes DC DC you don't know there will health organization you obviously can't tell there you can't trust information coming out of other countries so people at home are just like what await what do I do safest thing to do is just to stay where I am yeah but you don't know who to trust it's so very hard it's very hard to figure out who trust in doctors are giving disparity on their website I'm seeing information updated as of last week April 18th for flu deaths for like it's on the CDC weekly flu surveillance and I mean it's all of the flu information not good so how many people have died this year from the flu I have to take three here to find that information on a second because the Cova deaths or what is it now 55,000 I think my father this country yeah I think it's more right maybe 60,000 now closing in on that yeah which is not a small number it's a lot of people but then you find out that that that's a bad year for the flu that's normal but obviously this year we've locked everybody down worldwide even and you know there's just there has to be a slower spread because of this quarantine eing and because the social distancing so your I would imagine you're getting far lower numbers than they would have gotten if everybody had just gone out into the streets oh yeah yeah no doubt about that but no doubt for for a flu and this is my understanding because in that fourth novel that I'm writing right now is deep into the study of infectious diseases perfect perfect times crazy and then how you weaponize those infectious diseases what the Japanese did prior to World War two in that space how they use them in World War two against the Chinese what happened to that data afterward after the war the Soviet program from the end of World War two up to the collapse what happened to that information and then our programs today from the end of World War two up to and continuing through today so I was I was keyed in to all that ahead of time and so it made me a little kind of hypersensitive to me as I've been talking to doctors people that had worked in that space doing my research but from obviously I'm not a doctor but from what I've studied the difference here is that the incubation period so for us so in the military go overseas and how we're fighting insurgents and what do they look like well they look like the people that aren't insurgents what does that car look like that's pulling up to this this checkpoint it looks like the one that didn't have a vbid in it or is that one looking a little low on the suspension so they're not in a uniform they're not driving a military-type vehicle so same with this it's like an insurgent that's adapted it's adapted to those other diseases and how we fought them and it's adapted by the incubation period by that nine days so a flu you get the flu you're down you know you shouldn't go into work if you show up at work someone's like bro go home you look like you look horrible get out of here I'm gonna infect everybody you don't know that with row 19 so you go out there for this nine days whatever it is and you're infecting people during that timeframe so it's like that insurgent that hides and once the punks the populace it's the same type of thing like if adapted SARS was different flu is different all these other ones have been different and that's the adaptation of this one is that you go out and you infect other people without knowing it so that's the difference between it and the flu so it's a hard thing to wrap your head around we just look at numbers but it but there is a difference in that flue you're staying home you're sick you know it's it's really in a lot of ways it's a perfect way to spread a virus because there's a there's a video game that my wife plays she used to play doesn't play anymore now that this is going down but it was a virus video game really you send a virus throughout the world and the the key is if you make your virus too strong it's a video game you play on your iPad or your phone if you make the virus too strong it kills people too quickly and then it doesn't spread so the way you get a virus everywhere is you have one that sits in your system for a little bit and it's just weak in the beginning and slowly spreads its way across the world and that's essentially what this is in a lot of ways but this is this one's so weird man I mean the Newsweek actually had a story yesterday saying that they think it came from a lab so now that that theory of whether or not it came from a laboratory I think I tweeted it I think I tweeted it so you can find it on my Twitter page where I was reading it yesterday okay Newsweek not really sensationalistic publication right when they're publishing something like that you gotta go hmm probably something to this and there's a lot of speculation I mean it's not so hard to imagine I mean you're talking about something that literally was a few blocks from the epicenter in Wuhan where they had that level 4 lab right so the deal is with like the video game your wife was playing and that the goal of that game it sounds like was to infect the world to kill the world but if that's not your if you have a goal and you want your country to survive then you don't want it to become to hit the city the country whatever geographic area you want to hit with a weaponized infectious disease you want it to burn out in that city so instead of going over and dropping bombs on it like like world war ii like fire bombing Dresden or whatever else or Tokyo and just destroying those cities well you know what after the war you can go in with an infectious disease and you know it's burnt out and there's no damage yeah but you don't want it to spread throughout the whole world and come back to your own country so when I first looked at this and I heard about Wuhan I heard that there was a let's say not a weapons lab maybe but maybe it's a weapons lab but at least a lab doing research in infectious diseases a couple miles from these wet markets where they're saying that this thing broke out there are cases in the former Soviet Union of them doing these this research into infectious diseases and weaponizing it and then having it get out because the protocols weren't followed or whatever else and kills a few people and they hush-hush it because it's a nineteen sixty something or nineteen seventy something so there is precedent and it wouldn't be beyond the beyond the pale to think that someone was doing some sort of research and it doesn't have to be weaponization it can just be there just studying this infectious disease not even weaponizing it and someone contracts it somehow in that lab and then brings it outside yeah that's the controversial theory so here's the thing the controversial experiments in wuhan lab suspected of starting the corona virus pandemic and says the case against a wuhan lab and so it says why the wuhan lab remains a suspect in the corona virus investigation I mean it's really likely that we never really will know right but they most certainly were working on viruses similar to this one right there the end of this article says there's another one called our ATG 13 which is very very similar to the SARS covert to one that we're experiencing now Oh terrific they share 96% of the same genetic yeah Wow it's thought to be the most similar to this SARS Cova to of any known virus the two share 96% of their genetic material that 4% gap would still be a formidable gap for animal passage research says Ralph barek virologist University North Carolina probably in bed with the Russians who collaborated with like when you found out that a Harvard guy got arrested that uh because he was taking money from Russia or excuse me taking money from China because he was doing something with them yeah I mean it's real spooky what's really spooky is the World Health Organization is essentially in bed with with China yeah and they're not giving us a hundred percent clear detailed information everything gets filtered down through the Chinese propaganda system oh sure very dangerous and they also were exceedingly know in the numbers right and we can't trust China but it seems like they were a little more prepared for this than we were with far as testing gas goes and all so if you're doing research there's a lab where you're doing research similar to this close by there there's a history of other countries maybe even China too of doing research into infectious diseases not following protocols that we would hear in the United States or not all as safe as they are shocker here in the United States what we're doing the same type of research then it gets out and then they just happen to have a lot of these kits ready to go for testing I don't know yeah well in 2018 they were actually cited for violating safety protocols at that same lab in 2018 so they were there were there was concerns about that area long before but what's really fucked up is the World Health Organization posted in January that according to China there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of this disease this is days after they knew for sure it was being transmitted from person to person so China has been deceptive about this from the very beginning and they think that if they were honest about it and that they they stopped everybody from leaving it could have covered they could have covered this in the point where it would have been 95 percent less I saw that yeah 95 percent less people would have gotten in fact just locked down on to deal with it there as much as you can anyway let the rest of the world know I mean looking back that seems like but you're dealing with China seems the worst it seems like the worst it does seem that way it's a perfect storm it seems like but the way they handled their own citizens when their citizens are testing positive there's this horrible video this family being dragged out by these people in hazmat suits and they're trying to resist these people are dragging them away because they tested positive oh yeah once again that government taking a little more control control and we're just giving it up and we give up so much and even before this obviously we gave up so much information about ourselves voluntarily we would let's say in the 50s 60s 70s 80s we never would have given up and now we're like Oh click accept and now BAM yeah awesome I can post a picture or whatever it is you know this is fun I can communicate with my friends we're very accustomed to clicking on those user agreements no one can figure them out those those those concern me and obviously we've given up a lot of our information in terms of data where we go the map information that kind of shit but this tracking thing really freaks me the fuck it really does because they're gonna find another reason why they should be able to track you once once they do it because of the virus and then it'll just be next year it'll be the flu you know they'll find reasons to keep fucking tracking you would be safe you like have you got not doing anything wrong what are you worried about listen as soon as someone says that yeah it's yeah you're a fool yeah antennas got to go up I don't understand you don't understand what this could mean look the fucking mayor of Los Angeles was paying people to rat people out for not finding social distance not following social social distancing rules oh yeah there was an article in the fuckin news newspaper were saying that normally snitches get shot I saw that video it's horrible do you know crazy it's just like like so for this third novel I went to Russia to do some research and I'd always wanted to go there I knew that for this third one the first one should go before after August you've written about Russia in your books I was in the process of writing it I was getting kind of closer to the end but I finished up edits gosh I wanna say giant this January so I've only read savage Sun is that I didn't read it and listen to it people get mad you say I guess but so savage Sun is the only one I've listened to did you talk about Russia and the other books in the second one I did it plays in and the geopolitics side so the first one is really very I wanted it to be very basic for visceral very primal right out of the gate because I knew that in New York Simon & Schuster all these big publishing houses they see thousands of these things a year so somebody needs to make this stand out and a lot of that was the the personal experience from Iraq and Afghanistan morphed into the novel to make it feel real personal and visceral so were to come out swing in with that novel of revenge without constraint so I'd I'd done that research essentially just as part of my life by going to Iraq going to Afghanistan all those sorts of things for the second one I knew it had to be different so I put in a lot of more that geopolitics of what's going on with Russia power struggles all this other to make it a little different side and when people saying oh he's just a one-trick pony he just picked up this revenge thing now he drops it in Africa drops it and in China drops it in Europe that's what had to be different had to continue that hero's journey in this story of violent Redemption but I went to Mozambique as part of it to do that research because I knew this is before I even had a publishing deal I knew that hey John Grisham he wrote a time to kill first and he couldn't give that book away and then he wrote the firm and that's the one that takes off with the movie with Tom Cruise then later then they go back and they publish a time to kill Matthew McConaughey makes the movie but if he'd stopped at a time to kill he probably still be practicing law somewhere in Memphis so I knew I was always gonna write to so off I went to Mozambique to do that research get that boots on the ground experience like I had in Iraq had in Afghanistan already for the first novel I had by living in San Diego knowing la knowing New York and really being able to incorporate what I'd done already but I hadn't been in Mozambique had to go there so put boots on the ground and everybody over there wanted to tell me the story of their country wanted to talk about the politics wanted to talk about Chinese influence in the region with mining operations both legal and illegal and the meat poaching that goes along to feed all the people in those mines how that's affecting the environment so they just couldn't stop them from talking it was great and then for this third one I thought it would be the same in Russia so I wanted to go to come check up and insula and do a hunt do a little fishing over there at the same time but it's all part of the research and you can for one month a year you can get to come shaaka peninsula from alaska so you don't have to go from here to Germany or London don't mind some for all of August so you get in one flight a day under shower one flight a week only in August only in August otherwise you have to go all the way around the world so it's better to fly to Anchorage then hop on a couple hour flight and next thing you know you're in Russia it's awesome but I thought it was gonna be the same I thought you know land I'll get to this remote backcountry place where we have these guides and all that and I'll be able to really and it's on the military installation because of the people guiding us I used to have some connection to the government so he has this hunting concession out there in the backcountry and I thought they'd all want to talk to me and then I realized very quickly that for most of Russian history if someone is asking you pointed questions that kind of you to ask if you're writing a political thriller you were not long for this world it was a firing squad gulag off to siberia whatever so they were very hesitant to talk to me and I left on my computers behind soon as I walked through customs I knew that I was gonna get everything sucked out of my phone and computer well I know who who sent things to me an email or text over the last 20 plus years that yeah so I just left all that behind brought a pen and paper but I was asking these questions and I you know I thought ho they couldn't here's my book you know they're gonna know I'm an author I'm just asking but no they were very standoffish and very suspicious of why I was asking these kind of questions but it all worked out I got some great stuff and got to weave that into the two the third one what kind of huntin did you in Russia so brown bear oh wow it was crazy what did brown bear taste like I tell you that I don't know because usually I follow not usually well yeah usually I follow the customs of the local people because I don't want to like show up and me kind of the ugly America and show well I'm better than you you don't write you know you don't eat this but I will this is what we do so I kind of adopt what the locals do and they don't eat the bear interesting I wonder why yeah I don't know it's just one of those things that they don't well a lot of times people I mean it marries amazed I had the best bear this year a black bear Brian call gave me some okay Oh incredible it was delicious it was so good I tell that's people and like shut the fuck up like my daughter got asked what's your favorite food she goes bear yeah and her friends like what amazing yeah like it's probably not really her favorite food I think she's probably trying to shock her friends I don't know that black bear that that Brian gave me is I mean it was canned so it was just sitting there for a while yeah so this canned thing so how did he make it you know so what do you boil it and it's in the yeah how are you Wayne Endicott from the bow rack up in Springfield Oregon gave me some canned deer meat and it was really good yeah but it's really bottled it's like bottled deer interesting and bottled dad had bottled deer before but I'll tell you bottled black bear and if this maybe it was eating no blueberries or whatever but it was and it sat on our counter for six months because my wife was like total archery challenge and yet Kim for the house we did a wild game dinner Trevor Thompson came over and so we open it up and it was everyone's favorite I wish we had more of it what were the ingredients behind besides just used to put a couple some spices in there of some sort but I don't know it didn't look like it you just open it up and look then you open it up a little can like glass like you would a bottle yeah like you went with a jam yeah same as the deer that I had it seems like one of those vacuum-sealed bottles it was awesome I wanna go down there get some more from him if he has any more if he's listening I'm gonna come down and get some of that because I was legit yeah my wife loved it she's like wow this Andy as soon as you opened it up and it hit the air it changed like it changed it didn't look like a smirky thing that was in the jar like it looked beautiful amazing we loved it it was great a breeze favorite it's awesome yeah that's a weird thing like bear actually tastes good people are so wrapped up in bears because of teddy bears they they have this distorted perception of what a bear is and people that have no problem eating cows have get mad at you if you eat a bear do you know how much nicer a cow is than a fucking bear no cows don't eat their young I don't think they eat their children though bill they kill other people's children and then the mutt while other bears children rather and then the month look when I was in Alberta my friend John and Jen the people who run the camp out there the rivets their son saw a male bear kill a cub and then the female bear chased the male bear away and then finished eating her cub its amazed he was eating her cub so she she ate her own cub right after she was defending it it becomes meat once they're dead yeah they're all cannibals it's crazy a lot of that stuff is interesting how people have will associate bears with well in humans I mean they do look when you skin them they do look a little like humans ward off that someone looks like a fucking bear when they're dead like you've done something awful with your body that's a big boy yourself but Steve Rinella calls it best he says that they're charismatic megafauna yeah and there's oh yeah there's something else that we have in our head that you're not supposed to eat and we also I think we connect bears to what you would call trophy hunting meaning like someone who hunts lions something is someone who hunts things you don't although mountain lion apparently is very good it's delicious I've heard this I've had friends it's like their favorite food yeah yeah don't events it was saying I've heard him here he's talking about was the best thing he's ever ever eaten yes yeah and I did my first one this year and it was amazing I don't mind I didn't eat it cuz the guide didn't really was like it was like a no-go same thing yeah the guy wouldn't let you eat it it was very clear to me that that was not something that was done there you know I shouldn't I should have pushed it in Utah so I Prai should have pushed it I could have well yeah you should I feel bad about it now it's hard to get a tag for them too so it's not like it's easy to get it Wednesday it was wild yeah that was amazing but the back back to that that the bear experience was incredible especially with someone who doesn't speak English like her over there with this guy who's uh that's really he was part of well in the military and then worked for the government and then is now people just listening you doing air quotes yeah so I really interstate but yeah got my bear and then but the craziest part was my friend who got his and he wounded it first by accident of course and that happens like we know and it goes off into this thick thick brush in the states because I went and did another hunt in Alaska this year like they won't let you go in after I wounded bear into the thick stuff like maybe some well but my from what I've gleaned they're gonna go in and do kind of like going in after a wounded lover or something in in Africa like good guides that's where the guys are gonna go earn it I'm going do that so this thing's wounded and they hand me this rusty side-by-side shotgun that's at the bottom of this boat that we're in this little tiny little boat that we're in on this river and the guy hands it to me and then hands me two shells I'm looking at this right thing and I'm having these two shells in my hand I'm like okay and I'm like no cuz yeah II had so a couple more Michael give me some more and I trained up for Africa do it the double rifle I went to FTW ranch in Texas to get really good with a double rifle because I wanted to do a cape buffalo hunt the same way someone would have done it a hundred years ago so no optic side by you know double rifle so it's a rifle but it looks like a shotgun hmm so there's two rounds two shots but you have two other ones ready to go and so you practice that FTW practice and they have charging animals that are coming in after you and you're just like you would in the military changing bags but this time you're getting two more in there and getting it back up so well I trained hard for that and so when he handed me this old rusty shotgun and I think someone said oh that was made in an ake a factory I was like okay I feel better about this because I've seen a lot of aks and I've seen a lot of them rusty and working so I'm like okay I'm gonna have trust my about to trust my life to this thing and it's rusty it's from a bottom of a boat and this guy doesn't even speak English so BAM here we go for so and I look at him just to make sure it's not like buckshot or something so I can see this load it's a slug it feels like the double rifle I trained up so hard with to go to Africa which was an amazing experience getting written now and better but and off we go in to the brush so it's like they wouldn't let you do this in in the States like you're going into this thing and it will wounded a huge bear brown bear and off you gone it's just me the guy to my friend and this thing it's all quiet and I haven't felt this dialed in since romário six like I was on and then BAM this thing rears up like Oh 15 yards away just like humans and I just span and boom shot him like I would a person just how big was he ended up being over ten feet yeah I'll show you a picture after this ten foot tall bears more than the size of the head and I forget how huge anyways I'll show you a picture after this so yeah I shot like it was a human that it goes it goes running off like I don't know 20 yards or something like that into some more thick stuff and then we hear a death Bell oh but before we heard the death bellow the guide in broken English was like I'm gonna go around the other side and I'm gonna scare him towards you and I'm like oh okay so I do I go around to the other side and I get down I'm like well if it charges out it's probably gonna be on at all legs and it's gonna come charging like this so I knelt down and then just got ready to to put one in if it's coming charging at me I'm trying to figure out okay face mouth right here he knows my first bear hunt so anyway it heard the death bellow after that damn it was it was huge it was crazy that is such a different kind of hunting when you're hunting something that absolutely could tear you apart oh yeah like you're made out of tissue paper oh yeah yeah no doubt I'll show you the pay it's crazy but what it would surprise me was how much it wasn't like Wild West over there we said oh can I can we get one nut get another bear it was very like no you had your tag just like you would in the States it was all science-based we need to take this many out for the population like it was just like the states which is a big business and people coming over there they don't want to deplete the resources right yeah they're smart but for some reason that surprised me I thought oh it's Russia cuz I've been to Russia before I've been to Moscow been to Ukraine dive into the catacombs for earlier in life and I wolf those into into the second novel but I just figured it would be kind of wild Westy kind of hike I remembered it over in Ukraine and Moscow back in the early 90s and but it wasn't it was all very much you have your tag no this is yours and and we're not going to deviate from that it's kind of interesting they wouldn't even entertain eating it yeah yeah and there's a language barrier there too so it's hard especially when you're dealing with people that are tough I mean they're living in these huts built into the ground essentially transportation just south of Siberia so come ChaCha's just south of Siberia but essentially the same same type of thing and so they're built these into these small hills for insulation so I mean they're out there Wow and it's it's it's a rough existence so when they say we're not doing something and they say it in a way with this Russian accent and there's really it's not really a let's talk about it right it's not know you would think that the most people would want meat more than anybody you know I mean you would think meat would be very valuable in a 10-foot bear you could feed so many goddamn people maybe that's why they told us we couldn't cuz they're keeping it I would definitely not yeah at least that's possible yeah but they've done a fish out there moose huge moose out there northern pike right yeah but well they have they might but we were after Dolly Varden and rainbow trout brown trout Oh some big ones out there so it was pretty crazy was a good trip and I got to weave that all that stuff in so I got so weave in some of the people that I met over there the snowmobiles they have over there have one skate in the front instead of the two yeah so they're going through this taiga this tundra so it's tightly as a so they're only watching one getting my route or something like that instead of the two so I got a lot of good stuff by going over there and I wouldn't have known what to ask I want to see the vehicles that they used over there it was very happy to see some Land Cruisers so that was pretty yeah but they had a whole bunch of other stuff too some Russian some crazy Russian stuff and I got to incorporate incorporate those vehicles into the novel as well so you really never know what you're gonna get until you get on the ground and talk to people build those relationships and then things ended up end up waking making their way into the stories have you ever seen that Werner Herzog documentary happy people life in the taiga no need to see that you need to see it I've seen it before I'm a book it's crazy it's really good it's and it's this amazing documentary about these people that live in the taiga in Russia and it shows them from being in the summertime all the way through into being in the wintertime and it just there are just hunters and gatherers and they're so happy it's really weird it's really where like there's no mental illness there's no suicide and everyone's just struggling I mean they're just ever there they're making their own skis they're making their own homes they're making their own I mean they have these cabins set up for trapping and they use snowmobiles and then they have dogs they have a very tight relationship with their dogs and they get fish and they get meat and then that is that was what the and they bring bread with them and the breads all frozen obviously so they have these loaves of bread they bring they store their cabins they have to bear proof everything but it's just their life is so compatible with being a human being it's like there's something about our human reward systems that have evolved over thousands and thousands of years that being a hunter-gatherer just completely locks in with all the things that keep you content and happy there's the documentary right awesome yeah very interesting the relationships with their dogs dogs over there were amazing everything their dogs are everything they have a huge very very tight relationship with their dogs that's incredibly have the dogs that we had in the camp they protected the camp from the Bears like that was the bear protection was these dogs that were specifically trained up to chase bears off yeah I think I called Alec he'd have to go back and look but absolutely incredible dogs they were amazing it's a really amazing documentary absolutely whatever yeah there's another really interesting documentary well not a documentary it's a Vice guide to travel where it's I think it's called hime I think his name's hi mo hi Mo's Arctic venture and it's a guy who got a job in Alaska in like the 1970s and he owns the he has like a lease to have a cabin out there in this very remote part of the Arctic yeah and and once he's dead like this is it like no one else can go back to the government yeah I don't think anybody else is gonna be allowed but it's it's another amazing documentary and he's a guy who's a really he's an American guy who's really articulate very interesting guy very intelligent guy who loves living like this and raised his family out there and is his wife is American Eskimo and is this a fucking amazing way of life I don't want to live I don't want to live like that I mean I like cities all cars I like all that stuff but there's something incredibly compelling about being completely reliant on nature and your own you know ingenuity and hard work and he was talking about it in this documentary where the the Vice people this is back when vice was you know just starting out to this vice guide to travel so one of their earlier series that they were doing on on YouTube it's it's really cool when you're seeing this guy who's this reporter who has no experience like this at all in to interacting with this guy and him explaining his life and why he lives like this and why it's so important to him and yeah I think maybe that's why people find their way back to nature in some way shape or form like you want a cabin somewhere or they they like going to the mountains that go in a big sky they like going to Park City that's the dream for people yeah but it's still nice to be able to you know drive in and go to the grocery store nice to go to a restaurant he's looking smart now exactly I might not even know what's going on but he doesn't even need to right yeah yeah people I think also this was a little bit of a wake-up call for people as far as how soft we've gotten generally as a people and I'll say from the end of World War 2 for those guys that came back and got back to work didn't complain and built this country into what it is today but since then we've gotten a little soft and they're like oh wait a second I maybe it would have been better had I had like a week of food or maybe I would have had you know maybe 20 to go do I have a gun in the house and I all we do it's in that safe and I haven't shot it in years or was gave to my dad gave it to me maybe I should learn how to maybe use it in case the police aren't there for me when I need him to where do we have fire extinguishers in the house do we know how to use them are those things expired the kids know how to use them like all those little types of questions once again gets back to bandwidth so if you're worried about that stuff you know you're not worried about how do you adapt your business how do you adapt having your family at home and moving forward here when maybe you don't have a job anymore you need to get creative so you're worried instead about oh how many beans are in the cat but instead if you had oh we have three and everybody's experience is gonna be different what they're comfortable with as far as their levels of preparedness and it's not only about being paranoid it's just allowing you to focus elsewhere if there's a natural disaster here in California like an earthquake you know other places you know tsunami or whatever whatever it is hurricanes whatever it allows you then to focus where you need to be focused and some people will be like three days of food and maybe a little water and do I need something to filter water with in case I turn on the tap and there's nothing comes out Brown so everybody's level is gonna be different but I think this was a wake-up call and I'm not super confident that people going forward will take those lessons and act on them because that's what's important most will slide right back into complacency unfortunately I think that you're that you're right yeah but it's funny Kim my wife was like ah now I see why we have all this stuff and you know it's not crazy stuff but it's just like I like being prepared about it's not just from being a seal it's from before that it had always been drawn to the outdoors and wanting to be prepared and know how to to live out there survive or whatever else I've just been it's always been a part of me so it was very natural for us to have a couple guns I was some ammo have some water have some food because when this hit you know what I did book was coming out and I had to figure out how to adapt very quickly to the changing environment and launch it in some heat was very important to do it in an appropriate way and do it as much good as I could at the same time my helping independent bookstores who have no foot traffic that sort of thing but very quickly I had to take that breath look around and adapt and I didn't have to worry about food or water or filtration systems or ammo or we already had that so I guess but all my effort into figuring out how to adapt to the changing conditions did you get a lot of questions from people like how do I get a gun yes a lot of California people some lines around the block in front of gun stores were hilarious they've didn't realize you can just walk in they've heard about this loophole wait how can I like where's that loophole that they keep talking about how do I just get one of these no I can't even loan you one because if I loan you won't you walk more than but 20 yards away or whatever now it's an illegal transfer a real firearm yes oh sorry I might have 300 of them but guess he's not getting any you because you didn't prepare and I don't want to be a felon well there's also so many people that were anti-gun that now want a gun I mean it is hilarious it's it's really interesting to see like this is where well people are protected and when society's want running great and we you know up until this pandemic at least we had a wonderful society I mean it's like huh I mean there are problems with every society there's it's certainly not perfect and there's certainly a lot of crime and certainly certainly there's things wrong but however it is absolutely the best time in history you have to be a human being and to be alive especially in this country it's so many people like why would you need a gun no one needs a gun the First Amendment's bullshit when you take all the guns now that the pandemic hits those same people are like oh okay now I get it there's not enough cops in the world to deal with riots if there's mass riots in the street and people are breaking into people's houses and the world becomes lawless because the economy has absolutely collapsed and people that were maybe like a little bit sketchy just go on to become a full-on criminal that is absolutely inside the realm of possibility and we need to recognize that and the people that were anti-gun there is I mean a great percentage of them now or saying to me like I either I want a gun or I get it or how do I get a gun or how do I train like I see those videos of you training how do you train with a gun where do you go how do you how to just start and all these questions what where do you hunt like the the Google search is on hunting must be through the roof I would think so I would think so because if you're worried about food like my friend went to the grocery store right after the big thing hit and everything was shut down he said all I could find was one package of ground beef yeah definitely worried about ya you're not over here man I got three commercials yeah I'll hook you up I'll give you I've been given a lot of my friends meat I love doing it I like there's all I ask send me a picture of your food Alessi want to see what looks like when you cook it yeah I mean this isn't the first time this is the first time that you've been somewhere else and you've been able to it's not LA riots and you're seeing the Korean shopkeepers defending their stores yeah it's not Katrina where you're hearing a few things about the police not maybe confiscating firearms there but then not for not being able to protect you right but you know if you live in you know Montana or maybe you're in upstate New York or whatever and you're seeing that on the news and then you go back to making your dinner and have them whatever it's not real now this one I think was real for more people for everybody yeah cuz the whole country's locked down even Montana which has a very low number of deaths and a very low number of infections still has statewide social distancing rules the mediator crew those guys are all doing their podcast from their homes remotely yes a different deal let's drove at home it did it drove home the vulnerability and I think this is a good dry run because this is and I don't want to disrespect anybody who's died or anybody who's got sick but this is not the worst pandemic the the world's ever experienced it's not it's it's it's not nearly as bad as like the 1918 Spanish flu which killed 50 million people worldwide so this is a smaller number still bad smaller number but this is a wake-up call that this kind of thing is a real possibility and then take this and then couple it with okay a terrorist attack or take this and couple it with a natural disaster now you have two things going on now you have a pandemic and now you have a huge earthquake here in California fires you have a tsunami whatever it is so you have have those things or civil unrest somewhere yeah so that's three things now choose one of the shoes any of those or maybe someones watching and this is a time because we're weak and you get hit with a cyber attack from somewhere now all of a sudden you're at home and your credit cards don't work how old this data has been gathered over the last 10 15 years on people credit card information I mean they're building in China all these huge fields of collect data huge learn drives essentially they collect data so now you're at home and you want to order from your Whole Foods delivers or whatever oh not working credit let's try this next one oh this one's not working now what you do so right there's also it can get worse it can get a lot worse and but being prepared it's just a little bit don't to get crazy but it'd be nice to prepare to defend your family for me as a husband father I feel that's my responsibility as a citizen that's my responsibility that's that's one of my jobs is to be able to prepare my family for their end and defend my family if need be so my my family might be maybe a little bit different but why spend a Thunder ranch up in Oregon training both pistols in a ours up there our daughters been hunting since she's seven you know she's very comfortable with firearms but it's just natural and I think it's just natural for us as people to want to protect that the greatest gift of life yeah not just ours but those that we love as well so I think it seemed like it was not inside the real world of problems that most people gonna have to deal with before this and now that they've seen like oh the the the actual structure of our civilization is very thin the the veil that keeps you from bad things happening it's very small and it's just we lived in this nice little Goldilocks zone where nothing was happening where there wasn't any pandemics there wasn't any state like besides 9/11 there's no real attacks on American soil other than that one day so you look at the United States over this long period of time you're like wow this is like the most amazing time ever to be alive and everything's going so great this is just how it's gonna be now forever and then something like this happens and people realize like oh and especially I feel terrible for the people that work hard every day and then their jobs taken away from them it's no fault of their own they're not lazy they're not drug addicts they're not they didn't gamble it all away one day they woke up and the world had changed and now they don't have food money it's tough it's talking hard and it's yeah it's also one of the well it's the other piece when we talk about being prepared it's the one that often gets overlooked when you're talking about preparedness is that financial so yeah so yeah and for everybody it's going to be gonna be different is it one month worth of bills is it too is it three that's what the experts say or whatever everyone's gonna be different but it's important I think going forward for people to realize if they weren't prepared financially for this that going forward they need to start putting a little bit away they need to talk to somebody about how they best can yes because things aren't always gonna be roses you're gonna face adversity in life and we're just like we're facing as a country now like yeah you're gonna face it in life as well it doesn't have to be a pandemic you could just lose your job or something could happen to a family member whatever it may be it doesn't need to be a pandemic or a terrorist attack or anything these global calamities it can just be you losing your job getting sick or whatever it may be so having that foundation of financial security hopefully that's one of those notes people are taking from this going forward so they can be better prepared not just friend of these calamities we're talking about but just for normal everyday life because yeah you're gonna get hit you're gonna get knocked down and you're gonna have to get up and keep moving forward and you know it's gonna help you with that it's not wasting bandwidth on figuring out where that now how you gonna pay that next bill because you're prepared a little bit I hope people also recognize that if you're in a dead-end job and you've been just playing it safe and then it got taken away from you because this pandemic and even though you played it safe and you did is this terrible job that sucks like you realize like maybe I should have chased my dream you know maybe there's a chance I mean like a guy like you who takes but I want to get back to this because we never really we never really finished how the book up you talked about how you wrote a bunch of tangents yeah we did go on tangent but that that your story is one of the great American success stories I mean that is the story the story is the guy has a dream or the woman has a dream whoever works hard and then one day figures out a way to make it happen that's it and that's what you did that's it you didn't I didn't that whole thing about just not worried about it not happening I can always not happen it's good to have contingency plans for Shore I had I didn't have any specific contingency plans but I I knew I was I was gonna be okay but you know when you sent it off I want to get to the I want to get a lot of things I want to ask you how you created reefs how you created these characters but when you sent it off like what does it feel like when you've spent a year and what eight months or something yeah year at four months first and then another four months to edit and then you like alright and you send it off what is that what is that feeling like it was awesome it was awesome yeah Coronado California I went to the UPS Store on on the Main Street they're called Orange Avenue and I wanted to get next day air tracking you know everything insurance whatever you could possibly do and show you so it's all perfect and what I found out from taking those notes in the car when I was talking to Brad Thor I found out how Emily Besler who is his editor who's Vince Flynn's editor who did the Mitch rap series who sadly passed away a few years ago but you read a book called term limits in the late 90s that really defined the modern political thriller so I knew the font that she liked I knew the spacing that she liked and also I made a space area like Ariel two and a half it's in my old it's in my old notes now it doesn't matter so much but back then I wanted to make it I wanted to do everything I possibly could to increase my chances of success or making her not just look at it and have anything even who is just psychological like oh it's in the wrong phone I don't you specifically like juice up the beginning chapter the first chapter just to make it very riveting yes Rober yepper absolutely yep you look because I knew what I liked and what I liked reading and I knew I liked sniper stuff and I had that background and I could weave all that in there and you know I didn't just say he's walking in shoes you know they're Salomon boots why because that's what I use downrange or you know eyes in sick of gear because well flame buddy John heart started sicker and also it would make him blend in to that environment so he's not dressed in military stuff in the beginning so I needed to do all these sorts of sorts of things were very natural to do and and get him to a place where the reader wants to turn the page right how do I make the reader want to turn to that next chapter and I want to keep them up at night how do I make them want to go through the entire night to finish this thing did you spend the most time on the first chapter because of that nope I think was all pretty very pretty much the same on every chapter I would say when you go back to edits is really where you spend I'm dialing it in and gosh I'm trying to member there weren't very many edits on the first one from New York I thought there was gonna be a ton but because maybe it was because I had that yellow sticky from listening to your show with Steven Pressfield I had that thing that said revenge I tied every single paragraph chapter whatever had it directly or more importantly indirectly tie back to that theme to keep the reader going same thing with the second one had to directly or indirectly tie back to Redemption somehow even if it was very subtle what was the key on savage Sun the dark side of man so it's explore is the the hunter versus hunted dynamic through the dark side of man so really finding out a is James Reese the protagonist is he a killer yeah is he a soldier what what is he is you a hunter or is he all three of these things so exploring that because a lot of us are drawn to these two these jobs were defending our country defending the guy right in left Homer downrange so why are we doing that is it because of his comfortable people have been doing this from the beginning of time they've been defending the tribe they've been picking up the same type of weapons to provide meals for that for that try they've been passing down lessons on how to hunt and how to defeat other tribes in battle to ensure the success and the continuation of their bloodline so why are we still doing that today is it all for God and country or is there something more and so that's what I was really exploring with with the other one but what the third one but but yeah the important thing is to get to the end of that chapter and to have the person want to turn the page and then look forward and also to establish a relationship with the character like I knew creating James ruse I wanted to be a likeable guy like I don't want people people don't want to spend time with someone they don't like that's like why would you do that so I wanted people to invest in this character to like him to want to sit down have a beer with him but also he needed to have that background the training the experience to be able to flip that switch when everything's taken away and essentially become the terrorist to become the insurgent that he'd been fighting for the last at that point sixteen years at war and used those tactics techniques and procedures that work so well against us from the enemy side in Iraq and Afghanistan and use those here on the homefront so it's a little it's more than just a story of revenge that first one it's really also about someone who comes home and brings the wars from Iraq and Afghanistan home to people who have been sending young men and women to their deaths for close to 20 years now so it's you can read it a couple of different levels depend on how much do you want how much how deep you want to go into it now when you sent it to her how long did it take before they respond almost immediately really yeah it was so cool so I sent it off I'm super excited I get I totally remember because after I put it after I mail that I'm industry walking back to the landcruiser and this crazy lady walks out into the street from around the corner and this nightgown and I'm like what's going on and she's like there's a there's a dead rat in my house can you help me I'm like what and it was right there like 50 feet away and I couldn't say no so I remember this vividly that I sent this off Senta had my lifetime dream I get it in the mail to emily Besler simon and schuster and off it goes and i'm taking that breath and i take a couple steps towards the car and this lady runs around the corner like you know and just frantic look in her eye and I'm like yeah I'll help you then so mine end of this house and it was like this hoarder house there was just stuff everywhere is crazy so I had to go to this top level this old like Victorian house and take this dead rat and take it down did you think you're gonna die in there imagine if you send out it was but anyway I just remember that distinctly because it was so odd but yes I'll send it off and then I didn't know what you don't know are they gonna call you back are they not are they gonna read one word of it and just say or I have an opening at all who knows but about to yes so I was about two weeks when I say immediately I mean like two weeks all right quick yeah pretty quick I get a call from from Brad Thor and Texas I'm gonna I just finish this hunt and I flew over the side of the road and he said hey you've been struck by lightning and I was like what he said yeah what year was this this is why I mailed it in November of 2016 so I got out of the military in July or June 2016 mailed it in November and then I heard back at early December Wow yeah it was crazy and yeah she said she loves it and she wants to publish it and later I found out that she called him because he's their political thriller guy and she's like hey you know I got check cards manuscript and I love it but coming you're our you're our guy what do you want me to do and he's like I want you to publish Jack and that was so cool so cool so he could have put the kibosh on it a few maybe I don't know maybe I don't know he's so great he's so awesome and one thing he told me when we first talked like I said he didn't he said don't call me throughout this next year when you're writing but what he did say is that the only difference between a published author and an unpublished author is that the published author never quit and so for me from buds and having that bell right there that's within sight of you during hell week we put it in the in the trailer hitch of these vehicles that follow you everywhere so you don't even have to run anywhere yourself like take a few steps and ring this thing and you're done so I really resonated with me because of that love that so Mike alright I can I can do this and and I always knew I could anyway because I had that background and had that foundation I knew I was gonna do and I it was I was so excited so anyway he told me that that next couple weeks later I mid-december I flew out of New York and we sit down I think she wanted to make sure that I wasn't a crazy person so actually after you read your books who the fuck is coming up with this shit good point in that first one will tell you that there's the first one there's like in this third one if you've got to the torture scene yet well there's something similar read the whole book and I went through the whole tortures through the torture scene yeah so there's that one and then the second one there's another torture scene and then in this other the first one there's one that I got from The Shining Path guerrilla movement in South America and what they used to do is and they got it from somewhere too but they'd essentially eviscerate you while you're alive and make you walk around a tree so your intestines are now wrapped around this tree and then the jungle eats you alive yeah it's crazy so I was worried that might be a little off-putting to somebody in New York and publishing but later I found out that that's like everyone's favorite chapter from the book especially people you wouldn't expect like librarians and like it did people absolutely love it but what I guess in New York and I'm little like now I'm like okay I've really made a good impression so I'll bring a suit and I've never had to do this before so I heard of people you hang it in the bathroom and you let the steam get to it to get the wrinkles out of the suit so I do that and I'm getting ready and then I go to put the suit on it's soaking wet it's December it's New York it's freezing I don't have like kote like other people in New York have or scarves or whatever they wear and so I put this thing on and I walk I'm like soaking wet and I have to walk to this coffee place and by the time I get there I'm like a sheet of ice and I get there make sure I'm there an hour early and I gave the guy like 40 bucks or something to try to wait for a table to be ready there was a little more private than the other tables in the coffee shop and so when we go I sit down waiting I asked her what her favorite coffee is ahead of time boom you know she shows up sit down with a great conversation for about 45 minutes to an hour and she said I want this thing but you know you need an agent and I was like what once he negotiate yeah like the Pressfield thing didn't say that in there and when I was learning about the war of art and the resistance and all that stuff we talked about agents in there and I'm like oh no how do I get one of those she's like all right your guy I'll introduce you to four and then just pick one okay so interview four and how do you know who the pick so it was crazy so there was two two males two females they're all fantastic all great reputations all amazing the guys I was like it was very obvious that it wasn't they would've been great hey you're not gonna think yeah I'm not gonna make a wrong choice here so it was in that sense I was very lucky but I said okay they're probably not the right ones but between the two females are both so amazing but there are 180 out from each other when I had been around since the Tom Clancy days small boutique agency represents John Grisham so you go in there and you have all these John Grisham posters all over the place the whole team comes out sits down and talks to you it was amazing she was so awesome and and the other one younger hadn't really hadn't found her Tom Clancy or Grisham type person yet bigger agency that also ICM it's out here in Hollywood as well and it was such a tough decision was like a final rose ceremony I haven't broken up with someone in 20 years but I felt like I was breaking you know for someone but I was so invested in both of these agents I just laid they were both so fantastic but I felt like I was in lanai at the time when I made the decision and I was like and I felt like the final rose ceremony and then pick the one with ICM because I thought you know for this type of a novel and for where I wanted to go with a movie or series or something like that to be that part of them then to continue building this foundation of readers I think that's probably the right choice and I think it was so you have this plan to turn this into some sort of a series from the time you release the very first book yeah from before that and so what's crazy is that as I'm writing this now they tell you not to think of someone playing your characters your writing but as a child of the 80s that's almost impossible not to do so as I'm writing the crazy part is like usually you think of like Mark Wahlberg you think of somebody that had done these sort of things kind of before but I thought a Chris Pratt and he had just done all he'd done it's Parks and Rec and he'd done he had a small role in zero dark thirty where he plays a seal he has like a couple lines in there and for some reason like that's the guy really had no connection to him and no it wouldn't been the obvious choice back then this is 20 so I've start writing in December of 2014 I think her early 2015 somewhere there so so he wasn't his giant movie star back there hadn't done any of that stuff yet and I thought you know what this is a likable guy and he seems like an awesome dude I'm getting a good feeling from him and I thought you know growing up in the 80s I love Magnum he started off as a naval intelligence officer and then they found out about seals the writers they turned him into a seal a couple seasons into it and like everybody loved Magnum in the 80s and women liked him the guys liked him you know nothing not to like about Magnum and he also does the first essentially what you would call a murder on national television with the other person not having a firearm or a weapon and at the end of I think it's season season three but the guy a guy that had him as a powa and Vietnam comes to Hawaii there's a little conspiracy thing involved and at the end he thinks he's walking away and then Magnum asked him if he's seen the Sun Rise that morning because that morning when his friend his friend gets killed there's a sunrise and the guy turns around he's like yes why and the magnet turns around and boom and they stop it right there with this like fireball coming out of the end of his 1911 and they freeze it right there and it was the first time on television in that primetime hour where someone had killed somebody else the hero had killed someone else who wasn't armed I forgot about that very remembering it now it was very controversial yeah yeah and it's me so I thought that's who I need I need somebody who's a likeable guy who's going to invest in this and I heard he was like pro-military and that sort of thing and and because perhaps the guy and that's all that's all the thought I gave to it he couldn't have picked a better job so awesome and I get who knew he was gonna turn into with Jurassic Park and he hadn't passengers he hadn't anything serious yet but I also thought about because I've been studying this in something my whole life and I thought about in the 80s look what Tom Hanks did in the 80s you know he's in booze and buddies he's in dragnet he's in the burbs he's in jail versus the volcano and then he does something called Philadelphia in the early 90s and he takes that risk and since then he's been able to write his own ticket he's one of the greatest actors of his generation and I thought who's that guy in this generation that needs to stretch a little bit that needs to do something different and I'm like that's that's Chris Pratt he can do this and so I thought it and then even crazier before the first book came out I met Thunder ranch training doing some shooting stuff up there in Oregon and I get this call from a guy that I knew in the SEAL Teams and he's like hey bro do you remember me and you know you know Jarrod and I yeah he was out there and Utah with us and he said hey bro you remember me yeah of course I remember you have to go ahead and talk to him in five years or something and we catch up a little bit and he's like hey you know I was wondering thank you for a couple I was leaving the SEAL Teams I don't know if you're member but you've had me into your office you sat me down he talked about transition you introduced me some people in the private sector and I've never forgotten it I was like oh wow hey of course I'm gonna do that for you because I mean he's awesome too total stud great operator and wants to get out of the team so I'm gonna try to help him as best I can but he really remembered it and he said hey I heard you wrote a book I said yeah it's coming out in a couple months here they're these galley copy things which are early copies of a novel I can send one to you I'd love to send it and he said yeah I'd love it that'd be great but I'd like to give one to a friend of mine and I said yeah no problem who's that he said Chris Pratt it's like no way Wow yeah so he gives us the Chris Chris reads it and next thing you know he's optioned it before it even comes out are you a guy who believes in fate do you believe in destiny so when I was in Ramadi in 2005-2006 that's where I got to think about this a little bit because every time you left the wire anything could have been an iud and you could have either spent that time on the way to target and coming back from Target worried about oh is that is that dead donkey on the side that is that gonna blow up and kill me or kill that hit that Humvee in front of me that piece of trash right there is that covering something else is that it is our wire there you could spend every single mission especially you want to and from Target and even on target worried about that or you could focus on the mission focus on the job get there do the job get back and at that time I was like you know you know I think I have to resign myself to fate here and a lot of these things otherwise my mind is going to be focused not where it needs to be but on is that night II is that night II and so I thought all right you know what if I get blown up today that's just that's just how it was everything everything we possibly can to mitigate that but you know it could happen and I'm not going to spend an inordinate amount of bandwidth worried about that other than trying to mitigate it as best we possibly can but that's not going to be the focus of my everything that I'm thinking about it can't be I need to be focused on this mission I need to focus on contingencies there's a firefight I need to figure out what assets are available to come in here for QRF or whatever else what here we have overhead how do we how do we maneuver here all those things like that's what I need to worry what's a QR quick reaction force so you have those set up at different places in case you get hit so they can come on and usually in like Bradley's or abrams sometimes different vehicles and have a little more firepower than you do as you're sneaking through the streets so so we're kind of resign myself to fate and there's a book called the bridge at San Liu array and there's like I forget how many people will say five or six people that are on this bridge and it collapses and the story is how each one of them got to be on that bridge why were those six people the ones that were on that bridge at that time and its fate so so I guess then I'm really thought about too much since then other than that experience in in Iraq and just having to feeling like I had to resign myself to it there's perhaps things eerie though it's crazy it's a little eerie I mean wonderfully eerie no eerie maybe the worst word was pretty amazing I feel very fortunate yeah and yeah it's one of those things that you kind of maybe made that happen like maybe you kind of put that out there well as you were writing it thinking about him maybe I don't know I see that I said shut up hippie it's like Oh what do you got a crystal up your ass too you know but that yeah no I hadn't if I hadn't if I was like no I don't know I mean I was you know whatever an average seal or whatever but if I you know hadn't taken the time to sit down with Jared and like maybe Chris doesn't even know this exists today right and other crazy part of this i thought of anton fuqua directing it really directing it yeah why why why him because i love you training day he did training day i got the Oscar for her training day Magnificent Seven I knew he'd worked with Chris on on Magnificent Seven I actually did know someone who knew him but so I so I did have that connection through someone someone else but I loved shooter which is based on the book point of impact by Stephen hunter with Mark Wahlberg I love that movie because I could I loved the book so much they made it more modern for today's time but it's a Vietnam sniper is Bob Lee swagger those who it originally is but I just thought he's the guy he's the guy to direct this thing and now they're both doing it wow that's crazy that is very crazy yeah that's so weird man that you had those two people in your head like that's what makes me think I don't I don't not believe that it's possible to manifest something but I think most the people that talk about that stuff are full of shit yeah that's where it's a problem like most of the people that talk about that stuff they're trying to sell you something that well you know you can make your life happen and you just need a dream board and write all those things down there's a lot of that stuff is warship because you got to do the work right that's it but part of me thinks that if you do do the work and you do have that focus and that intensity I feel like there might be some sort of frequency that you can tap in where you make things more likely to happen or possibly you can make things happen but the thing is you know like you only hear those stories from the people that are successful like how many people are all right Chris Pratt in my head right now I said Chris yeah and he's like get the fuck away from me you know it's it's totally crazy how all that how all that stuff kind of comes to comes together you couldn't have picked a better guy than Chris he is such a good guy he's such a great guy he's almost weird weirdly nice ya know he's so nice maybe it's just different for around here maybe I don't know but he's very different in terms of like Hollywood actors like there's a few like him like you know it's like people love to say that actors are full of shit they're gross and they're self-centered narcissist and yeah it's true a lot of that is it really but it's not true all the time yeah and Chris is a great example of a guy who's like he's a very religious guy very pro-military very he's a really positive guy very very very friendly guy he's not your typical actor yeah also a huge movie star so it's weird it's like he's not that you know guy who does coke and goes to parties and he's a different different animal yeah they're they do exist male and female there's there are actresses that are great people they just they just really genuinely enjoy acting but for the most part the people that get into it are people that need a disproportionate amount of attention and for the most part the people that need a disproportionate amount of tension are disproportionately annoying you know yeah and usually they like to get rid of the author right away when you option something cuz I want to get rid of that guy because he's gonna be on set he's gonna be like that's not my vision you're ruining my book or whatever so I'd like to get rid of but Chris wanted me involved so I got to help out on the pilot script that's this thing that's awesome he's so good now is this a Netflix things that we're doing it's still classified okay they're doing some some announcement at some point but it's a streaming service oh that's right okay I know what it is yeah 10 fart series maybe something like that 8 to 10 parts though that's per yeah because if they tried to jam that well you don't have to anymore yeah it's great people like how he looks genius right especially now yeah another crazy fate thing is because when you were doing that like when you were writing that in 2016 the streaming thing wasn't what it is today right and well even when we did the deal it was like movie it was kind of like that that it was early 2020 18 when we did the deal and it's like well serious or movie so it's both it could be both in the contract and now and then they decided to do the series earlier on before kovat even was on the radar but now it looks like yeah genius move well now like series have a giant advantage over movies too now movies are getting released on yeah he's a really interesting thing today one of those theater chains was saying that they're not going to have Universal films anymore because Universal released rolls on direct to demand with people with Apple TV and Amazon stuff like that so these cinemas are now going to war like publicly going to war with the studios because they're saying hey you need to release your fucking movies in our theaters we got a business together and then the theaters like you know the movie production companies like you might not have a business and six months off because who the fuck is gonna go to the movies now I know even when they're like okay it's all good we're open up may 1st or whatever it is or yeah who's gonna rush right back with their kids it's not gonna be what it used to be it's gonna take a in the way down anytime yeah they were because well I've been saying forever I would love if you know I have a big TV at home I would love if I could just watch movies on TV I don't want to go to the movie and some guys talking to his girlfriend in the middle of moving ruining everything or people checking their phones they see the light from their phone walks in no sudden you're like the whole time with my kids just on edge the entire time I read about this lower the exits you know that sort of thing which is important to do in a movie theater it's like there's smoke or whatever you know you go to the wall that sort of stuff but yeah it's yeah when I stay I stay at home enjoy it at home make your popcorn at home so it's looking like a good move now but coming back to that to him back to the faith thing so it's also like what if I had not been a you know the operator or whatever that I was what if the guy had a different impression of me that sat next to Brad Thor at the fundraiser yeah he's not gonna recommend me to to Brad the or if I was if he had a bad impression from here they thought I was a bad operator or had a bad reputation or whatever else like he's not gonna make them mention my name it's a brad thor so all those little things that kind of came together or what if I didn't read growing up oh I didn't read all these guys like David morale created Rambo in 1972 and or wee brother heard of the rose early on which also solidified me to go into the SEAL Teams I was already on the path but he has one sentence in that book brotherhood of the road that it talks about seals and I've had such a good time such a great experience reading that novel that I knew that one day I'd write in the same genre as he does and now he's a he's a dear friend now he's absolutely incredible guy so all those little things just kind of happen I mean they happened but I did them because I was passionate about them was passionate about reading passionate about writing passionate about serving my country passionate about being the best operator I could possibly be so always focused on those things and then you know these other things kind of it helped it helped propel this whole thing forward so that seems like the formula for success in everything really really does like being passionate about something focusing all your attention and all your energy and really trying to do your best at something that seems like the formula do the work and it's a recipe book is called do the work you have to do that before anything else can happen you can't just wish that something was gonna happen and you know you have to sit down and do the work whether it's right comedy whether it's write a novel yeah start a gym whatever you're gonna do like you have to sit down and do the work and people don't they for whatever reason don't quantify in their head that all those little things you don't feel like doing when you just make yourself do them they all add up yeah and it really makes something happen that doesn't happen before it's not gonna happen otherwise no one's gonna do it for you no no one I hear authors talking all the time about what their publisher doesn't do for them so my agent doesn't do anything yeah be undeniable they can't do shit then yeah for me I'm like well I have no background I'm not coming from politics I'm not coming from sports I'm not coming from anything where I have any sort of a following that's gonna you know push me forward in this type of a realm what are they they don't owe me anything I owe them something I need to prove myself to them and prove that I was a good investment because most books don't make back their initial investment so initially you have to make most books yeah there's a few of them comic movies like all the movie all the Avengers and all that sort of stuff makes the money back for the studio's for all they are the ones that no one sees that maybe even Oscars but aren't making back their money so same thing in publishing there's a few at the top like the Stephen King's and Brad Thor's and Vince Flynn's and all that they make it back for all the books that don't make back their investment so I was like I need to prove myself to Simon and Schuster how am I going to do that well I owe them they gave me this shot and so I'm not gonna leave any rock unturned I'm gonna look at things like from other industries like black rifle coffee how did they build a coffee company like guys get out of the military and out of the agency how do these guys get together and make some youtube videos and all of a sudden now they have this amazing company well it's bought a huge company it's an amazing product at its base but you know what else they did oh they did some advertising they did some marketing they did their own marketing on advertising on social media platforms and they connected with other people that had similar interests or that they thought might be able to then grow the brand and also help those other brands along the way well it's also this it's authentic like Evan really Oh Evan hey for the CEO black raffle coffee has always been a coffee freak yeah so alive used to fucking roast coffee in the back of his hummus amazing yeah he's great he takes you through you sense that passions when he talks about coffee it's like me talking about writing you know you can sense that passion and it's incredibly from him now I'm turning into more of a coffee snob like before I wasn't but now that I know him and all those guys and have seen the process and now I'm a total coffee snob does he give you a hard time because Reese likes honey and a little bit cream in his coffee not as much as I thought he would because you know when he makes coffee it's really good without anything in it like when he does what he's doing and they do that thing with a glass deal and the whole thing it's only measures it out yeah and they weigh it and the whole thing it's awesome for me I mean getting up in the morning it's chaos the kids you know it's insanity and so we just hit the coffee maker like rival coffees in there and I toss in some honey toffee sauce and some cream so that's you give you shit about putting honey in your coffee yes so much just like the protagonist of these stories they they like the coffee black well in real life a lot of seals and Special Forces guys like their coffee black also they like to suffer and yeah but I always liked you know that latte I can get that caramel macchiato latte so I always I always did that and then I found out about honey and coffee and honey and tea later but it just was very natural for me to write that into the character because he has a background similar to to me as a former Navy SEAL sniper it becomes an officer and he's got this point in his time in uniform where he's gonna get out and take care of his family which is where I was when I started right so I learned him to be relatable I didn't want him to be a superhero I wanted her to be someone that wasn't was good at some things like kicking in doors like the taking sniper shot some of the things that I'm okay at but then also surveillance side of the house some of the things that we don't typically do in the SEAL team he's not as good at those sorts of things and maybe he drives a fj6 to Land Cruiser because I love Land Cruisers and there's also you know that whole subculture of people that love Land Cruisers yeah I can bring into the fold also so it's very natural for me to talk about those vehicles and then develop characters by talking about a defender 110 Land Cruiser I'll give each other a hard time whatever else or nine bill moyers 45 or whatever just use those things as character development tools so it was very natural for me to add honey and cream to protagonist coffee because that's what I drink at home a daily that's got to be the interesting one of one of the many many interesting things about writing a character is that you can incorporate your own little quirks and the Resco watches all the different stuff that you're you mean and the the gear thing too it's like you're very meticulous and very specific about the type of gear and and how he prepares everything you happy very very odd for me not to do that and some people don't like it and there are plenty of books where someone takes the safety off on their Glock before they shoot someone or something like that or they click it off on a revolver or whatever like there's plenty books out there that do that and you know I won't making a mistake that egregious I'm sure I'll make a mistake at some point for the people that really but when you see a mistake like that doesn't it take you out a little bit it's like watching a movie where they really kind of jack something up and I'm like because the worst thing to do is watch out like a seal movie with a seal or like a police movie with a cop or whatever that's all gonna tell you about all the mistakes so you can't enjoy the film so I try to just enjoy them for what they are but it does take you out he just like what else did they get kind of not right at the guys like writing the safety off on this clock so so for me it's very natural to incorporate that gear and it's also very natural for me to talk about it because I was so into it for so long that I know a lot of people in these industries and like this is an Aries watch right here I was at the cia's friends with Evan haver you know so I've talked to happen be okay this dude legit he's like oh yeah he's legit so so like all that stuff gets woven in there as well it's just so natural for me to do and also you know when I see somebody I can tell a lot about them by what they're carrying how they're carrying it you know what kind of belt they're they're using what kind she was they're wearing what kind of knife is in their pocket like I can tell a lot about them it tells a story immediately so I'm reading them without them saying one word and so my characters do that as well and then I use those tools to describe other characters that that aren't me that aren't a seal that aren't somebody else well I know how SF guys travel or now they have they do have their packs or whatever and F wherever it is or I know someone that doesn't really know what they're doing this character doesn't really know what they're doing so yeah he's gonna be carrying this 1911 that's brand new that he's not carrying cocked and locked doesn't have one of the chamber whatever it is like I can tell a lot about someone just by looking at their setup with a quick glance so it's very natural for me to do that in stories as well and it gives me a lot to work with how many how many seals are novelists it's not common there are seals obviously who get out and write nonfiction yeah Richard Marcinko who created Marcinko I read the first books that I ever read on military and oh nice nice yeah early nineties and when that came out I was so excited because I had read everything you possibly could on seals up until that point because I wanted to be a CEO since I was seven years old I knew I was gonna be in the military even before that books come out those came out in the 90s so I was odd really yep early 90s that was the first one I know if I can read them yeah read World War I felt like I read them before then but I guess that makes sense no plant time kind of blends together so when I found out hey there's an autobiography coming out about the guy that started this command damn knack on the East Coast its counter-terrorist you know I was so excited to read that book what's then there an issue to people kind of upset that he was telling these stories I think so but it's a kid reading that I don't know any that back story you're just like oh this is amazing yeah I've had an incredible life to be able to write a book and the first commanding officer of Delta Force wrote a book called the Delta Force and I think 1986 which really goes into the Iranian hostage crisis and does what happened to desert one in 1980 and that was a very formative time for me because I knew I was going in the military and at the time Walter Cronkite's on TV you were watching during dinner he's counting down the days that US personnel have been taken hostage in Iran and I'm seeing those click down times everything I wake up every single night and I'm wondering I see the pictures black and white photos of US military and people from the State Department I didn't know that at the time though I see a guy in a suit and a guy in a military uniform blindfolded in black and white photos on the cover of the newspaper and I'm wondering why all right why is the United States standing by and letting this happen even though I'm 6 years old at the time why is this happening why don't we go in there and get those guys and then desert what happens and of course that's that's on the mind it's still shades everything we do is a specialist in special operations was a big black eye for the country special operations and explain to people what happens so so six months after the hostages were taken in Iran so they were taken I think in November of 1979 and about six months they were eventually held for 444 days but about five six months into that we made an attempt to rescue them so they're being held at the Embassy still or an adjacent building I think and we was the first use that most people know of what's called Delta Force so our premier counter-terrorist unit that it's modeled after the British SAS and the British SAS has been in service for a long time so we had guys that went through their program in the sixties even and they took those lessons and created ours because late 60s mid 70s there's a lot of hijackings we have the Munich Olympics we have all these cabbies these terrorist events and we don't really have a good way to counter them and so Delta Force is created and their first test was Operation Eagle Claw to rescue the hostages in Iran so it's just an anniversary of it just happened the other day so April 1980 would give it a shot and it didn't work out so what happened was we have Marine pilots flying these sea stallion helicopters off I think it was the USS Nimitz I think so they're flying off an aircraft carrier they're meeting the assaulters from Delta Force who are flying in on c-130s from an island called massara and the Gulf of Oman we're a place where we would then launch into Afghanistan years later interestedly now if I spent a little time time there and they were going to meet up in the desert and outside of Tehran Iran a few hundred miles outside the fattest city so the c-130s land ec130 s land that have fuel helicopters land from the aircraft carrier they're going to refuel those helos and the planes are going back to massara and the helicopter is going to get closer to Tehran so they're gonna get closer they're gonna land they're gonna get camouflaged during the day and then some guys who have been on the ground in Iran this is the best part of the story that no one really talks about we've had guys on the ground in Iran we had an e6 Air Force guy that spoke Farsi we had a Special Operations legend dick Meadows I was also on the Sante arrayed in Vietnam and we have two Special Forces guys out of Germany and then two CIA assets I think one's called Bob and one one's named Mohammad and they had to get vehicles out there to the hide site what the Delta Force guys are and then they're gonna assault they're gonna go in they're gonna retake the embassy they're gonna get the hostages and then the helicopters are going to take back off land in a soccer stadium next door and they're gonna extract from their exfil from there so what happened was the planes land helicopters have some had mechanical problems couple get lost in the sandstorm they needed six to do the mission they launched with eight less than six make it to that link-up point in the desert so they have to scrap its called no-go criteria so it takes a decision essentially away from the ground Force commander because ahead of time he knows that if we don't have if we have four helicopters we can't do this mission so instead of being on the ground saying okay we have four how many guys do you have can we do it with this those decisions have been made ahead of time in the planning process so the helicopters land not enough they scrap the mission they're bored and what would have happened is they would have gone back and they would have reconstituted and gone after the hostages a few days later but one of the helicopters in refueling collides with one of the ec130 s huge explosion eight US servicemen died and so they don't go take da Stooges they don't go back for the hostages again a few days later Iran moves the hostages different locations all over Iran to make it a lot more difficult if we had gone after them again but the next day President Carter makes an announcement said we tried to get the hostages didn't work had this disaster in the desert and it was a big black eye for his his presidency and for special operations in general but the important part we took those lessons and we we applied them going forward so and how we trained all together instead of having all these pilots and assaulters and all these people that have never really trained together up until that point well now we do now we have a Special Operations Command we all train together so pilots are trained you're doing all this stuff together so when 9/11 hit all those years later we're much more prepared because of what happened to desert one so that's how we honor those guys that died that's how we honor that mission is by taking those lessons and apply them going forward and that's what you interesting ly not that's what you do in life also when you have to learn these lessons and apply them going for it's all about how you apply them going forward well that's a huge advantage for you as an author to have all that information to have that legitimate background like to be writing about these things like we're talking about guys who are writing about taking safeties off clocks people that really don't know what they're writing about when they do it's like I mean you can be creative and pretend you're a ballerina without of every ballet danced but I don't think it's gonna be the same and there's there's an authenticity to the way you write and to the one book that I've read at least savage son where it you just it there's a frequency that you tap into that is a frequency of a person that has experienced this stuff in real life you're not imagining you know there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff where people write about things where they're imagining you know there's a movie called warrior where it's an MMA movie oh yeah they fight two days in a row and when they know they fought two days around my kid though I'm watching what are you talk you have fight two days in a row have you ever seen someone the day after a fight you look at the fucking Elephant Man right her whole body's a mess everything's swollen like this is nonsense but someone that doesn't know is like this in the story they're gonna he's gonna lose the first night but the next night he's gonna go he's gonna win exactly these do things that take you out of like you if it's a it's a world they don't really know about and they're writing about this world whereas you're writing about a world that you were so deeply embedded in for all those years that when you're writing about it it's just it's really compelling it's very interesting thank you yeah I got coorporate some real world stuff in there too like a shot that I didn't take in to Jaffa RAC and I fictionalized that by having a memory from Fallujah and so I joined morph it around a little bit but the passion is there the feelings and emotions behind it are there and it's woven into the first story and then some and so it's very therapeutic I get to take and I was very lucky downrange like you can do all the right things in combat like if you were to have white board something out here and we talk about tactics and all the rest of it you could make those exact same right decisions downrange and things can still go south and people can die then the other is opposite truly you can make all the wrong decisions of quote-unquote wrong decisions and things can work out just fine like life so you could show whether you made mistakes or not point thing you're gonna have a hard time dealing with them later and for whatever reason whether it was luck or whatever else I sleep very well at night because of the things that that was involved in downrange but I still got to tap into them and put them into the story now there's a going back to what you said about seals writing books interestingly enough in the first book there's an interrogation scene interrogation an interview meaning not not a torture scene but sitting down with NCIS though the Naval Criminal Investigation service and so some bad things my career wasn't all all wonderful like the downrange stuff very lucky very fortunate to be in a couple right places at the right time to do some interesting things but when we got back a good buddy of mine Mark Owen he writes a book called no easy day and that's the one about the bin Laden raid and that one that was like a tipping point because in our community at the time they've been active valour that movie with it with seals active-duty seals playing characters in an actual movie there were other books out there so there's already discussion happening like hey are we too much in the limelight here we're supposed to be these quiet professionals but you know going back in time I read all these Vietnam books growing up and every autobiography I could about people in the military you know grant has his memoirs or whatever so there's there's a precedent not just in this country but worldwide people getting out talking about their experiences and that's part of a first-person account the historians will use later is it frowned upon at all so it it got it was starting to get even more and more frowned upon right up to that point and that was a tipping point so and that book came out that's when everyone said or not everyone senior level leaders were like okay stop all stop and they really well because of that book they went and invented all the investigations that happened they went in and essentially anyone that had a connection with him they pulled in and investigated as a way to put pressure on him to get what they wanted so so I was one of those guys known him for since 99 or something like that so we've been dear friends since that time and so we have emails going back all these years so I got pulled in to this interrogation room and they pulled out single personal emails single sentences totally out of context to try to get me for something that would put pressure on him and they did that not just with me but with almost anyone that had some sort of a connection with him they investigated because he's already out of the military so so things that you said totally out of context like joking around about something or is just statements about yeah just statements like what did you mean by what did you mean by this and I used that in the first novel cuz I'm sitting there in this interrogation you got these guys across from you and essentially NCIS air from my perspective are people that they couldn't make it in the FBI or the CIA and they weren't tough enough to be street cops so now they're busting people on piss tests in the military and that sort of thing actually my first experience with them was after September 11th and you know I think we're all in the same team and we're doing these ship warnings in the northern Arabian Gulf to enforce the UN embargo for oil tankers that are leaving Iraq and then going to Iran and so our job was to take those ships down before they got to Iranian waters and then the UN would take over after that but it was a really interesting time because like a cop pulling over someone you're walking up and you don't really know what's going on and so they would come out of out of Iraq they had all these metal over all the windows it cut off all the ladders on the ship so you'd have to use a caving ladder to hook climb up and then you have to breach and get inside these things and get them back into the Gulf before big hit Iranian waters otherwise you so it was kind of a crazy deal but during one end we're doing a couple nights on a couple nights off that sort of thing with another platoon and then NCIS shows up and they pull us all of these different rooms and they said hey so in an m60 some sort of a big machine gun typing was has gone missing on one of these ships that you guys were on and I was like oh that's terrible you know well how can I help you and so they start talking and make how how would you get one off a ship if you wanted to steal a machine got a premiership how would you get it off and me I was gonna creative I'm like we're on the same team here I'm like I'll this what I would do I'd taken off piece by piece and wherever I said no so I gave him I and then as I was nearing the end I'm seeing it in their face and seeing the notes they're taking I'm like wait a second are they like trying to get me to like I didn't take out m60 off a ship piece by piece we're only on there for like a problem is you're an author and I'm trying to think it all through yeah so I'm like yeah I had a bad experience with them but so what are they saying to you anyway so do this they start accusing you in in with the Marco and older than they're no they didn't accuse me but I could tell it things shifted is I'm getting so creative and telling them how I do it these guys are just like anyway so I kind of figured it out near the end and I'm like oh wow this is not this doesn't something to feeling quite right here like these guys are just after a win that's what there there's drunk yes somebody that's your job if they can get a seal even better so after said after Mark Owen wrote book no easy day the same thing and you saw these guys across the table and his years later so I wasn't like immediately they went after some guys immediately whatever but they put all this together over a long time and fall it was their alternate goals and what do they want I think they went him to it they wanted to build a case against him a criminal case against him for what for not submitting his book to the Department of Defense for review and is that so they can redact certain things the classified yeah which is why I was hypersensitive to it and even though miner fiction I submitted them and that is a protocol so when all those things in your book word says redacted is that why it's redacted really so it's because of them yeah so they made me very sensitive to it so no other author of fiction that has the class effect the the security clearances that I had no one else submits fiction but I was so I just tied to this because of my experience with the Mark Owen book and when they tried to do I was like I just want to make sure right and I said what they've taken out absolutely ridiculous so the first book I didn't appeal it because they took 45 days to do it which I thought was pretty good because they say they'll take 30 yeah and if that's pretty good they took out up nine lines or something like that which is fine but the second one they a month goes by and two then three then four then five then six and they get almost to the seven month mark when they can finally get back to me so at this point we had to push the publication date well to the summer it's like a movie trying to figure out like when you don't want to Avengers movies coming out at the same time from the same studio right so it's so these are thought well ahead of time so it was not convenient to have to push it all the way to the end of July so I was a pain and every single thing in there that was blacked out my attorneys found in publicly available government documents so not just like on Wikipedia or from somebody else that wrote a book or no publicly available government websites government documents that anyone on earth so they have done their due diligence to check if that stuff had actually been released already publicly my lawyers did yeah but the people the the the people you submitted to it the defense they just have this black pan and they're just just taking things out and then they see Oh CIA will send it off to the CIA you know I don't work for the CIA but they send it off and then that starts the CIA clock looking at it it's just ridiculous and this is not something you had to do it's by precedent no because it's fiction because it's fiction by precedent now like we talked about those laws earlier three felonies a day yeah laws are written if you look at them pretty broadly so the government can interpret them the way they want to and I didn't always used to be the case you go back 50 years the idea was you had to write a law that the average guy could understand in one when you looked at it one time read it it's evident what that law means not anymore the language involved how long they are how tough they are to decipher even for attorneys to decipher so it's it's written in a way that's they can come after anyone they want for anything which is by design and they used it to go after mark Koehn they used it even though that's nonfiction you know maybe should have he went to an attorney I had experience in this space what you would do who's the best attorney for this oh the guy that did a book called kill bin Laden with someone from Delta Force that guy has experience I'll go to him so he went to that lawyer who said no you don't need to submit this so there's lawsuits and all sorts of stuff that are associated with that but for me what they did this is years later his second book he sends it to me so I'm getting ready to get out of the military he sends me the second book and says hey what do you think of this and so I read it and I give you know real quick and then I said I'm like one no that's it awesome maybe in the first part in the preface maybe talk about your experience over the last couple years with the first book and what the government did to you and how you reacted just people were probably interested in that so I wrote that so now I'm into this interrogation room with these NCIS guys and that's one of the things that they pull out and said so why are you editing classified material that hasn't been approved but like I don't know guys guys a good friend sends me the sends me the thing I look at it so what they wanted was to just put pressure on him and said I'm gonna go after your buddy if you don't do this for us which was to say so what did they want from him I think they wanted he was guilty and they also wanted a state of not submit of not submitting it to the Department of Defense office of pre-publication and security review not going through you want to make an example of him so that anybody else getting out would know that they had to do that and I don't think it worked is there's plenty box out there that a nonfiction that have not been through that process but that's what they wanted from him they weren't all the money from it which was the money yep and interestingly enough all the money and he was always gonna give it all that's the other part of this is so interesting is because I've known him for so long he was always gonna give it all away and he had no reason to tell me that you know a year before them whatever however long it was before like he wasn't setting this up as some criminal mastermind but he was always gonna give it away to a seal foundation and when the book came out it all want to do a bank account but guess what came out of the background lawyer fees after that so he still had all the money except for the lawyer fees and then they still go after you for taxes that you're supposed to be anyway it's the government so so they wanted that money anything money going forward like if they made a movie from it all those proceeds they just wanted to crush them and make an example of him so other people would submit or make people think about knots not even writing anything anyway how did it all end up so it's a lawsuit with the attorney that gave a bad advice I'm not sure exactly where that is and then all the money went back to the government that was in the account and he's paying off the rest of it that went to attorney fees so so he didn't make anything no Wow one penny all the money went to the government all of my cell and plus taxes so double money so so all the money goes to the government because he lost is that the idea because because they finally put enough pressure on where the lawyers do their thing and they figure out a settlement of some sort and that was the settlement all the money Wow and his second book the same deal I know that went through the process went through but after I read it so he sent it to me before he sent it in there's nothing but you read it and that's what they that's one of the things they used to try to get him to do what they wanted so and that wasn't the only one there's all everybody that knew him got got pulled into this thing but point being is that had that not happened then that interrogation scene in my novel where James Reese sits down after what happens to his team who sits down with those guys across the table I changed Afghanistan Jane from San Diego to Afghanistan but that's how I felt about the guy sitting across the table from me so it feels real because I wasn't just like hey have you read into interrogation room or I'm arresting a couple cops shows where they have somebody in an interrogation room I'll just kind of write what that looks like or feels like no that's what it feels like to be in there having these eyes on you having them tell you that there's no cameras on when you know that there are and all all that sort of thing so I got to put all that together and make the book what it is so without that happening without them trying to go after me to put pressure on him and all we're gonna associated with that the first book would not be nearly as good like the combat stuff yeah it's different but the other stuff the conspiracy side of the house and and the NCIS guys and that interrogation in particular and some of the bad guys that's once again you can't kill people in real life but you know what you can't you can't in fiction and so it made it so much better than it would have been otherwise so now looking back and I thank him to this day I'm like you know that first book that resonated with Simon & Schuster for some reason and a lot of its what happened downrange and those feelings and emotions but a lot of it is because of what happened with with you as I was getting now that's interesting so now when you create these characters do you write a backstory do you spend time like writing out this guy's life and then sort of use pieces of that in the story or do you write it along while you're writing the story because he was had a background so similar at mine I didn't need to do that so I didn't need to create so now I am for this fourth one because now there's so many characters that it's hard to keep spelling straight and background straight and all that sort of things so now I have these family trees and these characters written out on Scrivener which is how I write it yeah so good to organize things and left so CLE hit that button it's all turns into like a poster board type thing but I didn't use that one until the third one up until that point I was using word and like copying and pasting and then scrolling and then putting it in where I wanted and then you know maybe I didn't cut because I he was worried I was gonna delete and then I go back and now delete it so it's so nice to use Scrivener like that just makes it so much easier to do that so so now I do but at the beginning I didn't with one novel and kind of creating you have the story so I did that I wrote six or seven different ideas down like one page executive summaries as I was getting ready the one I wanted to start with was savage Sun that was the one I wanted to start with really but I knew the characters weren't quite at that place where I could explore the dark side of man I needed to get readers invested in them take him on a journey much like I learned about Joseph Campbell and the hero's journey and here with a thousand faces back in 1988 I had to take him on that sort of a journey and get him to that point where I could explore the dark side of man through these characters so so let's had to start with that that first one it was very evident it's gonna be the terminal list that's the one so I took that one page executive summary turned into an outline but if I came to a point in that outline where I got stuck and this is the important part I didn't say uh-huh and readers aren't gonna figure this out they're not gonna come along on me with this journey believable I just went around it because I'm not on the battlefield I'm solving problems on the page like I am I'm adapting like I am on the battlefield but you know what I can sleep on it and I don't have to solve this problem right now I can get five months down the line and just continue going and eventually I'm gonna figure this problem out and it's gonna work out so I didn't let anything any obstacle stop me as I was writing that outline and I took that outline and started writing and as I figured out those problems then I would change the outline and I would adapt it so I could have a visual representation of what was going on and then eventually about the 75% point then I just discarded the outline completely and just kept writing so Scrivener made that a ton easier for the third book because doing it in Word was a pain there is apparently a way that you could set up word to behave like Scrivener oh really yeah I read an article on it and I tried to do it and I was like I fucking give up just gonna up using Scrivener I just love how word I write bits in word because I can get it on my phone I can get it on a computer just log into Microsoft Word and it just shows me all the files any laptop any computer I use any phone I use it just goes right to it where it's like with Scrivener you have to like upload it to Dropbox and then to get it from drop was a little that's a banner and then when I send it to the editor I did that thing were changes it to word and then I'm in word the rest of the time no Mac described after I did that was the finished product yeah as finishes it could be any what else has changed from the time you wrote your first book to now in terms of like your process and and and how you do it and what do you think you're better at now than you were when you started so the timeline is obviously compressed now so I started writing the second one before I'd even submitted the first one to Simon & Schuster because I was always gonna write those two because of that John Grisham story and him not being able to give a time to kill away so I was always gonna write too so I was already in Mozambique I was already doing that that research over there already writing that second one and if both of them didn't work out then I was gonna reevaluate my life choices but I was always gonna go all-in on - so now so point being for the second one I wasn't yet on that year timeline because there was no deal hadn't even gone to Simon and Schuster and then once the first one did get to Simon & Schuster then they plotted it out and I still had another over a year before I came out while I'm working on the other one so this third one is the first one that I've had but to be on that year long time line for but I've had it in my head for so long so this fourth one now is the one where things are really compressed because especially because of copa90 and having to adapt at the last second for this book tour and having to think of things that I wouldn't necessarily have thought had to think of otherwise like helping these independent bookstores I can't away drive business towards them they're hurting so bad right now how can I help they were hurting before this right well people are going back to him yeah they're hurting for a while and then people were going back yeah it's people like that page in their hand they'd like to have that experience with someone that they know in their hometown so so those kind of bookstores were actually on the upswing it was like the bigger ones never always important ears ago yeah Barnes & Noble adapting ish they're kind of hurt and so the little ones like okay they're part of a you know just a Main Street Park City there's a bookstore there the dollars right there it's great little chocolate place attached to it get some coffee tea whatever so it's great so I figure how do I help them at the same time and what I typically with these signed book plates you can only get through those independent bookstores so anybody wants a signed book that's where they have to go so did that I have some merchandise on my site all of that it was already going 100% to these veteran focus foundations that I had some sort of a touch point with cuz they'd help friend of mine or whatever else but now it's all going Center for disaster philanthropy cope with 19 response fund so they're things to talk about on interviews rather than oh I have a new book out you can talk about though how you're trying to help as you're launching or talk about preparedness talk about what the enemy is learning by watching our response to cope in 19 and how they're incorporating that into future battle plans those sorts of things so how do adapt do virtual book signings that sort of thing they're Q&A is using the technology that wasn't available 10 to 20 years ago certainly 30 30 40 years ago to to today so I had to spend all that time doing doing that so point being this fourth one when I get back from here it's all in back on book 4 which is it should be great cuz I love writing that's what I love to do and the other side of it the business side of it that we've been talking about that is interesting to me because I'm learning something new and I love learning new things and I wouldn't be learning about branding and marketing and all this sort of thing if I didn't have a product if I didn't have a book and it and I can help other people as they're getting out of the military starting other businesses that aren't even writing related at all I can help them and talk to them about my experience and what I've learned and how I've adapted because I had to no one's gonna hand this stuff to you you have to go out there prove yourself get after it do the work and be smart about it you have to study that landscape so I studied social media for like a year before I even did my first post and but I saw people I studied I said what do I like what do I not like what's appropriate what's not did you write this stuff down or just keep it on the head no kept that in my head that's that's pretty obvious like what's appropriate and what's not like when someone walks into that general store very very clear what's how you should treat someone whether they come in yelling and screaming or they come in asking for directions right thanks that's some basic stuff that a lot of people don't don't quite get how fortuitous is it that you're writing about infectious diseases and then this shit goes down I mean if there's ever a person who got a gift by a tragedy it's crazy because I don't know that research in the fall and into the early part of the year did you go to Galveston the CDC no no I talked to doctors that have been involved in infectious diseases and with the weaponization of infectious diseases and that I read through some books out there although I stuff online but the online stuff you have to be able really careful about and check with other people that really know what they're doing even though it's fiction so I done all that part of it ahead of time so what really changed for me as far as what I'm doing now and what I'm incorporating from this is what our response has been took over nineteen because it's put obviously our economy into a tailspin so what's the enemy doing the enemy is looking at that and realizing this this invisible virus has done to the United States with the Soviet Union couldn't do in 40 plus years of trying so how do we incorporate that into future battle plans can't we have a strategy even though failure what if there's just a threat of a bio attack what if there is a failed bio attack somewhere it's still going to affect that economy especially right now with us being so gun-shy about all these sorts of things so what are they taking from that and what are they learning to apply going forward so for my fourth novel I'm taking those lessons of what the enemy is learning from this and how they're going to I think they're going to apply it going forward and incorporating that into a fictional narrative so in in that sense you know I'm trying to yeah learn always learning it's always important to learn and apply it going forward and you you're you're also you're in the middle of writing this story but you're also living a life of a person that actually has to deal with this corona virus pandemic where the whole world is kind of shut down like as a just as a human being when you're dealing with this what's frustrating for you about how everything is going down you know I think it's what we just talked about as far as people not taking these lessons seriously going forward and making this a stronger country because of this so you get knocked down you get back up you're stronger for it you've learned something we're talking about in jujitsu you know it's either you learn and and so what are we gonna learn from that we're gonna apply that going forward so like the whole thing with the Iran crisis hostage situation we learned from that we applied those lessons and we were more prepared from 9/11 as a special operations force because of it so for this I worry just like you said our people are gonna go back to their old ways after this they can't wait to I can't wait to slide back into their old ways yeah so are we gonna be a stronger citizenry maybe it may be a certain percentage take these lessons to heart I don't know but so I think that's probably the it's it's knowing that people expect the government to take care of them and that's the expectation yeah not you it's not you don't have to take care of yourself or your family the government's gonna go looking for a daddy yeah how do I get that what 1,200 whatever that whatever money they handed out oh great well you know what's even better you being strong self-reliant self-sufficient and having your kids look up and see how you're handling this and say well the mom and dad are either in the kitchen talking about how much they're worried about paying that rent or that mortgage or they're in that kitchen maybe talking about it even if they are worried in a way like hey how do we do this better next time how do we prepare as on the other side of this and one of the things we can do now to get better prepared if this happens two months from now a year from now five years from now and the kids can see that too or they see mom and dad in the kitchen about hail we are so lucky that we prepared for this we were prepared financially we had a little food here whatever it is and so the kids will take those those lessons on take those to heart because they're very impressionable right now especially at 14 12 and 9 and they're definitely processing this and they're catching things on the news and they're talking to friends on there on social media they're texting back and forth of all that sort of things so this can either make them stronger citizens going forward or they can see mommy look mom and dad relied on government we came out the other side of this we got this check and nothing really changed so oh what lesson are they gonna take going forward right so it's a very important time not just how you deal with this okay and how you get through it now you move forward better for it but because of the lessons that we're teaching our kids whether we mean to or not it doesn't have to be a conscious thing like they were gonna take lessons and as parents it's up to us to figure out what those lessons are gonna be and we can morph it and make them stronger more self-reliant going forward like our daughter sees our freezers full of elk and moose and she we pull that out which frost it and she's she's a part of it because she knows she got this elk in Colorado last year now she's feeding our how old is your daughter she's 14 Wow she shot her first elk at 14 got a first look at 10 yeah no kidding tagging New Mexico at 10 yeah so somebody it was a retirement gift a great guy and I said you know excuse me - one for me and one for my wife or one for me with my daughter and I was like you know what I got an elk last year in New Mexico public land it was crazy crazy but I was like you know can I transfer that to my wife my wife and daughter go do this together and I'm with them also on a family experience and he was like yeah absolutely that's let's do it and so she was 10 yeah standing off sticks 307 yards one shot and the guide was he said Miss and she's been hunting before she's been hunting since she was seven and she is good and I was like oh you know I was a tough shot I know it's okay how'd you feel about that shot she's like I feel good I'm like oh it's just a ten-year-old saying that because they don't want to kind of lose face in front of the guide and moms there and dads there and uh Michael it's okay you know it's okay to miss everybody misses guess let's learn from it move forward she's like I didn't miss and say go up there there's no blood there's no anything we think we're tracking it we walk up yes you know she missed and we walked back down and there's just little tiny just ribbit in the ground if there was twenty yards away Wow yeah amazing show you a picture after God feel stupid really just went all the way through Excel he's on him back behind you know but that's a problem right they see the dust kick up behind the animal and they think that it's a mess yeah so yeah but you we have that meat from this last year in Colorado that's amazing about it with the family and she's like she knows that she provided that for all of us and very exciting rewarding for her and their little guy he's he got his first animal in Africa this last year whoa yes I went back to the crazy place to get your first day yeah so crazy so I've been over there doing some more research I went to South Africa to help train up an anti poaching unit because they hadn't used Glocks hadn't used em force a little bit of experience with both those weapon systems and I want to do some research in the art and science of man tracking so I went to South Africa helped train up this anti poaching unit it was an amazing experience and then they asked me to come back as a thank you to with my family over the over the summer so I came back with my with my family and our little guy got his first animal there they put the blood on his cheeks I picture him in the back of the Land Cruiser on the way back is he's never had a haircut at age nine he's blond hair blowing in the wind it's awesome and then we use every piece of it that's what's great about over there is they see you use much more than we use over here I mean stomach linings like everything gets used in Africa which is cool for them to see because they think we're using it all here they see us taking that rib meeting then neck meat and all the rest of it but over there they see everything get used which is a pretty cool thing for them to experience at that at that young age so it helps to be self-reliant too it's and they see the people out there working on the Land Cruisers they see all everything you have to do in Africa that you can just call someone to fix the plumbing and call someone cuz the electricity is out or whatever you fix it yourself cuz you have to how did you get to be a land cruiser for now how'd that happen cash you know I found out about icon 2006 or so I think it was maybe five and it's from seeing him overseas so I saw the Hilux is first in Afghanistan 2003 I think it was you're seeing these things over there and then you're seeing what we're doing to them we have some mechanics over there that are bolting on armor and they're doing things to the engine and they're putting in these radio consoles stuff for our secure communications and they're like wow this is pretty cool and then I saw the evolution of the Hilux over the next 15 years and got to see these things purpose-built from factory to and after marketplace that then does all that stuff that we were doing in Afghanistan with with screwdrivers and the rest of it I got to see what those look like and that was pretty sweet and you just see how much abuse they can take and what they're going up and over and so I think it was seeing the Hilux and then looking into uh I'm able get into coma when I get back because I saw these things over there and they stink last forever it was amazing and some crazy experiences in them and then I was like Oh Land Cruisers this is pretty sweet and I just it was a natural thing for me to like older stuff and more classic stuff and then to also like classic stuff that looks old but it's really new and can really well 62s just like that portion that I have out there where the metal is thicker and heavier gauge like you shut those doors like oh this is not a it's just different they're just they just made they're made different yeah so I started doing my research and I think I'm the first thing that pops up when you put in like you know restoration for Land Cruisers is his icon yeah there's a bunch of other people doing it now but John gets really mad I mean he gets mad at people doing shitty jobs of restoring Broncos or shitty jobs restoring Land Cruisers and I guess he's got every right to I mean he's so meticulous and they're so what they do is just incredible I'm it's amazing like it's one of those build it and they will come type businesses you know who was gonna buy a three thousand man our restoration job out of 95 Land Cruisers it's right not that many niche market yeah he owns that fucking niche yeah and on so many other cars too I'm so fortunate that he's you know down the road yeah I can hang out with him and talk to him and I listen to monitor podcast I listened to him there so and then I drove up from LA and gave him a had them start working on my FJ 6 2 when we were in San Diego doing a stage 1 kind of making sure all the belts and stuff we're good and you know whatever is kind of making sure it wasn't gonna fall apart but I always wanted to do that stage 3 or that icon type restoration and I always had my eye on that and then my landcruiser broke down my wife was driving it and the oil came out engine seized crack engine block like not good it's her fault but anyway so it sat in our driveway for a couple years as I'm getting out of the military and that's kind of a bummer seeing it there but get that deal and some of the first things I did was send that up to Jonathan get in line I did get mine was behind us he's like yeah you're just behind Joe so I had to wait for your 80 to get down I didn't have a few of them working at the same time but they do a cool picture with yours and mine yours was just getting done or the frame off or whatever and then mine was they're kind of looking dilapidated in the back just waiting you know like say you have to 18 months you had to wait that's wrong that's crazy so that was cool so it just showed up the other day and of course I'm not really I want to show people or whatever but at the same time people are hurting right now show it this is not a time to be flossing no it's sweet though that thing is legit so I love it so it's natural for me to put them in the books and that's and usually like that I want to say thank you to Jonathan for doing that so just like I put SiC in the books for my friend John Hart who started sick like I think it's on the first or second page of my first novel is sick of year so you know that's woven in there and I just love to do that sort of thing yeah it was cool gave me a bunch of smiles to all the different things the black rifle Coffee Dudley yeah all that stuff is very cool now when when you're in the middle of this book now what it what is your timeline like how far how far have you been like how long have you been writing on this fourth book so I outlined it I had the idea for awhile but I was still finishing up the third one so on the way to Russia outlined it because I didn't have a computer how do you do that so this time I used I still third one I outlined it in word and then I got my Scrivener set up and then I transferred it over and did the writing in words of this one I did the outline in Scrivener and I'm writing it in his script as well so I had those little post things or whatever they call them and Scribner with a little description of the chapter so I've outlined it that way but I started routing longhand cuz I didn't have my computer with me on the way Rush's didn't want to take it to trial all that information sucked out when I walked through customs so just legal pad and just wrote it out and just arrows and things and Asterix is and all that just a mess so I did that back then got home finished up book three and then started writing look for but I'm also doing the research so you have to I'm diving into books I'm talking to those doctors as I'm talking to them and getting other ideas about how to move the plot forward different things that can test the protagonist so this theme of this next one is really the ethics morality and legality behind targeted assassinations and the bio weapons piece is really forms the foundation of that but really what the protagonist is struggling with is targeted assassinations and who is he today is he now an assassin he's been a hunter he's been a soldier he went after these people that wronged his family and his troop and and put them all in the ground in that first book and now he has a yes but it's a mixture of a personal and professional track that he's now gonna take going forward because he still it's a little unfinished business to take care of and needs to use the United States government to track these guys down but he still needs to needs to get so in as I'm doing that and interviewing all these people I'm thinking about how that works and I'm reading a book it's almost done with it's called rise first and kill by ronen bergman and it's really about the State of Israel and because really we think of targeted assassinations and we don't we associate with our government I mean we do we've done it before we just did in January but Israel it's much more closely associated with Israel from its inception up until today and it's a fascinating books I'm getting lots of ideas from there I'm reading David Koch Owens it's called the snakes make some dragons or dragon in the snakes and he's a fascinating guy who's a counter-terrorist advisor for Petraeus during the surge he's become a good friend and so I'm reading doing all that research which helps me move the plot forward so I'm writing it I'm touching up those outlines and I'm working that research into the plot so at this stage I've written probably about half of it and it's hard to say because you never know we're gonna get another idea or what it's gonna take too long but I'd say I'd say a little more than half even though it's all outlined I know where I'm going know what I need to do and that first draft is due in mid-june when you when you write out an outline but then in the middle of your writing do you ever have these like Stephen King apparently doesn't write outlines he's a they call him a pantser right Betsy your pants yeah what are your thoughts on that I mean like when you read that he does that and he's I mean I'm a giant Stephen King fan he's probably written some of the most amazing horror novels ever probably I mean not probably has and what an amazing story also about during the work being persistent being resilient incredibly hit by a bus I know every bone in his body is broken historian in on writing about him starting back up again and his wife setting him up and but what do you think about someone who writes like that I mean with his incredible results I mean ya know it's Holly also earlier shit like The Shining and apparently doesn't even remember writing Cujo Wow yeah he talked about that he was so fucked up and I didn't even remember writing it Hey I mean it makes me want to do more drugs it's I do think about that when I'm up late and it's 3:30 in the morning I'm exhausted I know the kids are gonna be up at 6:30 7:00 or whatever but yeah you've wrote just the craziest shit but I your stuff's pretty fucking crazy too but yourself is crazy in a sense that I think these things really happen you know like like even like the tortures and I wanted to talk to you about that too like the torture scene like there's I've seen so many pencil necks talk about you know don't be rude but I shouldn't even said that but people who talk about torture saying that torture doesn't work I'm like how can you say torture doesn't work like by what statistic and I've seen people say these today we shouldn't torture because torture doesn't work and like how do you first of all how do you know have you tortured someone like how do you know where you what are you basing this off and why are you saying it was authority and resolve yeah Authority and resolve and conviction that you know based on statistics of something you rather torture doesn't work it seems to me like if people have information and they don't want to give up that information yeah we we don't want to think of ourselves as being this barbaric type of civilization that would torture someone to get information out of them but also if you want to look at it pragmatically that is how you would get people to talk so to say that torture doesn't work and in fact people who are tortured will say anything and well that's says who yeah I hate that kind of conversation because you are because it's an it's an anti-military conversation a lot of ways because it's the same it's the same kind of mentality that sort of dismisses all sorts of tactics that are used to protect people that don't they have the luxury of not knowing what needs to be done or how it is done yep so it's very it's very complex and it's very simple and I obviously use this in my writing and I did in that first book because the protagonist had to become that terrorist become that insurgent yeah so he had to adopt those tactics and he had essentially to I had to abandon everything that he'd been fighting for for the past 16 years to go after these people that wronged his family and his troop so as far as that the torture stuff goes so I got to explore it in a fictional sense so in real life it's important to talk about these things with your troop so at the tactical leadership level where where I was my entire career whether I was just a brand new guy enlisted guy or a troop commander at the end it was important especially once a 9/11 happened to talk about these things before we're in a situation where we called it first we call it bit first we call it battlefield interrogation and then it became TQ tactical questioning a lot more PC to call it tactical questioning rather than battlefield interrogation but you had to talk about it ahead of time so that your guys would know what was appropriate at a time so they're not in a situation where an IG has just gone off one of our guys is killed and now we have someone we think is responsible for that and there's one or two of us three of us in this room with him what are those guys gonna do well they're emotional and maybe we haven't talked about it ahead of time so what are they gonna do they're gonna well who knows but point being before we get there during training it can't just be a brief bye like up a pencil neck lawyer that comes in and says all right this is a non-print this is yes exactly it can't be that it has to be incorporated into the training it has to be discussed by people that are trusted and so that when someone's in that situation he knows what one is appropriate because of the second and third order effects that may come from it yeah you might want to put a bullet in that guy you might want to torture him whatever but second third or effects of doing that could be more devastating to this unit to them the our strategy as a whole that we're trying to accomplish over there so we need to talk about it ahead of time so for me it was important that for the eyes to know that we have to maintain the moral high ground because there's a very few things that separate us from our enemy when you get down to it you're both killing you're both killing each other and there has to be something that makes it different for us and that's maintaining the moral high ground we do not deliberately target civilians that's a big differentiation they they target civilians on purpose to get the political end that they want so that is a huge differentiator right there the torture thing is so interesting because of definitions so is making someone uncomfortable torture right is waterboarding torture is that tort well they did it to my sere class here is survival evasion resistance escape and we all go through this training back then when I went through it it was based on Vietnam you're a type experiences that people had had in in Vietnam and it's morphed a little bit over time but I it's they waterboarded people and they water poor people in my class if you did something that they thought the instructors thought would get you killed in real life or get somebody else killed in real life so being a model prisoner it did not happen to me but to my buddy he got waterboarded because you did something that the instructors thought would get you could it's crazy they put you in this prison camp or they're speaking a different language a made-up language their sights that you look like you're in a prison camp because it's built like that there smells they're cooking weird things so the smells feel like you're in a different country so all these different sensory inputs are telling you that you're not in the United States anymore and you get slapped around they call it camp slapping so you're gonna slap it around so which is different but you get waterboard if you do something wrong so is that torture a torturing US service members it's making them uncomfortable for a while so these definitions are very important when we start talking about some buddy in sitting in a corner and yours in there they're in that seat position and they're not sleeping or keeping them up at night is that torture well we kept blood students up in SEAL training for almost a week so is that torture I I guess its self-imposed only we're all volunteering to do it this guy's not volunteering to sit there in the corner but we also snatched him off the battlefield and we think you might have some information and it's putting him in an uncomfortable seated position is that torture some would say yes so it's crazy in that when it becomes politicized and the enemy gets to use it and when I say an enemy I also talk mean all their social media type networks all journalists that are sympathetic to the cause or whatever as soon as that can be morphed and called torture and become a distraction and become something that undermines the mission as a whole then you have to look at it and say okay what are we getting by what we're doing in Guantanamo what what what how versus how much is that hurting and helping the enemy's recruiting efforts and I don't know where that is I don't know what those numbers look like or where that tipping point is but as soon as the enemy can get something and use it for their own benefit like having black sites if we didn't know the black sites existed you know that would be wonderful but everyone knows that black sites exist it's explained black sites it's just a a base that is typically set up by another government agency with the knowledge of a different government and so it's not in the United States it's not on US soil to let the other government do the things that they can do that we can't essentially so it's off the books type site but everyone knows what it is because it's been on cover of the page of the New York Times and everywhere else as soon as that becomes something that the enemy can then leverage at what point do does does it hurt us more than help us to have those and at what point does it hurt us more than help us to quote unquote torture someone or continue waterboarding or to put somebody in these seated positions and to have that be the distraction and I don't know the answer but it's something that needs to be thought of and talked about and at the tactical level the guys have to know that we need to maintain that moral high ground that's the only thing in a lot of cases that differentiates us from the enemy and we have to hold that ground that's imperative so as leader you got to talk about it and the guys have to know that once you have somebody much like a police officer here in the States once they have you cuffed and you're on the ground like it's over like your job now becomes to protect that person that's how it has to be that's what makes us different that makes you different that criminal that makes us different from the enemy they're gonna if they have us in that position they're gonna behead us and they're gonna hold our heads up on TV and they're gonna use it for us our job is now to protect that person with our life that's the difference between us and the enemy at the base level so it's important to talk about that important for the guys to understand it so that when they're in that position it's a guy's first deployment and his friend is wounded or dead and he thinks this guy is behind it that he doesn't execute him when he has his hands cuffed behind him so it's important stuff to talk about important stuff to think about and and it's it's tough it's it's tough thing to grapple with and those those are the variables right public perception whether or not that perception or the knowledge of things that have been done could be used against our troops or used against our country as a whole and in social media and perception but the the idea that this is what would have driven me crazy about it is that those hard fast statements that torture doesn't work and I'm like which I don't know what you're saying yeah it probably works in some situations maybe not nothing I mean you know when people say that I'm like I bet I can get you to say yes better I can get you to tell me where your fucking car keys yeah no exactly like what are you saying right well of course they it works yeah like the idea that it does and then they'll say it and it's always really left-wing people that'll stay statistically torture doesn't work yeah what's do they say okay who's been keeping these stats since the beginning of time bitch have you ever seen any but or tchard like what are you talking about I kept you up you would tell me everything all I have to do is keep you up yep no I mean there's a reason people have been doing it from the beginning of time yeah some places it didn't work or whatever but at that outside that tactical level when we're talking about that next stage where the world knows about it where media knows about it where they're driving that story and they're helping the enemy by shining a light on these things that may or may not work doesn't matter whether it works or not it's it's detrimental at this point and whatever that point is then it's time to abandon it do you find that now that you're a prominent voice in the world of fiction authors and the fact that your your your novels have a lot to do with like real places and real things and real issues do you get asked questions do you do get asked to give statements or get have your opinion on things where you have to kind of measure it and go is there a benefit to this is there a risk to like to be talking about yeah am i alienating people or is this something where you can use your your your knowledge in your position as a platform to kind of like give your perspective on things from an educated point of view yeah so it's it's for me it is very it's hard for me not to tell the truth like I'm the worst liar on earth and my wife will tell you so it it's very natural for me to answer honestly but then also to be thoughtful and that's why they're not novels I think also another reason they resonated with Simon & Schuster is because it's thoughtful violence that's how I think of it it's not just shoots the guy than E or whatever it's thoughtful violence which is why those tear this torture scenes are so intricate and involved - that one with the Russian mobsters hey yeah there's some good ones I won't come with that to be a kind of homework of this series is that there are things that people haven't seen before and it's not just extra violence it's thoughtful violence so I don't worry about alienating it's it's more about me being honest because people can tell like if you especially today like maybe twenty years ago you could have hidden it but you behind managers and reputation minute what ever you call it today you can't really hide if you're on social media like I think eventually if you have a thousand some posts people are gonna glean and you're doing it and it's not obvious that it's just a manager that's doing it and it's a picture of you know you or not really it's not you it's obvious it's not you I'm talking about what it's obvious it's you it's hard I think to not be authentic and to let something slip through yeah I think eventually yeah I think I mean and you can see things that aren't appropriate you're like oh my why would this person say that well you know why because it's that like that's that's why like people don't understand the ramifications of posting things that and like you were saying how you got brought in by NCIS that one thing could be taken out of context yeah and used against you in a really weird way oh yeah and I used to think oh no we're on the same side and you know it's all about know people are after a win really disturbing revelation oh it was and that's why that book is so powerful in that scene why how those guys go down is still violent because it was therapeutic for me I didn't have to actually go out and do it myself I guess we were on the pages of a thriller but for me it's interesting so I do get asked I am I do go on different shows now as military analysts they ask me things and I answer honestly and I try to do it in a thoughtful way so example being the was the CEO of the Roosevelt that was relieved last couple weeks because he wrote this letter and you know it's framed by senior level officials as he sent out essentially I can open letter it sounded made it sound like he sent it out to his entire address book and he went above the chain of command and so he was fired it didn't go through the right proper channels and it smelled weird to me from the beginning because you don't get to be in command of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier by being like just some guy right like you know the military you're in for like 25 years at this point you're a captain and I would be shocked if he had not exhausted every other Avenue to try to get out what he needed to have done and he's responsible for fighting that aircraft carrier he's also responsible for the men under his command and he and now we have like 900 cases on that ship that's to explain to people the the ship was infected yep so they had a couple cases I think they had three to start with on an aircraft carrier at a docked in Thailand or something like that you know maybe in January early February something like that before really things got out of control so you're an aircraft carrier and the only place worse than a ship in a circumstance like this was an infectious disease is probably a submarine but he saw what was happening and he saw it starting to spread he saw it as saw that it was impossible to abide by social distance distancing guidelines and once you do when you actually have it not just social distancing but once you have it how you isolate somebody impossible to do on a ship and so he saw that and then the story is that he wrote a letter out a letter and it got picked up by the Chronicle in Northern California and that just went out to this huge number of people so went out to 20 people it was I've read the letter it's four pages it's very very well done very thoughtful it gives two courses of action one up we're at war and how we can keep fighting the ship and two if we're not at war need to take care of these guys and be ready for when war comes so it's very clearly delineated in these four pages very professional it's on Navy letterhead and it went out to 20 people and for me I thought you know what this is very strange that that he's being attacked like this from senior level leaders making it seem like he's sending out to his entire like gmail address book now it's still US Navy dot mil or whatever it's not a secret it's a secret communication but there's official Navy emails that aren't secret as well and yeah it bypassed the chain of command I guess but that at some point I think is his responsibility he's to keep that ship fighting and who knows what the personal relationship was between him and the guy above him or whatever I think there's something investigation will show it and now that and then the the Secretary of the Navy flies from Washington DC to Guam to give a speech to these people on the aircraft carrier and he says that the captain has just been relieved of duty was either stupid or incompetent if he thought that what he wrote in that email wasn't gonna get out to the press meanwhile the ironic part is that whole thing is videotaped that whole speech is taped and there's audio that makes it out to the media so that's the funny part for me but then also so then he's fired a couple days later oh geez and then the Secretary of the army or the secondary defense now writes a letter an open letter that says essentially the same thing as the captain of the aircraft carrier wrote a few days earlier the got him fired so it's really interesting I went on some of these some of these shows and got to sit down with a couple different people with military backgrounds and I was the only one saying that something doesn't smell right here and this guy has a responsibility to fight that ship to support his his soldiers our sailors and something's just not right about this and now we'll see what happens but but point being yeah I do get asked about these things and I answer honestly because the one of the other guys were saying on this show was that no train of command he didn't follow the chain of command and he should have followed that chain of command regardless you know the typical Navy type loner but being from Special Operations and being a free thinker as we're supposed to do let's be creative we're supposed to think you think read sell things from the enemy's side think about it from that side of the house and do what what we do which is why we can trouble a lot of the time in Special Operations because we're kind of not military and I mean we're military but you know we like to like to not break the rules we like to bend them to a certain extent to get what we need done and that's just very natural for us but when you're sitting down with people aren't like that don't think that way it's kind of interesting but point being I do get asked about these things and I don't really measure it against if I can alienate people or not it's just that I would be honest and be open I would be authentic and that's what people can trust about me and they can trust about my writing is that when they read that they know that I just didn't get it from somebody else like it's a part of me somehow and it's very personal even though it's fiction and that's what you can trust and if my protagonist is using a certain weapon or a certain knife or a sir it's not just that I googled Navy SEAL knife and someone or someone saying and then he pulled out his Navy SEAL dagger instead like no that's not how it goes you're know exactly who made it with a relationship all that sort of thing so what people can trust is that they're gonna get my honest assessment that's what I owe the guys in the teams I owed them my honest assessment that's what I would the people above me in the chain of command no matter what it did I owe them my honest assessment because that's what they could trust they didn't have to worry about whether I'm just telling them something just because I think that's what they want to hear where I'm looking to get ahead because I've never wanted this to be a career in the military I was just in there to fight and delete but that's what they can trust who's my honest assessment and so that's how I deal with today I'm just gonna answer honestly but it will be thoughtful it's not going to be like an off the cuff craziness that I haven't have to go back and retractor I hope it's not gonna be it's gonna be thoughtful because that's what I that's what I owed that guy's also was that thoughtful assessments both up and down the chain so that's just natural for me to do and what you're gonna get today well this mindset in this the the discipline and the authenticity it comes out in your writing man I know I started with the last one and I have to start yeah you were a little bummed out that I was like starting with the last one right well the most people get invested in the character like people ask me like can I start with this third one and the publisher wants me to say yes start with the third one now let me tell you you could absolutely start with the third maybe I'll be more invested if I start with the first I don't know man but the third one was fucking great I loved it and I'm gonna get into the first two now listen you knocked it out of the park man it was amazing amazing book I'm excited to read the first two now people can follow you is it Jack Carr USSR USA on the socials most active on Instagram and Twitter there is a Facebook but three was too much so USA and then official Jack are calm is the is the website and people can go deep dive into weapons or knives or gear on that sort of thing so
