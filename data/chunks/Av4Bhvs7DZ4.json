hello freak bitches hey Rory what's up buddy hey Joe how are you doing this man appreciate it seriously I really appreciate you having me dude you have a fucking amazing story you have a Hollywood success story it's you yes very it's the it's pretty get this face another one of my other everywhere sweetman's I'm to you up turn that off for a second I got to do something no I it's that it's very unhallowed in the sense that I was in New York and working at the Daily Show which is next to the horse stables for Central Park yeah I should say it's a great showbiz store I guess so yeah it's it went from being like a PA to the executive producer The Daily Show yeah that's fuckin awesome yeah well it was good it was not the I didn't know that that was gonna happen I got a job wanted to do comedy I wanted to do stand-up but I went to college so I felt we were coming out of college and tell my parents I was just like never all that money and stuff like I'm just gonna tell jokes like my I come from like my dad's like an old-school Italian guy like he doesn't understand this kind of stuff he's like what what about a job you know what I mean like get a job like he would run happier if I said I was gonna be like a mailman or an electrician like that would have made more sense than a job in TV so or comedy in general so I got the job fearing like that could at least justify the love of comedy that sort of makes sense like look I'm working in serious business well yeah at least television shows were very successful well at least I had to go somewhere you know I think that was a big part of it it was like what do you do in the morning when the alarm goes up oh you don't have to get up in the morning cuz just work at night and calm because of what yeah well I don't know the comics that we know that don't do anything during during it I mean they just fuck off completely I totally get on stage which I which I'm always quite jealous of actually you know I I but I always had that feeling when people go how do you do both I'm like well you know one's there in the day you know so that's a one way to do both though as I got older I got more tired at night it's harder to go out and do clubs after the daily show it is right it's a hardest thing in the world when you when you're on a set not the hardest in the world look compared to anything else it's really easy it's easy as fuck but I mean it's hard to work what I was gonna say it's harshly in the world to work a full time job and then try to go out and pursue something because you're all your your juice is gone yeah so yeah if you're I mean anything you're trying to do that's like athletes that have full-time jobs like fighters that have full-time jobs fuck that's hard and that's even harder because they have hours of training they have to put in every day but just when you're done at the end of the day you're done you want to get a bite to eat watch TV sit if you don't want to Xavier your notes and fucking yet were that for me the other thing was to is still not even at a place where like I walk in with Club and they're like go just get right up usually they're like why don't you clean up this mess at 1:30 a.m. yeah but I so for me it was a lot of it was just I love doing the time but sometimes you gotta hang out at the club and then you know it's like yeah my bigger problem was because then I have fun hanging out with other comics and I have afterwards I have a couple drinks next thing I know I the harder problem was getting up the next moment if you know were three hours right so that's where I started to have that you know well I'm doing the thing that was good about my day job is it got me better at comedy so I didn't really lose the like sort of experience I think I would have gotten onstage what I didn't get by doing it every night for a while was uh you know like seasoned onstage it took me a little longer to get like comfortable onstage get back into the groove yeah exactly yeah yeah but uh still it was a good experience piet√† EP was fun that's amazing that's one of those stories that you're gonna ruin the expectations for every fucking kid I have to say at the Daily Show because it's been on so long at Jon's such a cool guy and like really gave people opportunities there I was among the first people to kind of make that journey but now have not been the only one like I'm writer there was a PA that's amazing bunch of the EPS and Kobe peas itself or peers yeah like wow people can't come if it's like you know that's like a farm system almost for good writing and producing it's pretty cool that's fantastic yeah and it's become like for a lot of people how they get the news yeah that's a problem isn't that weird yeah that's how people get the new Jon Stewart yeah people tell me that a lot they say where I get my news and I get it like I remember being in college we go to college kids get their news I feel like I didn't even watch the news when I was in college like I don't know you're in college you know yeah so I guess it's better than nothing but uh I always tell people it's a good place to start to get interested in a topic and then go off and do your own research or whatever you want because when people get into political debates off of like emails and like daily show clips and they're like that's actually not true it's like it you know they don't have like a real understanding of each story necessarily you know yeah it's a weird thing isn't it when you're when when you're doing a television show that's also an educational show and also has like a very progressive point of view a very is what you would think of when you think of Jon Stewart's like very intelligent very progressive mocking of both the left and the right when they do ridiculous shit yeah yeah but it's got to be funny sure I mean that's it's that's a hard job yeah well it's really hard for him for me it was a lot easier because I got to watch him do well I have another thing about Jon that's amazing is he does all he's involved from 9 a.m. through the end of the show obviously when he hosts it but in other words she's so intimately involved and he's so smart he's so sharp that like when he's in the chair I never worried about a joke not working right even when they didn't work he just would like call an audible in his own head and then like remember a joke from like the 90 and meeting that he liked that didn't make the script and throw that in or it's pretty amazing to watch him - sitting in the studio because he'll change a joke in prompt her as a prompter scrolling and then later there's a callback to the joke he changed and he remembers to change the callback or skip the callback and I'm like and I'm sitting there with the script watching the prompter going oh no I'm like oh no here comes the callback like we're screwed you know and then he just jumps it or tags it with the joke it's amazing yeah it's really like watching what he's been doing it for that long - I mean he's fucking smooth he's so used to that gig like for Jimmy Fallon or me for Seth Meyers to try the same sort of impromptu ad-lib they might pull it off but Jon Stewart's been doing it forever yeah forever and ever oh no doubt and he also uh yeah he just and he also just knows a lot it was a good comic to start doing yeah he's a great comic but he also just knows he understands comedy in a way that I'm sure those you know I know both Seth and Jimmy super funny guy I just never worked with him that capacity so I know John understands it like music you know what I'm saying oh god no that won't work this will work right you know and people go how do you know something's gonna work before you try it and it's like you just gotta know how do you just kind of know well he also has a very specific voice he knows his voice you know his style of delivery absolutely it's um it's it's an it's a fascinating show because it's very political but yet very funny it's he doesn't sacrifice like going for funny yeah like to try to look like less silly or try to look dignified he's not trying to monologue it yeah he's just making this stuff as funny as you can and sometimes he gets extremely animated and it's fucking hilarious yeah well yeah I mean he's he's he's versatile in that sense like he can really do and he do any comedy yeah and but yeah as far as it I think it's because it really is and people this always bothers people so much I always want to go oh what they think the Daily Show is that can agenda is like we're all sitting around in a circle be like how do we screw the right no it doesn't it's people don't believe that in the go you're just hiding behind the fact that it's a comedy shows go no doing comedy is really hard there's nothing a hot like we still have to take the stories we still try to get everything right we have people who fact check there's a guy there named Adam Chodak off who's like just a guru of information and will come in to the rewrite room between rehearsal in the show after we change the joke and I go you can't say this this way because it's statistically inaccurate to like sometimes I'm like yeah man know what I'm saying it's not even it was a worse so we really fact check stuff that goes that but the you know so we it really a big part of the day is figuring out how to tell the story the narrative and then adding the jokes is why you have you know writers and guys like John you know right just then you can pile on the funny but funny is the most important thing there really is that's what's so funny that's why we state so long because it's like a I don't know that's there's no like movement happening there's just a comedy show well that's why everybody who gets so attached to it it's so crazy it's like if they want it almost to be more ideologically driven than it is ya know it's like people would they would want it if he said something ridiculous supportive in support of Obama they would like it sure but if Obama fucks up he goes after him too all the time yeah I mean that's the thing yeah the show really became what it is or what people think of it is now during the Bush administration mmm so I think people really associate being this like hardcore left-wing show and it definitely slants left I mean it's hard sometimes for it not to with in comedy because everything that's when you're pointing out some things are just straight-up absurd yeah it's hard sometimes not to seem left because you're throwing away like right you know so I think that's why people go why don't people do a right wing Daily Show it's like it's not really a left or right thing it's just a lot of times comedy is dismissive of people taking themselves too seriously and conservatives have a tendency to take things very seriously you know what I'm saying that's exactly what they are they're conservative exacting it more centered atomic by nature is the guy sitting in the back of the classroom man like look at this dick you know it's just like you don't really care you know what the person's saying you're just finding places to to get a laugh and I think so for us when the left does absorb things which is also quite frequent like Occupy Wall Street yeah was a perfect example of my favorite times at the Daily Show well we're like ripping the left a new asshole and the audience I'm in the studio or used to be and the audience is like what this is our movement man and he's up there Zippy's over there Jon Stewart for president t-shirts you know they're like oh shit and for me it was like we crushed those dudes and then I'd go to the desk between commercials and we'd be like yeah you know you know it's a stand-ups mentality like you feel the crowd like I just came back from Madison Wisconsin this weekend and it's an amazing city like the club isn't awesome the shows were so fun but there was groan there were groans for the crowd on certain things I would say cuz it was this college town right and colleges now are really like I know that's like a taboo right when thing to say but there's a left-wing political correctness in college now that is extreme extreme and I remember like ten years ago doing a college egg is very different than now you make a joke about people like whoa and that was happening in Madison and there's you know as a comic right like you feel that from the crowd and you go wait what just yeah and then you you know you want to like poke it a little bit so on the daily show John is a comic but we hit it when we hit a note on something we were going after Hillary you know eight same thing go what are you guys doing I don't know doing what we do making fun of people who are in charge laughs you know they sorry you don't it's selective outrage
