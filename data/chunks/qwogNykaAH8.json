well you know Alcoholics Anonymous was created by a guy who's into LSD yeah Bill W a real mean bowler Jamie I want to show you through your sweater and saw a bad sweater it's what shirt you're wearing it's very cool but this is a this is a symptom of everything is wrong go ahead are we on yet yeah we're on it's got fake short sleeves it's got fake short sleeves over long sleeves so the the short sleeves are sewed in so that's not so it's not attached how does it work then the short sleeves are top it comes apart but this sleeve part up there's not at all it's separate so it's two pieces yeah I didn't know that when I bought it either but when you pull the sleeve up what happens Oh goes all the way over the top oh so do you wear the two of them together or they I just saw it on I just bought it there's a whole rocky thing that this company did they had a whole bunch of pieces and I was like oh that's kind of cool so Sylvester Stallone is slated to come on the podcast you will wear that correct and he's here please okay all right so is that but that the upper shirt is just laid over the tops shorts long sleeve shirt so you could wear one without the other like you could wear the short sleeve 100 case just to sweatshirts you know but it's a it's the training montage oh it comes is it heavy or is it light it is not light at all I'm starting to sweat right now that we should the store but that'll make you stronger if you got a heavy shirt we are here and if some shit goes down I may have to bolt from the podcast yeah because there's mandatory evacuations all around here really yeah yeah what is the word live all in Ventura County there's all these mandatory of bees yeah honey bees is it really yeah they're making too much honey mudslides oh wow I didn't know that yeah I had to pull off La Cienega one time that a bunch of bees on there what yeah huge hives man Wow and you see you know a lot of homeless people and they don't do anything but when be show up fucking get to doing shit you know that's one thing I noticed quickly yeah yeah isn't it interesting how they get motivated by bees yeah these will motivate anybody yeah you know you know you know you're not all cracked out once the bees show up dude I watch the bees communicate with each other once I was on the set of Fear Factor and we covered these people with bees and then a neighboring colony a colony that actually lived their local colony came and we're like what are you guys doing here and the bees all flew up in the sky together and sorted it out in the sky really was wild we had the guy told us like the beekeeper he's like everybody's gonna stand down we got to back up get out of the area look what so yeah they have to communicate I thought he was joking let them do it huh yeah he's like they have to talk it out like well they talk what are they gonna say there's something going on with them that we you know we just kind of subtly we sort of get what they do yeah yeah they're kind of like little little kind of liaisons it seems like like a wonderful in the future we'll know that like certain animals can like you know take messages around for us and like if you told an animal something could go tell you know like I wonder if we'll start using animals more because animals are we don't use them that much I mean they were sitting around most of the time right I've read something about they were trying to encode information in DNA we could ask Mike Tyson about his pigeons yeah I think that's different though Kerri edges up attentions just to carry for long how about Game of Thrones yeah Sam yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure but whatever for whatever reason it makes more sense with birds Yeah right like a bird seems like you should be able to train it a little bit Oh bird you could train some birds I think some birds I think would do their own thing let me ask you this if you had an important message would you just send one raven that's what I never got how about you sent a fly what are you crazy look at that god damn think it's eaten what have an eagle Jack someone along the way the fate of your kingdom is at hand sir yeah yeah he can't put that on the back of one bird did I would send a bird nobody would expect you know like a little Warbler something on nightingale oh that's a good move yeah you got to send a bird that nobody wants to shoot though you like to shoot birds I will - dude we had owl two Thanksgivings ago we had two hours at my sister's house yeah I saw one last night actually did you yeah it was pretty no no lesson tonight before us it was pretty fucking cool I pulled into the driveway and owl took off it was big - it's gross I think owls the meat the oh you ate them you saying yeah but the he has a towels yeah I think that's legal I shouldn't say that on the podcast well I didn't have a lot Murray used to have a joke about it I don't know - I don't know even spit it out I'm not even joking you smoke that weed and they had to they didn't have all the thing they don't have a lot of meat on them it there I fucking know like owls they're predators they're important yeah you don't have rats everywhere yeah but you know they're I think they're violent then they're dirty and they they get this owls whoever did their PR you notice everybody thinks they're smart and they can read and they're like yeah they had a good PR yeah right yeah look at that we only got one up Jimmy but see how much little meat is on him you think there's more look at he's kidding he's kidding folks he's not eating owls the one in the middle looks like it's from another planet you know yeah yeah and that's what that's what it really looks like that's what it looks like underneath all that fluff yeah little alien Raptor creature I was like a crab looks like a crab I was driving home when one was flying above me on the road and dropped a rabbit he had got a rabbit and jacked it and was flying with the rabbit and as he was flying just decided like maybe he decided the car was too close to him what was too loud or somebody they just dropped that rabbit fuck it and I stopped the car and check it out I was like whoa this flirting really it sounds like flirting how alert drops a rabbit at your feet a bitch yeah it's ready to fuck probably yeah like an offering look at God for you more with that came the Predators man they we never thought of them growing up as predators yeah that's why they told us they were wise they had to have that monocle like fucking like Budd Friedman yeah need the improv remember like that planners peanut Budd Friedman from evening improv his whole deal was yeah no I was I loved evening the improv when I was a kid or saw it oh man that was like one of the reasons where I got into stand-up comedy I still watch these TV shows they had syndicated TV shows that they would do you know vh1 had won MTV at the half-hour comedy hour and what time did it come on it I don't remember man you don't remember that was Budd but it was probably night he looks like that planners nut but angry when that guy was one of the owners he sold it eventually and chicheng cashed out got from Brian Friedman in the left corner oh that's a different dude yeah interesting a lot of Friedman's out there but anyway Budd ran he was the host of evening at The Improv and he would come out with that monocle go back to that monocle picture again lower-left BAM that was him see you see Google Budd Friedman evening at the improv that's what it okay yeah nice guy real real nice guy yeah he was yeah a real nice guy oh he's always a sweetheart to me always very very friendly he was a very gregarious guy and he basically was one of the original owners of the improv and evening at the improv I don't know I don't know the full history of the improv I probably should but I think I want to say it started out New York yeah because I know there were there were ones everywhere at one point time they had one in Boston for a little bit and improv yeah yeah they had one in Boston and then they changed it to a different name yeah it started Hell's Kitchen in 1963 yeah so that was probably one of the original stand-up comedy clubs probably one of the top two or three do you have a favorite like a club when you were like doing clubs more together like a favorite one I was just happy to get on stage back then you know I mean I had favorite ones like Nick's comedy stopped was always a favorite in Boston right stitches but stitches moved a couple of times stitches moved twice what about any of the funny buns or did you go to any of those places yeah but the arc for the Boston clubs the comedy connection was the big one and now that's the Wilbur theater it's really weird because it used to be the smallest club in town and everybody wanted to work it it was like a hundred whoa I want to say they get stuff maybe 150 people in there but I mean ain't stuffed I mean this room this this ceiling was low you know I mean I'm 5/8 and I remember I could a pretty sure I could touch the ceiling so this shit is low so if you were like Owen Smith yeah or you know someone talk about a long haul yeah like yeah it's a big ass stage for you like big people would look real weird on that stage yeah but the laughs would be so contained it was no low ceiling and tight I love that I love hey I saw Hicks there for the first time first time I ever saw him was there I was like whoa he was doing this bit about Jimi Hendrix meeting Tiffany at the mall Tiffany the ama singer oh yeah the shoes real popular then I think we're alone oh yeah yeah that song I make you just be a wreck I remember being on the school bus so fucking erect bra dude I remember that shit bro did I love being erect and I was young man now it's whatever now it's whatever now I have to do something now what do you know what does my dick need me to do right so you eat now yeah so I'll tell you this if you want to feed a family of four you can't just have one hour I will say that huh well if you look at what it looks like without the feathers it looks like some same fucking demon yeah you know it's a real bait and switch I feel like it's one of God's hidden agendas well I was talking to someone about peacocks about this I started talking about on stage like peacocks are pretty but if it took their feathers off you'd want to kill it with a hammer yeah what is that fuck is that it wouldn't let that thing anywhere near your kids well look yeah ox have their feathers on you let your kids get right close to them oh yeah but beauty talk with no feathers yeah dark skin like charcoal cover this Garrity and the little nubs all over it oh look fuck look at dad looks like he's a lame murderer looks like a little twink out on the town a little creepy murder a little probably a little gray and pink murderer well is that what it looks like what Maine oh whoa is that real oh my yeah that's a duck bro it says pecan right cock picture they have a different head go back to that peacock picture that you just have home line okay that's a totally different head Leah beak shape different yes beautiful head that's the problem with the internet yeah okay then so hard to tell that's a duck son who is yeah yeah those are ducks maybe it's on that page or something like that well it says right there said feathers ripped from live birds didn't ripping the feathers off peacock yo Hicks a nice guy what was he like that you need to meet him I met him like hi oh yeah hey so I was I was an open mic er oh yeah you know he ain't gonna talk to me yeah it's like you know I say hi to everybody I've run into like door guys I always try to say hi to everybody yeah cuz I remember what it was like when I was an open mic ER and seeing these guys who I couldn't even talk I couldn't even imagine that we were the same thing mmm couldn't talk to them you know what I mean the big comedians you mean fuck yeah like Bill Hicks would come into town I didn't want to say hi to him gonna be super annoying right cuz then what are you back it up but that was always my thing I was so stupid back then too I'm not pretty dumb now but I was really done back then yeah there was no way I had anything to say to that dude you think there was a time you life you were the dumbest that you'd ever been a couple weeks ago no I don't know man but I definitely have more data to work with now but I forgotten a lot of shit too but like you think there's generally a time in people's lives when they what they should know kind of and the there's like a kind of like a middle ground where maybe it doesn't well for sure when I was in my early 20s for sure when I was in my 20s like deep into my you know it took me into my 30s to kind of fucking shit shake my head loose and figure out what the fuck I was doing yeah dude you're 20 bro when you think about twenties right no Direction no idea whether or not this comedy thing was gonna work out I'm like what am i doing yeah I'm telling jokes Jesus Christ yeah and then telling people when you go back home and they've never seen you they've never heard of you they think you're gay it's like you won't like they're like you keep flying home you don't have any money and you're not bringing a girl home yeah these jokes yeah you're hiding from something you know just come out I remember my stepdad he's yelling at me in the yard one time so what did you come out yeah I was like I'm not fucking gay bro like I'm just not flying some girl home that I just met you know just to prove to you guys catch it a lie yeah thought maybe he was gonna leave eh yeah like I set a trap yeah he's gonna set a trap yeah I was setting a trap yeah he's like a slick boxer that's one of the reasons why young boys will always accuse each other being gay because it's so hard to prove you're not yeah what someone says you're gay yeah you take that off me either that's crazy if the worst has got to be if someone says you're gay and you are but you don't want to oh yeah at least yet yeah you change your clothing next day he'd come dressed like in a Mafia outfit or something like something - totally take him hot off the trail you know you just wish you could say you were yeah you know you wish you could say you were I think now you can I think I think she can a lot of places I mean I would love to think that everybody's like the people that are around us where they literally don't give a fuck yeah Justin Martindale or look our language is funny and after that it's cool to be around those are the things that are most valuable in our world funny and cool to be around right those two things okay someone's funny and cool to be around we don't give a fuck if you're a guy or girl trans gay yeah funny ghost cool the beer yeah do you think this ghost at the Comedy Store I III don't know I have some friends or the other day I was trying to give them the whole tour yeah I tell them how it used to be Ciro's nightclub on it I didn't take them all the way but I showed them you know you go through the back room of the main room that that used to be like their hideout and shit I told them about all the ghost stories that have been filmed there but I don't believe it I don't think it's real well I think I'm surprised we don't have more ghosts you know what I think I think it's you this is what I think for real I think when you I think you can probably tune in to something that happened in a place that's what I think and I think if you trip yourself out you could see things that aren't really there and I think that it is entirely possible the ghosts aren't real but that you seeing a ghost is real yeah that I think that you can get your body into like such a frenzied terrified state and if you are open to the idea that the ghost is a real thing your mind can fuck with you yeah like the ghetto boys your mind's playing tricks on me yeah that's what I think I think legitimately and I also think that if you hit the right frequency I bet you get whole ups like it's just a ghost of a memory of someone getting killed in a place right or something horrible happening just the ghost of a memory no I think that's next that's one of the next things you're gonna be able to do like a gang sign in the air a special gang sign and then a fucking the truth is gonna pop out right in front of you like I think we're gonna start to learn a Harry Potter type shit yes or like maybe a song what if the sir a certain like playing of us lyrics hurt our notes in a row would reveal like the past right in front of you like I wonder if there's some you know magic little warp holes or something well well think about what music does do music literally changes the way your body feels like a drug like if you were a kid okay and you heard that rocky song dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah you could run faster you would get more fired up you'll be able to do more push-ups or let your step there don't say it do it yeah but you will probably a lot of dudes probably but the point is you would for sure get energy from that like a drug yes that was a cup of coffee and go like whoa this coffee is good right you hear that song yeah put up that video the other day oh yeah that I reposted vibrations and yeah if you look deep into this topic of vibrations and symbols that come out and like explain what we're talking about the I posted it on my Instagram I reposted it because it's really fascinating this is black man it's it seems like it's just a mat that's charged yeah vibrated let's explain what's happening for the people who just not gonna play this video cuz they're probably taking down it's got a lot of views there's lots of different versions of this online it says amazing amazing amazing resonance experiment so they put some st. as its and this is probably salt okay they put some sort of powdered stuff sand or salt onto a black mat that's charged and then they send certain Hertz through it this one's 3835 Hertz and then it makes a different patterns crazy on the look at this 3975 like every time they change the Hertz it has a different paddle the 4049 look at this pattern so the spirits are wait that's unbelievable but yeah and these are also you can take these numbers and these can also be notes that's a dark evening on a piano or used to hearing or singing right so these can also be recreated in other ways and are probably happening right and to us you know that's not like maybe one of those earworm here like Victor you're in the back your neck vibrate or something like that what if a certain Hertz just spelled you're like your grandparents name well what's interesting is that each one of them are different geometric patterns there are these beautiful patterns they're gorgeous and as you change the Hertz the patterns morph immediately yeah and but the thing is they're kind of fractal like not fractal but they they seem to be what's the word e equal in both sides is that way that this word I'm looking for mmm parallel no no I think you were you're on the right topic if the numbers a little more round like a round number these are not specific Hertz like if you do a specific likes winds different than identical but anyway both sides are exactly the same and it's separate in this one they're not it's not separated in a half it's it's it's all like the circle is the center it all goes out from there but they're different every time but they're all even like see it looks the only thing that's keeping it from being perfect is that they run out of sand and it looks like the power is centered around the center part where the wires are connected to so that's the most potent but silicon beautiful so that may like thing if you think about that like in a if there's a certain Hertz going through the air like in space yeah then it would form like a solar system I guess one better the feeling that you get from like Rocky right the feeling that you get from that saw that things go your body yes yeah it could literally could be like a little drug look think about why people like music so much because that musician is your drug deal yeah okay you hear like some old Elton John like you're in your car and Saturday night comes on your fucking goosebumps if you haven't heard that song in a long time and you don't expect it yeah oh fuck yeah Jesse had a friend that what makes you want a hat you know that's a good song - yeah but five is good this was done with Mike I was staying with musical notes Wow on water we're looking at the thing it says the cyma scope is that how you say that saya cym a scope uses a high definition camera to monitor the effects of an individual sounds particular vibrations on purified water revealing for the first time what piano notes look like ah there are people out there so much more than you and me oh yeah oh god it's it's amazing that we're considered the same thing you know as what smart people just really smart people yeah I have someone like Sean Carolyn the physicist and he has to break down particle physics and shit to you you like is it hard it doesn't even get in yeah does it I can repeat what he said yeah I don't the fuck it means when people start talking about quantum things in quantum theory and quantum particles as danger dude I don't get I don't trust that kind of stuff a lot of it well how about you know what superposition is it's the ultimate what the fuck or a particle can be in the state of motion and be still at the same time all right well good luck with that good luck yeah this magic world that you've created crazy scientists that I don't understand yeah I would rather do something more chill than that what the fuck something can see yeah sign up like or go for a run or something Oh being rather than study that or rather than be that particle oh rather than study that in bit yeah like I just think but don't you want someone to know because don't you benefit from cellphones well what about the such few people know that if they all wanted to lie to us then they could they would have to be conspiracy now you starting to sound like some other people it's funny that your body would do that the reason why they would never do that is because scientists whole deal is figuring out shit that other scientists didn't figure out that's like the best thing they can do the best thing a scientist can do is a real honest-to-goodness breakthrough would you have sex with a scientist you think yeah like a movie scientists like she keeps the glasses on yeah they're always blonde in the movies right sorry no sometimes a dark black hair too mysterious I bet they're clean - if you fuck a scientist you know I bet they have a clean apartment maybe but maybe not maybe their fucking brain is like that chalkboard with all the squiggly alien mathematics are that's true huh what shit tattoo does a bunch of dirty math tattooed on their puss I was reading another but I was reading this things about Richard Fineman you know who Fineman was fine was a scientist he was a physicist and there was an article about him like was Fineman an abuser but it was it was talking about Richard Fineman and how you know he's - you just his wife said he's just do nothing but calculations all day and then he wanted to play the bongos and he didn't want anybody to bother him but like he had a quote from one of his one of his books and it's crazy reading and it's like I just but see if he could find it because it's a really it's a crazy quote calling women bitches and I'm like what like that there were that that you know I just I don't want to paraphrase he's like I don't I don't I can't deal with these bitches around here so I think he was a funny guy right what I think it's hard it's hard when you see things in text because you think okay maybe he's like a really mean terrible person I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches that they aren't worth anything and that they're all in the all they're in there for is for to get you to buy him a drink and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing I'm not gonna be a gentleman to such worthless bitches and so on he writes C but I feel like and so on when someone says and so on that implies that this is taken out of context what does that mean and so on that means to me what I'm getting out of this if I if I was gonna guess is that he goes on he elaborates mmm he might say this is how I felt back then and obviously I changed my mind I mean he could have been eighteen when you talk about this or sixteen I don't know what the fuck right but he also could be very funny because he was apparently a very funny guy hmm so his the the title of his book is surely you're joking mr. Fineman oh that's nice then but if it was so like if one if someone said that but adopting all these bar girls or bitches if they said it funny mm-hmm could you see those those same more yeah I thought that all these balls are the bitches but it's all depending upon how old he is - or it could be that that's really how he was and maybe he got married maybe got in trouble his wife and he had to say this you know I don't think that's it I think he's talking about when he was younger but it's um I could see that though do you're at the bar if you don't like we're allowed music and all the girls are just drinking with a bunch of and I would be like oh these girls are a bunch of bitches probably yeah but that's a lazy way it is a lazy way thing and it just makes it it's you can judge and you can control the scenario yeah thing is look if you go into a room and ten girls are in there and seven of them are fucking super annoying and you say these bitches are all annoying you're being super rude to those three that aren't yeah and there might be some decent girls but that's why it's weird yeah it's like it's weird to hear a high-level famous scientist probably that I think in the article they were saying the second fit yeah beyond beyond Einstein he's the second famous most famous physicist especially a scientist because you think a scientist would know that there's a couple of these bitches could be variable right you know I am thinking this might have been a quote from him when he was young yeah that's crazy that he said that or him criticizing himself when he's young but I don't know I'm just guessing I was hoping that it would be that bad it's crazy to read that dude a lot sometimes I miss being young man don't you miss it sometimes well no and yes like it looks like fun to have no responsibility in to be 22 and be backpacking around the world or doing something silly and not having a place where you have to go or a bunch of bills but on the other hand I feel so fucking ridiculously lucky that I get to be a comedian right like I don't want to try to do this again yeah why would I try to do this when I'm doing this but yeah but to go back I just miss being young and like remember a nap man we took a nap and you were young it could last you fucking didn't care could last for three days yes but I think one of the secrets to happiness is to never look back at any point in your life and wish you were back there because a it's not possible right and B if you didn't go through that you wouldn't be you if you would go back now and be 22 again and broke and fucked up with all the information you have now he'd be like shit y'all don't know I had a fucking Netflix special you guys don't know I was killing it out there I decided to start over like an asshole now here I am oh yeah I'm young but I'm broke I can't even afford vitamins your right feet at the right food I can't afford AMA noodle I'm eating ramen noodle everyday I'm gonna start breaking joints yeah tear muscles and shit you're gonna be eat now yeah fucking catch squirrels in my yard that's when it gets bad I'm not used to being yelled at either I miss my body being young dude how old are you I'm 38 shut your mouth you're fine you just got a workout yeah you don't workout huh I just started getting back into it yeah that's all it is doing some yoga and I want to go try but resilient yet sit downtown slow down with that tear yourself in shape first yeah that's what I'm realizing my yeah my advice because if you trying to explode and get out of things look don't listen to me you can start you Jitsu and be in terrible shape and get in shape through jujitsu you can yeah absolutely but if I was going to advise someone I would say if you're gonna do something that's as physical as jujitsu I believe that you should armor your body what I mean by that is like your shoulders your knees your back your neck those are all areas that if you don't work out at all they could break susceptible they're susceptible so yeah I would always advise that someone does a bunch of calisthenics particularly like like the classics push-ups sit-ups bodyweight squats chin-ups those all those classics you do a lot of those get you just get your body accustomed to resistance training right do that first then I would move from the I would always start with a but with calisthenics always start with that and then from that move into weights do like some kettlebells take a couple of months you could take a couple months before you just jump right into jiu-jitsu if you don't have but if you're an athlete I mean you could just jump right in right if you're a guy already does basketball you already wrestle oh yeah jump right in but a guy who doesn't do any exercise at all yeah Jiu Jitsu so rough on you yeah I used to do exercise I'm and I used to do they we used to shoot up steroids on the side of the interstate when I was growing up shoot on the side of the road why wouldn't you go home I was more of an outdoor thing I felt like you know I don't want to bring that shit in the house but we would uh me and a buddy - do Billy conforto actually and he passed away r.i.p and he died he had a bunch of pills and actually drove into an embankment one time but um no oh yeah can you imagine some bad way to go and he but he was a busboy and I was a busboy and he would uh and yet we both like to go to the gym and he was like the first gay man that ever met and then he um you know he one time he got us some steroids or something I don't know I think everybody was doing them and then we just yeah we pull over and do and then just go to the gym you know do one time a guy in New York's I don't want to get some drugs the middle of the night he went came back three hours later with steroids he's like you want to walk in party Wow who's partying Mysterio like fog no bro okay I'm leaving tomorrow in New York I was there for about eight months how come so I was just kind of trying out the comedy scene there and see what it was like why'd you decide to leave mmm I don't know I guess that's one of like a new here's what it was I never wanted to get old and say that I didn't try it to go to LA to try New York - oh right - never have even just six months even just have like an experience there you know well it's a hotbed for sure the two hot beds right now are here and there yeah those are two hot beds and there's all this debate as to like which one's better or whatever it's silly it's that's a great hot bed yeah no denying that there's some world-class comedians over there and then there's ones that show up there and here like Chappelle he's always bounce bouncing back and forth Chris Rock was always bouncing back before Louie would news worked in in here but Louie's working again he's working at The Improv right now Lucy Kane San Jose yeah oh wow that's cool I think he's gonna sell out a world tour in like a year for sure for sure her next month even if we wanted to yeah for sure you know I mean it's it's interesting this whole bit about the parklands shooting you know you know yeah so that stirred up all this controversy that is so that's such a louis c.k bit it's interesting it's almost like people don't understand what kind of comedy he did right yeah like suddenly they forget who he was yeah if you look at his comedy you're not even surprised he was jerking off you know kind of room service sort of deal you know but he's he's his style has always been like that I mean that he's his style is always very irreverent yeah saying fucked up shit you can't believe he's saying and you know well written and well thought out stuff this is stuff he's working on and this is people like you know how could he joke it wasn't even that good he probably wrote it that day okay two days before who knows how many times done that bit but I guarantee you the guy takes ten months off of stand-up and then he's starting to do it again I don't he was scared I bet I don't think I would ever joke around about that I definitely wouldn't joke around about but you can yeah Nate I don't know if I would it just wasn't it wasn't his best stuff it wasn't good it's like it wasn't ready yeah but maybe he could have come up with a different turn on it where it wouldn't be as offensive and it would be way funnier that's what working on a bid is all about right like fuck look Holtzman Brian Holtzman if he had said that exact same thing that Louis said we would be howling yeah we'd be in the back of the room slapping the table howl and laughing yeah could you put the fucking fat kid in the way literally I love that guy that's a bit though if Holtzman said we would be crying we'd be slapping the table we'd all gather around and watch him write late nights would be an issue right it wouldn't be an issue at all because we know that it's humor is it yeah it's a fucked up thing to say that's kind of the point the whole art form is about saying things that are funny sometimes saying things that are funny are self-deprecating so sometimes they're fucked up yeah they're always different sometimes saying things is they're funny is really adorable yeah someone will say something it's real adorable but also hilarious yeah or your act this is odd odd and hilarious just very very Theo von yeah if I had to describe your act I'd say it's very Theo von really yeah it's you you know how to do it but it's like everybody does it different folks and you know you take a set from someone who's just working stuff out and you pretend that this is done he's probably half those words he's saying he's probably trying to be in the moment he's probably got a place to go kind of got some punchlines and hoping that he'll see something in it while he's doing it and working it out yes and then you listen to the recording and you go why did I say it that way why did I do this and you change that and add this and it's it's to learn yeah and then you know it just can't expect them all to be good either like immediately especially when the guys been on trial like you know or been you know under that social pressure and or just like you know in you know probably been dealing with remorse and going to self I don't know I mean who knows what he's been doing this is mine this is my take on a lot of this and I think this is an important thing to say we can't lose our empathy we can't lose our compassion we have we have we should be compassionate towards victims we could we should be compassionate towards each other we should be this this tendency to want to stop people from working and being like there's a certain amount of time where it passes and it starts to look like you don't want anyone to have a path to redemption right which is everyone's got to have a path to read have to because we're all faulty yeah all human but there was an article about it that I just retweeted today from Nick Christakis who is a professor at Yale i retweeted it today earlier in its about call out culture and these people that got called out for things and how it destroyed their lives people that you don't even know yeah it's one small park scene where these these two people got called out for stuff but it's like with a subscription that got us with the subscription hmm gotta subscribe in New York Times bro you got to pay for good journalism I pay mmm this account actually if you want to use much you have you have a times I don't I think I do I had one but I tried to renew the other day and I couldn't because these cunts stole my fucking American Express card and I didn't get my new one yet who did the people where some fucking piece-of-shit criminals yeah charged up shit one of them was Toys R Us in India oh wow okay good I love seeing what people charge when they do steal from you it's kind of fun isn't it isn't it crazy you're like pissed that they stole be like oh wow alignment was one dollar they got an ottoman a lot of it was a one dollar Cronos like what are you doing if you bang that maybe they bang the card out for like a hundred $1 or maybe it's got a snatch knows you're running places to get a snack get a gum get uh it was all it was all online you know uh I bought a ricci or something the other day was 88 cents yeah that would be a stupid thing to hit someone's card for you'd want to get a jewel yeah really expensive a pen yeah I'm up for that 29 bucks how crazy though that that that's the future that now it's like that like I was thinking the other day that having a baby inside of your body this was gonna be like the last yeah that's becoming retro y'all they're gonna take it out for sure there was a baby that was born today inside the amniotic sac did you see that mmm that's a damn goldfish it oh it's crazy you see the delicacy in some places inside the sack I mean I don't know what the story was cuz I I'm a notorious headline reader I read headlines I just googled it and there's there's it's not a thing if hats happens apparently well I don't know if it happens all the time I wanted to get incredible photos of babies born um but it was an article that was going around the internet today baby born in it's a video of the baby moving around inside this this sac it's very weird that's a Dan got it on YouTube that's a dumpling dude if you're downtown what is it's a dumpling it's they're very small it's not a while see if you can find it it was all I saw it I believe I saw it on Instagram let me see that baby man do you think maybe when babies are born right when they're born look at that though that's the same thing that's the baby inside the sack that's one of those things they eat is to eat sometimes on those game shows oh so I'm guessing this is a cesarean section happens once every eighty thousand births that is amazing that you could see what the baby looks like when it's in there holy crap that's incredible bro oh it's mannish it was in Spain human beings making human beings that's crazy this is exactly what I saw this is this one it's exact when I saw how crazy is that might be upsetting for some you're about to see the Amiata exact being opened the old man upsetting that's how we exist yeah but people aren't ready for life we're gonna keep you from life we're gonna keep you from everything there it is man the sack oh shit kids from now we could see a little bit of butt on that one oh lordy yeah I can't believe do you ever think that maybe if a baby is born a certain way like missionary or doggy style that it could affect the way that they live their life I thought about that before well you should probably understand how babies are born they have to come out headfirst the baby comes out doggystyle you got to spin them around inside the womb literally okay but what if the person is doggy style when they have the baby though Oh different thing yeah you kids probably gonna be a freak yeah doggy styles like we're not making love we're fucking yeah doggy style is basically us kind of Pat yeah it's like getting to know each other quickly well it's just a different kind of fucking yeah it's like oh this is a dirty shit yeah it's fast or slow sometimes it depends on how you're feeling sometimes I miss sex when a young man sober sex is for fucking kit is for what is this with you missing your youth I just love love being what are you doing I don't want to watch a lady give birth you son of a bitch she's giving birth in a river it's cold in the river you crazy bitch that's melted glaciers that's that wim HOF earth poor little kid and if it's not warm if it's not that it's warm and if it's warm it's fill with bacteria fuck no no you can't have a baby in your bathtub if you live in fucking Brooklyn down the street don't you love your kid yeah lady first of all she is uh she's an Australia well this fighters that are gonna crawl into her pussy right now and kill the baby before it even comes out they have seven of the eight most dangerous snakes in the world are in Australia trying to tell my friend Adam Greentree yesterday doesn't want to believe me very the brown snake got strand brown snake dude kill this shit I'll kill that little fucking Creek bitch speaking Australian brown snake that's how she got pregnant in the first place dude a lot of my sister ones got knocked up my brother once man I'll never know yeah almost hi what's almost he fucked her I mean I don't know if they fucked but they well that's almost they were thinking about baby names so I assumed that they had had some type of interaction oh so they were gonna do it on purpose I don't know I think that they're thinking about baby names in case they fucked up boy that's some weird planning ahead how much wear a condom er but I think that's a dude's move if you think you might have knocked a girl up and you still want to stay with there you like oh let's talk about baby names you know I'm saying until you ride out there until you bail that menstrual cycle know until you know that the menstrual cycle yeah you know yeah he's a little single on a full moon or not it's a weird thing if you are you're having sex with somebody and you like having sex with them but you don't like hanging out with them yeah that happens for guys and girls yeah that means for a lot of guys I know dude it happens Saint girls too it happens I've heard girls say that like I don't even like hanging out with them anymore but I like fucking them it's changing now and a lot more girls are being very much like guys used to be well they can be the first the birth control pill then dating apps they can get ahold of people spend money yeah now they have options yeah but the thing about this about dating apps it's like that's gotta be just as weird as dating for a girl yeah almost weird or maybe right because you can't even see the person right I mean you can see pictures of them yeah but you don't see them when they're looking at your profile in there right you should be able to see how they look at your profile how many people are looking at your profile in any given moment no that's a that's a nightmare and of itself yeah we think about that imagine like just people just looking at you and saying no and you're in the distance all the time it has to be bad for us somebody'll say yes in the odds the thing is you're playing the numbers maybe in that sense it's better because the only people that get to hold you the people that say yes right so you miss all the knows that's true but what I was gonna say is that haven't had a baby with someone that you don't really like yeah that's a possibility if you just like to have sex with them and then you don't like I gotta go yeah you can't go cuz the babies around he's gonna have fuck buddies that everyone else guys and girls have fuck buddies yeah I'm almost everyone I know has had one in the past where you weren't in a relationship with them really my drive over and fuck and bang and then alright bye mwah yeah bye but you kiss at the end that's a lot of chicks these days I think they just want to see they don't want to kiss someone only want to see you sometimes you open the door the girls they're ready to fuck and then just walks off in the other direction we puts a blindfold on you bird boxes when you're done with us man they're done I feel like they're done do you feel like that I think it's a precarious time a lot of chicks are probably going lesbo this week oh it's dude I would be with Trump I think the the more days that the the government is shut down the more women are gonna go lesbian they hate men so much because of Trump yeah go gay but people always gay people right now going that's not how uh never what I said earlier about jokes but if what's funny to me is gay guys are always like I'm gonna turn this guy out and that always sounds I was learning that does work but that sounds alarming it does sound alarming but it does work I have once a Almo said his name he worked on she wasn't he's not an actor but he worked in the world of acting and he told me that he blew a lot of straight guys mm-hmm it said that was just something that happened they would have a couple drinks and pretend they'd never done it before next thing you know yeah I got that delicious mouth that's what a lot of gay dudes say it was either him doing them or them doing him but he's like you'd be amazed at how many you know air quotes straight guys are out there my womb yeah he just knows how to swing it but would you do you think is it less homosexual to jerk a guy off with your left hand what are you left-handed right hand right handed see if he turns you off your left hand it's it's gayer to do it with your right hand it's care to do with my left hand the one that doesn't work as well because it'll take longer yeah but you don't really have but it's understandable like it's understandable if you do with your left hand because it's bear leaving your hand it's my hand bro you're not gonna feel that much of it though jerk them off with your right hand so you should be effective and get it done with unless you like holding on the dicks longer don't know what's gonna happen you're gonna come the knockin wanna hang out with me anymore no I would do that just go faster no I don't believe you yeah I think no I think you I think you I think using that left hand is that rid that's the party move you know because it's not you could still use this hand to be on your phone you can do other stuff yeah but then you're not concentrating on the jerk in the guy off look once you commit to doing something gay just get it done son yeah to get after it that's true you don't want to be out there while you're pretending that you're looking at your mentions okay but also what about this though if you are aggressively very effectively jerking off right and then you can barely use your phone it looks like you're just like a maybe a you know gay or bi gentleman it's on some dope or something you doing gay shit with your on your phone okay I think I sound like it acts as a condom to prevent you in gayness you're doing gate things I mean you're holding on to a dick you just gotta accept that and keep moving there's a lot of peopIe yeah you're right just take the next right action there's gay people doing shit that's gay there's straight people doing shit that's gay Oh a jerk that man off once you commit to that project just keep going and yes the payoff what do you got a jerk them off I don't know I don't think I let me ask you this yeah here's a question okay if there was a place if life was free yeah really do whatever you want if you're a grown adult you could do whatever you want that's one of the interesting things about society is that we set up these rules in cultures and we decide what you can do and what we decide is different with the deciding Hollin is different when they rain yeah everybody's got different rules yeah but once we set those rules it's very hard to buck those rules let's just pretend there was no rules what if there was a place where guys would go and guys would jerk them off and in New Jersey like if there was a place where guys straight guys got a job jerking guys off hmm but you it shot you you get paid a thousand dollars an hour you don't think that straight guys would take that job straight struggling guys then you would they would morph and figure out a way oh just over a generation or two just a generation or two if you could make a thousand dollars an hour beating guys off yeah start it as I could that's cheap in each job if you could wear an oven mitt what you do it I wouldn't do it just do it do we figure that uh if you could wear an oven mitt while you do oh no and oh no warm oil in your bare skin that's the only way to jerk eyes off you guys dude this way other ways man you could definitely do one way you could do is even you wrap your heaters do like that really sideways like a Kentucky Fried Chicken there's only one batter bullshit nobody likes that crispy batter I'm trying to think if I had to Jirka one thing about jerking off to me uh I feel like there's not as much calm and your body is there could be you know I'm saying you don't get that much out well it depends on what you're jerking off to and you know how focused you are on the task if you're jerking off while you're looking at your phone yeah yeah but you know you checking your Twitter and your also beat now you have multi-tap but you're not gonna get a lot no matter how much how you do it really yeah how much do you get you get like a little bit how much do you get like if you had a compare it to something like a quarter no probably like maybe uh like an eleventh of a handful I guess I don't know how big is your hand dude I can't even do you still masturbate as an adult no I do it as a job I mean put a diaper rejuvenating myself I think you'd rip your dick off yeah that's true man I uh I don't know man I actually masturbated yesterday and I feel bad about it sometimes but why I decide oh no for some reason is that's the thing it's a cultural thing thank God it's when we're young like think about it this way what if the culture was all stand-up comedy culture because arguably stand-up comedians have a different culture and a different way of looking at things yes and it definitely is a good very deep camaraderie between fellow practitioners right yeah if that was the culture was the stand-up comedy culture was the whole world you wouldn't give a fuck if you peed off right you wouldn't even be slightly embarrassed right I tell people you tell me I tell people where it's at sure Ari would tell me all the time how many times be doffed or 200 we all tell each other how we beat off of what we beat off - I don't like it as much as I used to when I was young well that's my thing you're probably healthier yeah you know like you gotten older you're more comfortable you're successful yeah it just feels like it feels like a novice move if I'm still jerking off it's 2019 it's certainly a distraction - yeah something about especially looking at porn just there's I'm not anti porn I don't want anybody to get me wrong I think you should be able to do whatever you want to do ultimately and I think a lot of why people have bad opinions about people doing certain things is that we judge people when they do certain things and we have these ideas about them that we sort of impose on them right but I think for some people porn is very useful but you have to have discipline yeah see the thing is if you watch porn and you watch two people have sex and you get excited and you jerk-off you just took care of like some sexual needs that you had yeah what could possibly be wrong with that the only thing that can be possibly wrong with it is that there's something wrong with these two people having sex and filming it well is there like but doesn't everybody want to fuck me I don't want to film myself fucking but doesn't everybody want to have sex people love to have sex obviously one of the most important motivations that we have oh yeah look people leave the house every day because they might have a chance to fuck it's for sure I mean why do people why do they get involved romantic relationships in the first place to not just not just be nice to each other but to fuck eventually sometimes that's the whole thing yeah so what is it about two people fucking on film that's so distasteful well you know you don't want people to see your special thing maybe or like what you don't you know you want to keep it private I get all those gotten too fancy though it's too high-def though you can't you're Britney you can real life can't compete with it so then it's so it's not always the case this stuff is just right there but it's not real life though it's not as good it's not as good as real life but I think that it's visually it starts to get that it's better and it starts to get where like sometimes I got like I'm 40 days off pornography right now right really yeah so you're like on a pornography detox oh yeah I don't ever want to see it again really yeah if somebody tries to get their pussy out I'm like you stopped but then let me say this to you though you also had the same kind of issue with drugs and alcohol right so you have like an addictive personality yeah that's a good point so have an addictive personality you know I was saying earlier that I think that the thing of it the thing itself is not necessarily bad and for some people can actually provide a service right yeah like it helps them to jerk off I don't understand why that would be bad the only thing they would say is and this is I don't know how factual this is because I haven't done any surveys but what I've read is that a lot of the people that get involved in that are victims of abuse mmm that's disturbing right you don't want to hear that but then some of them aren't some of them do it because they want to do it yeah like isn't that okay that seems more okay than someone who's doing it because they're a victim of abuse and they're desperately seeking love and attention and they don't know how how to do it that's a good point so then you look at it like in terms of but you just that's looking at that is like well then don't laugh at comedy right because you laugh at comedy almost everybody this is comedians fucked up or fucked over I mean that's that's really why they get into it in the first place because they desperately need attention they want to be special they want to be something and they're like look at me look at me so they figure out how to be funny yeah usually those are victims of abuse like it's some way shape or form not all of them right because they easy affection they need it they need something from people maybe six out of ten right yeah maybe in ambulance hours yeah yeah so there's so many things that you could look at that like that but you know like something good comes out of stand-up right so we just accept that that's okay to laugh at these fucked up people but you know what I mean like Joey Diaz oh yeah that guy's lived everything he's seen everything but it's okay it's okay to laugh at the chaos that his life was because the jokes are so funny yeah you know it's it's weird right but it's not okay to look at like even if the girls enjoying porn if you find out that at some point in time she was molested and that possibly was one of the motivating factors that led her into porn then you get super weird about it yeah you think about it they should put that on the thing like percentage chance of somebody that was molested in the video and I think that that would deter people from watching a something so yeah man my thing is just I started to think of sex then in frames like okay I got to meet the girl and then we have to walk over by us so you know we have to see this and have to see that then that happens and then now and that's sex so I started to you know like interpret it that way and I don't know sex was just fun when you were young when you were fucking imagine being 16 and fucking somebody else it was 16 bro you know what I want to hear in the background I'm saying this song living that died that Diana Ross who sings Oh Paul McCartney and wings motherfucking szura that was from James Bond oh that's right that's right guns knees oh they did that was one time where the fucking remake is so good that was you kind of guy wasn't their own song we've been dancing here some older we hear it has Axl been on your podcast oh no I definitely have him on man Wow I'll definitely have that going on I can't imagine the brink Yeah right yeah this who knows what kind of ego happen and what all happened whenever they went give me some volume so I couldn't hear it at least I want to hear him say that the beginning pass him yeah we go here we go here we go yeah look out so he was four years he went crazy yeah vanished was trying to make that one album forever right took many many years and everybody's like goddammit Axl Rose went crazy I need to see Amy like dan was a shame Guns N'Roses was so good so good and then slowly but surely he fucking came back like really came back like he's fucking back like that dude tours with ac/dc now yeah I mean he crushes it I saw some videos of him on stage he's a fucking animal again he looks like heart a little bit like one of them hard buddy but that's just age in time you know it's just oh I don't think it's aging time I think there's a lot of other ingredients could be shrink throw some shit on to that mix well solve us triple right yeah but you slash looks the same as last looks the same but that's what I'm saying they're both the same age yeah I started out together or close to the same age at least dude how much fun must that be fuck decision I think it's too much fun this is my theory then I think it's too much fun and I think they don't even have to write new shit so because they don't have to write new shit and it's too much fun they're out there just fucking smashing yeah every night fucking smashing smashing shows smashing tour buses and hotel recognition just smashing each session pussy they're smashing they probably crazy you probably even notice if you fuck a dude if you're that famous I think you notice I think you're wrong I beg to differ oh he's got a hotel prompter what about a masked dude there's you know Axl Rose on a teleprompter desperate but I guess you want that if you're on all the drugs if you want all the judge not only do I want teleprompter I want it to be highlighted what I'm supposed to say I mean he's wearing hot pants so close he's very hot pants with high cowboy boots with socks ha ha ha and a mesh top and tighty whities so what is it that makes somebody so famous that they get close to being almost like a bisexual you think do you keep bringing up all this gay stuff yes you will tell me was your stepdad right no bro I've never been gay man never ever no never ever ever never I mean maybe when I'm 60 or 70 I'll bust out try you know I'll come on somebody but I'm not doing anything you know Jay I want a family and everything I think they're so free with their expression right that they wear whatever the fuck they want and I think that's a part of the culture of really huge musicians is that they get very free with the looks their sexuality like look at him with his mouth with his ripped up pants Axl Rose back when he's a cutie-pie or David Bowie David Bowie when he was in his androgynous state of prints I mean you can go on and on and on about men like fucking Mick Jagger I mean Mick Jagger would swing his hips yeah PUF is Leigh Ellis well Elvis is no stay pretty manly thing but he wore women's clothing and women's like you know you know stuff from Mike he wore stuff from like scarves and shoes understand know what's that women's clothing store that's in every like living secrets no it's for like kind of more you know Lane Bryant or the big fat lady stuff he'll shoot a dude clothes store for fat guys big and tall they call it yeah but that's like some of them it's called a g-spot it's over there on Pico Boulevard J Anthony always sells those suits over there on stage what's up oh there he is is that him now that's him that could be the lady Sheryl Swoopes no se he's uh that's that's his Monica hair looks weird like that it's like he went to spring break but that's axel from younger days so that's when he had vanished for a while right oh but when he did that like he did a big concert in Brazil too right and listened to that and his voice was kind of struggling a little bit cuz he has such a such a scratchy voice you know the other thing like that voice probably very difficult to maintain yeah but that primal fucking welcome to the dude that was this shit when I was that was like right when I was graduating high school I remember I worked out this shitty little gym I'd be on the leg press machine listen to welcome to that job what kind of headphones again whatever they are the big ones though oh yeah I had a Walkman with a cassette ha yeah it might have been a disc player well okay that one's ridiculous that one makes Oh whose no reason that Holly Hunter that's him now no it's not Holly Hunter lead singer I love guns and roses are you calling my brother nice to beat each other in our room we'd fistfight in the yard to fucking Guns and Roses bro ac/dc it was the music of my childhood was get was that was GNR Alice in Chains that's that's a weird look the the the thermal or the flannel shirt tied around the waist what's that look right but that's a weird look yeah like on purpose that's a weird look I said Darlene Connor it's like hey I know I'm not gonna wear this flannel shirt but I'm gonna tie it around my waist but hey it's not really a skirt right it's just like an accoutrement to my outfit of fake ripped pants yeah right that's a weird look isn't it a weird look would you think you'd rather have like a little skirt or like be naked you think skirt oh really make me self-conscious but what if you had like a little dick hide or like a little thing that you could still did look at how big is your dick either [Music] you can't get no escape would you ever wear a fake dick so that people thought your dick was bigger if I did it would be an outrage tuck in the front tucked in my sock and it would be green like a holic like a dark green like evilly no it's fake though feel like how that guy's is fake bro yeah I think I'm gonna have dicks in the future it just seems like everything's going away so fast my god they're trying to do that with this new Gillette commercial you seen that Gillette commercial I heard about that you can shave your buddy or so No oh this is really mad cuz it's like an anti masculine Gillette commercial it makes like every man look like a misogynist piece of shit it's such a disturbing commercial it's like over and over again men doing douchey shit like hey bro aren't you selling razors yeah changing the world here shitty fucking advertiser based philosophy what are you doing like what are you doing who fucking greenlit this I know how is that Yelena but like yo yo yo guys people get hair they want to fucking shave it just got back do not get a fix imagine if your of sexist rapist piece of shit and you see that Gillette commercials like damn I'm gonna switch my game man I've been too much of a dick like does anybody think the Gillette commercials are somehow another in any way shape or form gonna affect cultures bad you're selling razors is bad from it's just a razor I'd rather braid my fucking face hair than by Gillette nobody wants to be lectured to we're tired of that so sick of that stop it you don't have your shit together nobody has their shit together and you telling people how to get their shit together in a fucking razor blade yeah yeah don't be racist we know don't be a sexist yeah we know we know most people aren't yeah this is like you got it like most people are the videos like most people are it's not most people are crazy that's a disproportionate amount of people that are that's what I hate about a lot of the just a lot of these I the ideology today it's like like they say everybody where I'm from is racist or everybody's like you know some christian bible thumping yeah and it nah that's not true so many of the people i know are not that at all that it's unbelievable but so many of the people in some and in these other places they don't even know anybody from there so it's like they have no idea but they immediately stereotype because of your accent - yeah you have a southern accent people assume you're not bright yeah it's so stupid but it's also it's indicative of what the place used to be like like what the world used to be like was like a lot of the rural educated yeah now that there's the internet the world is a different place man you can meet cool people in Wichita Kansas you know cool people everywhere everywhere you go you're gonna run into pockets of cool people yeah cool people are everywhere man so in people good people are everywhere and they're they have different values and a lot of them are more community oriented more friendly we we on this side and those on the east side everybody gets this idea that everybody is like the people that live all stacked on top of each other fucking like bees swarm in the high yeah most people don't live like that man most people live somewhere where there's less folks I got to relax they could throw a frisbee and not if I can hit anybody that's the most people you look at the vast majority of the country there's what is there 300 and how many people billion why does it 350 already what is it billion million bro million you're good and billion I'm glad it's not billion I think there's you imaginary man I would say 320 if I had to guess I'd say 320 I'd say it's 325 thank you right but that's like how do they know about illegals oh who know it's probably 2 billion if they knew illegal aliens you wouldn't you be pissed but how do you know how many of them what are you doing you counting them how are they still here dude but you can't even raise your voice you know like I have to drive to Riverside even fucking raise my voice I feel like like that's how too tight it is in LA 308 million people in the United Oh in 2010 but that's 2010 mm it was 281 million whoa look at that dude think about just think of that 20 fucking million people 28 29 27 million people and who's fucking the most are they saying is it White's oh it's all white is it really you think about fucking every race now bro its new no I've decided we decided to take back our country oh no man we're on our way to white people are on their way to being a serious minority yeah that's gonna happen beige power bro that's what I say everybody I look I love all the variety but you know what it's like it's like we have nice things we can't we can't have nice things we keep breaking things yeah so we can't what because of racist people you can't have all this wonderful diversity so we're eventually all gonna be gray we're gonna be like those fucking aliens with the giant heads and we're gonna have no dicks and we're all gonna be the exact same thing so no one can criticize anyone on anything other than your thoughts and they're gonna be able to bring your actions and thinkin be able to read each other's minds yeah that's what I think and I think we're gonna ruin the environment so they have built-in eyeglasses when you're born they just fucking glue these bitches on your head sort of like chicks with fake eyelashes oh yeah you just you just have these lenses that you put on when you're indoors you peel the lenses off and otherwise you can just see Nate you can walk outside but you can't really go far and it's just you see you could press a fern button in ferns or Papa well just you know foliage or something you know fall enough foliage maybe a deer runs by if you hit that side button I think nature in the future we'll probably be contained in these gigantic dome like places like I'm Stephen King books and that's where you'll go to get into the nature yeah like a biodome with Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin I think that's gonna be like there's gonna be there's gonna be nature places yeah and the rest of the world would be City the rest of the whole plan will be sitting are our wildlife would be a bullshit wildlife it'll be like you know yeah you a few thousand acres or something like that of a bunch of animals living together is all that's left it'll be like I can't like a rabbit with like a little story like a story on its back something because if you look at the population and I'm not one of those doom and gloom people when it comes to overpopulation you know why because I like people on people like yeah there's too many fucking people you know like I have good friends to think you know you want to help the world don't have any kids Mike okay yeah I get why you would say that but don't you like people I love people people are awesome it's all I know I mean some of them aren't awesome but the vast majority are pretty cool yeah or at least capable of being pretty cool if you're cool to them and you establish sort of a community being cool with each other the vast majority of people are people are nice people are yeah friendly yes the vast majority so what's the problem the problem is was too many of us and we're not gonna stop right they're gonna I want to fuck somebody right now you know we're gonna make people the question is the will they say stop stop the study say scientists say that as people come more affluent and as they become more educated they're less likely to have children or they have less children so they think that the best way to stop overpopulation is actually equity in the world like or equality rather in the world make make the whole world basically like America where everybody's just got a chance to get ahead and everybody has an awesome education and everybody has access to the best information it can't happen but if that does happen that's what's going to curb overpopulation otherwise the people that are the least educated or they're not going to have the same access to like like in in countries where people are poorer like for instance they want to have more kids because they want the kids to take care of them too yes that's a big thing right that's a big thing in traditional communities and you know they're tighter and you if you here's the weird thing if you talk to scientists they will tell you that arguably those are happier people yes happy people that live in these like villages and stuff and they all enjoy each other's company even though in our mind it's a hardscrabble life you know they're living in a third-world country in a village but if they have access to food let's see if they live in the Amazon or something they have much food you can get in there you got a lot of food man like I know how you would say hey I don't want to live that way so these people live in the wrong way they you know they have fucking ten kids laying on them and shit yeah they're all community in this Hut together and you like that's that looks terrible for all hot bunks and that bitch too a lot of times you see the whole family's in there fucking but meanwhile those people could be like really happy yeah they can arguably be happier than a comparable group of people in Western civilization that you would just grab a hundred percent and why is it black home there's a lot of black families are still in the woods you notice that a lot of the tribes there kind of Darla I guess maybe not black but it's like a Latino or darker myth like not I don't know what shit I guess it's like a more universal shade almost kind of like a sofa color well if you're in the jungle you're obviously in a hot climate if you're in a hot climate you better develop some fucking melanin yeah that's what it is is melon and they got more melon and family I mean if you look at it I'm Italian mostly if you look at it and but I have some Irish in me too but if you look at Italians who are in the Sun all the time did they get darkest fuck yeah you know and if you were seven seven plus generations of people living in this one area were you exposed to like tropical sunlight all the time oh you had brown the fuck up or you wouldn't make it yeah that's true I go to Costa Rica even for a couple days and I'm fucking you know browned out of my face is all you know kind of has pus in it from the Sun but I think people evolving in a place like that like being there hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years maybe thousands of years like you adapt to that environment or you you know the the preferential the preferable jeans are the ones that make it through yeah and those people have joy those families have a lot of joy because they have their family around you know like if somebody if somebody dies they have them right day it's like there's everything's just a lot more communal I think there's just a lot more love the only problem is they don't have like ways to save each other the way we do right right like they don't have cars they don't have modern weapons they have to hunt with these bows and arrows they make themselves but they do have pots they have some things you know but also depending on what tribe obviously and also your life expectancy is probably not as long if you do die and you believe in a higher power then you get to go see them quicker you probably have reincarnation your you know your friend that died could now be a plant or a you know coyote that you meet or something you know I'm sure in a lot of their cultures it's a lot of uh you know that just things are mortis all intertwined you know human in nature well that was big with Native American cultures right like they thought that uh coyotes were I mean in many different different tribes where they looked at coyotes almost like they had some magic to him or something yeah wise they're up all night I mean I could see that yeah you're in that tent sleeping sleeping off that hashish hi [Laughter] it's a coyote got trapped in a bathroom he I want to say it was in South Carolina or North Carolina they're a wild man they was in this bathroom and these guys have to get it out of the bathroom and sitting on the sink it's crazy they had to use one of them long poles that the the jack dogs you know he grabbed around the neck you see it mmm I knew was one of those places in Nashville yeah I could see that dude it's a cool little video but it's weird like those little fuckers are everywhere now they are everywhere well raccoons are really dangerous you they're always doing you know Jerry is silent the Nashville Music Hall and this beautiful so they're in this hall in a Boat Show look at him he's chillin it's a very photogenic how weird so what they did was they captured it and they said that if they brought it to an animal shelter they would have euthanized it so instead they captured it and let it loose in the woods woods cool do you have any animals that you don't tell people that you have like any secret animal I keep a lot of giraffes I could see you having something now have you thought about it oh you start piranhas allegedly and what do they keep in a tank you know you keep me in a tank you know you used to be able to buy a human skeleton online whose have a human skeleton at the bottom of my piranha tank really where does that you buy a skeleton and what can you do with it I don't think you can anymore I bet you can't buy them anymore you used to be able to just buy human skeleton how long can you keep it the whole time forever who was it um here's the funny thing I got rid of it and we'll get rid of him like mammal throw away this human skeleton is some question come with this you would think it'd be like a Cabbage Patch doll like it comes with a little birth certificate we bird it which is even worse probably and then people are gonna be like what the fuck someone someone got killed here yeah someone's gonna find it someday what the fuck it's gonna be a giant mystery it sounds fun I always love mystery man the thing is somebody might have died like they might have somebody might have killed somebody and sold their bones it's probably one of those are real oh my god what does it say is that let me look at this a male from India in good condition 12 teeth present the rest broken missing there is lipping on the lumbar vertebra what but that's $5,000 you could buy a fucking human skeleton holy shit dude there's several of them for sale sale so the lumbar vertebra lipping you know what that means I think that means there his backs fucked up excuse me and what happens is the discs themselves the lumbar vertebrae the actual vertebrae dog bone piece mm-hmm from wearing against each other it starts to spur and develop like a curve to the bottom like I think they're calling that lipping see if that's what that means whipping whipping on the lumbar vertebra whipping whipping on it yeah yeah I got it let's see that yep that's what it is yeah see that up image upper left left right there yeah see how it curves over the top oh yeah osteoporosis osteophyte grading or lipping yeah see as your disc gets smashed your bones trying to protect themselves and they grow this extra bone tissue and sometimes that obviously I'm not a doctor and if you are a doctor stop yelling I know I'm talking about yeah but sometimes people that that shit causes sciatica either inflamed discs poked out poke into the nerves or the bone pokes it or it causes inflammation in the area Eddie Bravo that he does yeah and he Bravo how that is uh he got his whole disc replace without 5s want him disc autumn yeah Wow yeah he gained an inch in height - did he really did was back's all fucked up so like you gotta think like your discs or these things right these little things and there's probably a bunch of them and they bust and when they smash and get smashed down to nothing I mean he was basically bone on bone he had almost no disk so he was in a constant state of inflammation horrible I need a text like he couldn't he couldn't sit down sometimes he'd have to stand up he would have to hold his lower back and he does dealt with the pain forever but it was like almost nothing there so they replaced so his bones were on top of each other they replace that and put this thing they shove it in their fucking two-story Eddie suddenly he's talking but and new shirts yeah he's but he actually is no longer in pain that's what's amazing yeah and this is an articulating titanium disc so they used to have to fuse your vertebrae together yeah that's what I've heard of they don't have to do that in every case anymore sometimes they still do it for some reasons you know the doctors are know what they're talking about but for many people now this articulating titanium disc is now an option I'm gonna check it out yeah I know that else is one surgery part of it taken out how bad was it was it hurt it hurt bad yeah now it's better no it's better now sometimes I have sciatica though um do you ever stretch it out yeah do you ever use one of those teeter inversion tables um no I just got something free from you guys though in the lobby what's that thing called pro formas or whatever oh that's a so right yeah that's a so us so awesome Asajj isn't it great so uh yeah that's this I'm gonna come on that day and think like a good brother sorry my thing feels good you are so horny today I had to drive it's like a 20-minute drive over here drivin nothing like driving dude no I'll say this things that get me erect these days driving being on planes you know that bumpy roads owners you Miller real you asked me one time remember they had a lady I felt like I got an erection on a plane and she got pissed she told the she told the flight attendant to get me a blanket yeah well did you have it out no a hat was asleep it was in my pants it was in your pants yes she saw it somehow yeah she saw my pants cuz I wear lean pants lean pants or you know it wasn't wearing like a like offense canvas or anything you know textile yeah that's crazy that she's looking over at your AC though but I guess if I was a woman and a dude had a rock-hard boner just like a couple of feet I would know that's like a ticking time bomb okay all right but I want a plane I'm going home yeah but what if you're a pervert yeah I am a pervert but I'm still just going home and not using my dick I mean what kind of scale of a pervert are you if like ten is jerking off in front of people on the subway with a knock that I have a friend that's a flash for that well you this flashes and this flash is a jerk off on people doesn't do that that's that's ten so then the nine is a flasher that just pretends to jerk off in front it doesn't finish yeah or can't get hard and then you got to go back from there oh yeah having a softball five what are you a three no I think I guess perverted tendencies like what I guess it's like would is perverted you know well it goes back to the porn talk like you say that you had a problem with porn you were watching too much porn it became a habit for me that's what I didn't like it became instead of me wanting to watch pornography it became oh I'm used to watching pornography at night so i'ma do it jerk off and get a little bit of rest I didn't like the habit but it created a bad habit well you uh you get real intense thinking about things yeah like even when we're talking about like business stuff like you can tell like you get you focus on things yeah which is good if it's a good thing you know but sometimes that kind of thinking can get away from you yeah I think it does sometimes the same kind of focus that can get you really excited about something that's productive in your life can also get you obsessed with something that's not productive it's a set the kind of person that you are in a lot of performers you're an impulsive creative person impulsive creative people sometimes get caught in ruts you know and there's a bunch of different reasons I think for for addictions I think there's psychological addictions physical addictions some of them are undeniable like physical addictions some of them will kill you like you get off of alcohol too quick you'll die yeah it's a physical addiction that is real at a point you can't pretend it's not real that shit'll kill you right so it's obviously real but then there's other ones like washing your hands too many times like some people are addicted to washing their hands I know what dude it doesn't go anywhere without Purell everywhere watching his hands it's putting pressure on that's crazy I just like to touch doorknobs put touches doorknob Purell back to the hands it's weird and you fuck up your skin flora like it's not good yeah we had a dude they used to lick both of his shoulders for it start talking me oh that's good it was crazy that's Alette motherfuckers know you're serious oh yeah that's that Irish hello right we're in crazy town you're the mayor lucky dude you licked your shoulders until we had a tea we had to do in our town he put like a chocolate on your shoulder you try to get it off get it off that's not right that guy's gonna grab you one day and fuck you well he did you in trouble or something I don't remember what it was I'd grown up but he was he's like one of those angler fish he's tricking you yeah he's getting you to look at that huh he's gonna get you I come looking for that chocolate guy yeah you know my shoulder book he looked down he's got a bat in his hands well if you did it's like you on that plane go get you chocolate chocolate but here's the main man what here's the thing is if you put Stevie Wonder move you just did huh just kind of get my neck better I'm trying to get my neck longer everyone wearing a little bit of a neck brace sometimes it's not stretching it out it's just tight my neck feels kind of or not tight it feels short yeah have you used those things the harness that goes on under the chin and you attach it to the top of the door and you pull on it quickly I've seen this those are great really yeah yeah yeah if you have a tense neck I'm a big believer in that kind of spinal decompression yes there's want that yeah you can get that and I got a really good one out here two two really good ones from that Teeter company we you put your waist on one of them and you lean forward and it stretches your lower back and the other one you hang from your ankles it's really good for it feels good to it'll leave you cuz it's just like that compression of life sick of it yeah smashing you down and it's very rare that you do anything that like I have a terrible problem slumping I've always slumped I've always been like I've always had shit posture for whatever reason it's not good like you're supposed to sit up straight yeah you know you're supposed to your back is supposed to be straight so you can be like I sometimes I like I sit like this yeah I'll talk to people be like that like my head is forward it's like just very bad for your back like you're making your your disks carry your weight in an uneven way what you want to do is have everything everything up and strong obviously this is exaggerated but most people like you get lazy so what well what good posture is is like a constant state of exercise that's what good posture is yes I'll just slump all the time but yeah but doing posture all the time it feels like you're always like you know about to graduate you know I feel like you always have to be like kind of like don't say that it's like but you don't have to be exaggerated but you really should and I've been trying over the last few years really hard to do that just straight I need to get an alarm for my spine that's it that's the shit I love that's called the the teeter Dex inversion that's one of my favorite things ever for loosening up your lower back really decompressing you yeah I got one right here man and it's not prohibitively expensive either I'll hop on that before I leave yeah that thing right there when you go down when when it uh press play so you can see how it works you hang down like that and when you hang down like that it just lengthens everything and straightens it out and that's the one where you hang by your ankles I love that one too all the ways yeah it looks good right I cannot even imagine they have that good for you I got one right here but really I feel like something you would do to kill a deer or something no that's that's a different kind of thing man that's wild man I need some stuff I think I need to get more you know bars and stuff I could hang off of I got to alleviate some pressure for your shoulders like chin-up bars grab ahold of a chin-up bar just hang hanging is really good for your shoulders because everything gets compacted everything gets like punched in and nothing stretches out I'm built like a Conestoga wagon brother you know that and still going Conestoga what does the Conestoga it's like a wheel base is really question was like 6x6 you know like I'm not that fucking you don't move that good I mean I think I used to be able to but I got it going to the past bro you're still young enough to move like that right now yeah another thing that's a Conestoga wagons built like that imagine if you just decided that's how you're gonna rock it from now on you're on the highway people are beeping at you get your motor running wooden wheels wagon dragging behind your Ram pickup truck a fucking a bar of gold just falls out the man you got a Silverado Chevy Silverado pulling a fucking covered wagon baby like you can't do that why not cars registered yeah it's all legal who the fuck is buying wagons these days people buying them today oh the wagons coming back it's just these assholes that want to reenact a civil war and pretend they're still slavery well here's the thing bro I understand re-enacting it in the winter but they do it in the summer man do they really yeah you don't want to do in the winter you'll die and the South always wins the reenactment too it's just wild no it doesn't really yeah I don't mean so real I think there's a little bit of you know what they should do they should reenact the Civil War and kill themselves not in real life but in the in the fake what you mean pretend hey man I want to fight for slavery and just all pretend to kill themselves yeah oh that's interesting yeah they should say hey we're gonna we're gonna do it the right way or we're gonna toss down our guns and suck all the dicks of the guys in the North yeah well then they would won that one if they decide that they don't what if they're like if they catch us they're sucking dicks like it has to need the nutrients they're starving dude I was thinking about this do you think that so slavery right they had it do you think that what if I had this thought of one day what if computers artificial intelligence happens ok takes over and then they're all gonna know that we had we owned these phones yeah yeah just like people soon like they were slain like this was a slave like remember when you owned my little buddy emotional about that I see where you going with that but I disagree I don't think that'll be an actual factor I don't know I got the rose gold one that undo nothing like that but you got a black case on it that's ridiculous yeah that's true if you go in rose gold I think you have to go caseless like a I'm not going caseless man a lot of people go Kate look at Jamie caseless are you really James a caseless barbarian wow I bet he jerks off for this fucking his natural hand that's nice huh adorable do you see your kids every day yeah sometimes I keep my eyes closed [Laughter] is it nerd Dave were you nervous at first to have them yes yeah nervous to be vulnerable nervous to love something that much nervous to have that kind of responsibility nervous about all those things yeah that you changes you changes you like nothing else but did you feel like the changes would be for like that you won't like the changes and then you did like I'm like did you have reservations well I didn't have a relationship with my father growing up so for me it's very it was very very important that I did whatever I had to do to have a relationship with them to be as present as I can be to like to whatever whoever I was before had them to evolve to mean to get better like it's it's it's a very when you have kids it's a very weird thing what happens to you because all of a sudden it's you're not alone anymore oh yeah you like you you don't just have responsibilities like you have a dog you have to feed or a plant you have a little person yeah and you don't want to fuck up that little person you like shit and it feels overwhelming and then the world feels so dangerous change the view of the world though yeah there's so much threat there's so much out there that could stop signs planes stories - you read stories about terrible people and terrible things that happen oh and then you're like fuck it I don't have to worry about this just happened to me after wherever this happen to know somebody else - and your little song you know yeah that's wild brah that's crazy world in you you think of people differently because you think of people as a project that developed instead of being in a static state that's interesting did you did did do you think that something like emotionally happens to you like at a level that or a DNA level yeah yeah the love you had like Dave Chappelle said this best goes not only to do increase my love it increased my capacity for love that's a great way of putting it I would I would agree 100 percent increases your capacity and you become at least me I became a nicer person I've seen it not work - I've seen people that just reject it I've seen men and women that just don't want to be parents yeah I've seen women move away from their kids they don't want to take care of their kids I've seen men abandon their families they just don't want to do it it's crazy and I don't know if it's a mental health issue or if it's just some people just can't take it yeah Everett like there's like attitudes and this is not just about raising children's about pretty much anything difficult in life there's some people that have a very low quit point very low they just quit everything they quit it gets tough quit quit there's a lot of people that just quit and when you have a little like say if you have a little Theo in front of you and you think about your life and your childhood and like how important it is for you to raise this little person and give them love and teach them about life and protect him become safe and give them good lessons in life yeah it just changes everything man changes everything changes everything but it also is very ver whelming it's over well it's eerie Assange xiety when they have kids they start thinking about the responsibility and the weight of it all or they don't some people just fucking take pills and lay on the couch and let their kids suck fucking carpet glass and fucking stick Forks into the wall sockets and you play with knives people just don't some people don't give a fuck some people are dumb that's that's the thing two men died you know people don't want to say this but there's folks out there they just aren't equipped for life I really believe that I think D come the dumb brother that's what I'm saying take the semen out of them you know I'm saying like at a certain point but here's the problem you're dumb compared to physicist so who's the who's to judge and who's to say that this person is really stupid couldn't have a brilliant child that happens to men a lot of times brilliant people come out of state adversity man who knows what they need but it's like it's not our job to decide who's stupid and who's not because it gets slippery oh yeah you you could get box into that stupid corner in a different metric if you're hanging around with a bunch of people from Stanford you know and they're looking steel Vaughn's the neighborhood and they know there's 10 people the neighborhood but only nine can survive it's like resources for nine we're gonna get rid of me probably depends on how good you are at digging ditches oh it could be better than them at that though yeah so suddenly I have a different skill I don't know it's have you thought about having kids yeah I think about it a lot more like as I get a little bit older I just yeah the thing for me is just like about being brave I think and just being willing to have my life just be totally different and be a with that no and just being like willing to know that I would be okay in that space you know I think it's hard it's like I just it's like I'm just starting to manage the space that I'm in like I just has a regular person and then to get to that point where now it's like fuck you have another ball you have two balls in the air you know wife and a kid or yeah and then what we're talking about earlier look sometimes people fuck people that they don't really like to hang out with yeah I'm not doing that anymore man that's where it gets slippery because sometimes that sex is fun man I was just talking to a buddy of mine about this he's got a guy he's a single guy and he's got a gal that he fucks every now and again they get together and they both kind of know what it is yeah he gets it together and they work one out and then they see yeah that's it and his his take on it is interesting he's like you know and some people you just don't want to seem that often like that's okay that's okay but the problem is it's not always Mutual mmm right sometimes the guy wants to see the girl more than she wants to see him or vice versa and then they becomes some weird thing one person starts talking the other person's Facebook yeah you know people start getting weird with people you know like that's that's actually an addiction to people get addicted to each other just as much as they get addicted to pornography just as much they get addicted to wash their hands or anything else people absolutely get addicted to certain people oh yeah well then that person doesn't wanna have sex with you anymore like it's like they're taking away your drugs you know and really dumb men and in those cases get very dangerous because because yeah they start thinking this person's done something to them because they don't want to be with them anymore and really dumb men are dangerous right there yeah that's where you know you you you hear about women getting stalked by their exes and murdered and that's where that shit comes I hate that really dumb men who are angry now that the person that they loved doesn't want to be around them anymore yeah and they can't look at themselves and they're probably mentally ill and they might be on medication who the fuck knows what trifecta or what conglomeration of factors is making them be that piece of shit but yeah they just feel a I want you via people man get feeling they get they feel rejected and then you just wanna ya you don't know what to do sometimes you get addicted to somebody else's love or lust or sad all those things yeah women - men - I was talking to a gal who was going through this with another gal couple of lesbians couple of lesbians field talking about boy less one lesbian was mean to the other lesbian apparently I was delivering a furniture you know what I'm sayin boy domestic abuse there was some article about domestic abuse growing and lesbian communities yeah yeah it's disturbing it's a dark arts man and those women are and some of those women are tough you think tough as nails would you fight a lesbian for an undisclosed amount of money yeah really you don't even have to hear the number what is undisclosed man do I get to hear at all no I'm not can i train first I wouldn't like Amanda Nunez I wouldn't let you phone no no no no yeah it has to be a woman at least I've seen a couple pictures of them you know like I just want to be able to make sure yeah I've seen like a couple of images of him or at least be able to scroll through their instant you see that video of that grown man who punched that 11-year old girl in the face of the mall that shit makes me mad yeah he's so crazy there's a bunch of kids apparently then we're involved in some sort of a scuffle this guy comes over to break it up he's yelling at them break it up break it up one kid pushes him and then he says something and then pushes the girl she goes flying she's a little tiny person he's a big dude she comes at him with her dukes up and he just fucking way laser I didn't see the hits her with a straight left right in the mug he's a big grown man like he looks like a big man who knows how to throw a punch I'm not gonna play the video you want to find it go fine no I don't want to see it fucking disturbing but two things you should tell you one that guy definitely shouldn't have done that but - she shouldn't have fucking run at that big giant man with her dukes up yeah like God I know she's 11 I get it she didn't know she's a kid and sat down teach kids and some 11 kids are hearty some 11-year olds are hot I like what if you get her like I knew a 12 year old that's no no she's this big oh she's little she's tiny she's like nipple high on him Oh ko sir you want to see it No you do you do want to draw it for me on a napkin I don't want to see it yeah those are the old days man YUM do we have a guy remember they had a guy who sold some tits into armed man a pint you maybe a birch or something and people would go out there and go jerk off at the base of the tree he I think use like a stepstool or something versus a barrel that's when you found all the magazines in the woods Oh at least have that but times you go out on the tree and somebody will be using the tree like oh fuck I've got a walk back home that's not real you're making this up you have photographs this tree No why not do you know where it is could you take us back there with the film crew okay thank you back here oh I bet it did I bet it devolved now though but always a tree live go back there and touch the thing and all sudden you can't find your way back we're going in a circle like it turns out that the tree got tired of people jerking off on it so it involves some sort of a neurotoxic Apple then when you touched it it got in your bloodstream and distorted your perception of distance and time yeah but do what if you would have come could divide they what if semen could defy gravity what do you think about that I don't but you know I do think imagine if it wasn't if come didn't just get humans pregnant yeah oh that's what I think of some frogs the chickens I give everywhere you went you found guy just dude fucked a turtle

it's wild you're out there looking down you watched all these fish swimming around like that we went near this coral reef it's crazy it's just this world down there where the puss and how easy it was it for you to block out like sharks or something just not a blue not easy no no that's real like you're always thinking like what if one of those motherfuckers is here oh and you look like a dealt like a damn delectable event to a shark but yeah I mean you don't say if you did if Joe's out there that's a that's a real snack how many famous people have been killed by sharks that ever happened that'd be crazy I feel like LL Cool J got killed by a shark and Malibu like what how is that real how could it happen right what if AJ Simpson got jacked by a shark can you imagine how many haha' would break out across the country yeah ah if you could see Oh Jay Simpson in flute have to be Florida he'd be he's in Florida a lot of white trash girl oh fuck he's waving waving to the beach and you see the fin like 15 feet away from him if you go under and then no way oh dude I bet Oh Jay Simpson and Dennis Rodman have fucked a lot of the same chicks bro when you think about that with what if the kid well I don't think OJ Simpson's allowed to leave the country right-o saying what if Kim Jong Un's starts partying with OJ ha ha ha it's a good like I don't care the juice is loose dude a buddy of mine was doing cocaine with OJ Simpson one time and you and I in Miami how long this is like 15 years ago post murder then yep after the murder and the guy goes hey does anybody have a car key and then he hits OJ's okay you have a car key or a knife that's what he asked him for to do the cocaine off of oh no she's like this guy's got a fucking knife was he laughing yeah oh my that's pretty funny I think it's funny I mean if you didn't get in trouble for it even if you did it I think having a sense of humor about it still important the way he reacted every step of the way did not seem like a guy was being accused of something he didn't do every step anyway every step of the way I wouldn't do that yeah I couldn't do that I don't even a man that is not what you'd say yeah if your wife got killed right he would not be thinking like that you'd be - freaking the fuck out but you should watch this witness Nolte no it's so Sasha Baron Cohen and the very very end of the show is almost like a bonus scene oh I didn't know he got this deep with the outfit who's the gal it's just it's part of this is like cell she's like a girl that's supposed to be with him he's like this extravagant millionaire billionaire type character oh and he's got a Jay yeah I need to see this show period I think he spent like three or four hours with him he said did you hear that they might have uncovered a pedo ring he might have uncovered a pedo ring when he was doing this Oh Jaden no Sasha Baron Cohen oh wow oh yeah did you see it read the headline that says if you find with the exact specifics of it were but like they decided not to air it but it's like what dude you know what when you said that about OJ it made me think I met Buzz Aldrin from the moon yes and he's and when I met him it didn't seem like he'd been to the moon yeah scent cut who is America interview to FBI over fears of Las Vegas pedophile around whoa said the goat said the interview led him to believe there could be a pedophile ring in Las Vegas holy shit could you imagine if a pedophile ring in Las Vegas was exposed by Sacha Baron Cohen in a comedy movie and they find out it's real I wonder if this is all just a setup for some other type of film but let's look at it objective okay okay there has to have been pedophile rings in the past undeniably I would think if you go back you go back to like the 50s or the 40s or the 30s there has to be something like that way easy-bake yeah they take orphans and they molest them all that Sandusky type shit that has been going on yeah so how often has it been going on and what happens now to the same type of people like if that's no longer available for them is there some way they get it some super fucking super tightly watched circuit ring of people who still engage in this activity and figured out a way to do it I hope not I hope not to everybody hopes not but the idea that it's impossible the idea that it's impossible is unlikely yeah there's probably a market for it sadly well you think about it all the time when you think about other countries right oh yeah they're doing it they're for sure yeah most of our guys it seems fly over these other countries and be dirty over there yeah going over there and there's a ring a pedophile ring oh that's scary dude who wants to fuck some kid that's crazy I think they think it's mostly people who have been abused like that themselves yeah mostly yeah that's one of the things that Kevin Spacey's brother is said about Kevin is that Kevin is basically like their dad and their their dad sexually abused them and now Kevin is acting that out and there was an interview his dad his brother rather Kevin see Kevin Spacey's brother mine everybody looks like Rod Stewart on the strongest acid available who he's crazy-looking missus weird-looking guy with wacky hair and he wears funky glasses and weird clothes Donnie what's his name I don't know what his name is he looks like he's wearing a costume Donnie Spacey that's not it is it no mmm but here take a look at him jeez look at this that's that's his brother ha ha dang it looks like nice castle guy an English scientist and Rod Stewart I can't believe Kevin the one they got banged by the dead I think they both did I think he's saying they both did I can't believe I even uh said that it's messed up yeah that's sad man they said their dad was a monster yeah yeah look at his dad like look look at his brother how he dresses up look at that crazy Rod Stewart outfit yeah I bet like one chick or one dude fucked him because I thought it was Rod Stewart it's like look I'm just gonna ride this ride Stewart huh this is outfit that's crazy outfit that is a crazy crazy outfit he's got rings on every finger he's got a wallet chain across his pecker Wow those dicks keeping time brother yeah look at that shirt that fluffy shirt with the crazy-ass neck accoutrements yeah if you're not trying to get fucked by somebody you shouldn't wear all this huh yeah and but but think about how much effort it took to do all this now go up to his teeth son yeah son what's up that mug at Scotland bro clean that shit up is he from Scotland it's Kevin Spacey from Scotland I think they're from Britain I think they're from America really yeah weird where was Kevin Spacey born fuck if you know you're googling yeah well yeah you know you're right the Google in front of you um but no doubt the what about this do you think he would have been as talented if he didn't have this affliction where does it say this is any worries from orange teachers you see there you go perfect dump and one of most talented men of our time I think people in New Jersey fuck you bro hey I was born there he is very talented he's also very crazy and I think in his day you could get away with a lot if you had a movie star I think you know they just they ran those sets like uh yeah they're crazy well they have that are Kelly thing now I mean that huh guy his whole life he got to do what everyone at it seemed like that's a different animal right because he's a musician but yeah it seems like he's the underage the underage thing with him is Lea married Lea underage had sex with her underage and it was told armor we just grew up listening to his music it was choice girls are coming out about him doing that to them when they're yeah but a lot of people knew thirty fourteen they're saying 15 well I can't believe more people on comes let's see there was a video you know that weren't complicit in that oh is unbelievable what about the people that like well here's what's crazy did the video is out of him peeing on people and then years later people are still making music with them yeah wow that's crazy that's crazy yeah that's crazy when you find out how many people were what was it was it The Breakfast Club what show was it that they they started reading off a list of all the people that worked with our Kelly mmm-hmm post video so the video was out Lady gaga all these people and like a giant number of people do you think we'll ever be able to eradicate that the fact that people do that to like have like the pedophile or have that vibe for them first the to sexual sexualized children or young people hopefully scientists will figure out a way to isolate that part of human thinking someday like hopefully there'll be something researchers doctors scientists psychologists whoever it is figure out a way to stop that but in the meantime what it has gotten is way more difficult for them to get away with it right right and it is going to get more difficult still I think people are going to be connected I mean we're connected right now with cell phones mm-hmm like this is how weird the connection is you know Adam Greentree who was here yesterday we just we were talking about Toyota Tundras he said after we were talking about it he said all of his ads on his phone like when he would look at a website it would all be Toyota ads no way it's like they're listening yeah they're listening to his phone like the word Toyota Tundra came up over and over and over again in his search searches Toyota trucks because we see that Hans Toyota trucks Toyota trucks I'm gonna say that and put a draw Toyota Tacoma say it over and over again yeah but whatever the fuck process of I mean I don't know if he actually accidentally googled Toyota trucks that day - yeah but they found out he's their kid my point is like saying something in a conversation and it's being connected to these internet searches like these little things are starting to happen and it's gonna get more and more prevalent it's over for us we're gonna be like way more connected now then we're gonna be way more connected rather in 10 years and we are now look man we got to figure out what would that be like because no one saw this coming yeah no one saw us being disconnected so what the fuck is it going to be like if we're connected much much more than that in the future what's that gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be something unimaginable because it's this was unimaginable right so that's what I'm thinking it's going to be some next plane that we're gonna get to there has to be some next level of intuition maybe that comes into it or yeah I when I was really high I thought this up yeah my really high thought was you know how kids learn things really easily they learn things way easier they can learn a language really easy they're gonna if very soon in the future a universal language is developed that coincides with artificial artificial intelligence technology virtual reality and augmented and augmented reality and so this universal language allows people of all languages they can learn it and they can learn it and this was coming off with something that Jamie said once we were talking about emojis being almost like hieroglyphs like wow like that seems so weird because they seem so cute and corny but but someone could send you a whole like series of them like eggplant water smiley face high-five in and that's like Oh someone's a fuck oh yeah that's my right meet time to meme a picture could sell sure well while I was thinking that I was like okay well what would stop once they develop augmented reality or artificial reality in some sort of a easily digestible form whatever it is whether it's a chip that you have in your body that sends signals directly to your brain allows you to communicate with each other if we developed a language and we can send and receive images in a way that may be even more effective than the language that like we assume that English is the best way to talk because we only know how to talk English right maybe if we could speak Chinese we could express ourselves clear maybe we we speak Turkish or Arabic maybe there's a better one I don't know I only like one language but what if sound languages are far inferior to visual languages and what if these visual languages allow people that even can't even see to see because they could send it directly into their mind they can see these things with their eyes closed they're not even using their eyeballs and everybody can communicate on an even plane so there's no language barriers hmm and what I was thinking this almost like well that's Covey's isn't possible no it's not impossible because there's all more than a hundred languages I mean how many languages are there if you had to guess I would bet there's probably 100 and maybe 15 yeah I bet you're right I'll say 130 let's go crazy I'll see 130 level cast it's probably a thousand who the fuck knows one language Bob one language Bob more more than a thousand okay I'm gonna go then me I would like to have a separate guest I want to go with 1800 I would like to go with 1060 mmm that says there are roughly this is number of spoken languages in the world today 6,500 whoa what where how about sure about about 2000 of those have less have fewer than a thousand speakers so even if we count those off it's still 4 over 4 well you know those people on that Sentinel North Sentinel island I think they have a dead language there's only 3000 really where that guy got killed there's only 39 of them 4000 so even if you take up that 2500 right if you take those off the ones that he said that only less than a hundred people are yeah but they're using it right good point well here's the thing that's really crazy um the the the indigenous people of Australia my friend Alan green tree who's here yesterday he he works with a lot of these people he is a like a mining company and one of his like a bunch of the people that I work with would explain to him these different languages that they're not written down and you and your mob like they would call the Aborigines who call themselves like it's it's not like a clan it's called a mob they're a term for it would have a totally different language and someone who lives just a few miles away so they'd be a different mob it was a few miles away totally different language you can't understand what the fuck they're saying they don't know what the fuck you're saying then there's another one over here and there's never one the one I'm like how many do you think there is he's like I was probably hundreds well like hundreds hundreds of different languages nobody knows what the fuck anybody say it's almost like they don't want the other one to know because it's like they'll get their secrets maybe how many do you think there's another report that says there's this number of languages that are spoken in US homes as of this as of 2015 okay a smaller number but 300 350 Wow at least it says at least three if you had asked me before this conversation always said 13 yeah me too I was gonna guess actually I was gonna guess I'll laughing fuck that's a lot of languages dang that's so crazy foster's we're at fuck no no we're okay that makes my point I think the next stage is a universal language yeah universal language would like think about the Aborigines there that's how fucked up situation to be in nobody knows what the fuck anybody saying and none of those things are written down so you have to be in that clan to understand that language or that mob and then they die off and yeah they're not yeah their thing in small small ball well they didn't think it's not planned out well but we are connected everyone's interconnected and I think through a universal language it's entirely possible we could reshape civilization yeah through a universal language that every kid picks up in school you teach them bing-bong right up side English or Chinese or anything else but Bing bong is the the the Internet latter route and this internet language that everybody understands everybody just starts communicating through Bing bong and nobody yeah nobody's using regular language anymore you just occasionally talked like when you're in bed you talk ya bitch you remember dirty talk yeah English talk vile or French dirty talk there's a hundred and eighty five s that are spoken just in Los Angeles but that makes sense if there's 300 in the country I would think all of them would be here I'm more shocked that all money is pretty multicultural area there's a group in twenty five hundred people or so that speak Dutch at home and Riverside oh yeah that makes sense but only Dutch not egg well not only but that mostly maybe I get when the lights Riverside Dutch are so aerodynamic they move good you know you ever seen a Dutch that really are dynamic they're the what what are you doing your lean face lean headed four inches cheek to cheek or big people dude dude how big they're the Dodge Howe they're very tall but they're very aerodynamic very aerodynamic the downhill people they call him dude look at pull up a Dutch okay pull up arnesto who's yeah Ernesto let's get a gander at this fella right here miss Dutch kickboxer mr. perfect I bet you it's hard to kick him on the sides of his heads because he's a little less than others it's goddamn with Donais okay that's him later in his career too if you get earlier in his career he's more jacked get earlier in his career win it right there BAM take that picture right there no no the one above it where your cursor was to right to the right to the left of that one or right I'm sorry of that photo you just pulled up the right of the photo you just pulled up that one right there BAM that's what he looked like when he was in his prime let's get a phasic Dutch that guy's in advance though I feel like advance Dutch look at him yeah that guy's okay how about Rob came in our OB kam n ra n rather while the greatest kick boxers of all time and there we go aerodynamic yeah it come narrow as head is what I was looking at your sideways what up about basic Dutch God does not look like a guy with a narrow head bro yes it doesn't mind ah ah her head was next to his head you you you his head would eclipse your head no yes it would there'd be nothing behind you look how long that hit is narrow his head got in front of you I wouldn't even know you that I do is that you back there I'd see the bottom like I I'm back here jerking off with my not it doesn't count did I you think it's better be crazy in this I don't want thing about this but to watch people from different ethnicities jerk off you know we're back to this again but you know what I'm saying though cuz everybody probably you should watch a little from memory now uh yeah I'm jerking off from memory now do you find that your fantasies become more elaborate a hundred percent they're more exciting it up no set it up in your head oh no it's so how many days a week he beaten it more than four and you got a pro no two days a week and I'm disappointed at that I'm just trying to turn over a new leaf you know I want to not jerk off yeah I'll be confused I think that's uh that's look there's a read there's a if you just look at sexual desire and lust yeah there's a reason why you become more and more desperate as time goes on it's like your your sights are set too high or you're not being ambitious enough you got to spread your seed if you think about how ridiculous it is if people didn't know that having sex with people has consequences and and by that I mean you can get pregnant you can get diseases if there was no end of this cultural limitations people frown upon it but if there's none of those and imagine how much people would be fuckin oh yeah it would be insane yeah if there was no such thing as masturbating he could fuck at a gas station pee wee fucking yeah if there's no such mastery Batian wasn't possible first of all you know what would happen what women would rule everything 100% because man would have so much chi built up in them nope nope they're bitches they'd be given in every chance they go cuz the women would unit it would be worth so much more yeah because women would be able to decide whether or not you came there's only way that was the only way if women were the rulers yeah whether or not you came if there was no way to come without them oh my god they would dominate we're fucked dude I know that the next law if they're really smart that's how they would take over chop our arms off dude you telling me though you wouldn't watch like a little like Chinese guy jerk off from like 30 feet away go back to this again no but just tell me much train accidents I don't want them to happen Jamie pulls up a video of a train accident all my god you gotta see this watch it okay go ahead okay i watch it oh I don't watch that kind of stuff you know but tell me about this how close do you get like there's a Chinese got jerking off in a park okay and he's ma he's depends on Who I am he's Cantonese these Cantonese am i me right now you're you right now you're jogging right jogging yeah I was beaten off depends on how close like you stopped to tie your shoe right and you see him in the park like no that guy's definitely beaten off and you're about 200 yards away I probably would stay there how close would you walk to it I don't know when put someone's jerking off in public yes do one of two things you have an obligate depends on what he's doing is he looking at you and jerking off now if he's looking at you and jerking off if he's doing it out in the open he might be sick but he turned enough toward you that you're kind of invited I think no no no yeah you're right if you're in the park this is just I mean being 100% serious yeah if I'm running in the park okay I see you know five yards over to the side right next to a tree there's a guy beating off okay I'm gonna stop running and I'm gonna look at him and I'm gonna look at all the people around him and I'm gonna keep an eye on him and I'm probably either gonna call the cops or I'm definitely a stand there cuz what if some person is jogging and he just decides this is the time to jump on this person yeah what if some kid is walking by and he as that kid and drags him into the bushes this guy's so crazy he's beaten off in public and he's looking at you yes true I don't think I would go over and be violent with him but I would definitely keep my eye on him I'm not gonna let what if he's a fucking sexual predator and he's looking to do something to someone and you could be like Peter Parker and spider-man save your uncle Yeah right you know that's what made Peter Parker become spider-man he saved his uncle well he had the power and he didn't save his uncle a robber ran past him he didn't feel like he had to do anything about it the robber got into the elevator and it killed his uncle I don't even know that yeah that's the store wasn't an elevator I forget what the actual story was but the robber did something to his uncle and killed him his uncle was everything that hunka look care of him so then he decided he could never let evil people do anything bad again and he became spider-man like that superhero I think you have an obligation especially if you're if you're a man especially yeah like if I was a small woman and I was in that same situation I would say call the cops immediately you know don't try to be a hero get the fuck away from that guy but call the cops immediately but I'm pretty sure most dudes that are beaten off in the forest like that they're not looking for me right they're looking for a woman or a child yeah that's true they're probably not looking to meet another I wouldn't tell another dude if I saw another dude I'd grab another dude for sure to help me like let's get this dude I'd be like hey hey hey come here man this fucking guy's just beaten off oh and in most men would be like oh Jesus what do we do my cops keep an eye on I'm gonna call the cops yeah I'm let him get away call you know so many runs by tell them - oh yeah that's a see when someone's what someone's really crazy like that kind of crazy like some guy got arrested for trying to abduct a kid trying to drag a kid doing in his house and he had horns on his head yeah he's got horns he's a sexual predator and he's got those those implants in his head were yeah looks like some kind of stuff demon is his ears hang down to like it's fucking chin okay oh great that guy's out there that's a real guy just got caught right so if you run into that sort of a situation you like you have to as a person you can't just run way I feel like you got to stand you got to stand around and make this you know make people aware of it right say this guys coming over trying to come over here this guy is jerking off or yeah yeah I think getting somebody else to help but there's less of that than there's ever been before but there's always gonna be some of it so you're talking about with pedophiles like how do you stop that forever yeah how's that possible stop that forever and we had a dude in school when I was growing up this guy big Richard Wright and he ended up meaning big dick that's what you call him know this yep well we didn't know this is before we were old enough to know that dick and Richard were the same no or dick how about this how was Jack John I was short for John Jack is it really yeah I don't even know that JFK John F Kennedy John Kennedy Jack Kennedy oh wow I didn't know John Kennedy was the fuck is that yeah there's some other weird ones right yeah we're never gonna get a universal language I can't even get that right it's from Irish that's how you say Jack and Irish you got to look this up really yeah John since they're Irish that makes a lot more sense you enjoy the way you say John I believe it I guess if you said it fast and from far away cuz I'm like Jack John yeah short for Barbara is Babs yeah I know it Babs actually is that Babs that's weird short for Barbara barb is a rough name though I think harm like a hook yeah like and who wasn't a woman fuck barb all right now it's cute Barbies cute huh Sal is like a man's name Salvatore but that's a short fro well there's other weird ones with men I know there's some other weird ones that I forget big Sal I know a lesbian named big Sal whoa what's her real name Sally mano now so nice to be called Sal but one time she borrowed a man's bathing suit to go swimming with us and I thought I was pretty impressive no top or top no top dad hey let's go she's fucking so big Sam she was in the shallow end too daddy you know and that's a Matt's a healthy gal but yeah I think if somebody I was in Germany one time I was on a bike ride and they had a man swinging his dick in a big circle and I thought that that was but it was a nudist area of a part well if you got a new this area that's what you're gonna encounter yeah people swing index yeah I guess I was kind of sped off hmm you know I think about it sometimes about big Sal no buts about that guy in the park on what he was doing why he's doing that you know what I used to think I used to think oh look at that piece of shit now I think oh that was a baby right I was a baby that name became this helicopter dick weirdo why standing on the street pointing to his hog spinning spinning like that it's fucking weird it's crazy it's fucking weird it's weird that there are people that do that and how much of that is because of repression like that would if you went to the most sexually liberated country they have more or less perversion that's the question right and how much of it is imported like if you went to the most sexually liberated place like and how many of the people that come in are people from out of town that are weird that want freaky shit and then it becomes an economy yeah and how many people you just leave them to their own just be chill yeah because we're pretty caged up they say here in America it's pretty you know everything's kind of taboo and you can't see nipples and stuff on television and yeah it's weird but I wonder if that's also why we get so much done yeah you know like do we I mean maybe it's just maybe it's my perception that we get more done than other that were more productive I mean it's I think we focus on it a lot yeah a lot of things have definitely come from here I think that's changing right yeah but I think pedophiles going out of style - I think there was a time where more people got away with it easier that's for sure yeah it's hard to get away with it but God that that fuckin that whatever that is that makes a person do that just doesn't seem like we've eradicated that mmm it must be a loose wire and I'm imagine that the thing about that is if they could one day figure out a way to get certain traits and breed them out of people or engineered them out of people like we're fucked then well what if what what would you leave in like what would you leave in emotional outbursts would you leave in the ability to have an emotional outburst like what the fuck yeah would leave that would you leave that in that's fun yeah it's fun for me but maybe you and I wouldn't be the ones who decide would you leave sneezing in no I mean I'm a behavior male okay more emotional outbursts okay like fucking cunts yeah you fucking assholes like that kind of shit that's gonna shit yes I would leave that in I would leave that in to not a lot of it thought I'd turn it down a little and I wouldn't fuck with it I don't think it's our job to fuck with it okay cuz you need that if a war breaks out right yeah you can't have be some guys like Oh gonna need that in a war yeah you're gonna need that energy you need let that whole like male eruption fucking crazed aggression that you don't like well when an invading village is headed over the top of the hill you want that and a dude with an axe yeah you want that you want that to be available yeah agree unless we get to a point where we don't have any war anywhere ever again until then like what but what if we engineered it out with the Russians say they're going to but they don't they don't they would do that probably we would do that also we would definitely always so fucking sneaky do you think that we will have another war I hope not but that's always the fear right mean we're in the middle of two yeah well I think a could be you think there could ever be another state war in America of the blood go Civil War States people some people were worried about that some people weren't a government some people want state-run government well some people were worried about that as hate for the Republicans and hate for Trump in particular ramps up and that they're really worried that there'll be some sort of a violent outbreak between the right and the left and that this could actually really happen man it's not impossible it's not impossible that at least battles could break out because people are fucking polarized man yeah yeah but I think what's interesting to me is that more and more people it seems like at least from my perspective on the right are now coming out against Trump it seems more common more common especially with this government shut down people like what the fuck you know there's so many videos of people going what are you talking about what this wall like we need money like people of the government people a lot of our living check to check yeah you're shutting down their pick is the only way you can negotiate this wall this is the only way you can fund this wall this is crazy yeah yeah I mean it's I don't know I mean uh people always say the government sucks if I can shut it down and then it shuts down everybody gets mad you know well I it makes an argument that the government should be doing less things this is the real argument the argument is some of those things that the government does why does the government have to do it why can't it be privatized why can't it become a business it would probably run better if some of those things were not run by the government like airport security or like road maintenance or like a lot of other things yeah like don't have the government do it have private contractors do it from real okay yeah strong standards and and strong competition and john stossel actually has a video about it right now it's on his Twitter page it's a long video but explaining how one of the things people are realizing from this government shutdown is that the government does a lot of things that they don't have to do yeah it would be probably better for everybody if some of these things were streamlined some of these things were done by the private sector I don't think that's a bad idea yeah I think there's a lot of things that could be done better if there was competition as soon as the government controls certain businesses I mean maybe they do it really well maybe they don't you know I think that I think there's certain things that where socialism works really well like here's one fire department mm-hmm fuckin you gotta pay for the fire department everybody wants to fund the fire department don't ya cut the fire budget man what if my ground no fire a house yeah and we wants fireman we're gonna pay for the fire department pay for that shit pay for the police yeah pay and everybody says pay you shouldn't be rich people only get cops and poor people don't get cops that's crazy everyone would say that's crazy yeah right well why is that not the case with education to that well right don't you want people to learn things but yeah when did education becomes big business why is that a business it should be our goal as Patriots right to make less losers more happy successful people more aware people more educated people you know but instead it's like subsidized by the government and that makes even weirder and then you have student loans you can't escape you yeah a lot of that is pretty bizarre dude it's bizarre fuck it should be free but there's also like there's another like a lot some people don't want to do anything data is true want to be alive and they just they just they don't want to contribute and really have any sort of life and there's no desire for that and there's generation and generation and generation of them that is true but what if what you ever would you ever look at universal basic income it's a weird idea i flatly rejected it when I first heard do we have it no we don't have it they've tried it out in a couple of places but don't think it's really worked out that well but the idea behind it I'm having a guy who comes on soon his name's Andrew yang this is a proponent of universal basic income and the idea is to give people X amount of dollars per month whether it's a thousand dollars per month and everybody gets it no matter what and by doing that you take care of all of the burden of survival like if we take care of everyone in the civilization everyone occlude everyone gets shelter so that eliminates a lot of crime and a lot of strife just right away right question or lay back where's all that money come from there's a thousand dollars a month three hundred eight million is that what it was plus you know that was 2010 it's probably more now let's slate let's say 320 that is a lot of money 320 million thousand so that's 320 billion gee it's not what it is I have no clue 320 billion a month when that would be if you gave a thousand people a million dollars isn't that what it would be a thousand million is a billion right just do it in the calculator bro don't do it in your head thousand million yeah so that's right so must be so that that's so much money so three so the the wall like him talking about building the wall isn't he asking for five billion yet oh my five mil okay it's not that much I don't think well that's to build a wall once this is every month you would need all those billions hmm that's a lot of and so that means everybody would have their basic needs met yes everybody get a thousand bucks where that money comes from this is what I need to talk to this guy about obviously I'm not a mathematician or any sort of an economist so yeah I have any idea what they've how they feel like they could do this three thought they got that three thousand a more every adult in the country Jesus that's a lot less a stipend of 250 a month is that Andrew yang it's not from him specifically but it's a different guy from like guy was talking bad about it actually he's just giving you what people were oh someone talking that's a happy I yeah someone talking bad about it well yeah three thousand a month is a lot yeah that's crazy that's almost that's crazy but yeah $36,000 a year that's I mean look that would be nice right then you'd be in the top 1% of the world everybody over thirty four thirty four thousand yeah thirty four thousand dollars I think is 1% as it would cut the nation's poverty rate in half well yeah but where's the money coming from and also do you lose incentive at that point that's a good question is that bad yes dad to lose incentive yes why because that's what it's like the drive it's the only reason otherwise you nobody overcomes anything nobody achieve there's no is that true is it the is the drive does the drive always have to be for survival or can the drive be the drive to succeed and better yourself say see look at it this way if you have thirty five thousand dollars a year what do you think you'd be cool you'd be like I don't need to tour I got 35 grand coming no I'd want to work harder right I think a lot of people would want to work harder because I think your motivation would be different your motivation would be to do better than thirty-five thousand dollars but that thirty five thousand dollars would take care of you look if money was free and economy didn't make any sense and you could just fix it like that I would say yeah fix it like that where the fuck is all that money coming from that's a crazy amount of money yeah we couldn't do it week i'm ii n-- no and that means that were a lot of rich you would have to give up some of their money people aren't doing all of that to that would be nine hundred billion dollars every month yeah right he's doing that am i right about that three hundred billions not it's for every adult it's not to give it to every person oh okay every adult you know see definitely raise your kids they get the money fuck it to get a car three thousand no bills that's true that's true so how many people were dealing with how many people are adults it changes to out this is the argument they make does that you would end some of the subsidies that are already going on like Medicare and some security and maybe welfare in some cases because people would have money that they're spending or they're getting now so that money like I don't know it'd be worth a shot I think it'd be worth a shot but how long do you try to make you know cuz then people are gonna be like I needed more time you know right well that would be they wouldn't ever get their shit together there's some people that will definitely do that there's some people that will never get their shit together and I don't believe that this is a simulation I don't believe that they were in some sort of a video game but if we're in something that was learned that you were it was a learning environment mhm you would want both to have your own opportunities for failure and to see examples of failure around you you would want to see that like I'm not happy that Artie Lange that his nose is caved in and that he's got all these problems with drugs I'm not happy with that I love Artie Lange alright already lying to be clean I think he's hilarious I think he's a great guy the one thing that could be good that comes out of that for anyone other than Artie Lange and Artie Lange's loved ones and friends yeah is someone that's just looking at him online and sees what he's done and goes I fuck that inspiration I don't want to ruin this guy's in and out of court he's always getting arrested he keeps pissing hot it was easy there's even something today well the thing is that it's it's it's sad it's sad and people love the guy and you see this is dangerous yes drugs are dangerous yeah some people it hits them this way and for whatever host of factors are he's got it bad right he loved already so someone on the outside seeing that could be like Wow and that now is a thought in their head if somebody offers them those same drugs right and so hmm I don't need to make my life hit rock bottom I can look at this guy or that guy or maybe someone in the neighborhood or people around you that don't get their shit together you could see what happens right when they don't chase their dreams right follow their ambitions they don't they don't take the time to let the people around them know that they love them they don't do those things and you get to see that that's a little bit of your own education - it's not ideal right ideal would be everybody is doing great and we would all have this big old fucking happy community but yeah some education comes from that you get education and also but do you start to even specifically with Artie Lange do you ever think that when that sort of become such a big part of his life that I will like I've worried that that I wonder well it does he is he gonna falter with drugs and stuff it because it keeps his name in people's minds no I don't think so you know I don't didn't think people was he was always a successful guy anyway mom when I met him he was on MADtv then I met him in 1994 the same time I met Kalin I became friends with Artie we did a scene together where I played a boxer and he was a boxing manager I didn't know that you know he did that show yeah man it's probably online somewhere it's wow we look so young I was like I think I was 27 Wow yeah and he was probably the same age as me or real close as was Callen Callen it's just that's me right there that is crazy or the boxer yeah dude that is crazy look at the shoulders though huh OSHA what did you feel like to look at your young body like that weird is it yeah it's weird it's like a different person yeah doesn't doesn't feel like it was me yeah yeah yeah well you you look at yourself you know from the past fuck bro look at you Artie Ansem guy even already fucking handsome and yeah dude I had hair all that hair kind of an illusion was it yeah I was falling out it was definitely on the way did you know you were gonna lose your hair terrified yeah it's weird seeing my body with no tattoos - oh that's interesting at me yeah that wasn't even like weightlifting days that was all martial arts days dang bro strange I but yeah the first time I review heard Artie was just through drugged so maybe my perception of that is that you know well Artie you know he was a very successful comedian for sure from the Howard Stern Show from doing dirty work that Norm Macdonald movie and a bunch of other things MADtv so many different things that he did he was always very successful and very well liked like in the comedy world if you don't like like if someone says fuck already lying you'd be like what's really right who the fuck are you yeah why you don't like Artie yeah that's wrong he's the nicest guy ever it's just one of those things man you don't want to see it go down like that you don't want to but you learn from it yeah other people learn other people do learn from it other people learn from all kinds of things that people do wrong you know you don't want those things that happen but man they're educational for all of us we're all in this constant state of evolving this this culture that we're in right now the civilization is rapidly changing everything is shifting oh yeah thing and growing it's out of control man I mean it really is oh and a lot of elements even like um I was listening to the when you and bill bird were talking last time he's anybody's talking about like flying around and stuff like that and then he was talking about doing a comedy special he's like I don't even know what to do with it these days do I just do clips do I put it like yeah things just change so fast like a year ago or two years ago to been like oh this is exactly what you do make a special it's you know it's like do i well it used to be you didn't have an option you know the first guy who actually introduced it as an option was Louie because Louie decided to put his special on his website and you buy it for like five bucks which is a really reasonable amount and it was a really good special and it killed he made a shit ton of money right and then people realized that he made a shit ton of money and then people realize how good he was and then people realize how famous he really actually was and then everything started booming and taking off for him and he was already in the process of happening but it happened even more because he did that then Netflix came along right that's the ideal they shook it there's nothing better than that saturation that situation they just set it up so they put their like we're gonna get everybody we have a fuckin trillion dollars we're gonna get everybody we're gonna get all the greats we're gonna get Chappelle chain Chris right everybody fill in the blanks Sebastian they're just gonna correct Bilborough they're gonna just crush it and keep crushing it and then anything else now like if someone has a special on Comedy Central you go oh I guess Netflix wouldn't hook them up yeah yeah go to Comedy Central that's how you look at right in the comedy community right but I think a real player is going to be Amazon because this Amazon show the marvelous mrs. basil yeah people love it it is fucking good is it it's good as a comic I watched I get nervous I get anxiety when she's about to go onstage I gotta watch it dude it's fucking good the guy who plays Lenny Bruce kills it kills it he seems like a less seedy less problematic Lenny Bruce but he seems a lot like Lenny Bruce I mean it's you know he can only do so much with it he's written in as uh he's like someone who helps the marvelous mrs. Melanie CD was Lenny Bruce CD man a little bit I mean it's just I just I he doesn't see the guy this is just the way it's written doesn't seem like a guy who died of a heroin overdose right yeah we got yeah he seems like more together in the TV show hmm so mostly it seems like in the sheet TV show he seems like a victim of the censorship of the circumstances involved in that point in time more like in the future like he went mad you know if you ever see any of the Ainge one of the things that I noticed when I when I really started getting into stand-up I used to start I would watch some of the old stuff and one of the things that I found is you can I think I bought it as a VHS I forget I don't think it was online it was way before YouTube and this stuff was available online you could get old performances and I watched Lenny Bruce Wow in this videotape that I bought it's basically they're filming him going over his court case in front of a group of people it's really weird because he's not really telling standup he's just reading off of his court case oh wow it's kind of interesting it's interesting it's not it's not it's like he's going mad it's going crazy because they're trying to bring him in in jail they're finding him and arresting him and they're locking him up in jail and they're ruining his career because he's swearing onstage and what he's trying to say is like you know no this is I'm trying to point things out that I'm swear if I say something if I say a naughty word it's for a reason it's to express myself I'm not I'm not just just saying things because they're illegal and I want you to lock me up he went on trial for that oh yeah oh he went to jail for that he got arrested many times many times him and George Carlin look the reason why we can do it at the way we do it now has a there's a direct you could trace the path as a direct path to Lenny Bruce hmm Lenny Bruce started it all off I had agreed to do some more work he opened the door for guys like Carlin and Pryor his you know there's more it's all back then too but Lenny in particular he had a irreverence to him and this this notion to buck the current yeah standard of what you couldn't couldn't say you know he just changed changed what comedy was brave did use a you know there's people like that that are these these figures whether it's nikola tesla for technology and innovation whether it's you know there's a bunch of people like that in this world yeah they just changers one dudes like Elon Musk is another one one dude Wow just salut look at this Jesus Christ these these people that are like that one guy goes off in a direction yeah and I say I think like I wonder if say if they went to the universal um money for everybody right you've ubi or whatever don't necessarily think it's the worst thing in the world but then you have as much adversity for people like would you get a Nikola Tesla would you get a George Carlin would you get people if they didn't have to look at the world that they're born into and see not the things be uneven and you spark some desire you notice what if we get that I don't know I think you would only have your needs met I think you would still have your desire to improve I think that's an inherent thing but I think it would be more beneficial this is just a wild guess I'm oh yeah wrong it might be totally wrong it might be it might you might be right you might ruin people's ambition but it might raise the base level right so what we're we're we're operating from it's never the same level of desperation so maybe we're not as mean to each other right but maybe the innovation still takes place because people are always going to want to be challenged and maybe it comes from a good place right instead of from this constant place of desperation right so if somebody goes from a zero to a ten in their life which would be you know somebody that does something unique and special and outstanding if everybody all are automatically is given a three at their base then now that person's gonna get us to a thirteen yeah or maybe you just don't have as much of violence you don't have as much sadness oh that's true because people yeah people were violent when they see they want stuff from other people if you're your food if your food and your shelter is always met like we don't have that right and we've talked about earlier about like cultures have standards and these standards they're different everywhere and those communities accept them and they don't like it when you try to change the standards if our standards here were that all of our needs are met we just we decide as a community if we're gonna stick together and call ourselves America we should treat ourselves as a family we treat ourselves as a family we shouldn't ignore neighborhoods we shouldn't ignore communities that are downtrodden we shouldn't ignore any kind of poverty we shouldn't ignore lack of education or a lack of nutrition we shouldn't ignore those things so if we take care of all all those things from all of those things first before we do anything else if you had a re-engineer America would you think hey what we have to do is ramp up the military budget by 94 billion dollars because we're basically arms dealers yeah we're gonna make these deals with Syria and Saudi Arabia wherever the fuck we could sell rockets do it so yeah but that's what we do that's what we that is what we do but if instead someone came along and said no the way to make this country stronger is not make the arms industry bigger the way to make this country stronger is to make the human industry better right make it better let's fine-tune humans fine-tune oh yeah why have we done that less losers yeah 2024 I like Theo von run for president that would be the best I'll be your vice president you like pants I don't do anything I like that man hang back and eat chicken nice and all the weird hair I got a P so bad yo is it okay pasta vote in your head go ahead good see we're probably almost done anyway it's already three o'clock go P okay go infographic on it the EBI it's because there are the argument for the positive or wanting it is a lot of job they're gonna be replaced by robots soon right yeah these are some of the jobs there that are at risk yeah they think automation automation is gonna kill most jobs so insurance underwriter ninety nine percent of jobs are at risk farm laborer ninety seven percent of jobs artless Wow fast food cooked ninety seven percent of jobs at risk construction laborer eighty eight percent truck drivers 79 percent mail carriers sixty eight percent Wow they recently had a robot cooking food I think it was called flipy they don't remember where they put I think it was somewhere the United States maybe but they just fired it was the word they used because it was doing too good whoa yeah fire day because it was doing too good that doesn't I get I believe it yeah yeah that's a stupid ass ended way of looking at it I don't understand that stupid shit someplace called Kelly burger it was too good that's so stupid that's so dumb it's been sidelined at least temporarily turns out the automated fast-food worker created by miso roebucks what a victim of his own success 50 burgers an hour Wow so yeah why is that bad it's better it's way better it's better than you you don't work that job now right I'd suck at that job if we can find some other things for people to do me yeah but you know I'm good at a couple of things I'm not good at flipping burgers what you're not good at that you don't want to fucking mindlessly flip burgers it doesn't even need a mind why not leave the mindless things to them to things with no mind so this is the idea behind it but the problem is where's the money come to take care of all the people with the universal basic income and are you saving enough money with the robots to make it actually profitable to pay for people pardon that if you save more money and more money implementation well Andrew Yang is gonna come in here and he's gonna explain all this stuff to me in a way that's supposedly gonna make sense he seems really smart and he was on Sam Harris it's podcast and that worked over there man this much urine I've ever held I think congratulations hell is it how much can you hold look out car D Drive Theo von I Drive a BMW but I'm trying to get rid of it figure you more for a muscle car type fella really yeah I used to own a 1984 Ford Escort and somebody stole my passenger seat god damn it yeah what are they gonna do with a passenger seat I don't know probably put you know put in the living room I would guess at the time put in the forest and jerk off dude how much comes out in the fucking forest bro uh yeah that's where the next no wonder swamp thing happened well I was thinking this once they found out that in some plants some plants contain DNA from salmon because the salmon yeah we're used as fertilizer by the plant as it decomposed it got into the actual plant itself and you can actually somehow or another through some sort scientific process that I'm too stupid to understand they can actually detect salmon in the actual plant itself we're closed so if you were whacking off on that tree and that tree it's every day that's your spot you went down to that titty tree and and whacked off on the roots yeah and then like after a while you did an analysis and you found your D in the tree itself oh yeah Oh be great man if it maintains the information of everything that walked off on it you have a little son made out of wood one day mmm you they had a kid in our town of one time does he's got made his son a wooden shirt that I tell you that a wooden shirt yeah he made his son a shirt out of plywood for Christmas what yeah he wanted a kid to wear it oh yeah he did and I remember I was um wait a minute is it a stiff shirt or is it he make it like little itty-bitty tiny pieces of plywood and weave it all together oh no I was pretty stiff and the dad was a yeah like an Elvis impersonator you know what dad was an Elvis impersonator casino or did he do it at carnivals notice locally oh um but we didn't even money in that no no money really I think he's probably not all but he had uh he had four kids and one of them he made I was going walking home one night and I heard him in the garage and he's making like a son like a like a for Christmas like a wooden shirt like a you know oh there you go oh not as nice that one is nice wouldn't shirt yeah can you get oh but that's a like a sculpture yeah that's nice can you get one more that's like like if you went over someone's house and they have a wooden shirt on a hanger like and they think that's cute just leave no now this kid needed it because people we just witnessed kid that's a man sculpture yeah it's a framed wooden shirt it looks like he's used to beat him up because of his wooden sure know people used to beat him up anyway on the bus well the wooden shirt would protect you from a lot of shots it's an idea and it helped him wouldn't sure you better shut the fuck I swear to god he did a kid's not walking around with wood over his body like that not a daddy that would be yeah this was your pads inside it looked happy fuck no dude do you think his dad is estee lauder lady yeah see there's some lady with something there okay but this was early it might have been teak then look up teens way too much attention yeah they're posing pretend to be aloof Shorthair by the ocean we're in a wooden shirt a big no that's a big no from me hey do you want to meet my friend she's channeling with her fucking geometrically patterned wouldn't shirt on what no I like regular people this kid's name was Eddie can you look up teak what does teak look like you imagine if someone was trying to set you up with that gal you'd be like well I'm torn because obviously she's very pretty you sure she's not crazy she might have splinters at her tits just dude it was one photo shoot she doesn't wear that yeah except when she worships the ocean I don't like now that's something a little more malleable teak or something like that what are the kind of wood do they have over print shirt now we're talking print yeah so it was like that but a little bit more but more real and he wore this for what reason get out action like a chestplate like a yeah Roman soldier Todd would say like that okay was it like how was it connected on the waist on the sides rather it was just kind of like a long square it was almost like a kind of a cereal box kind of where did he put his arms legrest his arms on the side in the side yeah fuck your armpits up I was limiting I mean look man these were I mean the man that made it not a real you can't do this my people would find out they would call him out what ya doin I was young you could do anything you wanted to you know people that people were I don't know just more fun you use your imagination more when I was young you have more fun how many kids you see beaten your kid people used to beat their kids oh yeah probably like at least 20 I bet oh yeah people would be polite in the street beat their kids yeah you know yeah you see people beat people up let's prove way more common but I guess it's maybe we've moved out of those areas too that's true people back in those areas like bro I'm on the front line shit still going down yeah easy to see if he will fight man I saw this old man get thrown into a fire one time in a ditch fire that people were burning throwing right in this guy was in his eighties to mr. Pulido my god why they throw me in a ditch he was fighting a bus driver he was fighting our bus driver and I'm the bus driver threw in a ditch yeah I don't know why was he swinging on the bus driver I don't know whose fault was it both of them both of them I think I mean one of you know they're both adults I mean look man I'm not surprised they were doing it well you know reasonable humans yeah yeah it yeah if you saw me with me shocked they were fistfight like what do you do with people like that once universal basic income rolls around and there's some stupid people that just ain't getting any better basic needs met okay so then after that after you do a couple years universal basic income then what do you do wolves in the woods yeah let wolves loose go thin the herd it's insane man get some dude out there jerking off thinking he's hanging out behind a bush he just turns these six wolves looking up and they just know what to do well you think a wolf would attack you while you were jerking off or no fuck yeah you're all pink everything's pink it has pink dick looks delicious when you wearing clothes it's like can I eat that I guess I can eat that I gotta get through all that fucking bullshit plywood t-shirt once I get through that I'll eat the fuck out of that dude but if they catch you out there with just all pink oh yeah they eat the fuck out of you yeah yeah I hope I don't do anything bad like that innate in any of them see me you know I don't want to be have that kind of ending you get independent I'm gonna say right now I don't think that you're gonna be jerking off in the woods and eaten by a wolf I might be wrong yeah but I would say that's not how you're gonna go thanks for not like I just don't see that in you back I see better things for you naked your pecker in your hand imagine it's like you're about to come and the first wolf built your cap bit your calf you look look they're gonna get me anyway I'm just keep going on the edge oh yeah maybe the bite and the pain cuz you're about to come once you uh rock it you you bust like you get more than usual yeah and you're like wow at least I'd I'd be my biggest load ever okay that that's one thing you've always been disappointed by right is the sheer volume of your loads well it's not much if you look at it take at it next to sink in magnesium really yeah allegedly egg whites I do have to sink at the house actually sinks supposed to be good for raising testosterone Oh bro that boss at the neighbors the more you save it up - oh yeah gather up more but I like to do that nocturnal I want to ride I want that dream bus that used to get super bus yeah dude I want that dream bus never when you would bust in a dream mmm those don't happen anymore but they can if you search for it if you seek it out yeah but you have to not be to offer a long time to the point we bought it bodies like this dumb motherfucker can't even jerk off yeah I'm just gonna have to jerk off for him like unconscious your brain fucking jerks you all are asleep what do you think do you think that you're learning things while you're dreaming because some people think you learn things when you dream I think that'll be one of the next hurdles that we get over where people are able to be able to take in information while they're asleep this is what I mean like they say if you have a problem if something's bothering you you should sleep on it and when you wake up in the morning you'll have a clearer perspective I believe that yeah I think so too I think that's real cuz I've done that before that seems to actually be a good strategy if you can go to sleep the problem is if something's really bothering you like damn we're gonna figure this out like you might stay up all night and be exhausted and then you might not be able to sleep and think through it you got to get a higher power to help you out man yes you got to get us where a higher power comes into place do you think you see yourself ever going to church again yeah I would think so I think Churchill is kind of evolving over our time and stuff like that and we just go to Justin Bieber's preacher Carl Lentz you know he is hey whoa he texted me actually whoa he's trying to groom you trying to pull you in how you get dark arts how low low do you wear your shorts huh oh I saw you guys make it out of this room yeah that was a little wild huh so you know him I've never met him no you just text each other back and forth yeah we communicate sometimes yes that's that route hashtag dick route yes and he uh looks good yeah they're both camo - I think Jo shorts yeah but I've never met him but all we go is chase each other yeah let's try to meet you know like not tonight you think he's somewhere erotic no oh oh yeah that's a weird way of putting it every time here you talked about jerking off the magical problem it's like you came in here with a gay expectation how I got into it I jerked off yesterday I'm not gonna planning on coming again for a couple days huh do you have a time where like if you've jerked off and it's been like four days like man maybe I should do something no I get that feeling inside of me some it's like a vulture that wants to fly out of my fry right right okay brain you don't want to be like two sex-obsessed no like there's a balance right you don't wanna beat off everyday no

I'm a fan maybe I need to see another side of him I mean I would give to Scott it gets an old man just get to know him dude when I was a kid I was a gigantic Dice Clay fan I mean when I first started meeting him at the store I can't believe he's healer but once you got to know him as an adult I mean being if he's been always been cool yeah yeah maybe better seem to have a new experience with him yeah he's you know he just his dice he's crazy like half of his thing like if you go to his Instagram page half of it is like a put-on he's always fucking around oh yeah always being funny yeah that's true but he gave me very good he's the reason why I started touring he gave me very good advice when I was you know select in the 90s man he's like you should go fucking tour he's like you're funny he won't hang around here all the time yeah I was like yeah he's right I don't want to hear on here like I should do clubs I should make a living and this is what he was basically saying was like don't get roped into only working in Hollywood and doing television shows and stuff like that because then these other people he'd control your destiny you could tour yeah and this is from him obviously coming out of he had the most insane epic success of any comedian ever yeah he was a rocketship he was he had sold out hundreds of arenas arenas giant-ass places a why remember when his DVD or his see whatever would hit the neighborhood and whenever all the kids were watching it and I wouldn't even allow to watch it so I thought when I was listening to him talk I was thinking oh yeah of course like this guy probably made more money than anybody ever did on a sitcom ever oh yeah and he did it just doing whatever the fuck you wanted to do and he was basically saying hey don't get wrapped up in this only you could tour you can make money mmm I mean even if I'd never made money the way he did you could still make a living whereas if you don't tour and you just do sitcoms or just work in television especially if you work as a writer that's the dark path the great stand-up comic that becomes a writer they never tour and they never develop a crowd and does that happen yes it happens a lot but weren't they just supposed to be a writer then oh no no no no no they gave in to the writing they could have when we know great comedians who mostly work as writers it doesn't make any sense when they don't want to they want to be a comic out there performing and the level of their material is far better than the level of their notoriety mm-hmm you know I see you're saying yeah there's Owen Smith there's a perfect example Owen Smith in my opinion it's one of the best comedians on the planet he's a killer that dude makes me cry funny guy and he's oh good his timing stage presences delivery is material the subject matter it's excellent it's top-shelf comedy yeah but most people don't know who he is right that's cuz he's made a means made a great living as a writer but he's still he should you know he should be recognized as a comic as well yeah that's how I look at it so basically what dice was telling me back then was like get out go go someplace mmm go do the road do comedy out there you could headline clubs well gratefully yeah I mean it I'm gonna glad you did that because if we didn't get you you might not be the same comedian if you didn't say that yeah I'm sure and I don't know you know it's easy like it's easy to just decide someone's an asshole or you know you have one interaction with someone you want to shit on them I just think we should be and I'm trying to do this myself to be very careful when you shit on somebody yeah when is it when is it valid and when is it just you looking for something to shit on right like when are you showing no empathy ya know when what is it now I think I mean I yeah you're right I mean I'm willing having new it you know a new experience too late you fucked up fuck he said his name he said Mook it's over oh well I don't care about that I mean he's gonna get mad well he he was an asshole yeah so it's okay if I they he just they kept their like he was on stage before me so I was gonna go up after him he was probably joking around run yeah but at a certain point it was it was just ruin aspect no it was looks like he kept not getting it and then did like I fuck you know is this like it at a certain point to me it was just rude I see because you were probably a little bit anxious you're going on after him and then he's not saying your name right you feel like oh he doesn't know who I am so this is kind of disrespectful there could have been there could have been yeah I think that that certainly could have been my party if I could admit some ego and a 99.9 percent fucking around yeah he thought it was funny maybe one he would do that if it was if he knew you yeah he'd be like oh who Bobby Lee right he's alive I mean that's part of who he is right well maybe I'm and maybe I'll have an opportunity to get to know him better him and I Marrero hate each other they do I'm great friends with both of them now I loved watching him at MIT seashores when he performed his mini shores reunion our deaths party but I remember I liked watching him there you know I don't I mean I think that he's a great comedian and stuff that you know who what is he like now though I don't know who would you've liked have seen live I got to see him live when he was really old and sick unfortunately I love him man yeah he's from near where my mother's from in Illinois Peoria yeah house I at least got a chance to see be in his presence and see him live yeah and he had this kind of he kind of had this head bob thing that was very you know who I think could come back and murder stand-up right now Roseanne Eddie Murphy yeah I think if Eddie Murphy came back right now he would murder stand-up murder it somebody said that the other day they were thinking he might come back he did a thing one day where he was talking about Bill Cosby about them taking awards away from Bill Cosby and he did this Bill Cosby impression and he did it with this what does that say what happened pop-ups come on the fire too sequel it's coming back for that the movie oh really well is our CEO in it too just he just had his tenth kid Wow shoot just shooting mad loads now there's a guy who needs a birch tree in the yard 57
