yes legit I don't sit on wallet so I don't play with wallets fuck no you ready I wasn't sure you got have to move cameras around Phil show me is you have a it's a mini fanny pack it's very small it's it's like you can carry everything I need and a small phone you can't carry a modern phone that's like pre-modern ah the six fits in there is six plus would this be a problem baby bang against your dick so what's going on man so for everybody who hasn't seen you on the podcast before let's give them a brief synopsis you were a trainer at one time at Marineland and you you're known as the walrus whisperer that's your your handle on Twitter which I didn't select by the way you didn't know how'd you get it I was on a TV show called wipeout and it was grassroots as hell in Canada so basically what they do is they fly your charge and Tina they they sort of you rent the the course so and then they instead of it being you know wipe out whatever country this time it's Canada so it was really grassroots II and so they told us if you guys can like help advertise so get on your Twitter's get on your this get on your that they called me walrus whisperer it just made sense to put it otherwise I see I don't particularly love it so it was like for a show it was but let's explain you worked for Marineland you got fired you were you were taking care of this walrus and it became like a big cause because a lot of people were concerned about the animals safety there and since then they've been cited like what has happened with Marineland okay well so I'll give you a quick rundown so I worked at Marineland I was killer whale trainer I was the guy jumping off the killer whales doing the right flips off dolphins everything else I wasn't fired I quit amidst some duress a difficult period where and I'll elaborate the basically a water disinfection unit broke down and the resolve wasn't so much to fix it it was to pump it with more and more chlorine basically the way water is disinfected at Marineland they used an ozone generator so they use ozone in conjunction with the chlorine cesare mitigate the chlorine use they elected instead or rather the sole controlling mind elected to put off actually fixing it and let's just at night they're pumping it with chlorine well you can just imagine the effect I'm the hugging time with a little bit of chlorine so this was a tough time so I actually quit I actually couldn't even imagine the effect so it hurt the animals oh yeah we talked about this on the earlier shows that people want to go back in time a few years to when you're first appeared on the show there was like some serious issues health issues with dolphins right had their skins peeling off there they've got ulcers I mean the sea lions are losing fur and patches bleeding out I mean this case is at least one animal died and things started getting real bad and of course my walrus in in all of this is there and she's in the water as well so if this only compounds the issue and the thing about the walrus is it's and I usually work a lot it's anomalous my relationship with she thinks I'm her mom he was like a scientific thing that happened her brain circuitry opens I am print on her so my smell everything I look like or you know when she was a baby well she was actually 2 years old when it happened that's what makes it kind of fast on a baby that's not a baby no how old is that in the walrus world like is it dog years no she's still young I mean she's not dog years she's babyish yeah 2 years it's not but she's fairly young and you were caretaker so she imprinted that you were her parent well there was sort of a traumatic thing that happened we we were drawing blood from them because back then you know they're not trained to accept the pain of drawing blood and so she wasn't conditioned for this they were young we had to get blood so we were actually doing a job on another walrus and she was sort of loose running out and we were wrestling her down and and smooshy come over she's climb and hectic and crazy and you know she's still almost 300 pounds at that point you know you got a mover if she's climbing all over you it's a big obstruction so I sort of put my hands in front of her face and that's what happened I'm telling you you could it was like a magical moment all of a sudden something happened and she just looked at me her eyes changed I changed I was now a different person I'm now her mom she was following me so I walked down away from the scene just following me and from that moment on she never stopped and that's the sort of became the basis of our relationship is that I've sort of raised her so dude you put like the touch on her they put the touch on it yeah with these two hands right here in forever face and what is that a normal thing with animals like I said it it almost never happens you hear of animals imprinting on humans a lot of times not usually at at her age that was a bit advanced for that to happen usually it happens when they're very young right if it's gonna happen yeah because it does happen when people raise bears and a lot of weird animals that you wouldn't ordinarily think as pets but I don't know if it would be an actual imprint like the imprint is different there's one thing of familiarizing how do you differentiate well it's just it's natural oh she's protective of me she will not leave my side I mean I could walk to the edge of the earth with her she'll be beside me you can't do that with her she's still a Marineland right now yes I haven't seen any updated photos in some time so it can't be absolutely sure but yeah I'm fairly sure but she's hidden they won't they do not bring her on display she's not on display you're not gonna find her why they hide they hide the pinniped basically seals sea lions and walruses they bring them in her case she doesn't perform anymore when she comes up she's not reliable you can't get her to do anything all she does is goes out on stage and she looks for me frantically so she's not reliable so they bring her up between shows occasionally so she can see the Sun and that's it and so you know I've got to have people in there with video cameras ready and I mean it's tough but we get the videos we get the information I need so what's going on with you and them now because there's been a series of lawsuits and this is one of the reasons why you wanted to come in here and talk right so they've so they sued me of course frivolously they sued me with plotting to steal a walrus is the is the their allegation this was in 2000 this is actually five year anniversary comes up on on violent plotting to steal walrus did you try to get her out of there no if I tried to get her out of there and have her today no I wouldn't I have nowhere to put a walrus well that's not true you have a river in the front yard but I have no interest in releasing her into the NAG River and then watch her go over the falls it's I have no interest right so no nothing like that I don't have a beach front Arctic home two carriers who but yeah so they started suing the shit out of anyone who spoke anyone who spoke on the record was getting sued so it wasn't just me it was a number of people and yes so we just elected to try to fight as long as we could try to sustain this legal battle because you know in lawsuits you've got to reveal a lot of information to lawsuit it's not fun like this I mean real ins had everything from my phone to like the I mean not physically but I've given what do you mean like everything like your phone we found communications I have everything yeah wait a minute so if they sue you for trying to take a walrus that you didn't actually try to take they can get access to your phone records they can ruin your life yeah but that doesn't mean anything they can get access to your phone or why would they have access to your phone records yeah they have I have a legal obligation of giving them anything that is relevant to their claim so be it communications be it but what does that mean does that mean they can read all your text messages read all your emails read all things law yeah they know everything yeah Wow it's crazy and I have zero from them after five years because they're using the system as it means to simply abuse me and acting the fool as their as Marine Lines legal team does exceptionally well proves prove very effective in you know abusing a guy like me whereas a corporation with endless amounts of money just sue the shit out of me so they're basically just suing you to punish you and to try to keep other people from doing the same thing and talking out about them they've sued media they've sued a student eighteen-year-old kid from California who didn't it was a yet to be released project movie he made almost like a cartoon he it was in the in the key of marine lands Canada's last remaining Orca Kiska and marine lion caught wind of that they sued him for a million bucks of course I assume that's settled now I don't know and there's no way of knowing cuz I haven't heard anything above it but and what was their lawsuit based on they at least in what I think I just scanned the documents but they allege that I can't remember then how does that work when they sue someone from California does you have to go to Canada that's interesting I don't know actually I and that's that what's what was so confusing about I was like now you're you're suing Americans and stuff like I don't know if that works they suit another writer in fact as well an American writer they don't give a shit though Basu yeah didn't they get they get fined recently so didn't something happen along those lines yeah they got charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty a little over a year ago I was in court of course Marineland Suzhou SPCA for 21 million alleges agency wanted to destroy the theme park so that's where we were gone so basically down the road over the course of okay I got to get into this okay so the charges they have 11 charges of animal cruelty first they were five and are five or six and then an additional five or six now there's total of eleven charges for animal cruelty that marine line has to go to the criminal court to defend against okay they dragged it on as always I'm in court every freaking day you can bet your ass even even one time there was a it was a confidential meeting in fact it was not for public I mean a local writer knock on the door would cut sort of walk in and the lawyers are looking I was like the fuck you doing here but I hate like we sit in on well anyways I don't know what you just said there was a there was during the negotiations right between the the the crown and the ospc a for the town yeah the crown that's the one who would be laying the charges the animal cruelty charge so you get charged okay what is the crown what are the the crown is like the is the justice he's like the essentially the judge here before the judge he doesn't wear one but okay so so it's like crown land and no crown land it's public land yeah so right so I imagine that's probably in sort of capacity why it's called crown I don't know I'm not a legal expert but nonetheless so they're in there negotiating and basically the way animal cruelty charges are our pursued is they have to meet two thresholds number one you have to have a reasonable chance of conviction number two it has to be in the public's interest to pursue a series of the first charges were immediately dropped because and this is since just driving me crazy for years that this has been going on it continues but if I for instance if I make a complaint to the ospc and I provide a photo of an animal which of course I did that is clearly damaged and fucked up if they don't physically have evidence of who it is that's actually harming the animal there's no cruelty they can't do anything so in that case they dropped a lot of the charges against marie-line because the evidence didn't actually point to anyone specifically it was just evidence of damaged animals okay so they threw a bunch of okay but then there was a bunch that were that they did have a good chance at a conviction and this is where Marineland promised the crown that this was going to be a very expensive process long and drawn-out process and the crown agreed that it didn't meet the threshold it exceed the threshold of being in the public public's interest in spending a lot of public dollars pursuing these charges and so they dropped the rest of them Marineland turns around and Sue's the OU SPCA for 21 million dollars claiming that it was malicious prosecution that of course they named they didn't name me specifically but I'm always the unnamed Marineland employee in that and they alleged that I threatened to defund them and all they think I'm this Keyser söze like character which I don't mind playing up a little bit but they think I'm pulling strings all over the place and that I half exist half don't I think there's employees there that think that I'm like no so they they get brought up on 11 charges of animal cruelty the charges get dropped and they turn around sue the government 21 million dollars the same government that led them off for years the OU SPCA has been complacent they're complicit in sorting allowing Marineland to operate as they have unimpeded for you know 50 50 years they've had a good relation Marineland in fact donated the land of which the Niagara Falls Humane Society is is built on which is where the OU SPCA operates on it they would learn there was a plaque on the wall until you know after 2012 and we started spoke out that honored marine lands owner John holder for his generosity yeah you sort of get red pill is that red pills at the right pill pretty when you it's the wake up pill so that was my wait what moment holy fuck thinks things started to change pretty fast for me once I'd realized the depth of which marine land was sort of in with all levels of government really all levels of government and so they've you know they continue to sort of allow for them to do these things but but they're suing the government yeah and we can't possibly be in bed with the government and suing them or the Canadian Association of zoos and aquaria much used to accredit all the zoos in Canada or still does they accredit them so they try to they try to say oh this is a good zoo it's accredited Marineland I believe also threatened them because they were not going to renew their there their agreement this year and so Marineland claimed to have left them and they said you know we're in the phase of development right now we're gonna just leave this Canadian Association of zoos and aquaria it's absolutely bullshit they were not they were so yeah Marine Lines basically has their there out of friends that's for sure finally but it took a lot of shit to get finally get that to get that so but the real issue in your mind is the way they treat the animals the way they've run their business right is that well I would say that I've expanded now into just arguing that those animals should not be in a Marine Lines possession be all together the whales your rules is done it should be done done it should be done and I think after blackfish I mean before you came on or when you cave on it was before blackfish had been released and then once people saw what actually happens to these super intelligent animals when you lock them up in swimming pools they they're starting to realize it and see world's attendance is down and people are down on the whole idea especially killer whales I mean god they're just giant majestic animals it seems so fucked up to put them in these tanks and to separate them from families I mean the emotional distress they go through I'm a firm believer that emotionally we don't even have the slightest sense of how complex they can be right because they don't have an ability to express themselves to us and other than eating us occasionally and they're G killer whales only do in captivity yeah there's no there's no records of killer whale attacks in the wild yeah state fuck people up in captivity though like enough know I've been in the pool with a pissed-off killer whale have you oh yeah I jumped in one time I was I mean I was a stubborn dad a bit of a cowboy as a young guy too and like adrenaline junkie I like to have fun I like to jump off the killer I like to hurt throw me up high I was having a show with her basically the way it was was she throw you their tail or on the end of a rostrum right on the end of her no she dunked you it's called a rocket ready ghetto huh eat on the front of the whale as such at the top of the water and then she starts to pump her tail and you dive down with her she'll follow you everywhere everyone you go and then it's like flying a plane man it's amazing and then you just arc up and then she just takes it to the moon and she's screaming underwater when she's having a good time or rather when she's expressing herself that she's gonna toss you this particular time when when I was when I probably shouldn't have gone in the water by while she was pissed I could see in her eyes how could you tell that she's perfect the animals lick it I mean that's the whole basis of being a trainers to get to know the animals know their behavior know everything about them you spend a lot of time with them what are the indications so in this case I was so the way those the shows work I mean they don't they don't exist anymore but back in the day was you work the animal initially just to get a sense of their demeanor so you got him jump in you got him run around you get a gauged you know you get a good sense of how they are on that particular day she just wasn't responding real quick her eyes were a little big big she wasn't focused on me she's looking elsewhere she's sort of drifting off a bit I just didn't really have her attention but I think I don't know what maybe I had my dad in the crowd or something I wanted to jump off her so I look at the senior trainer at the time she's like I don't know dude like you're gonna jump in on my fucking I'm jumping in I go to jump in I get to the edge of the pool she's standing directly above or below me I dive over her she she lunges at me and she snaps and I see it from below be like I see under that she's jhana and snapped at me so now I've snapped at you like tried to bite ya she tried to grab me so now I'm gonna feel like if she really wanted to bite you she would just oh yeah well so so now I'm so warning bite or was it a bite bite probably definitely a warning bite otherwise I wouldn't be here tonight she if you that's what I'm saying like it's not she would miss no she's not gonna miss so and so happens so it gets further so now I'm in the water and I'm now at the top of the water and and staring down at her she's now inverted upside down and she's swimming and she's circling the pool upside down yeah huh what you get frustrated they start doing these things she's upside down and she's swimming in circles I'm looking I got a whole leash it if I if I take off out of the pool that's gonna trigger some response out of her that I don't necessarily want to know so I'm saying come on why would that happen I think that it if she doesn't want you out of the pool you're not getting out you're if you're getting out of the pool it's gonna be on it's gonna be her decision if I if I start trying to race out she knows I'm trying to get out she doesn't want me out she's staying me there she's keeping me in it I don't want to know where that's going that's interesting so you knew that you had to stay in there then I'm without choice that's that's the best course of action at this point because I'm not gonna win a race out of that pool and so now I'm up right she comes to the surface and I see her dorsal fin and she's coming pretty quickly at me and I put my hands up like this I don't never forget it she arcs her tail down arcs her back up like stops dead at me I remember this big wake happened I put my rostrum I just sort of tap or cut a comer and then I put my feet on her pecs I sort of she takes me to the stage she dunks down she and then she picks me up puts me on the stage I sort of back away like wow thank you thank you for like being nice to me I had a friend's dad one time there and he's one of these guys I took I took him on a tour I'm like okay just don't touch the big male sea lines I mean they got big teeth I wanna rip your arm off they can they're not typically aggressive but just don't touch him and he's in there like this I'm like aw dude I'd take him out to show the killer whale I could see that and this is another time of course but I could see that she's losing patience and she did the same thing as soon as we turned our backs I said to my go you know what maybe we should just step away as soon as he turned his back to go she lunged the same thing and tried to tried to grab it's crazy man and I was just like holy shit so they don't have killer whale shows there anymore well that killed that particular killer whale kiss cos she's the only one left in Canada there's no more in Canada it's not ever going to be marine lines never gonna get another one she's been sort of unresponsive for a long time she's on a lot of medication medication tons of Medicaid what kind of medication you put a killer whale on well she's got different I mean you could gauge the blood you start putting on minor antibiotics the antibiotic you get them on how do you take blood from a killer whale flip them over and they got out they've got a in their tail there's a series of large veins you just roll them over they let you yeah everything is everything is everything is trained in that there you're gonna provide it voluntarily so and it takes a long time to train these things but you train them sit and you just prick it you just literally grab this little needle you put it in the in the vein they don't get pissed at you they get pissed if you miss and you keep trying oh don't do that fuck yeah I've seen it happens but they let you take their blood if they're healthy and responsive yeah of course if they're not there's nothing that's gonna get you to the get them to the edge of the pool but so you you take their blood and then they what do they find seven to the loud you want to look at cortisol levels how the stress is you want to look at white blood count see if they're fighting any infections you know there's always you know in her case there's always something a lot of the animals are in fact on valium a lot of different sites yeah tons what's that that is like rampant use in in in in the aquariums y-yeah valium yeah I'm reelin accused me of stealing valium in fact in the lawsuit as well which is absolutely not true is this is this used everywhere oh yeah just Marineland oh not just Marineland SeaWorld's everywhere yeah what yes like dolphins dolphins are on valium all the time sure I when I was when I was when I left marine land I had the agreement again I left fairly amicably considering the the situation but you know I wanted to play my cards right and marine lands owner called me back in specifically to help a dolphin and it was defeated of course though I wish that wasn't the Daily Mail what's what's the other one the dodo is the dodo a good one BuzzFeed let's go with BuzzFeed SeaWorld puts its whales on valent volume like drug documents say Jesus fuck those documents are from a lawsuit between marine land and sea world where SeaWorld sued marine land sea on terror at SeaWorld sued marina they're all benzodiazepines I'm telling you Wow trainers give their orcas although also known as killer killer whales a psychoactive drug benzodiazepine according to the sworn affidavit filed an hour to Ontario Superior Court of Justice and dispute between the park company and a rival company Marineland over the transport of a prize killer whale akika i can't go i cake is if you watch blackfish you've got Tilikum that's the one that killed ya that's people that's Tilikum son we had his son Wow we had him he was I mean he captivity right in captivity in a pool by himself or the most raised in cow bread and porn in captivity oh yeah and he was turning aggressive and SeaWorld was like they were having none of it they wanted that killer whale back and I don't blame it's amazing I'm sued for millions because I'm alleging that that marine land is mistreating their animals SeaWorld sues marine land because they're mistreating their not up taking appropriate care of the killer whale and actually win the lawsuit they would not put any barriers around the pool we've got a marina had a large pool imagine this unimpeded ability to touch a killer whale if you wanted to reach it's not a safe idea this is absurd in fact it stretched when you're dealing with a large you know boisterous male Orca so SeaWorld wanted barriers around it so that people can't get close well the owner Marineland you can't tell him what to do he's not going to do nothing anyone tells him what to do so suddenly we're dealing with the fact that this animal started to lunge at the pub now this is an animal that if it gets ahold of someone it's over there's gonna tie with them for a bit we're gonna hear a lot of screaming but the screaming will end you're not getting anyone out of that out of that killer whales mouth forget it and this is what SeaWorld was dealing with they're just like shit dad enough bad press even back then if I kick it kill someone or hurt someone or anything or dies in marine lands care it's gonna look bad and see what so see was like getting the fuck out now when Tilikum killed people you get killed how many people one person he's granted uh three to four actually in Victoria Canada the first one then he went to I think it's absolutely hilarious they kept training them and kept doing things with them that's a pit bull forget about it be done but it's a killer well almost any animal many they are lying they were training you know lions and the lion killed someone they'd be like that's a wrap unless that watch that's not truly was that one grizzly bear that was a trained grizzly bear for films it was in what's that movie something forty some football movie with a big bear anyway the bear killed a guy's brother or cousin the guy was just standing there it's a horrible video you could watch the video I've seen it the guy just standing there and the bear just decides to tear the guys throat apart just reaches up bites him rips his throat open the guy runs off grabbed his neck he's dead within minutes the joyce's working with animals man I mean well that bear they kept alive and they started training him again and there's some really weird footage of the guy training the bear again it was the one from the Will Ferrell movie semi-pro yes semi-pro that's the dog or the dog that's the bear that bear fucking killed somebody look this guy's smacking this bear around look at will that bear eventually killed somebody just got tired of people it takes nothing for him oh it's so easy for him yeah just decided to fuck him up but now when Tilikum was doing all this he was on valium oh I can't say for sure that that was the case I want my suit any more when they start putting killer whales on valium so in in ocean ocean areum's are aquariums and shit valium is often used as an appetite stimulant so when your animal is off you know off so they don't they don't eat if they're not responding to buckets of food you're fucked yeah I'm gonna drop the water to get access to because they're not interested in more they're not your friends anymore if you don't have a bucket of food forget about it and so so sort of often enough to trigger that appetite you'll pump them with the valium - valium if they don't want to eat stuff it written a fault well then you get liquid valium you can inject as well well if neces that's a process the things that I've seen and done that were normal to me and normal to anyone who's working there is insane we used to drop used to call this beluga rodeo and at Marina and Marina is notorious for having like we have I say we over 50 experts they're pushing 60 belugas at this point and this is why it's so important to start changing these fucking laws because this is absurd and and it creates a whole world of problems of course socially for these animals babies get killed by males it's it's yeah it's gross it's bad it's not manageable nonetheless what we would do is we would drop the water in one of the pools so you have I mean anywhere between ten and fifteen belugas flat on their stomach there's a great at the bottom but they can't move they can't move well if they want to move they can but they're flopping around but it means they're gonna get fucked up bad like scratched up by the ground so if you've got maybe a little bit of water we've tried different things to try to mitigate how damaged up they got there was one time I mean they get carved up we used to call it I mean it's morbid but we stood joke around he's called the Caesar water because it was blood-red by the time we were done those procedures I'm telling you Joe it would make you sick it was that the water was thick of blood and so one time there was a it was a beluga named peanut and she started to panic and what she did was she repeatedly slammed her tail in a panic she started to bounce around like a fucking basket ball she was getting air three feet in the air she's you know she's probably a 3,000 pound whale two thousand pound whale or something so you're not gonna stop that but we tried of course we jump on her chunks of her tail I'm not joking chunks of her tail flying off fly up if anyone goes to marine land go ask about peanut go take a look at her at her tail there's nothing left of it she's got like a nub that's sort of like you would jagged on the bottom she was fucked up after that again lots of meds lots of recovery but it was foul a man so is this the benzodiazepine is this a recent thing that they started doing - no I wouldn't say so I can't vouch for anytime before 2000 when I started but for sure once we were there I mean so when you go to Sea World and you see those killer whales and dolphins doing shows they're just peeled up out of their fucking minds it's a it's hardly assembly it's merely a semblance of their wild counterparts you're not going there and seeing a dynamic animal no more you're seeing a depressed drugged confused probably frustrated animal and I mean again what those what those animals go through it it's difficult for people to give a shit about anything if it doesn't affect them personally if you see an animal's going through this it you feel it you start to appreciate what's that is it like call I feel weird even calling them animals I feel like like killer whales and dolphins in particular are so fucking intelligent it's it's hard to call them animals I mean obviously humans are animals as well but they are their own thing I mean those marine mammals are their own thing they have their own world and they dominated it yeah and in their world man if it's a fucking amazing world this they they're one of the only animals that we know of that has a really complex language and we can't even decipher it and then just last week Marineland and Francis is talking about wiki it's a killer whale that just picked up she mimics she mimics human voice so they've got her saying like hello hi and these different things it sort of sounds like she's mimicking what if she started saying a bunch of racial shit racial slurs well then let's get her capture of dolphins yesterday yeah yeah but the capture is it's already illegal in the United States right well you you you have to go through the you can get him from Canada and Canada gets them from being capped Canada can get them from anywhere this so basically that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans very strategically talked about this sweeping overhaul of the of or whatever this their thing whatever it is the words eluding me but they did this I believe any ways to sort of mitigate sort of Justin Trudeau went off about the the Kinder Morgan pipeline sort of Iran it's not it it's a big pipeline that they're gonna you know run this oil in BC and there's a lot of protests and what he ran on the campaign that he wouldn't do this you know just Trudeau talks about saving them were a little time and cleaning up the environment so they've made this announcement now that's a good that's a good piece of legislation it doesn't ban the breeding it doesn't address a lot of the things that we're actually addressing with bill s 203 which is the one that I spoke to you two years ago that Marineland has managed to get this guy this senator to keep playing again acting the fool doing all these creative ways to kill this bill and that's where we're at now I mean I expect sometime next week to get an announcement this bill should have been passed and brought into the house a long time ago and you know not the case still dot still stall and everything and again it's all lobbying illegal lobbying which may or may not turn into some problems for Senator done Platt correct me if I'm wrong but for a while some of the some of the parks in the United States would get them from some of the parks in Canada which would get them from Russians and Chinese who would capture them in the wild right so the parks the United States would say that they don't capture whales so what they would do is marine light would capture a boatload of wild ones and then once they would do it personally well they would pay some Russians to capture the Russians cheating at the Olympics they're stealing whales so they bring the whales in wild those were those those whales have for instance uh you know they sire a calf that calf is now deemed captive born and now it can be shipped to the States and so so what marine land was doing was just breeding like crazy and then sending up to Sea World and that's how we got the the killer whale to begin with how we got I Caicos you know big trade with belugas and and so that's we're trying to put an end to because all these loopholes you know marine line really capitalized on this but they want a long time lobbying the government for years I mean they've been around for 50-plus years they've had they've they've done all the right moves a businessman would do if he wants to keep in a thriving business without too many hands sort of keeping them from doing anything it's just so disturbing that we're willing to just accept this because we don't know what they're saying you know we know that they have a really complex language we can't decipher it though because it's so alien in terms of what the sounds they make it's not something you put into a box but it's not like any other animal between dolphins and killer whales and whales in general they make sounds in with a range of complexity that's just unrivaled in nature outside of humans and their auditory system is so complex when you put them in a when you put them in a concrete pool just imagine what I mean icons I put my ears under the water and it's loud yeah the filters are going you got different sounds I mean Ryan water being pushed in from this pipe and that much screaming people screaming music louder louder than popcorn the audience yeah yeah god damn it's I mean I look at them almost like they're kind of I mean they're definitely not human but they're our kind of people they're like a water people it's weird if you if you put yourself in the mindset of looking at an animal and and try to change your perception of them a little bit rather than then sort of disassociating and you look at you start you can actually see that they're like looks like they're people man like that's that's just a different meat suit yeah like and when you deal with killer whales and stuff well they evolved in a different environment but they evolved to be incredibly social highly dynamic populations they they live in these very intimate groups they stay together for life a male killer whale will never leave its mother's side over its lifetime it'll stay within about a body's length its entire life unless the postures beating on it then I'll just stay on the other side of the pod for a while at least they have that luxury of escape whereas in captivity males get the shit kicked out of their big puppy dogs big male orcas I mean yeah okay their murderous getting hit they're killing people but they're actually big puppy dogs they're I've always felt so bad for candy we had this big male beautiful big bull male he was just he was rocked his existence I having been pulled from his mother and this is really largely explains why Tilikum went off you ruin their lives that's over that I mean their whole their zone diet the reason they live member - they remember mother fuck man it's just why do we allow this it seems to me like like almost a form of slavery I mean I don't want to diminish the horrors of human slavery because in human slavery at least there's no question whatsoever that's a human and there's communication yeah so it's it's as awful as it gets but god damned put the ignorance aside the slavery of killer whales is like really close it's really close the only way to get them to work effectively and efficiently is to keep them hungry drugged them and keep them hungry so yeah it's brutal how is it still legal I mean it doesn't see you isn't SeaWorld are they expanding didn't they just make a bigger pool for those well we're so nice toward killer whales we gave them a bigger cage yeah so what they've done is they've tried to repackage the show as we're not doing the big dynamic show but they really still are they're like we're just showing natural behaviors which is bitch we want natural behavior let them go fuck up a whale shit they put a fuck they put like a like a backdrop of a couple trees or some shit like a new show a SeaWorld there's no crazy shit going on I mean in in California see you will not see what promise to stop banning rather they promise to stop breeding the killer whales right but these fucking promises don't do not believe for a moment that they're like some type of responsible corporate citizens it's gonna hold out of this thing it's bullshit so we're gonna entity yeah the business entity they're trying to make money and so what California did was they went out and banned it so in California you can't breathe orcas i import export issues all that but in Florida so again SeaWorld makes the promise they had an orca Protection Act that they were looking to do exactly California we're gonna put it they're gonna make it concrete passed the law that way that way SeaWorld can't just backpedal on it right on the road which everyone suspects they will SeaWorld is lobbying like fucking crazy and just just last week successfully defeated the bill again they're putting a lot of every world is trying to defeat a bill that they successfully defeated multiple times including that just last week and that allows them or the bill would keep them from breeding these animals in captivity so very fighting against that yeah successfully fighting it's over they're doing in Florida yeah while they're pretending in California they don't want to breed them well no in California they actually passed the law the state of law in Florida it was defeated repeatedly and now so they're trying they're trying to breed animals in captivity and if they do breed them and flora they'll be able to ship them to California to China so that's where the demand is right now and in fact SeaWorld was just bought by a large Chinese corporation they just named they just named one of the one of the guys to the SeaWorld and so what people I mean it's safe to assume that this is exactly what's happening as Cyril this is planning their exit strategy and they're gonna start sending their orchestra to China oh geez we're moving industry right now in fact kilowatt captivity is like if you can get in there and it's all coming out of Russia right still but and so they're still capturing them in the wild yep in China it's it's a it's a burgeoning booming industry man forty-four ocean theme parks in China right now she's building a black crazy how many of them are in the United States how many aquariums yeah I don't know I can't I can't say for sure ah I was actually surprised to read there's like 300 and something dolphins in captivity in the States I didn't I think that was the number I saw I didn't realize that was that big I had no idea that there was that many in captivity in the States it just seems to be such an archaic thing and it just I can't imagine that the United States wants to keep doing that the fact that SeaWorld is trying to keep doing that in Florida and that they've successfully lobbied to allow them to keep breeding these animals in captivity but you can't once you have them in captivity for a long time say if SeaWorld wanted to release them they can't really release them there's nowhere to release them and that's what's being worked on now there's a project called the whale sanctuary project and I suspect there'll be a fairly large announcement soon I believe they'll be looking at a location in the in Canada and they're gonna build this thing though there will be a place for them which is a great place to do it because would they do that well you go coastal of course I mean you got to be in the ocean you get a pen off an area you got a I mean there's lots of things to consider you got to make sure there's a lot of water changes a lot of different things because you can't keep the animal in something that's gonna stagnate and it's a minute so it's gonna be some sort of a cage it yeah assume a fence of sorts around there maybe like a fjord I wouldn't be a fewer difference in Canada but like just imagine jump it is magic certain that that's not gonna be the case but uh well they can I've seen I've seen dolphins jump out of the pool that's crazy yeah yeah I got rushed in one morning to get called in because uh because a dolphin jumped out of the pool holy shit I mean that's a wake-up call when you get there and you see this thing flopping around you're like Jesus Christ and I don't do well you get the sling together first off there's you know we have these different slings things that you know to move these dolphins so I was I was alone I was a dolphin way yeah like five hundred pounds six hundred pounds in this case she was a decent sized female so I went and grabbed a kid out on a ticket booth or some chicks it was too early in the morning I had no staff there rush him in I'm like dude I got two guys I'm like we got to get this dolphin and these guys I mean if you've never done that before your jaws on the floor right I fucking had these two steel poles on my shoulders dolphin in the sling lifting it up I swear to you man my back went backwards like this it was the heaviest thing I'd ever carried but we got her back in it was crazy but yeah jump out of the pool it was crazy in fact there was a time in the summer I remember where one of our dolphins was teetering on the edge what she would do is she you know they're always spyhopping like this looking over the edge of the crowd explain that to people that are just listening it's okay so we're just listening so imagine there's like a short wall something that you know they can look over so there's her spyhopping they're spying up to look okay one of our Dolphins learned that she can actually jump up on the ledge and balance now she was on that that's like an 8 foot drop to the concrete on the other side of this pool she's up there posing I'm hearing the crowd I'm but I'm backstage I hear the crowd going crazy look what is this I go out there she's having fun doing this holy shit that's the dolphin that jumped us what we did I said we got to take her out of this pool we took her out put her in the back pool where no one would see her of course and that's the next day she actually jumped so I should be dead today if we hadn't have moved her Oh then of course all murrayland did was put up like more you know more obstruction things to keep keep him in the pool so now when you find her outside the pool how long had she been outside for she was still wet so it wasn't so bad but one one dolphin was we found her that she she got stuck on the stage overnight and when we got there her skin had become so dry that it was it was starting to crack it was kind of fucked up she actually has this permanent scar from having dry eyes yeah and a chunk come out oh I love what she was bright do you are you talking to her when you find her do you try to comfort her like I mean yes sure she does she calm down when she realizes people are trying to help her I got they aware what's going on or she in a pan they always fight they always fight if they don't I mean this particular dolphin was a fighter every time we ever tried to put her in a sling and move I mean one time I loved madam I can go back in memories and I can I can remember my thoughts during these times and we had her in a sling hovering over the pool and the way the sling is is you've got two holes in the sling where the go in right the pectoral fins mm-hmm and then one where the genital slit is so if they shit it didn't wind up you know stuck in the in the sling but and then you've got a crane atop so now you've got this thing lifted over the pool well she's fighting like crazy and we can see that there's a tear in the sling as she's fighting fighting fighting we get her the crane just gets her over the pool the sling rips she's plunked into the pool hole and we've we've sling doubt like 15,000 pound or 10,000 pound killer whales over like 30 40 feet in the air imagine one of those drops oh my god so not sort of a wake-up call Wow archaic procedures man moving these these things the things that especially had a place like marine land marine line when you step through the doors and hopefully you don't but if you do it's like you've gone back to the 70s does any of this hurt their business attendance is abysmal over there they're crushed I live right I watch the sunset over marine land from my front yard it's a beautiful sight I Drive by of course just about every day that their attendance is rocked and Niagara Falls which where which is where marine land is is booming the tourism is through the roof you can't it's shoulder-to-shoulder over there and marine land seeing none of it and you think it's because people know about the conditions absolutely oh I got a lot of support in a local community like people know exactly what's going on tourists it's a little more difficult and you know Niagara Falls welcomes millions of them so you're gonna get a fraction of that but it is a fraction Marineland is not benefiting from the booming tourism there they're on their way out there on a clock for sure for sure I'd be shocked to hear them opening in 2019 I'm not gonna make that prediction but I would be shocked it's it's not bad but to be fair there's no investors at Marineland it's one soul controlling mine owner who started with nothing started with 2,000 bucks built this thing he is indebted to nobody he's you know he's cash rich of course and he's got a lot of fuck-you money and not a lot of time so he's out to fuck shit up I wouldn't be surprised to not a lot of time in life you mean he's like 84 years old now yeah and so uh I would I wouldn't be surprised to think that he's rationalized in his mind to just fucking sewer this thing like destroy you know destroy all all our lives we're having spoken out but just tank the park in the process fucking Wow yeah he's very defiant he's a he's a very paranoid and and defiant man so you know at 84 years old what else does he have left to accomplish I guess so you were saying they had 50 beluga whales e+ maybe even 60 at this point beluga whales are huge yeah what is a big one way I don't know if we ever admit if we ever actually weighed our bigness yet a guess at 4000 pounds maybe five wow you got 50 of those 50 of them yeah that's insane try catching one oh I don't want to try I used to get tasked with here's your here's your scuba gear here's a net the size of a football field go catch that believe oil so me and my buddies be like okay here we go dude you'd be you'd be it it really would be amazing to be able to capture the things we've done on video can you recognize the difference in intelligence between killer whales dolphins beluga whales absolutely dolphins and killer whales are like remarkably similar just cunning smart you turn your back and they're pickpocketing you I mean they are just and they're brats and I love brats I mean they just are bratty I know they're having fun they're having wow they're fucking with you they like to make things difficult if they know if they know how to frustrate you they're gonna exercise that so it's always a mental game especially when you're dealing with animals training with those beluga whales are really timid so like you know they call them the Canaries of the sea cause I kind of skittish so I don't know if that's a reflection of their intelligence necessarily but I would call them like maybe a maybe a hint more dum-dum than then the next one right but ya know they're more scared shitless of either not you know blue because they don't really want it they don't but they're not as smart as dolphins or I wouldn't say so I mean it's but they're in total wrong I mean some way some way intelligent yeah they're sort of sitting ducks out there belugas and it's mean like in the in the in the in the and in the whale world the whales respond they respond to verbal commands yeah so in the case of pinnipeds absolutely so seal in the pen they're walruses seals sea lions they respond to variables alone absolutely whales we I I couldn't say for sure in my experience that that was the case however in the case of just that announcement last week of that animal mimicking the the the human sounds it means she hears them so if you can hear it if the animal can hear you the you can definitely create a queue of sorts to trigger behavior so they it's passed that they could know some of our language I don't know that they could recognize someone dance yeah I wonder no we know that they have dialects right but we don't know anything that they're saying right no and that's what's interesting is I mean I sort of beat myself up wondering if in fact they're using a language that is to be interpreted as words as sentences versus sounds that mean things it's not something necessarily decipherable you know you know when a dog's pissed because they growl growl is different than a bark it barks right but parks aren't necessarily words and if they are maybe they're fuck you I don't know but I was listening to this thing about monkeys I think it was Steven Pinker's book where they were talking about it was an audiobook they were talking about how monkeys have differentiated the sound that they make if there is a tiger versus the sound they make if there's an eagle any time I'm walking around and I hear squirrel and a tree making a certain sound I know there's a cat in the vicinity and so you probably what am i but they have a language like a very crude language but what they've done is taken the sound of an eagle and they play it near monkeys and the monkeys look up of course and they play the sound of a monkey trying to alert the fact that there's a tiger in the area and the monkeys run up trees and start looking down yeah it's really interesting because like they have a few sounds that they can repeat and they know for a fact that these monkeys know what they're talking about and monkeys even play jokes that's a length on each other they play jokes on each other like if one monkey wanted a banana he would say hey man is a fucking eagle here and the monkey would run up the tree and he would get the banana like they would they lie to each other it's pretty fascinating it makes doing fucked-up things to them that much worse right you mean monkeys I mean we know that they're intelligent but they got a little tiny little tiny brain a little tiny ass head little tiny brain you know but it's all I did Orcas brain there's their giant these are huge enormous brains dolphins brains are she dolphin brains are way bigger than ours you want to hear fucked up story actually I had to dig up a dead killer whale it's an extract portion of its brain that we missed during a necropsy you had to dig it up yeah it was around yeah it was in the ground he had been buried for like ten days - whoa dude how'd he die I can't remember how Candide died exactly but he did he died like pretty young I can't remember exactly what the what the final we we never got that information as as trainers you sort of what we're always told oh it was you know it's always meningitis it's all he died of meningitis or they would say ah twisted intestine or something they always came up with things that you just you know they kept you asking questions rather than feeling clean I mean was ever conclusive in that regard but on this particular case or in this particular case the vet had pulled me aside and said okay I ask you something fucked up can you go get two people suit him up we got to go get a piece of the brain we missed of candy I'm just like oh I can't possibly impose upon someone to do that I can't how deep it been buried like it's butts 6 to 8 feet he was and you can just do that in a yard they allow you to just bury it in the yard Marineland has mass graves in the back in the exact place that they're claiming development now which I've got some overall Oh shots they've acted like paving roads pretty close to it to where the the bodies are buried and what like how many different things you think of buried thousands why thousands I didn't just in deer alone forget about I mean Marineland breeds more deer and that why do they breed deer he's got he's got a whole Park of animals different animals that's where the animal cruelty charges stem from was actually it was not marine mammals cuz there's no laws protecting them so that you know they continue to live in a void of protection but the the the the deer is the Bears there's no laws in Canada in Canada yet it's coming man and how I've been talking about this for five years we're almost there but I'm up against the first come on here 2013 was my first time here yeah so that would have been four years ago so they have thousands of graves in the back thousands of animals in large graves so this big hole for instance there's a big hole for the deer they're all going in there the big deer the bloody eat him he used to back in Christmas back in the day when he saw when the owner you still host Christmas parties he'd go back and slaughter a bison then feed burgers and make food out of it stuff and they used to do that they don't do it no more they actually use to be called Marineland something in game farm and by being a farm or classified as a farm he was actually able to kill him produce food there's something I've been told that happened now why did they kill deer back there went to a pole well I mean a lot of them died because they're they're gross first off we've got 500 deer and in a in a pen that's like disgusting they're not all gonna get to eat some of them are gonna get injured these things happen so at night what would happen is you know someone let's say we drive around in his truck you know put the gun out the window and just eat just go on the shooting spree he's wiping out these animals in the morning the land animal care guys would show up and be like okay go go pick up the bodies and these poor kids so what he do it out for a goof or what he do it because he's trying to thin the population cuz there's too many of them oh no there wouldn't be anything like that well in one case once the once the investigation came out in 2012 which revealed of course abuse with land animals as well they went on a calling spree if you will where they got rid of some of the uglier sort of less healthy animals it's funny cuz yeah his marine line actually breeds the more beautiful deer off site the more beautiful animals that they have on just are not on display they're actually back their breeding off out of display that's where the two dogs I love to recall when the owner shot those two labs beautiful little Labrador dogs went running into the up and down the running up and down the fence across from you know marine lands owners house which is where the off-site pen is where he breeds the animals and that's where he decided I'm not calling anyone to come get these animal this fuck dude this story is so heartbreaking he just pulls out a shotgun kills one the other one cowers because there was a witness and of course the witness never identified themselves they didn't want to be sued and then he shoots the other one and then he tells a land animal care supervisor he takes two just take the caller's off the dogs go bury him in the pit it was I was there that day I heard the gunshots I was there when the vet got the phone call she was like oh my god okay she hangs up she looks at me she goes Jon just killed two dogs I'm like what the fuck man dogs that you can go hey go back home puppies dude they were beautiful dogs there was a video it's since been the Toronto Star website a lot of the videos are gone a lot of things are happening now on account of these lawsuits and further down the road that we've gone where things are starting to disappear there was a it was a very powerful historical website about Marineland and some of the owner's history and you know these things are gone now they're gone I mean I can't allege as to why or what agreements are if there are agreements I can't go down that road to suggest I don't know but a lot of these resources that I think that were very powerful are gone and disappearing now so he's this Marineland has this giant yard right how many acres are you talking about where there's thousands of animals buried I mean the park is massive it is there's more there's probably three times undeveloped land versus what's developed there and it's a big part it's sort of barren there's not a lot of things as rides and you're gonna walk a mile between them but nonetheless the owner what he liked to do was was sort of a choir a lot of land over his lifetime that that was his thing he owns half a nagger Falls I gotta watch where the hell I step because any given point if I'm glad if I'm on their land I'm getting charged with trespassing whether I like it or not in fact the city of Niagara Falls leased land to Marineland to keep protesters off of their sight which is absolute bullshit and if anyone's listening from City Council I'm I hope you do you gotta fix that because that's some horse shit right there man that you guys have been pandering to Marineland for too long I mean to keep us from being able to protest that's horseshit sorry and why do you think that is because they just don't want to get sued there was a time when Marineland and owner were called like the king of Niagara that was it Marineland was atop the hill that it was the Falls came second to marine land at least marine land played the this idea that people came to Niagara Falls they would see the Falls it's they'd look at him for ten minutes and then they would have no reason to stay they were saying they're bringing all this business because people are now going to hotels going to restaurants and then go on a marine land the next day and so when did this change when did marine land go to shit yeah 2012 so right when you left so before then is this thriving thing just nobody knew about the conditions that's what it was very ignorant of court people wouldn't have known who's gonna talk it's not new for marine lands owner or marine land the corporation to sue people for speaking out they did it before and successfully not in the sense that there was any judgement but successfully in that the people that spoke had to pay a horrible price and you know essentially got silenced so no one wants to speak out against that no I don't blame them I get it I mean I'm eating it now it's been five years five years of everyday waking up wondering if this is the fucking one where you're done you know so you've been embroiled in these lawsuits for five years five years on they sued me on Valentine's Day of 2013 yet and nothing's been resolved they're the only way that there could be a resolve at this point is if I were to sign a document and I'm I'm assuming at this point because murrayland sent nothing in terms of any type of agreement but you know down the road it's their objective is to shut me up they want to wipe out the last twenty years of my life they don't want me to open my mouth about anything and of course in the last five years and then the twelve prior you know when I'd sort of revealed everything that's going on through trying to shut me up they want me they want an injunction a permanent injunction I assume they would that to keep me from being able to go to the park well this becomes very conflicting for me because they have my walrus sort of hostage there and I do I do dream of a day of being reunited with her and I imagine that would have to take place on marine land property some day so it's really not prepared to sign anything in fact I told my lawyer just last week it's a non-starter and I'll remind marine land now non-starter they'll never shut me up I'm not signing it I'll have to eat shit forever but I'm not gonna sign it so where do you anticipate this all going I mean you've been in a prolonged legal battle for five years now what do you anticipate this going and so in April so last time I was here two years ago I you know I solicited some some some help resources to be able to pursue marine lands owner in that I want him to be examined in court much like I have in the same capacity that I had to forfeit all of my communications I look the same for the corporation and I want to examine marine lands owner as representative this proved very difficult it took I mean we got the order to only just last April to examine and we got we won the order and since then we've tried multiple times to schedule now we're almost out of here now if trying to schedule this man to come in for examinations and he's not showing up a couple times now and so at some point if marine land doesn't want the facts out there and that's what I'm pursuing I want the fact out there they're gonna have to they're gonna have to settle and so how that ends with me I don't know I'm not looking for money I could give a shit about trying to get rich in this thing are you trying to sue them for money though I'm suing them yeah but it's so much Wow numbers don't matter but it's like a million and a half or something they defame the shit out of me let's be honest it's pretty absurd but again so would the million and a half I'm in it I'll never see it but would it be predicated on you would have to shut your mouth if it wasn't something that went if it wasn't a judgment that the judge made for in see if we were at the trial the judge makes their decision then if we settle beforehand it's because everyone wants to wash their hands and walk away marina is not gonna wash their hands of me unless I feel unless I've got them properly cornered the only way they want to get me is well of course they want to ruin me right Dave how could you properly corner them what would be well if marine landowners missed a couple examinations now how many until I can go in and actually file a motion to have the entire statement claim dismissed well the fact is pretty soon so my objective is to go and get this lawsuit thrown out at which point they've only got that I've got the counterclaim for them to work with they're not suing me no more now who's got the upper hand that's my dream that's your dream but if if that doesn't happen I mean it seems like five years is a long time to be in a prolonged legal battle like at what point Tom but does it become so absorbed that the court throws it out so it just happened now it's actually a new rule that as of February 2018 any lawsuit that hasn't been scheduled for for trial was administratively dismissed there's a new law and so but that doesn't affect mine unfortunately because we actually fought to get a case management judge on our case on my case because like I said marine ones acting the fool I can't seem to get in front of a judge everything's joking around so we went and won that again it took a long time you know what's the crazy thing about these lawsuits and I see now of course 2012 was a lot more naive but all of the wins that I get in court cost me so for instance I I defend a motion against Marineland it costs me $7,500 the judge says okay Phil wins this round let's give him some money back on a partial and M he gets 3,500 bucks back still just cost me four grand Marine lands owner misses an examination as an example I've got to get what's called a certificate of non-attendance I got to send a lawyer 1,200 bucks so it's it and how is all this funded now oh I have a public go fund me of course I've had several and how do people if they want to donate cause I'm sure a lot of people listen he's this like fuck this man I gotta help this guy save smooshy calm I've got my documentary on there which I'd like to touch on a little bit it's great if you had a chance to look at it no okay well if you get if you manage to it's it's pretty it's good these kids from Ryerson University did it the brave kids and how I know it's a very effective law or documentary is that Marineland didn't sue them they know the danger of this documentary they know how powerful it is and they didn't sue him and that's how I know that this is powerful and they decided that it's so good they have to leave it alone and just ignore it because if they sue them then it'll put attention to exactly and so they made a small statement saying oh this is Phil just doing what Phil does and it's funny because the Ryerson students turn out to me they go but that's not true like we came to you they just want they actually wanted to do a five-minute personal profile of me they said look we want to just do a quick interview we don't make sure that morning I don't know they comment the right day I just you know I we spoke for hours and then they sort of got back and said you know we want to do like maybe something more with this you guys do whatever the hell you want I mean I'm I'm an open book I'm give everything away you want something here go go nuts with it and so they did and they did something great it's really good and yeah so you know definitely definitely please check that out you know well dude every time I talk to you I'm happy to talk to you you're a great guy but we always get fuckin hugely depressed conversations I'm always just like what fuck and now the valium I do it if I have to get into my own personal well-being I mean you get compromised when things like this happen you do you just do I imagine it's a half a decade of stress it's like big portion I'm turning 40 in a month so from thirty five to forty third if it's all been stress and lawsuit every day and not just that they're sending goons to my house I mean they sent the police to my house I mean it really is relentless it's absurd the things that there was a comedian I don't want to mention his name because he deleted the tweet that it and he told me all Twitter deleted it is bullshit I'm not gonna I don't want to give me any attention but Peeta had tweeted something and so he quoted that tweet and said it's trying to burn this place it's a comedian very funny I click retweet I got the police Cyber Crimes Unit on my front door the next day because the lawyer sent them because I am citing violence i incited violence for the followers so now I'm real I was worried that the the buildings were gonna be burnt down well I would never say to do that I mean either fuck down or I would never tell anyone to fly a drone over it either opportunity for a million view YouTube hits yeah I don't do it don't do that it's just you know that they're on the wrong side of history and not just Marineland but all these places all these places like there's going to come a time in the future where people look back at this kind of captivity of these hyper intelligent social animals stolen from their families it's a terrible terrible statement about human beings the thing I love about I guess what you call my campaign is that I have support from hunters I have support from vegans I am across the spectrum at one point I had a far-right while a person who's perceived as a far-right internet personality tweet my documentary and then Rosie O'Donnell tweets it she's as left as it gets and so I'm looking at this video dot yeah yeah Wow oh dude I got a Rosie story it's kind of heartbreaker actually but when I went to New York and again Joe thank you so much for when are you when you spoil me with those UFC tickets dude that it's always the most timely thing and so appreciated because it's exactly oh it's just like this trip it's exactly what I need at the time to start us keep myself a little break have some fun and so I was going in New York City remember saying you're messing like dude and you're like bro and Choi I'm like huh and so so Rosie sees the documentary and someone says to me a Rosie just tweeted you documentary like oh cool so I go to her Twitter and the nasty shit so I follow where she follows me back just decided me messages like dude like it's really powerful like I really like and then she goes to elaborate like I want to know more about you I want to call you tomorrow okay cool sure shit the next day of phone rings I'm talking to Rosie I'm like this is crazy again I'm 40 I know who Rosie is I don't know what these days of kids know who Rosie I think Rosie O'Donnell's like oh she was a heavy in my day at least she's like you know powerhouse and she's expressing all this interest like you know I've I've done documentaries I released them on HBO you know I've done all these things I'm gonna I'm going to LA tomorrow and I'm gonna call you back on Friday but I'm meeting with this Emmy award producing producer and we're gonna get this thing out there and then she starts to say and this is where my heart starts to ache is that you know you always sort of hope that there's gonna be a hero that I mean especially the last five years it's gonna be like you know what enough said enough let's let's do this and especially in the case of with my walrus she starts saying I think we can get the walrus like we can get some pressure get a TV network pressure so let's get that walrus I'm just like good you're pulling on my fucking heartstrings now I you know and then I went to New York I'd hoped to have lunch with Rosie on that particular trip I was going for two reasons actually is also was hoping to do some ayahuasca I'm looking to get a reset I need some I'm gonna do that soon and sooner than later but that was that was the intention of going to New York and then since then it's just been radio silence from Rosie unfortunately and I accept that in that she's as complicated world and whatnot but man she pulled on my heartstrings now don't might have wanted to do it yeah and I'm not gonna fall Dino I see how crazy sort of her life and sort of things like go on and I'm totally you know she's got a lot of family issues and yeah all sorts of other stuff too but yeah that's a bummer it's just a bummer is what it is I think also people get involved with you and hear the stories and then they get scared of being sued them all the time yeah yeah you should see it I mean I just even last week I contacted someone that I mean the media now and mind it's a very different landscape now from 2012 2012 the media was against me corporate media was in Greenland had him in their back pocket that was before blackfish 2013/2014 715 media's mine 2016 17 18 now the media's just who knows what the fuck they're doing and like it's all over the map so it's hard to get any sort of and I get Marineland will sue them so it's also an issue of after things have been going on for so long and nothing's happened people start doing well what what can I do you know a lot of people actually think Marie Lin's done there's like ah dude congrats Marie lands dead right like no man still happening still being sued it's all happening it's just less current I'm account that it's five years but that's exactly they're there that's what they're doing that's our objective well I think also relent fatigue and people are tired of fucking hearing about I'm tired of doing it you know what I think also the the eleven different counts of animal abuse you know they probably fought like oh this is it I know I thought that that was it and then they turn around and Sue the O SPCA which I mean it's all dark man it's it's really dark in the fact that there's so many people involved helping it feels dark you know it feels feels like a total violation of my life like whatever I'm up for it I'm I'm here to fight but it feels gross yeah you're at every turn being like fucked up and all you can do all I can do and in a lot of times I'm not only allowed to even speak of it I mean I may have even compromised things in this I mean I always compromise things when I when I speak but it's that's what's choice how I compromise things here today by telling true story I'll find out tomorrow or Monday when I get a whole deluge of fucking legal threats I've been threatened with more lawsuits marine lands lawyers have in fact threatened other wits whistleblowers lawyers so they're ready to sue lawyers I mean you want to talk about gumming up a system it's over at that point if a lawyer Sue's another lawyer you're looking at 15 20 fucking years wasn't there changes in the laws in Canada like how you can sue people so there was anti slap legislation that was enacted years ago I spoke at Queen's Park this was something that you were yes for about of course and then slap stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation so I speak out against what's happening at Marineland Marineland tumult the cache which corporation sues the shit out of me and their strategic way to try to silence you right and so Ontario passed a legislation to make that illegal however at the time Ontario's premier was suing the leader of the Opposition she took out the retro clause so it was no longer retroactive to any lawsuits that are already in the system so now I'm actually fighting against a lawsuit is illegal and if it were to be applied to my lawsuit had it been marine that would be up against some punitive damages like crazy just for my fault of launching a malicious but because it's but because it's not I sit back and and I just continue to eat it and then other people are actually I see it in the paper when so I was like oh this corporation tried to sue this girls they over half a million dollars for well maybe not half of mine but they all are some money for for having launched the suit and I'm just like I feel for you don't man you know what to be fair it's also I call it a sort of curse and blessing I mean look I'm here man in what world would I be right started as a fan of the show I started listening to you saying things like be the hero of your fucking movies whatever that coal was and I did and so I get the idea I get I eat but shit starts to taste delicious when you see the damage you're doing as well what are you doing for money now so I started a business summer business some years ago I've got an air B&B which is like was the best idea ever had I'm so happy and blessed with this thing because people come down and I host them now it's the thing I like to do the most I got a beautiful home on the water it's like you know I got a nice dock converted one of the apartments into an air B&B in honor of my cat that we spoke of in fact two years ago Eugene so it's called the Eugene and so you know that's that's a means to sort of sort of help me I honestly I work for for Canada Post as a mailman which I I sort of love in that it challenges me every day I wake up in minus 20 degrees wind howling blowing snow like crazy I got a co spent like six to eight hours walking in this shit it sucks but that's challenge and you got to wake up and rise to it right I mean you could just as well stay in bed all day but that's not gonna help me yeah that's a weird thing about like mail delivery in a lot of places is still walking around oh I'd do it it's brutal but I love it I'm walking 20k a day dude I lost a lot of weight I'm feeling good it's how it helps me it really does I I'm a I need to I need my body movin I know one speed fast you know I'm forty I'm slowing a little bit not that much surprisingly hopefully hopefully my run lasts for a while but it helps me my voice my head goes from dude everything's abysmal and fucked - dude you got this man stick with it you got this you know you listen to music you're getting powerful you're feeling good nah it's just right for me it really is in a perfect world where would you like all this to end I want the waters sounds crazy my dream is I'm gonna free whales there's gonna be a sanctuary I'm gonna free marine lands whales I'm gonna have a hand in this that's gonna happen numbers do you really think that's gonna happen you think they're gonna enact legislation that makes them release those animals I think so yes really yes what makes you so hopeful s 203 they Marine Lines tried to kill this bill for years now they've not been able to and this time next week the sucker should go that whale sanctuary sanctuary project they're gonna build a whale sanctuary there's gonna be a place for whales if it's in Canada and all the exportation laws are that marine land can't get rid of their whales there will only be one place for whales if that business elects to evolve or if there's any type of ownership changes I see this being a big dealing to me how this sanctuary would work well you'd have an environment where is penned off in the ocean and you know the be I mean various different pens for various different procedures if you will but the idea is that you if they can't be wholly released then you've got a place where they have a sense a semblance of freedom if you will but it'll be in human care there'll be more of like for instance a viewing platform where people be able to view the whales versus how big of an area we're talking about massive yeah I know I can't say the square footage I don't know because they nothing's finalized so we're still under development would they develop a bay or something would they would want to ideally get a bay that has good water change over that you know that that works if you can find that and I mean the East Coast is looking really good these days is there a model that they've drawn up not all there's models yeah no absolutely there's we look at something like if you've got the whale sanctuary project I'm sure you'll find tons of different problems I just don't know how they're keeping the orcas in those things if you put a fence up they're not gonna go anywhere they wouldn't jump the fence they don't there's something about jumping out I mean when the when the wild captures happen what do we get here there's the whale saying we're building a model sanctuary where captive whales and dolphins can riri a billeted and live permanently in their natural environment so it's a step so this is a step between this and then the the wild yes/no are they gonna free them and then release fish in there for them to eat I imagine they'll be all of that every which way that was being nice to that allow them to actually hunt and kill the fish which I'm sure that's what they want to do the fact that they can feel the natural rhythms of the sea I mean they're in tune with the scenery in their environment that the pools no place look what it says here for medium savate for years median survival time in years for wild caught orcas at a marine park for years 1,100 square yards of space and a large display tank at a typical high-end marine tank 300 14,600 is the minimum number of square yards for the first whale sanctuary project seaside sanctuary so this is three hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred square yards so it'll be a massive place 105 is the number of captive orcas and belugas in North America so that includes marine land submarine land has half the belugas in North America is crazy it's crazy and they fly under the radar because no one wants to talk about them right 24/7 round-the-clock care care for the whales the sanctuary that sounds beautiful marine lands threatened to sue these people money fuckin I am dude buy more we need more than just you it seems like fuck man people listening please get involved this is a great step though I love this idea of this step you know like have something that's like a bridge between captive and the wild also it would allow their atrophied dorsal fins to to reinvigorate they could start diving deep again I mean you know how deep it necessarily but at least a little bit and get you could train these animals to physically take them for walks if you I guess you'd call them swims where you would be able to leave and have them just follow a boat and go for some exercise you could totally do I mean that it really the the the things that this is going to present the opportunities for these animals is brilliant and amazing and the board it's comprised of all your all your wild animal brilliant scientists I mean this is the project this is the future so that is the way to do it right because I've always said when you go to a place like SeaWorld or whatever and you look at all those dolphins and killer whales like how would you get them free how do they would have to be some intermediary step there it is wow that's exciting times man it's I hope they do that man it's how they do that because I feel like if there was a place we could go and people could feed the killer whales like release some fish or something like that and be there to watch that would be way more exciting than watching them in a swimming you watch a fucking killer whale fart in a wild versa do a backflip in the captivity and you're watching that fart in awe and the and this thing is just music and bullshit I pulled over yesterday morning I was in Malibu real early in the morning and I pulled over watch some dolphins I was awesome I was told speaking with someone they're like dude they're here they're in Malibu go see him yeah they're here right now yeah I was I was on the PCH and I was driving and at the corner of my eye I saw something the water and then I saw the tail fins going over it and a few of them together and I pulled over and I'm like fuck man that's amazing I gotta want to live in Malibu some scary tsunamis but if you were there like right there like looking out your fucking bedroom window and checking that out first thing in the morning I wish Dolphins in your yard yeah and they're just wild man having a good old time they just feel different you know you see them in marine land or I've never seen my marine land but you see them in any sort of captive area and you just get this weird feeling like yeah they're cool to look at but man they're just not they're just none that you know there's something missing there yeah it's like the difference between seeing a cow in a pen versus a buffalo in the wild you know just this is where hunters I say they're really this is where I get a lot of support from hunters because it know hunters I mean all you got to do is grab a pigeon just call in corner street grab a pigeon if you can grab and put it in a cage and watch out depressed you are and a half hour watching I mean this hope it's horrible so so even that's what I love about the hunters are just like nah man you got this thing right like fucking well and people have this erroneous idea that hunters hate animals no they love wild animals they love things to be wild you know it's just just a very depressing aspect of human nature that we've chosen to go down this route and that we did it a long time ago I really truly believe that if there was no dolphin and Orca captivity ever previously before it would not be possible to do today impossible would freak out they would at least in America the future is brandonna kids are repulsed by it all I mean this is where and they should be I go speak to schools and every kid and the beautiful thing and I mean it sounds horrible but the kids that go to Marineland gets singled out pretty bad by the other kids so it's not a good time to bring your kids to a place like Marina unless you want you can have your kids pick what about China how is it how is it so cool in China they just don't get it over there they just don't know very culture yeah it's fairly new for sure cultural yeah I mean I don't want to I don't know I just know that that's that will be there for a while yet all right the paradigm shift hasn't taken there yet man it'll be a while you know so save smooshy calm for anybody who wants to go and and they can that's where your go fund me is that's where they can watch the documentary please do yeah and listen man I hope in some way this helps you always does I'm a super appreciative I hope in some way it gets people to donate and pay attention and to be aware and please folks watch blackfish just go watch that and if if it doesn't make you crack up if it doesn't make you cry it doesn't make you really sad that people are capable of doing that it's just um it's just wrong it's just it's not it's not what we should be doing as a species as a race as a civilization it's just the wrong thing to do and one day it will be looked upon very very poorly the timing of people putting their eyes on me now has never been better things are gonna happen follow me on Twitter I'm gonna be tweeting a lot of major developments in the coming month the timing of this of this particular podcast couldn't been better and again I'm super indebted to you forever I'm so appreciative I'm appreciative you too my brother thank you thank you alright folks we'll be back next week enjoy your life bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
