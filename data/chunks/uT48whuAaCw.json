for three whoops we got an issue okay here we go five four three two yes and we're live hello Lindsey it's happening not much pleasure to meet you yeah yeah good to meet you I'm the girl who tags you and all the disgusting medical history photos and I'm really looking forward to grossing out your audience I'm looking forward to you doing that as well you have fascinated me with your Twitter page and you like first of all how you are a doctor right well I'm a PhD I can't save anybody's life we can perform you know Victorian surgery amputation or something I think anybody can right yeah is that a real one this is this is a prop this was a real fun thing to get through customs when I was coming in from Britain it's a Victorian amputation saw it's called the Clockwork saw and for people who are just listening it's it's a circular saw and there would have been a crank that you wound it with and then you'd release it and it would spin sort of automatically oh yeah and the idea was that it would make it faster but the reason why I love this saw so much is that it was a massive failure and I don't think we talked about failure enough in science and medicine you know all the things that work there's a lot of things that don't work and so this guy who invented this saw when he tried it out it was spinning so fast that he took off his assistants fingers oh Jesus Christ oops it never got out of prototype phase so I had to recreate it for my youtube channel now when you in those old days when they didn't have antibiotics and antiseptic and yeah when they saw someone's leg off or something like that I hope many times those people live well you could pull through the operation that was one part of it but then of course you could die a post-operative infection yeah so my book the butchering art really focuses on this one guy named Joseph Lister who applies germ theory and develops antisepsis so germ fighting techniques and most people don't know who he is but they know the product Listerine mmm-hmm so Wistrom was named after him by I always tell people that so basically a Lister was a British surgeon and he came to America in 1876 to convince the medical community of germs and there was a guy in the audience and he decided to create this product Listerine but it wasn't even a mouthwash in the nineteenth century it was used to treat gonorrhea whoa so but also I don't endorse that you told me throw was Street I know I I don't endorse that and I'm sure the Listerine company is not too pleased I'm talking about that either so Listerine now just is for breath right yeah that's all it does yeah it's it's it's an antiseptic mouthwash it's not even any good for you like is it good to kill all that stuff inside your mouth like right but you're a medical historian I'm a medical story I would say that Dennis would say that that Listerine is still a good product usage a bacteria yeah form of it like that I just used something I switch to Listerine now in honor of Joseph Lister so how did he know how did he know that there was James they were real so let me let me take you back to you sort of before he walks on the scene so these operating theaters they were filled to the rafters with ticketed spectators people actually bought tickets to see someone get their leg hacked off oh well I you know what no one's asked me that I don't know how much to take it would cost for that spectacle now I really need to look into that what they pay to watch now right you know we could say you know and when I sent you my book signed it and I said I thought that being strapped to the Victorian operating theatre was the original fear factor because I can't imagine anything worse than being strapped to this table yeah and so we're talking about before anesthesia so you're fully awake and one of my favorite surgeons is this guy named Robert Liston he's six - he's really tall for the 19th century and he could hold you down with his left arm and he could take your leg off in about 30 seconds oh Jesus which is what you'd want that's what you'd want but that's still a long time it is yeah I mean if we just sat here for 30 seconds with dead air time and you could think about you know yes hacking through that lag just scream 30 seconds I wonder how many people would be at the end of this podcast like five people would be still on there listening so so he was incredibly fast who's known as the fastest knife in the West End he would walk in he was a showman so he'd walk in and he'd say timey gentleman and you could just hear the ripple of pocket watches there is yep there he is and he's using a knife in that photo yeah so actually the Liston knife that he invented was this long bladed knife which they think Jack the Ripper may have also used which is why those rumors are that Jack the Ripper may have been a medical practitioner but that was a really common thought right yeah I mean we're never gonna know who is right it's unknowable we're we're still kind of obsessed with this I've heard so many different versions of that yeah and recently there was some kind of bogus DNA test of a shawl that they said belonged to one of the victims but it's impossible to prove the provenance of the object but that was that was listed so he's 62 he's really tall one of my favorite stories is he would go so fast as he was switching instruments he'd hold these bloody instruments in his mouth just like how different this one that's the face I wanted I want to be just totally disgusted through this whole segment um and as he was switching instruments he accidentally cut off his assistants finger and then as he was switching instrument he slashed the code of a spectator and the assistant died of gangrene the patient died of gangrene and the spectator died of fright so it's just right he just did a little brave blood Wow he got slashed in the with the jacket and I guess he had a heart attack from the stress and so it's jokingly referred to as the only operation with a 300% mortality rate did a good job that day he killed three three people in one would you say slashed you mean he cut the spectator or just no he just cut their code he was kind of switching instruments all it took to kill someone I thought people were tougher back then well not that guy now he lives forever in the butchering art is that guy yeah I had a heart attack he must have had a heart attack it said he died afraid maybe that wasn't real maybe that course shit doesn't like stories you know they get blown out of proportion yeah it just seems like you cut someone's jacket then I die well it's you know it's a stressful situation people are getting their limbs hacked off you know your blood pressure would be really high and again it and these feeders were I mean the the floor of the operating theater was crowded as well so they'd have to actually clear the floor sometime so you can imagine you know you're strapped to this and the leg wasn't the worst thing so one of the tweets that you shared of mine which your platforms seem to enjoy quite a lot and sold me a lot of books by the way I thank you I'm awesome was this story about this guy who was suffering from a bladder stone and it got stuck in his urethra and so out of desperation he stuck a nail down his penis and he hammered it to break it up yeah yeah and yeah people would not sign your platform for that story so they they obviously are ready for this how did that work again that didn't work right it did not work no he died whoops that guy definitely died um but it's it really illustrates how desperate people were back then and how few options you know they had there's the image of it I don't think you'll have to show this on YouTube Jamie on YouTube really that's clearly a penis there's penises in breasts on you shave me a lot of you think they look at this more carefully if people want to see it well tweet Twitter is the most open of all platforms I'll let you get away with almost everything you can have porn on Twitter yeah well I mean I don't have any problems with Instagram I put that stuff up but yeah but maybe some things get removed from Instagram it's really kind of interested seems to be dependent upon how many people complain yeah probably there's there's always those people out there looking to be offended I just think they just want to do something they just want to press that button yeah oh there we go yeah I know I get you know at this point there's so many objects that that can cause offence of course medical history and it's it's you know there's a lot of dark history body-snatchers and things like that and I'm a firm believer that we should tell these stories openly because they happened in medicine and science grew as a result of it but but they're not easy subjects to discuss with an audience especially when you have so many characters and Twitter and you're you're trying to get out of complex idea right and also like you're not just there's a lot of Twitter pages that I follow where people just try to gross people out you're actually educating people about the history and and we all should be really thankful that these people went through all the stuff so that we don't have to yeah absolutely I always say to my audience so I been going around the world sort of demolishing romantic notions about people white and might think about what it's like to live in the past because it was pretty pretty bad and I I have visuals as well and I've had four men faint so far it's always been man it's just a commentary right now it's ancestors of the bitch those weaklings coming to my lecture and I think what it is though is on people think I'm gonna see something gross so I'm not gonna eat and then their blood sugar plummets so it's not really the closest but they're not really prepared you know and there's interest yeah and they're standing sometimes I I give lectures at this incredible museum called the old operating theatre in London it's the second oldest in the world and so you have to stand because it's like a Victorian operating theatre and so people lock their knees or whatever oh wow so you give actual lectures in the real theaters were these to cut yeah yeah I did my book launch there and if people want to see it I filmed sort of a like a theatrical scene of a young lister attending an operation in that theater and it's not my youtube channel called under the knife and I really want to get this made into a movie I'm trying to come into Hollywood and convince Hollywood that this Quaker surgeon from the Victorian period deserves the cinema feature but it is an epic story he saved more lives than any other person to ever live look it is an epic story and for anybody who's ever gone through operations and I've gone through several of them we owe those people a massive debt yeah you don't have to awake stretch both my knees reconstructed wake up and they're fixed yeah it's amazing yeah and in the past before anesthesia a lot of times patients were sat in chairs so they weren't laid down and they were sat in these very high chairs so that their feet dangled so they couldn't brace against the knife if you think about pushing off of course um there's a there's a story about a guy named Robert Penman and I know we have images and I'm sure YouTube won't take those down he he comes to a Robert Liston the fastest knife in the West End in the 8th in 1828 and he has this huge facial tumour growing I mean it's been growing for about eight years it's taking up his whole face he can't breathe now and Liston looks at him and says I can't do this operation which is tantamount to a death sentence but he goes up to Scotland and he goes there he is Wow yeah it's it's incredible when you see that painting on so Penman goes up to Scotland and he sees a guy named James Simon and Simon agrees to do this operation and pemon is sat for 24 minutes in a chair restrained while this thing is caught out of his face first in a bucket and and survived yeah well we have a picture of him later in life Wow you know and he looks like he's doing ugly Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln wasn't really known for his looks I'm psyched he doesn't have that thing in his face though yeah see that the jaw is definitely slimmer but he doesn't look too deform considering what he went through so it is incredible um you get such crazy stories like there's a woman who has a mastectomy in 1840 without any anesthetic now at this time you would have if you were wealthy or if you're middle-class you'd have this operation in your home you just have it unlike your kitchen table which is which would have been safer than going to the hospitals really yeah because the hospitals were crawling with all kinds of infection so hospitals were places for the poor and to give you an idea of how gross it was the bug catcher who had rid on the beds of lice he was paid more than the doctors and surgeons in this time yeah because I mean that's pretty important right there's maggots all kinds of things crawling around in these hospitals so if you were wealthy or middle-class you had your surgeon come to your home and so she has a surgeon come and the surgeon determines that yes the breast has to come off and says I'm gonna return but I'm not gonna tell you the day which would make me more anxious he thought it was gonna help her not focus on it but all you would be thinking about right as one is this guy that's a person without breasts it was like I'll just show up it'll be easy and so he shows up and he goes into her bedroom and he opens his hand and shows that the knife he's gonna use and he says to prepare her soul for death but this isn't very confidence inspired any doctors listening don't tell your patients to prepare their soul for death and and she does survive and she talks about how it's so vascular that the blood blinds him at one point and so like just what do you think I can't get worse he can't see and he's under and she is under his hand for an hour and a half oh my god away and she survives she ends up living a long and somewhat happy life I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares yeah there we see so do they tie this woman down like how did they oh yeah they would have definitely had to restrain her I mean oh people were probably a little bit stronger or more able to adapt to pain than we are but nonetheless there would have been some pretty heavy what year was this that was in the 1840s do we know when cancer became common or was it always common in humans that's that's a good question the oldest archaeological record I believe it's 2,000 years old of metastatic cancers so it's older than you think they're diagnosing it for for centuries and centuries I'm not really an expert in history of cancer but it is around and so with breast cancer you know probably by the time it got to the stage of mastectomy it probably would have spread if you think about like you know it being visible to the naked eye but yet she survived she did survive and so then you'd have to question whether she had breast cancer or maybe it was some kind of like yeah maybe a cyst and she went through that for that but yeah and again it before antiseptics before Lister comes on on and comes up with germ fighting techniques this would have been so dangerous because you have this open cavity in Windows and so Joseph lists when he comes up with his antiseptic techniques he actually performs a mastectomy on his sister on his dining room table oh right which and she survives and that's in the book see this this would be a great movie don't you think yeah I do think it would be a great movie it's like it would be a great movie for the Coen brothers yeah you know because it's so chaos Ville you know and all that kind of readiness yeah I do good period pieces too yeah plus they could make it more entertaining no part of that world but this guy with the face where they cut that tumor out of his face so for 24 minutes that's all it took to cut that thing out of his face in that that case yeah and remember a course it depended on the skill of your surgeon so he goes to a very good surgeon named James Syme but there there's a story so going back to penises there's lithotomy as the removal of the stone which you saw kind of a demonstration there and it was incredibly painful so if they stuck a rod on the penis and they cut through the scrotum me removed the stone and of course there was no pain medication and it was just awful did they drink you know it's kind of a myth because of course drinking within your blood hmm but someone asked me they said I heard that surgeons would punch the patient out and I was like oh you have to be really good to knock someone out on a first punch and of course he'd do more damage you could do a lot of damage to the head that's definitely didn't happen unless someone can prove me wrong maybe there's like a weird example but I've never come across that um see so it was kind of it was you and the surgeon and with the lithotomy it takes about a good surgeon it took about five minutes well there's a guy named Steven Pollard in 1828 who goes in to have this done now it's incredibly embarrassing it's you're you know you're naked from the waist down it's an embarrassing operation it's painful he's broadened the theater and the surgeon ends up taking over an hour because he's so intact and the patient is screaming you know please just stop just stop and on and the surgeon yells back at him for having abnormal Anatomy which how would you like that you're sitting there on the on the table and you're being blamed for this going wrong and he pulls through the operation but he does die post-operative infection abnormal Anatomy how so he just said you have ADD normal Anatomy and so on the autopsy report it was revealed that there was nothing abnormal about his Anatomy the surgeon just was really announced oh yeah it wasn't blaming the guy did you have lunch before this yeah I did good that's well that's good because then you won't faint well I hosted fear factor I've seen everything yes nothing what's worse I mean was there ever a segment on fear factor that you thought I don't know if I can watch that no no I when they had a drink calm that was rough yeah that was the second version of Fear Factor when it came back for a brief period of time and they were going way too hard they were trying to do them so yeah yeah they're like fear factors back and it's crazier than ever and they just went way over the top that's what they do with TV right yeah always pushing the boundaries they didn't have to yeah I could have just gone with regular fear factor and we would have all been fine we could do historical fear factor create these sort of things it was a blessing in disguise but this this surgery as we know it when did it first start like what is the first historical recounting of an actual doctor Oh or you mean on someone something there a licensed doctor when did it start like like really hard questions no no I know so little about history it's like 19th and 18th century it's it you know we have evidence again in archeological records of surgical procedures going far back but who did them they would have been you know sometimes what they call them wise women comedy cunning women on marver surgeons yeah I guess there are good razors right yes yeah actually barber surgeons used to do things like pull your teeth they used to blood let and so the barber pole which is red and white is red and white because it was advertising their services as blood letters so what they would do is they would tie these bloody rags around the pole and it would whip around the pole I know it's one of my fav story and and the the ball at the top represented the bowl that would catch the blood and the stick would have been the stick that you held to kind of get your veins to stick out and people were blood left for all kinds of reasons like you would do it like a purge or a diet or or you would do it because you were ill the idea being that you had produced too much blood and you needed the blood to be let to kind of restore balance in your body what do you think it would be like to go back in time and hear someone say something that's stupid like you're sick we need to remove some of your blood you have too much blood in your system you Lindsay you're gonna show you're gonna send all of these like crazy academic historians are like we can't tonsorial services what does that mean and you know what else the barbershop quartet comes from the idea that the barber surgeons often had a musical lute in the office that you would play or the patient would play was like a musical therapy so there's all kinds of hangovers from it and you know the Demon Barber Sweeney Todd yes so this is kind of a one of these stories that pops up and they think that it might be that medical practitioners were trying to undermine the legitimacy of the barbers you kind of either get this story that the barber is this like sort of demon figure who's chopping you up and selling you and making you into pies or is that a legit one because that seems like nonsense it's well it seems like it's a recreation no it's an order one coil it seems like parody like look says listen to my troubles no charge listen to your troubles 50 cents they might have had that on there Barbara thing yeah when they're cutting bullets out of you it's his bullets removed two bucks they're all drunk pomade mustache wax yeah well people thought that bullets were that gunpowder was poisonous so a surgeon would often amputate if you were shot Oh God until they kind of realized that sometimes it was okay to just keep the bullet and depending on where it was it could just be like a recreation of something that someone found maybe and they're selling that as a piece maybe right probably yeah yeah and we get that we get the red on blue and white barber poles now so what happened was the barber surgeons and the surgeons split off professional at some point in history and so the surgeons start to use blue and white poles and the barbers use red and white poles and I think now the red white blue is is like the patriotic red white and blue but but the traditional barber pole would have been red and white and it would have signified that you could come in and get your bloodletting because those those bloody rags would have been out there on the pole before they had the pole they would advertise by putting just bowls of congealed blood in the window oh and then in London they decided I think it was about the 14th century they said no more of that so the barbers started to throw the blood into the river which was also equal roses yes so the barber surgeons would have definitely been doing minor surgical procedures and they would have been more affordable than the surgeons and the physicians themselves but nobody could really do much for you in that period according to our own sort of 21st understand you know some 21st century understanding but I always say to go back to your question about you know how would it feel to hear something so dumb well what do you think today that you know in a hundred years we're gonna look back at and there's there's definitely going to be stuff right that where I can go I can't believe that you know in fact I think that this is probably gonna get people to go know that totally works you know that that a trend of copying yeah now that you see so that was also at 17th century so they would cup they would have these heated cups and they would create this blister and then they would cut it open with this really sharp instrument and that's how they would bleed you so it's kind of this weird thing that's coming back but for slightly different reasons I don't think there's any evidence that cupping is real no I don't think so either and I and I like to point people to the past because if we're gonna make fun of you know what they were doing in the past it's kind of making a reappearance so to speak but people do all kinds of weird things now too like they eat the placenta yeah there's there's no medical evidence that that has any kind of health benefit yeah but it's edible I think yeah and can eat it well it's funny because that actually segues into into this lovely object this half skull here um my friend Zane Wiley creates these these are actually cereal bowls right but and the reason why I brought it was because it opens up a conversation about something that I like to talk about which is corpse medicine so people used to actually eat dead bodies for medicinal purposes what parts so if you had epilepsy in the early modern period some we were like talking like 16 17 18 centuries um people would drink the blood of an executed criminals lost their heart like the idea was that the life cut short that the blood was very powerful force and so you get these sort of drawings of people gathered at the scaffold you know this poor bastards gonna lose his head and these people are like holding cops up to catch the blood and it didn't work and epilepsy was so awful because it was so misunderstood and you can imagine you know when someone goes into a seizure it's it's it's scary and if you don't understand what's happening you could think that it's witchcraft or there's all kinds of things that people thought about that disease so these people were quite desperate so they were drinking the blood of executed criminals good lord they ground-up mummies ancient mummies and they would make it into pills and did all the kinds of things right so I so I always point this out we eat the placenta today it's kind of like you know a form of ingesting bodily uh yes yeah so people were just super super desperate back then yeah people I mean of course there was not much that could be done right but but we do some kind of form of corpse medicine and organ donation so we're taking dead body parts we're not eating on but we're driven into our body to cure ourselves yeah I have a cadaver graft on my right knee oh yeah really well I had a huge fist fight you know I had some gum disease up here and then they had to like graft a little like piece of cadaver bone whoa but they don't call it cadaver bone see they call it could everyone - you don't they call it um freeze dry bone or something no wasn't bone it was uh they call it an allograft but it's it's a cadaver they use the achilles tendon for the ACL because the achilles tendon is much larger than an ACL so it's stronger and if you know are you familiar with the way it works it's really kind you know the way it works is not like it takes over it's not like an organ transplant so you don't have to worry about your body rejecting it in the same way although some people bodies don't accept it it doesn't work but they take this graft they put this new tendon in place this new ligament in place rather and then your body reaper LIF writes that ligament with cells so it's even though it'll feel like it's healed up within like a month or two like you're Neil feel a little bit weak from the surgery but people get a distorted perception of how strong it actually is and fighters yeah in particular I know several fighters who have wound up re-injuring their knee because they thought it was okay real really it was very gummy and very weak so how long does it take to heal before like six months yeah yeah like six to nine months they recommend but it's amazing what we can do now about 150 years ago that I'm talking about and today yeah it's just the in and I always because I'm a big Joseph Lister fan I always say that if we hadn't understood germs there would be no way to go deep into the body would there sure yeah and so he opens up this sort of huge field with medicine and a lot of advanced advancements are made off the back of it but but it was it was a gritty time and it definitely you you definitely could die very easily life is very cheap back then yeah I mean yeah I can only imagine just the the idea that woman getting her breasts removed on her kitchen table yeah there was a no there was a little boy he was 12 years old his name was Henry pace and he was told by the surgeon he had to have his leg removed and he said as little kids do would it hurt and the surgeon said no more than having a tooth polled oh he was very unprepared so they brought him to the operating theatre and he was so awake and so where he remembers counting 6 strokes of the saw before his little leg fell off why did they have to cut his leg off he broke it and it was just a sprain and they just decided to take it off no I mean if there was a compound fracture the chances of it on becoming infected was quite high so when Lister comes along and he's trying to figure out what's causing infection he notices that if it's a clean break and there's no break in the skin usually it heals okay but if there's a break in the skin it gets infected and usually it leads to some kind of gangrene or septicemia and that's how he starts to wonder it must be something coming from outside and getting into this wound that is causing the infection but he breeds Louis Pasteur's germ theory and this is how he starts to put it together but when he first comes out with it you know there's a lot of pushback because medicine and science are essentially conservative in the sense that it's like puzzle solving if someone you know you you solve the puzzle within the rules that are already set out if someone comes from sort of the fringe and has this wild idea usually there's a lot of pushback and so that's exactly what happens with Lister and it's hard for us to imagine because germs we understand them today it seems obvious to us but back then a surgeon didn't wash his hands or his instruments because why would he wash his hands or his instruments if they were going to get dirty with the next patient so that you have to get into the mind the logical mind of a Victorian surgeon they wore aprons I think Jamie I'd also sent a picture of like a surgeon with with his apron on on actually it's a picture of a butcher but it gives you that kind of idea of what your friendly Victorian surgeon would have been wearing and that apron the more blood it had on it it was like a sign of pride almost because that meant that your surgeon was very experienced and had a lot of blood on it so that's a butcher those similar tools of the trade yep similar tools and certainly that apron would have been on your surgeon I don't know about the hat yeah I know it's kind of like gangs of New York you know you kind of picture they would worn those really tall top hats and those crazy plaid colors and it's it's a very colorful time before Victoria chorus plunges the nation into mourning later so Lister is coming in along the 1840s it's very sort of colourful and filthy and dirty Victoria plunged the nation in the morning well we know when her husband died she went into sort of lifetime mourning so she's always wearing black for the rest of her life and everybody follows her example so we think of the Victorians wearing sort of all that black but in gangs of New York a lot of people thought that that was sort of imagine world but actually that's what they would have looked like they would have been wearing those plaids and those bright colors and those top hats but Lister was a Quaker we think of like Quaker Oats which is it's kind of accurate and he would have been wearing sort of black and white and very dull colors so when I think about this movie because I think about it a lot I think about sort of this world being very hedonistic and colourful and there's a lot of drugs going on they're discovering ether and all kinds of things that they're experimenting with and then you have this sombre Quaker and as the movie sort of progresses the world catches up and gets a bit cleaner with Lister so they were experimenting with all these drugs oh yourselves oh yeah it was like but it was just a crazy time so ether is so my book begins with the first operation under anesthesia and I wanted to start there because I think if anybody has ever thought about the history surgery which they might not have until they turned into this podcast they tend to think of that moment that's the big moment but actually surgery becomes much more dangerous because the surgeon still doesn't understand germs but he doesn't have the patient fighting him anymore and so he's more willing to pick up the knife and go deeper in the body and so post-operative infection Rises and in it opens with the great Robert Liston and he performs the first operation under ether in 1846 in London and and he doesn't think it's gonna work it comes from America he calls it the Yankee dodge and it's a miracle it works and the age of agony is over when ether was discovered everybody wanted to try it this drug that made you insensible what was that like and so you get these kinds of stories of medical students sniffing it and drinking it in fact I believe there's still place in London you can get an ether cocktail okay and I don't don't endorse it it's highly inflammable so people also smoked a lot in operating theatres so you can imagine that there were a lot oh yeah there are a lot of accidents on but but you drop it on it basically because it evaporates really quickly you drop it on a strawberry then you dunk it into champagne and it's supposed to get you really high very quickly and then it wears off equally quickly I try to convince my publisher to have ether cocktails a book launch but they're like just have a bunch of ubers ready yeah yeah or carriages like in the Victorian so so people were yeah definitely trying and then of course have you tried it I've not tried it I haven't found that bar yet yeah there's one experiment on the people that came to your book Lynch great story you know probably ship your toe in first yeah maybe maybe try it out yeah maybe for the next book yeah but yeah and so so you have ether in sort of the mid 19th century and then of course later you have cocaine you have opium which is well actually cocaine comes along is presented as sort of a cure to the opiate the morphine addiction so like take cocaine and I had brought its in my Mary Poppins bag I'll show it to you later after the show I brought a a postcard that shows a dentist and he's pulling a tooth and the person wrote underneath just had a tooth pulled with cocaine so they were they were using it for all kinds of things and doctors were becoming addicted themselves to these drugs then heroin comes along there invents heroin heroin is given to your children it's put in all kinds of things again it's um it's positioned as you know break your cocaine addiction now with heroin so it just it was just a crazy period and it was really in sort of in the early 20th century when a lot of this stuff started to be regulated finally Wow I didn't bring any of that I believe there was a mummy that was found in ancient Egypt that tested positive for cocaine but they think that it might be a false positive because apparently there's something else that they would consume back then that would make you test positive for cocaine I don't know yeah Jamie I'll find it but there was it was some it was some evidence I think what they were trying to connect us to now I remember they were trying to connect this to the idea that people from Egypt had the ability to travel to the Americas and that someone from here goes American drugs in ancient Egyptian mummies can make it a little larger Plews it says it seems safe to say that blah-blah-blah-blah-blah in 1992 a new study of nine mummies from ancient Egypt quite a stir when his announced the discovery traces of nicotine and cocaine in their hair both of these chemicals came from plants found only in South America and this research has since been touted as evidence of pre-columbian contact between American Africa something thought to be impossible based on the rest of the archaeological record so what's going on let's start by looking at the evidence ba-ba-ba-ba-ba 1992 the perform by some savolta Balaban OVA and - that's a serious woman and two of our colleagues at the Institute for anthropology and well this is a in Munich they're using German world anthropology probably in humanities of the University in Munich tests were carried out by nine mummies on nine memories Munich Museum dating from 1070 to 395 BC the study focused on hair samples which were often used to assess drug concentrations in the body do the results was it say here what they discovered all the mummies tested positive for cocaine and hashish which makes sense the results caused an immediate stir what the come on let's cut to the chase here folks first thing to say archaeologists are not just being stubborn about this there many reasons not to think the traces of drugs and 9 mummies means what is it what is the conclusion cut to the chase here folks this is a real teen cocaine ok back up back up cocaine stop okay cocaine most of us think of today was first discovered in early civilizations the Andean region of South America that you and the coca leaves exactly instead the cocaine and possibly the nicotine - were actually being introduced to the mummies as part of an embalming process that's interesting whoa more likely the obtained cocaine from America okay I don't know I give up there's no way we'll have to read you did a good yeah I tried yeah it just seems like it's gonna take a long time many resins and spices hold on a second worse certainly used this day we aren't entirely sure what they all were rare or exotic materials were almost certainly used and it is far less of a stretch suggest this included imports from the Middle East and potentially as far afield as India hmm I don't know I think they the this is a very skeptical about the idea that people from Egypt were able to travel all the way to the Americas where the cocaine was but I think I think part of the conclusion was that there were some other things that would make that you test positive for cocaine oh it's interesting what sort of like poppy seeds make you test positive for right you have to go for a drug test for work they say don't eat poppy seed don't even just hot yeah it wasn't there like a Seinfeld I'm looking at the Wikipedia for it to that it might have been part of a thriving tourist scam in Egypt in the Victorian area so they might have like said it was there and some people come look and then you know women said what was there the cocaine it says since passing these corpses off recently deceased as ancient mummies was a thriving tourist game in Egypt during the Victorian era like I could have that doesn't make sense because the tests were done tonight after the experiments even assuming the cocaine was actually found on the mummies it's possible this could have been a contamination that occurred codes were fondling monies those mummies because they wanted to eat them as I said they'd be round them up and they use that on ancient Egyptian mummies that you have to yeah think about how much was destroyed what do I think about all the time this is a fantastic exhibit almond powder Wow look at that that is nuts mummy extract it's cure-all whatever you got yeah fixes you know it's a you know it's a quack remedy when it's a cure-all we still have quite a remedy you know take a pill lose weight those things that are causing people to lose weight and those late-night infomercials yeah take a bunch of pills yeah that's all for modern day quackery there's a fantastic exhibit that's right now there's an IMAX exhibit in Los Angeles at one of the museum's I saw it about a year ago but they have a King Tut exhibit and then on top of that they have this gigantic IMAX theater which is fantastic and they show the all these different tombs that they discovered and how they discovered them and but it makes you really when they've discovered King Tut's tomb we have no idea how many similar tombs there were that were over the you know yeah I think about how much yeah absolutely I mean what we have you know in the museum's is just sort of a fraction yeah what we know and and still stuff is coming to light it's just a minimal yeah but yeah they the Victorians are responsible for destroying a lot and for taking those mummies and just grounding them all kinds of things yeah it's what what gets me is what was the mote like where was the theory like would the theory come from like when you wanted to see mommy when it in a powder some of it would have been sort of folk medicine influence you know there's there's this idea of sympathetic magic so for instance if you if I stabbed you with a sword let's get very violent you could be healed if I put this sort of special sympathetic powder on the sword it would heal you so it was sort of this um healing by distance so all kinds of strange ideas existed but and that's why it's important when you're studying the history of medicine to really get into the mindset because it's so wildly different to the way we think right um and and you know actually do you know what this is that I brought this some if people are just listening it's it's a long beat mask look a bird bath shot yeah I do not know what that is okay so this a lot of people think this is a Venetian mask this is actually particularly on a particular example from Venice it is what people would have doctors would have worn during the bubonic plague so it's well the plague doctor mask and so um it was invented in the 17th century by a French doctor and the idea behind it was so people thought that disease was spread by this thing called miasma which are like little particles in the air they're sort of associated with bad smells so if something smells bad it's probably not good for you is what they thought and it kind of makes sense because it's like you know you're in a really if you're in a slum area of the Victorian period it's probably has a lot of disease it probably doesn't smell good so that was sort of the thinking behind it so what you would do is you would put sweet-smelling herbs into the beak and so you would be smelling the scent it would protect you from those evil miasma whoa yeah it's you know is that a one no we don't actually have I don't believe there's an example of a real one from the 17th century but there's a lot of illustrations of the plague doctor and he would have been wearing a hat he would have been wearing a cape leather gloves like sort of just protecting himself oh there you go that's a real one authentic 16th century plague doctor mask preserved and on display at the wall there you go another one dosed in Germany Museum of medical history but I questioned that because it was invented in 17th centuries so if it's real it's gonna be a little bit later interesting but we don't know how much they were warned because they would have been expensive a lot of doctors weren't very noble so the plague broke out they got the hell out of there there was sort of a phrase go far and go long you know get out and don't come back for a while it wasn't much they could do for you they had a stick as well that they would sort of poke the patient with so they wouldn't have to touch the patient and kind of have them turn over and they can you know yes you have the plague there wasn't much they could do for you and we can cure this is they did not know what what what germs were so they really understand what the plague was they had sort of a concept of contagion so if you broke out with the plague they would probably quarantine you in your house and they put a big cross on the door and so people would bring food and on you you um you know put a basket outside of your window with a rope and you take and so they do that until everybody was dead in the house or that the plague had passed and they felt that you were safe to come out into the general population so there was an idea that these things were contagious but not again in the way that we kind of understand disease diseases being spread today it's so strange that they would you would not know what was going on what people just start dying and you'd like what is it yeah it could God's curse on and and people say you know oh the plague mask is so terrifying on it's super creepy but I always say that it's good look this is why I brought this across the Atlantic so Joe Rogan could wear the plague doctor mask how many people wouldn't know what that is like if you went you know if you go to they say plague doctor mask funny because I was just in Venice recently and they were saying that you know the big carnival that they have every year it's becoming harder to do because of security reasons so you have like a huge population of a city wearing masks and covering their identities they have to cut back which kind of sucks because you know that's a sign of the carnival so now they're they're cutting back where you can wear them in public places and things like that but yeah fortunately we're a plague mask can't we're played masks I'm gonna bring it back though I'm just gonna be walking around downtown LA how would that attach to your face like straps yeah there would have been straps or in that other example he was showing it looked like it was sort of a fool I know there it goes I mean that looks so creepy it's so creepy but death today we have the modern plague doctor what do you think that would be yeah hazmat yeah yeah exactly and so you think about the hazmat going into hot zones that would be pretty scary if you didn't know what was going on it's certainly sort of ominous you know when you see the hazmat so it it's a weird thing that exists because in a strange kind of way it probably did protect the plague doctor because he was covering himself up but it protected him for the wrong reasons he still didn't understand how diseases spread are you aware of the theory of alien abduction being a distant memory of childbirth no yeah there's a there's a theory that is actually being tossed about that these people that have this ancient well they have this memory of childbirth right so all of a sudden you're being born there's bright lights above you there's a man or a woman who's the surgeon with a mask that covers their face so all you see is their eyes okay and everything looks bright and and it's terrifying and clinical and you're on this table and everything's cold most of these alien abduction experiences that people recount they take place in some sort of a medical facility yeah and everything is bright and strange and cold and they think that this is is they're they're saying that we had this idea that children don't have memories that babies don't have memories and so they said well why wouldn't they have memories that's ridiculous of course they have memories they have brains they they grab your finger they looked you in the eye they would have a memory of every second that they were born and it's probably one of the most profound and disturbing memories because before that everything is incredibly peaceful inside the mother's womb you know you're just like taken and pulled out and then there's this bright light above you've never experienced any light so every and your visual perception your field of view is all distorted right this is the first time using your eyes that's why people are saying yes that's interesting this is a theory it makes sense to me because of you think about more sense than the abduction so what does because people don't really go anywhere see the thing about the abduction thing yes they put like cameras in people's rooms and and they say they have these alien abduction experiences but they don't go anywhere so what they're doing is a dream yeah which is the mind is amazing and it's so powerful and we know so little still yeah so also like these all these that means it's kind of duh because they all happen while you're sleeping 90 percent they tend to be medical yeah it's very medical in nature right you're being examined and then there's also going back to childbirth there's also a lot of people that have these experiences that they are being told that either they're taking their baby away from them or they're studying their baby or that they had a baby inside of them they didn't know about and that the aliens have put it there and they're taking it out right yeah yeah I mean it even goes back to the virgin birth right so it's all very weird but this this memory that people have from childhood is most likely you know probably a pretty intense interest memory that's always there yeah yeah and some people can tap into it and some people can't yeah sure yeah yeah this was also a theory while natural childbirth supposed to be less traumatic like women having natural childbirth in a bathtub you know yeah that that is actually kind of like moving back to you know it's men start to get involved in childbirth around the 17th century 18th century before it was mostly women so women in the village would come and actually the term gossip comes from the idea the women who would spread the word in the village that someone was going into labor they were called the gossips negative thing later so that the gossips would spread the word the women would come in this was a female only chamber on and men were not really allowed in a man might be brought in if the mother was dying or if the child was dying and then in that case instruments were brought into the birth the birthing chambers so the doctor might come in and he might take these sort of forceps and a baby apart and take the baby out baby would die but in those cases it was like really extreme like this was gonna happen like either the mother is gonna die the baby was gonna die both of them were gonna die or if the baby was coming out feet first yeah capable Midwife could could handle that on but this you know the cesarean section people think that it comes from the term that the idea that Julius Caesar was ripped from the womb of his mother but um it's unlikely that that story is true because his mother lives into old age so probably the the term cesarean comes from the Latin term meaning to cut and the first sort of record we have of this happening I think is in the sixteenth century and it's a farmer and he takes the instruments that he uses to castrate his pigs to cut this baby out of his wife yeah and and we don't have any records of whether this it's probably didn't work again no idea of germs all this kind of stuff I know she lived we yeah I don't have there's no sort of it doesn't follow the records don't follow the story but she probably died and the baby probably died as well people don't know the castrate pigs to make them more edible the oftentimes castrate them and then let them loose because then they they concentrate on grass and not ass that is a actual farmers term I I have you know talk about cesarean sections and castrating pigs who knew those two things well that's what I do well the difference between a steer in a bowl his steers castrated they castrate them because they make better steaks things I learned yeah you don't want a muscular jacked boy exactly yeah that but that buffalo above my friend Adam green tree shot that in Australia and the my friend cam was chewing on a piece of his for one piece for half an hour oh my gosh it was that 2,000 pounds sack of Steel so it's not good no sit down no I mean they say they very like sometimes some of them you can eat yeah you know I mean you can eat them they're all Ruffalo yeah but they're just insanely dense crazy how big I mean when you see the skull it's just the size of it is incredible yeah it's it's also an invasive species so they have no natural predators so there's just thousands and thousands of destroying the countryside and so people travel up to the northern lands are to land I forget that the name of the place where they go and they hunt these things Wow yeah they're huge yeah Australia's a trip I mean it is really a wildlife experiment because they brought in so many animals and right Susie as well yeah and they're not indigenous in there so when you think about the history of surgery and that you you concentrate on this one very particular time in this book in this book yeah but as a medical historian like when what first were what led you to that like why I mean I you know I'm like that kid who never grew out of the obsession with Tales from the Crypt yeah Ripley's Believe It or Not you know the shrunken heads I actually did a segment for a documentary in the shrunken heads and I had to go out to Poland I actually got to hold these things that I was always fascinated with growing up well people don't know that they think the skulls in there that's why they don't shrink the head yeah and it's it's amazing because what they do is that obviously they take the skull out and it's a process and this documentary was looking at they were DNA testing them because the tribe that makes these skulls they were done for a specific purpose to trap the soul of the warrior that they killed so that there was a spiritual reason behind it but what they were finding was that some of these shrunken heads were female um which probably means that um as westerners came into these areas they wanted to collect these shrunken heads as curiosities of course and so they traded guns for heads and so we kind of drove up the the demand for these these shrunken heads so they started killing women well it wasn't just just anybody and it might not have been killing them it might have just been taking bodies of people who had already died but they definitely aren't all authentic in the sense that they were yeah killed in battle and so it's just kind of an interesting but I got to interact and see these shrunken head so I was that weird creepy kid that you know no one really wanted to talk to I joke that I was I also um looked like barb from stranger things and my brother pointed this out and we were watching stranger things and then barb dies and nobody gives a shit yes sorry sorry everybody and I was just devastated I'm like nobody noticed for you know like a whole season but yeah they barely cared like what she's missing I guess he's missing that no one here last time we saw her by the pool I was I was really awkward I was five seven by the age of ten and I was just I was just like that weird kid with Tales from the Crypt and so I kind of so I went on to study history in college and then I went to Oxford and I did a masters and PhD in it but academia is not it's isn't doesn't allow me to be as creative and weird as I'd like to be so now I'm just a storyteller I'm a freelance writer and I do this YouTube channel and I'm sure Oxford's gonna be like give us the PhD back can they do that no there's a real value in that in terms of Education because what you do is very interesting and entertaining and that's why I started following you and retweeting your stuff it's really I appreciate that you know it's funny because there is this sort of tension between what they call popular history and academic history and I get at like academic historians will come at me on Twitter and stuff and this one guy said to me well you're just an entertainer and I was like well that's not an insult to me like that's that's not true you have a PhD yeah i stupid yeah what school just said that yeah like me you're just an entertainer yeah just it's like it's like I'm bastardizing the subject kind of you know way that they don't like well it's because of people like me I'm like a grouse my retweet makes it you want it you know like I did this thread on Twitter called your Victorian doctors trying to kill you and every tweet was like Coco rats cocaine laced cigarettes which you had also shared at one point and just all the kinds of crazy things and then at the end of the thread I said but what is it about today that people will look back but you know this one academic was like this is really on you know bad history and you're you're making it fun how dare you you know that but for the most part people enjoy it and and that's nice well that is like the the big complaint that people have about academia is that it's so stuffy yeah yeah I'm gonna get like so many weird academics I know it's just it's one of those things like I've had to make peace with um because I am a storyteller and if you look at my profile I call myself a storyteller first rather than historian great stories though the see stories list for us in 2019 are so incredibly fortunate to have you know actual real doctors with real modern medicine to fix us in you know talking to a guy who's had probably five surgeries yeah I know I'm yeah it's god it's so I know I had an appendectomy and it was it was amazing they used little tiny robotic instruments now and they they barely make you know I think the incisions like an inch long or something it's a buddy of mine had shoulder surgery and the the actual cuts are like millimeters tiny little cuts you barely can see the scars it's amazing and you know with your knee surgery it was an injury from activity right you know and you think about people in the past they weren't necessary well I mean there was there were sports and competitions but mostly people were getting injuries from repetitive strenuous labor that they were doing sure there's a story of a cab driver in the 18th century and he got this aneurysm behind his knees so on the cab drivers in the 18th century were these high boots like riding boots and it would rub at the back of the knee and it created this huge aneurysm and there was a surgeon named John hunter in London who said well normally what you do is you would hack the leg off because oh sorry God Pop's are gonna bleed out but he said I have an idea I want to cut into the leg and I want to tie off the blood supply to the aneurism I want to see if that works and it did and you saved this guy's leg and that's really important because remember these people had no options if they couldn't work a lot of you say aneurysm you like people think of aneurysm and think of a brain right it's like what's the what's the term it's um it's a specific kind of aneurysm it's almost like a balloon that appears on the outside sack of blood big sack of blood why didn't they think they could just drain it that's what I would think if you severed it yeah I don't know um I'd be like slow down doc yeah don't don't heck that leg I'll Drive this taxi bitch and what's incredible about that story actually is that he that hunter saves the leg and then when the man dies right before he dies he knows he's going to die this is many years later he writes a letter and he wills his body to Hunter so this is one of the first early exact to take the leg and took open it up and dissect it and to see what happened and so that way it's on display the surgeons I'm sorry at the Royal College of Surgeons in London so they embalmed it yeah well he would have preserved it probably with on wax injections almost like plastination oh I was very torn when I was walking around this because what a part of me was saying this is really fascinating and the other part of me was saying what is the difference between this and like fucking Ed Gein's house where he made lampshades out of people oh yeah I mean one would hope the difference is consent but one would hope though yeah woman well there has been controversies with certain acts exhibitions maybe not body worlds but there's been some spin-offs where there's been a question of where they got those bodies yes and of course if if you're also going into sort of poorer areas and asking people to hand over their bodies is it really consent because sometimes these families don't have money for girls and yes there's other incentives but I think my view is what you know it's it's given under the guise of science that we can only view dead bodies through the lens of science day that's the only acceptable way but it really is art um and I wish that it would just be more openly recognized as just art whether it's your kind of thing or not because some of it is posed in really shocking ways right that are unnecessary to teach Anatomy right so you know if you're going to say it's an anatomical lesson why does the person have to be posed in this sort of dramatic way so I think that you know it would be better if we just called it for what it was it's art and it's supposed to be provocative and shocking and that's why people come to see it and we're morbid curious it is absolutely interesting yeah I mean and people say oh my gosh the Victorians bought tickets the operating theatre well people come to my Instagram account you know I mean we're still morbidly curious oh for sure it's really interesting that it's called a theatre as well did you ever see that movie with Benicio del Toro though I think was just The Wolfman it was one of the more recent werewolf movies but he becomes a werewolf in the operating theatre so the doctor is convinced the doctors convinced that he's a madman there's something wrong with him so they give him electric shock therapy and all these different things and what's the period it's supposed to be in this period oh yeah yeah it's in London so yes even you find it it's kind of a crazy scene you know the doctors were experimenting with um electricity a lot and galvanism and things like kind of reanimating the corpses we get the story Ward Frankenstein um and they were also interested in how long do you live or your conscience after you're beheaded right so there's these expertise experiments during the revolution where they're like shouting at the heads to see if the heads will blink Oh God so I'm sure we can't air this on YouTube so this will only be us watching this because if we air it on YouTube don't do it see that's exactly what this feeders yeah he's like saying he's gonna kill all of them like you need to get out of here and they this doctor is very arrogant and they're dealing with him and the moon turns full and he starts freaking out and it's it's really interesting because if this was actually how they had patients strapped in is that accurate like the way that chair is set up yeah they would have I mean so his feet it looked like his feet were on the ground so the chair would have been higher so his feet would have sort of dangled it's one of the best ever and I'm a giant werewolf fan I mean this is one of the best ever because this was actually done by Rick Baker who's the same guy who did an American Werewolf in London which is the werewolf it's out in the hall okay oh yeah but this is the modern version of it that they decided to make and you know the thing is that these guys were watching this and the doctors arigon has his back to the patient while he's discussing and it's exactly what those cheaters would have looked like as well yeah but they would have been just so crowded that is so strange though that this was like this was entertainment this was something that people wanted to say well you know it wasn't just sort of the morbid curiosity it was also that the Victorians were obsessed with scientific progress so they wanted to come in and see right I see that they want to see what they're trying for people are listening yeah this is a it's not a good movie but it's a it's a great scene there's a bunch of great scenes in this movie I enjoy it just because I love werewolf movies yeah yeah it would have been fun to shoot yeah well it's um it's also they decided in this movie to make it with minimal use of CGI and yeah what they decided to do is do it all with perceptual yeah rubber masks and things like that pretty ridiculous movies it actually it's funny because um it sort of reminds me of again Liston the the 6-2 giant he got a patient on the table who had to have a bladder Stern remember how awful that was and this guy was like fuck it I'm not gonna do it he jumps off the table he runs across the room locks himself in a closet and Liston Liston all 6 two of them chases this guy rips the door off and just drags him back oh my god so you know and that really happens again be a great movie anybody listening yeah pushing this movie alright are you trying to sell that while you're out here no I mean I'm I guarantee you someone is listening to me I think I I you know I could sell the rights to the book but I've held on to him and I'm developing them with my producing partner because this book was born out of a lot of traumas so a couple years ago I went through a really bad divorce and I was facing deportation as a result from the UK and so I had no money they took my passport everything like I couldn't do anything so I wrote this book and so I always say that Joseph Lister saved a lot of lives not least my own because it's kind of lifted me and it's been a rebirth so I really want to be involved in the process I've always been fascinated with movies I want to kind of see how the sausage is made sort of speak you know if you're a writer and you just sawed off the rights or not you don't really have much creative input at all right but yeah I just think that you know it's it's a great story because it's it sort of crosses with the with people who are interested in the horror genre right because you get the the surgery the Victorian surgery but it's an uplifting story about something that changed the world and the way we fundamentally understand it who you envision playing Lister I see Bradley Cooper yeah yeah he's like quintessential movie star right yes yeah I was thinking on Eddie Redmayne the British actor who's like he's so sweet and whiskers are very sort of who's that girl he's in on fantastic beasts and where to find them the the Harry Potter he's he's really big in Britain or Benedict Cumberbatch but that guy's awesome yeah it's strange I think Benedict Cumberbatch would like to play Liston the 6-2 guy because it's a real theatrical role well come he's another guy who's awesome and everything amazing yeah yeah so if you're listening Benedict he's killer and Doc dr. strange is another movie that's not the best movie in the world but he's killer in it yeah and he's tall you know he could play list any good he's you know we could Balcombe out a bit and ah there we go does he have to be the patient you don't want to be the guy that dies when it's code /d Ike's yeah I'll be that guy I'll be the guy with faith yeah so this book sort of you were in quite a bit of personal anguish yourself so you have this deep attachment to it I can it's my first book and I'm working on an um a new book on the history of plastic surgery uh-huh any fast name with that as well yeah it's it's interest so I'm looking at a guy named Harold gillies who was rebuilding soldiers faces during World War one and if you've ever seen these guys photos I mean it's we have no problems you know you you think we have no problems in the 21st century you look at these guys because they've been shot through the face and their jaws are missing and Harold gillies on really designs or starts plastic surgery as we know it and it was a time when losing a limb made you a hero but losing your face made you a monster so these guys are really isolated and so what gillies does is he gives them their identity back so it starts on the battlefields of World War one and it's gonna kind of follow gillies throughout I like to do character-driven stories even though they're 100% true I like to sort of follow medical history through the eyes of one particular person Wow yeah the the history of plastic surgery is fascinating to me and I'm hooked on that show botched oh yeah people always I'm sure is so great this is me watching box this is me all the time doing man stop doing them what people put themselves through right and I started following some plastic surgeons on Instagram just to kind of know what what you know they're doing today and and thinking about the ethics of how they target people on social media and how do we feel about that and I'm telling you I'm 37 I'm feeling bad about my body I can't imagine if you're like 14 and awkward in your barb you know and you and you have access to these accounts and the effect it has on young people on Instagram and everything well I had Johnathan hate on the podcast who wrote this book the coddling of the American mind and one of the big things that he discusses is people comparing themselves to others through social media and children particularly girls yeah this higher instances of suicide cutting depression much higher instances of depression I believe yeah I believe it too it's crazy and then you see someone like Kylie Jenner who transforms herself literally from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan yeah yeah and it's all done through the knife and it's it's great and that'sthat's the whole thing like that that kind of beauty is unattainable release or oh yeah this gentleman is Harold gillies on one of his patients and well that's the end yeah and what he did was on he invented this thing called the tube pedicle where he would take skin and he would he basically create a tube and he can place it somewhere on the face where the defect was and the blood supply would make it attach and the guy did an incredible job I mean first nerd 19 that's probably 1917 right there that's like better than a lot of the people on botched the final product and that skill ease down down there that yeah that's another man no he was incredible and really when you think about what these guys went through - yeah um so the so my book is starting with this guy named Pierce eclair who shot through both cheeks and his face is just blowing off and to get off the battlefield was half the struggle because if your face is blowing off most of the time the stretcher bearers will just pass you up because they think you're gonna die but it was a survivable wound and so just getting off the battlefield you know so you sit there for 12 hours oh my god died in the process you know food you can't eat no food and that was the other thing so a lot of these guys died because well intending nurses would lay them down and if you don't have a jaw your tongue slips back into your throat any joke yeah how are you suffocated so so just getting to Harold gillies hospital so he starts this incredible facial and jaw unit in Britain during the war just to get there was a battle and then you have to go through all these painful operations and so I want to look at that and then of course like how does that become what we do today but equally I always tell people that botched is one form of plastic surgery but of course there's a lot of important surgeons doing reconstructive work yeah um you know and now we have face transplants which are incredible I don't know Jamie if you can find someone who's had a face transplant but there's been quite a few yeah there's there's you know the I think the hardest part is finding the donor mm-hmm it's hard to get people to donate their organs as it is but think about a face is so personal yeah and the last one National Geographic did a spread on it and was I 18 I think it was an 18 year old girl who shot herself in the face and in a moment of rage and um and anyway she ended up having this face transplant about three years later and the the donor face I think with someone who was in their 30s this person had died I think of an overdose and then the family decided to give this face over so it's it's actually incredible what we can do when you think about you know from the battlefields of World War one to what Gilly is doing to where we are today with facial reconstruction and it's just going to get better and better yeah I'm sure it is gonna get better and better and for people with disfavour in injuries and things it's fantastic yeah what freaks me out about botched is the psychological aspect of people constantly tinkering with their looks it is yeah and now they have apps where you can upload your face and you can change things about your face and it's just we're we're all becoming more and more insecure I think with social media and and yeah it's part of this world where we where nothing is real that's the other part of it this a lot of these pictures aren't real now people are doctoring their photos to make themself look different than they actually do look and they know someone walks into the studio and you're like wait that's not what I thought that person was going to look like this woman who's friends with my wife her neighbor is a model and she takes all of her photos with no makeup on and then they put the makeup on her oh my god yeah that's how they do it they do it all through Photoshop so she can do whatever you turn into an avatar but it's kind of crazy that they they take photos with no makeup and then nothing's real nothing is real anymore we kind of just thinks we're mean I don't want to go down this road in this conversation but I think we're preparing ourselves for a time where nothing is real I mean I think preparing ourselves for a time where we live inside some sort of a simulation yeah and I think on it's interesting because celebrities like yourself have to really think about how your image is used after you're gone as well now like something that you didn't have to think about so there was a commercial with Audrey Hepburn in Britain and she's it's it's a galaxy chocolate commercial and she's there and it looks like she's eating a chocolate bar and so the ways that they can manipulate images and and I think for the first time a lot of celebrities need to really think carefully about whether they're okay with their images being used in certain kinds of ways after their death like who owns your image it's just like when you look at medical history in the past you don't own your body and so a lot of these surgeons get hold of these bodies to dissect and they're digging them up from from graveyards there were Body Snatchers they called themselves resurrection men and they would go into these cemeteries and they would do these bodies and they would oftentimes strip the body naked because it was it was illegal to steal possessions from the corpse but not the body itself because there was no I there was no concept of the body being sort of property so they would throw the clothes back into the grave and and they were really clever in the ways they did it they usually sent a woman in the daytime to masquerade as a mourner and she would kind of go through the graveyard and she would see where the fresh graves were because of course you'd want the body to be as fresh as possible and then at nighttime they would go in there and they would dig up these bodies and they could take as many as 12 bodies in a night it was like hard labor and it was very lucrative because the only legal bodies to dissect in Britain in the early 19th century were bodies of executed criminals of people who had murdered other people's so silly went to the like to say goodbye dear Nana and drop some flowers on her grave and there's just a big hole in the ground well they would cover it up but you do get these stories of people finding out that a body so for instance I think it was in 1785 on this person goes to this graveyard and discovers that a body is missing that a body has been snatched and everybody in the village goes to this graveyard and digs up their relatives and drags these coffins back to their home until they could make the cemetery safer oh my which is insane because people were really feared this and so yesterday on Twitter I put up a picture of something called the cemetery gun so they had these devices that they would put at the foot of the grave and it had like a tripwire and so you can set up the gun to shoot anybody good god and there's actually a really awful story of a grieving father who this was set up at the grave and he accidentally trips it and he gets shot so you know it wasn't it wasn't exactly a safe way to protect the bodies but they also had Watchmen look there it is this for your for your twitter feed that's twitter yes cemetary gun 19th century used to protect against Body Snatchers that is so crazy it's a musket yeah it was hardcore I mean you'd have to be quite wealthy as well to set something like that up at the at the foot of your relatives grave they also use coffin collars so that was sort of like an iron well it was it was a collar and they would nail it to the bottom of the coffin so that way so what what a Body Snatcher would typically do is just opened the foot of the grave he wouldn't dig up the whole grave he'd smash open the lid and he'd have instruments to kind of drag the body out well if the corpse is nailed to the bottom of the coffin you're gonna have a lot of trouble dragging that body out so people you know they did all kinds of things they put these cages over the over the graves to protect them so people the Internet god bless its will say to protect against vampire or to keep vampires from coming I they had nothing that or zombies it was to prevent body-snatchers from getting a hold of those corpses but you know those by business yeah there they are mort's safes they were called oh my god and you'll see him a lot in Britain um and there they were people were very paranoid about this I mean you can find a lot of examples of this and bodies were stolen a lot and thank God they were on some level right because think about how much we learnt from these bodies bodies were needed to be dissected to teach medical students yeah and one of the scenes in the book I talk about the dead house they called it the dead house and everybody had a different experience in the dead house there's probably people listening who've been in a dissection room and you have a really vivid memory of that it's probably bright and white and clinical well these places the bodies would have been bloated and partly decomposed dissecting bodies was dangerous because you could cut yourself and you could infect yourself with bacteria they weren't wearing gloves and so you get examples of people cutting themselves and dying within 48 hours so going into medicine was dangerous and there's a story in this book about a guy who goes into the the dead house for the first time and he freaks out and he sees all these like mice and rats and things like that eating the body and so he jumps out the window and he runs off but later he becomes accustomed to it as we all become accustomed to horrible things at some point and he actually starts taking pieces of the corpse and throwing it to the poor little starving creatures that are on the dead house and she's yeah so it's kind of like you know that that horror that we all experience possibly when we when we were confronted with death to accepting it as you have to as a medical student if you want to go on so the dead house is is particularly it would have smelled dissection would have would have been a winter sport because the bodies wouldn't decompose as quickly you course wouldn't want to be dissecting in the heat of the summer did they literally have seasons for dissection yeah they would they would tend to teach students in the winter so they wear like winter jackets and they would have probably because well they had a fireplace at the end of the room as well make a really stuff smelly right and you couldn't really predict what a person had died from as well so remember people are dying from things like smallpox which is awful yeah and this is before bass vaccinations this is certainly before antibiotics and so a lot of doctors or medical students died as a result of going into the profession oh wow so there are they getting it from these corpses they can get a bacterial infection certainly and just being with patients if a patient comes in with smallpox and in smallpox a lot of people I don't know if I did I send you a picture of smallpox Jamie a lot of people think oh it's it's like chickenpox like not like chickenpox it's it's a really awful disease and it's the only disease that we have eradicated ever in human history yeah which is incredible so it's it's one of those ones the other yeah that's unbelievable children with it it's just and it was so common it was very common it was it was very feared as well because it was so disfiguring and so know if you were for instance a wealthy woman and you got smallpox and you were scarred your family might worry that they couldn't marry you off so you know it was one of those diseases that left its mark on you literally and and it also had a high mortality rate as well but it wasn't like chicken pox no there's my my PSA like chicken pox well it's you know it's one of those things that we're so thankful that people have figured out how to get rid of something yeah and and in smallpox vaccine was invented in 18th century most people don't know it's it's that old that's terrible yeah Edward Jenner invented it and actually the biggest anti-vaxxer movement or protest happened in 19th century hundred thousand people turned out to march in Britain against Jenner people thought that on their children would turn into cows because he used cow pox the virus cow pox to bestow immunity onto people and so there was this huge fear that you know it was dirty to kind of insert this animal virus into people and so there was this big protest a hundred thousand people to protest the fact that six parents had been jailed for not vaccinating their children and so this is much older than we think and the fears that we have about vaccines are or not that's a similar to what people worried about in the past as well but Jenner is an incredible figure that is incredible when you stop and think about the fact that this is still going on today with the internet yeah yeah all the mean you can find out I mean I had dr. Peter Hotez on recently to talk about vaccines and and the misconceptions that people have and he explained that they have isolated a bunch of different environmental factors that and genes that contribute to autism but that it all takes place in the womb right people want to hear that no I mean and that is the danger of the way information is now spread of course echo chambers it is you know it's confirmation bias is the real danger wasn't it was actually harder to get that message out but a lot of you know you get famous sort of cartoons of of people sort of turning the cows or the cartoonists my new husband is cartoonists and so it's like this this way of this powerful way of kind of conveying images and fears and stuff and so yeah people people had that fear of vaccines for a long time but Edward Jenner coming up with his vaccine undoubtedly saved millions of people's lives undoubtedly yeah it's just so it's so amazing that that's the problem is still around today we even with all the information that we have available yeah I think you know there was on Fox News newscaster who recently said that he doesn't wash his hands because he can't see germs I don't know who what he was joking hopefully you said the next day he actually washed his hands so so people were sending that to me because again like this dirt right and and I I always tell people you know it is that idea of what you can't see it's hard to convince people and with Lister you know if you think about it here's this young guy and he's coming along he's saying there's these invisible little creatures and they're killing your patients and trust me I have this really weird instrument called a microscope and I can see them and it was a leap of faith he was also accusing the older surgeons of inadvertently killing their patients because if they weren't washing their hands they were leading to higher mortality rates so they probably fought against it as well yeah so there was there was huge pushback so what Lister ultimately does is he turns to the younger generation and he changes their minds and so it's a slow burn it's not like you know the movie moment unfortunately where it just happens all in once and it takes quite a long time on and it's it's weird that it takes so long because if you think about him coming in 1876 to America it's after the Civil War people were dying soldiers were dying of high infection rates they were packing wounds with mud I mean they couldn't get worse than that right and so people were dying of all these all these kinds of infections he comes to Philadelphia to convince the medical community and speaker after speaker just denounces him on the first day and then he gets up and he does his demonstrations and he starts to slowly change people's minds but it takes a long time the the cover of the of the American book is on the American version I should say is a famous painting by people and see that by Samuel gross it's called the gross clinic um the guy in the middle it is gross as well but the guy in the middle of Samuel gross and he so didn't believe in Lister that he would walk into the room and he'd slam the door and he'd say there mr. Lister's germs can't get in anymore and you can see in this that he's sticky he's wearing his street clothes he's sticking his dirty fingers into this wound and there's a woman in the background and she's um covering her face and she's the mother of the patient and she's wearing black because she expects her son to die so so this is the u.s. cover and for the UK cover I think I sent that to you Jamie um it's I sent you a picture of both covers side by side it's another painting by Eakins and it was done within ten years and it's called the Agnew clinic and it's totally different because the doctors are wearing white there's a sense that they understand germs there's a sense that antisepsis is being used there so that kind of before-and-after shot in such a short period that Lister is able to change the world what made you choose different covers for the UK and the US version well so that's actually writers don't oh there you go so you can see so penguin published it in the UK so they've stylized the original painting but you kind of get a sense of what it would have looked like um and actually you have women appearing in the operating theatre professionally as nurses so this is after the Florence Nightingale revolution as well it still looks different the way we operate but you can definitely see a difference between those two paintings you refresh my memory in the Florence Nightingale Revolution so Florence Nightingale is a in this book a little bit people always wonder why I didn't speak about her as much but actually she didn't believe in germs at first she thought Wooster was quite hysterical with his idea of germs but she was working towards sanitation in hospitals so they're working towards the same goal but just with different it's slightly different tactics so she revolutionizes nursing to make it a more respectable profession before then nurses you wouldn't want your daughter becoming a nurse if you were from a well-respected family because it was she would be privy to the male body so you wouldn't want her interacting with male patients so really kind of lowly on poor women went into nursing and it wasn't really a respected profession until Florence Nightingale comes along and there's this sort of revolution so the revolution is not just about the profession though but it's about the sanitation reforms that she brings about in hospitals so you see that on the cover as well but there's there's also another guy I'm sure there's like I can I always like sort of predicts comments I shouldn't think about you know what people are gonna say but people tend to get mad on like when I give lectures cuz I don't talk about this guy there's there's groupies out there that love this physician named Semmelweis and I do talk about him in the book a little bit so Semmelweis was this disease I call him groupies Semmelweis groupies because every time I give a talk there's always one person who asked this question and I have to spell myself and I'm like ah here it is and they say why I think you'll find you haven't talked about Semmelweis Semmelweis was was practicing in austria and he was putting this idea together that if you wash your hands and you go on to the hospital wards infection rates went down and they call he was ridiculed heavily they called him the hand washer and he ends up being put in insane asylum and it's really kind of sad weird death that he has and and he's really sort of persecuted for these ideas of hand-washing and and infection rates he's doing it a little bit before Lister comes onto the scene Lister's not aware of some of Isis work but equally I always tell people that some voice doesn't really do it first if we if we're gonna play that game because again there's a difference between the basic sanitation and then understanding why you're implementing it so until you understand that germs exist it doesn't make sense you can't really convince people and that's where Lister comes in he takes loo pastor's germ theory and he's able to convince people in the medical community that germs exist hmm so until we understand you know again why wash your hands if they're just gonna get dirty that's amazing so again why did you have two different covers oh yes so the publisher just picks whatever covers they want basically on so my us publisher had come up with this my UK publisher came up with a cover I didn't like that much and so I said well why don't we use the second Ekans painting so that they're in conversation with one another so I like that I like the font better on the US cover I know I love this Victorian font and I think the image of that guy wearing street clothes is just more it's so evocative you know it's just this book this cover actually so it's been translated to think in about 15 languages now so most of them kind of take this this image I was wondering if you knew what this might be this is so it's a circular metal metal contraption with teeth on the inside gorgeous no idea what this is called the jus Campinas this is an victorian anti-masturbation device what yeah there's the real one this is this is a prop that I use for under the knife that's the real one so what would happen is if the person got an erection it would clamp down and obviously kill the erection pretty quickly can I say that yeah that's one we made for the show yeah but it's basically yeah it's similar if you see like the one on the screen it has device so these they were trying why were they trying to get people to stop master though the Victorians were obsessed with with masturbation and there's probably a lot of people out there who know that Kellogg's cornflakes came out of this sort of obsession yes patient please tell people that story we heard it from dr. Chris Ryan oh it's so funny well it's funny in a haha kind of horrifying way Kellogg was was obsessed with with masturbation he thought that a lot of his patients were suffering from all kinds of mental ailments and physical ailments because they were masturbating too much and he thought that a diet bland in bland and high in fiber would kind of kill the fire in the belly and so he invented what became Kellogg's Corn Flakes dream but his brother was the one who commercialized and his brothers like we should add sugar and dr. Kellogg was like no people we masturbating all the time we can't add sugar you know and they had this like sweat and Kellogg's cornflakes became the commercial version with the delicious sugar added in so that was the brothers idea it was the brothers idea to add the sugar and make it sort of delicious oh yeah oh yeah that's that was illustrated by my husband we do all kinds of did that yeah oh so that's not original no we read your son and heir is it becoming a dirty little self abuser stop all contemptible is this an actual text cock lane in London no but there is stop all contemptible onanism what is onanism masturbating and onanism with the infallible and modestly priced jigum penis so was that a common thing during the Victorian era so yeah you get I mean the idea that masturbating is bad for your health goes to the 18th century we kind of tend to think about it is a Victorian obsession because it becomes more and more accepted idea in medical terms but it's bad for you that it's bad for you and you get these like sort of drawings of men like languishing on the couch was it masturbated too much or a lot of dudes out there right now there can relate they just need the jiggin penis and and also there's another one I sent you Jamie I think the this sort of like looks like a flaccid penis doesn't rather once it's really high yeah they came in all shapes and sizes and oh boy yeah like now it would probably just be yeah are you supposed to pee out of that yeah maybe you could at the end of it like you have to just imagine what that thing smelled like oh Christ look at that ball at the bottom with the hook that seems super uncomfortable it's in between your legs so it must be like a hook where you could strap it in strap it in that's like a tie steel cup I don't know who's coming on the show afterwards but they got a lot of Funches good news is Ron is a hilarious comedian so we might have to redo the entire show just with Ron yeah just show me I'll just leave these objects behind and you had the cop do so it's so gross in fact you two pee out of those like a spaghetti strainer at the end of it I knew I thought you know when I was going on the show I'm like what can I bring joe rogan that's gonna you know stimulate the conversation and the anti masturbation device so he's a crowd pleaser well with men they thought that it was causing all these ailments they thought it was causing all these different problems yeah and graham crackers as well come out of that so Reverend Graham was also obsessed with masturbation just like Kellogg and so he created this sort of dry tasteless biscuit so everybody you know crumbling them into there no Wow little did he know that someone who's at s'mores now you know I don't know if it works if people feel like that that's helping them with their masturbation problems but hey leave a comment what's just crazy that people didn't most people have no idea that that was the origin of this that's what's so funny you know there's there's so many like Listerine graham crackers Kellogg corn flakes all this kind of stuff that that has sort of a medical background and wasn't there a medical background in the term hysterical that hysterical was related to women yeah the idea that the wanders like that the female womb was like an animal of it which you know and it would move the body and so you they would even do things like they would smoke it back into place they'd put like smoke they would put like incense and all kinds of things to kind of like get it like coax it back into place I can't even imagine the people are gonna start following me after this but there was there was a time where women would go to the doctor to get stimulated as well right is that true so this is like a little bit out of my expertise I think that's been proven to be false actually um but but there was I believe and I could be wrong on this that there was a Victorian idea that a woman had to orgasm in order to become pregnant yes so that was that was an important part of it I wasn't just a Victorian thing I'm pretty sure they taught me that in high school you want to get a woman pregnant part of the idea was as part of the male orgasming inside the woman was what led to her having an orgasm which would led to her getting pregnant that is weird well there was there was might have completely removed correctly again so I was probably 15 at the time well there you go but there was there was someone um I think it was like a senator Congress I live in the UK now so I'm not as with all the crazy stuff going on over here but I think there was like a senator who said this again this idea that a woman had to like orgasm it meaning undermining the idea that you couldn't be raped right unless you had an orgasm which was a Victorian I remember leave yeah I think that was really recently yeah I think it was like in the last year like I really do room I mean I have to just be like in the background popping up and like I could have like a sign that says 18th century or 19 that you know let's where did that idea come from originally and that's I do have this weird weird vague memory that that was the way that that you were taught Catalan but it's it's too weird they don't remember I don't it's it's too vague you know it does sound like I now I picture you went to like a really Victorian school it's a place called Newtons and it's suburb of Boston really nice cool nothing wrong with other other than your sex ads I'm not sure if that was they did smack our hands oh it caught us masturbate so why were people so obsessed with that while they obsess self-pleasuring yeah and I think that again you know you look at that sort of buttoned up Victorian mentality and put like dresses over the legs of pianos and chairs and stuff like they did it might be more bullshit than I remember but I really do remember something okay oh okay you know what I remember where I heard it from I heard it from Terence Mckenna it was one of the things he talked about during one of his his speeches yeah that's right we did we did fact check that I mean we like to think that that the past is really different from us which it is in some ways but you know again like we still share some similar fears and the masturbation thing actually the last thing I want to show you that I brought is this so this is this is a urine wheel that would have date to the medieval period and so the idea was that the doctor could diagnose you according to the color of your urine spoiler alert if your urines black you're probably in big trouble you robbed oh yeah and things just yeah they didn't just um look at the colour they tasted the urine is well hilarious so and they could diagnose diabetes because someone with diabetes their urine tastes sweet so they were actually diagnosing every part of of the urine in the medieval period and doctors with your they some some practitioners would take the urine and put it into a divination Bowl and they could tell your future and I think they should bring that back like you know at the end of your checkup you know not to be covered by insurance but you know okay if they test your urine and you're totally dehydrated and blood in there like yeah bro you ain't gonna make it do that well it's weird that image in the the whole circle the the center circle like that this a guy is the doctor holding the flask yes is that the doctor yep that would be the doctor holding the flat skin actually took a wine taster school taster I did a whole again a YouTube video on this which is why I have this stupid prop and we we cut through images in that image of the doctor holding the flask was sort of the predominant image of a physician up into a certain period now it's sort of like the stethoscope is the is the object now that we associate with doctors but we'll ask you stay here in flask used to be it and yeah they're called urine flask in a doctors poll younger poll and in the plague mask oh my god but they used to call them piss prophets because they they tell your fortune use your urines oh my god shit I think that is something we should bring back I think you bring that back well you know what if there's tarot card readers one as prophets yeah at least piss prophets are basing it on something yeah you know your urine into that divination Bowl I know there's so many images of the doctor holding the flask in obviously like the car of your urine could be an indicator of health it still is okay and look at the guys like what you think doc store right now look at those the band-aid around the guy's head yeah like he's hurting the guy's got a head injury in the doctor shop is the next image what was going on there oh Christ yeah actually on the barbers when they pulled teeth that sometimes they would have a drum in the shop and it would get louder as they got closer to point the tooth which would make me more ink oh my god and the barber shop was was a male domain because you would also get advice on sexual diseases because of course everybody had syphilis oh right so this is a fake nose so everybody sort of lost their noses okay so something you probably don't something you probably don't know about syphilis I don't know if we have that image of um of syphilis that I I sent poor Jamie I told your bookie manager Matt Staggs I said send these images to Jamie and don't tell him any contacts if Allah summit acts sort of the soft tissue and the image that I sent through which he'll show in a minute on the the guy has holes in his scalp as well oh wow that's a photograph that is a photograph of his head his nose though so you could just cover that with a hat oh yes but it was it was incredibly painful and you Al Capone had syphilis and so you lost your mind it attacked this long GG's brain it was really two people today you know I'll show these images on my Instagram or Twitter and people will be like wow I didn't know syphilis was so bad people died from it all the time well syphilis is also responsible for powdered wigs you know that story right no when it was I forget some noble person got syphilis and started wearing wig yeah and when they started wearing wigs other people started emulating them because they were the celebrities of the kingdom this is a drunk history is legitimate and the more wealthy you were like because syphilis makes your hair fall out as well yeah fall out yeah and so the more wealthy you were the bigger and taller your wig would be that is where the time big wigs comes from oh that's interesting I mean I knew that in the 18th century that the wigs were getting bigger is that like the fashions in fact my husband illustrated book called the gin link is that and as it's sort of like an 18th century newspaper and as the newspaper moves on the women would have to sit at the bottom of the carriage because their wigs were so high in some cases but if the women had syphilis oh my gosh after surely it would be passed on or so that's probably why they had wigs as well yeah and with syphilis you know your nose fell off and it was so prevalent in the 19th century that they had no nose clubs so people would get together yeah and they would in London they would cheer the fact that you know they couldn't smell anything either no I mean it was awful and actually one of the ways that they treated syphilis was through mercury which is and so when you talk about this uh nose Club writers and yeah I understand they were top hats and underwear yeah pull up the thing know about bigwigs so I can see do you see that one right up there oh yeah if you go up wait up Jamie and go yes so that man didn't lose his nose to syphilis but that's an early form of rhinoplasty that dates back to the Renaissance and you'd have to stay in that position for weeks while that grafted I believe this had a sakata visit for people just listening there's a slice off of his arm that's connected to his nose and they have taped and strapped his arm to the top of his head so he sustained this position while his the trunk of his arm grows into his face and then they're gonna cut it and remove it when it develops its own blood supply it's like it's like the Nick if people have watched that show the Nick on they have a scene with this so yeah it was it's so uncomfortable I'm better off with no nose yeah you might be better off and mercury of course you would lose your teeth and it just really awful kinds of things that just didn't work no and how long did that last for the mercury thing uh all the way into the 19th century and so Frasier a bunch of people died when they go hey guys no copying you know basing this on yeah okay syphilis hidden between powder ways syphilis epidemic in late 1500s year of left people with patchy hair loss go to go to the actual the who was it was what yeah so these noblemen they were all gross disgusting people with STDs what but what is the name of the guy hold on don't scroll go back up here it yeah okay there it is louis xiv only 17 his mom started thing worried the baldest might hurt his reputation Louie hired 48 wigmaker's to save his image five years later king of so but if you scroll down yes both men likely had syphilis so this is what started it all out well they were modern sensibilities like that just looks so bizarre well not only yeah I mean everything right no one's washing themselves that tries me crazy when people want to pretend there are terrible things about life today there absolutely are but this is the best time to be alive ever by far yeah people say on is this the best time medically and it's like well hopefully that's always true right hopefully tomorrow is the is better than you know hopefully we're advancing and learning more and everything I mean I think that you know we shouldn't look at science and medicine is totally linear like that we're progressing towards something um but that you know obviously we're learning from what doesn't work and like that's why I said failure is a huge part of what I love to talk about and on YouTube and stuff because we just don't talk about it enough and with and science and medicine and all the things that fail and help us get to where we are today well Lindsey thank you thank you for writing this awesome book and thank you for your amazing Twitter feed I've been spending many many many moments freaking the fuck out reading your stuff and watching your images I'm really happy you could come down here and share all this stuff with us thank you so much
