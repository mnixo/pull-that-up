you think how about promotions work yeah here we go four three two one so Tom pop and I are sitting here let's say did you see the fight on Saturday night and he said the guy that got knocked down mental health care mental health guy the guy got up for everyone with mental health he said no I didn't see the fight like they only saw I only saw that this is how narratives work yeah you know I mean like in this day and age especially there's way too much information out there right like there's no way you could see every television show or watch every sporting event or or know every scandal yeah so when something happens like the blurb that the little summary that I have absorbed my one buddy watched it on Instagram he posted a thing and it was very heartfelt that he got up for all the people of mental health yeah and I read that and I feel like I experienced the whole thing but you know it's funny I don't know if he won or lost I know he gets to draw it was a draw yeah I was drawing okay and I don't have a firm opinion on whether or not the draw was justified has I only watched it once I thought I thought that Tyson fewer won most of the rounds except the two that he got knocked down in Tyson's the anti mental health guy know he's the white guy he's the white cuz why the guy that got knocked down okay and Deontay Wilder it's his it is he's strange and that he has like the most freaky punching power I think I've ever seen ever that's what I heard it's not a big guy I mean for a heavyweight he's 212 pounds he looks pretty big oh he's jacked yeah but he shredded he has no fat on him whatsoever back is where all the powers and that's where I was his muscle is like you see his back it's just fucking just a bundle of snakes when I saw the clip it was like he'd knocked him out of them like backed up and danced Tyson got up yeah look fuck that guy Wilder punches so hard and that was in the 12th and final round that was of a fight where he was mostly losing he was mostly getting boxed up it was mostly getting out boxed but then he would land and he landed real hard and like what was like the 8th of the 9th something that some like that he dropped him but that wasn't a big knockdown right he knocked him down but he got up pretty quick and he was he was okay but in the 12th he fucking blasted him right he hit him with the right hand and then as he was falling he hit him with a left hook on the chin as he was going down like any late flat on his back with his arms down he looked unconscious yeah he really did and then he with rose like Lazarus and he looked pretty sharp when he got on his feet you want the rest of the round yeah he won the rest around the stung him yeah he stunned Deontay Wilder it was crazy because of the mental health kids yes he was doing it for the mental health people you think that's really what he was thinking when you're getting up off the canvas I'm doing it for the kid I would never doubt him yeah I mean because he really does he's he's in a very unusual guy and he donated his entire purse to charity well out of it like eight million dollars really yeah yeah he donated all of it to charity holy cow yeah that's great he's a fucking really unusual guy he's been in here he was in the podcast when he was gearing up for the fight so I should call him the super nice mental health guy he's a very nice guy very nice guy is he big like giant six nine sixty so we're sitting here you feel like he shoes a giant but he's super sweetheart you're a friendly guy geez yeah really well-spoken you know it's got that like heavy travellers accent he's a traveller had he made money before oh yeah he's a world champion so he's like he was a world champion Bank mm-hmm and I almost killed himself in a Ferrari almost committed suicide he was just headed towards a bridge he was just gonna fucking either slam into the bridge or drive off the bridge that was his yeah he was going on over 60 miles an hour like headed towards the bridge and he changed his mind look that's what he looked like before he started his comeback what yeah he was 300 pounds that's 300 plus right how much they say he was I want to say 485 yeah something crazy because he's obviously a saint 300 kilograms so yeah times 2.2 that's like that yeah oh my God he's so he was champ then he fell off and became that chubby well what happened was he beat wladimir klitschko who was a long time heavyweight champion I mean fladam correct it was there remember champ forever yeah and he al boxed him like soundly boxed him and and beat him and then was like now what and went into a depression start drinking hard partying hard a lot of cocaine and just fucked his life up just as he achieved what he won and to achieve I mean he's calling it mental health you know because of depression and all those things but I part of me wants to say that a lot of that is I mean I don't know obviously I've never been inside of his head but yeah when you're doing that much coke and drinking that much that has got to be a major factor in why you feel like shit and then yeah the letdown of this incredible achievement becoming the heavyweight champion of the world beating this guy who hadn't been beat in a long time many many many years yeah and then you know just partying too hard and then getting into a horrible funk when there's always hiding to come back there's always that part of it where you know you know that you have that there are those personalities and there's genetics involved and he gets you into the drugs but then the drugs start going to work on your brain yeah and then it you know it becomes something different becomes you know it's it's no longer your own consciousness that's working it's this sponge that just absorbed all of these toxins mm-hmm who knows what's misfiring what's happening at that point we say that as we drink wine GSG holidays holidays whatever little fucking myth I was gonna bring you some wine today this was nice of you to open this it's just good stuff whatever this is I don't know jack shit about wine I learned a great method for Thanksgiving about wine what's up I went to this place in LA it's called 2020 wine it's like this it looks like writer this is the Lost Ark it's on the on the 405 and you just walk in it's just wine this huge room racks and stuff it's so elegant it's just like this great place to be it's cool it's like temperature-wise it's like it's great and it's intimidating because they have you know I don't know that much about wine I want to but and I realized this this is my strategy and it worked out perfectly I went to the guy who works there and I said look I have 12 people coming over for Thanksgiving show me a $20 bottle of wine or less that I can buy a bunch of for my friends that's gonna blow everyone away and he lit up like a Christmas tree it's like this is what he wants to do it's like yeah there's 200 bottle dollar bottles of wine we know what that is I'm gonna come with me and there it is and he took me into the back in he found these he's like this one's from Spain $18 no one knows it exists the best wine I've had all year another one of this Italian Barolo that nobody knows about and look at this it's only $12 a bottle because nobody knows we have extra cases it became like his of course that's what a wine guy wants to do right one is the wine thing that a name is just as important as how good it is sure yeah like when people you know an Opus one or Camus or like we all know that because that's like the Mercedes of wines cigars are like that as well I know more about cigar I don't know much about cigars but I know more about cigars that I know about wine uh-huh and like everybody wants Cuban oh yeah Q Cohiba wants something that's hard to get yeah but this was I was like oh this is how you should do it find a good wine shop and go to the guy who's waiting to be asked that question yeah and he's so excited to show you what he learned and he works in a wine shop so he's not spending $500 a for a bottle either me and shit my buddy mark Telegraaf a and I were in Florida we're eating this very nice Italian restaurant with a bunch of people from the UFC yeah we just said let's get a nice bottle of wine you ever have a nice bottle of wine I'm like I've had good bottles of wine but this place had like bought bottles one from the 70s right so I said all right let's go fucking crazy and I bought a bottle wine from 1974 oh my god this is better this is bad this one's better it was like it was weird like I guess if you're a real connoisseur like part of it is like Roberto Duran was the champ when this was bottled it was like it felt like it had less alcohol and I think that's a one of the things that maybe happens the the flavor source to morph and change it just felt less potent yeah almost more watered-down it wasn't that good well there's there's didn't I enjoyed it but I didn't love it right and that you know and you probably paid a lot for it was like a thousand dollars yeah I'm not joking yeah I think it was a thousand-dollar bottle one I'm telling you this to my Thanksgiving we had it was $18 bottles of wine probably blowing our heads off yeah probably way better so great yeah they're there you know I try and learn about it and there are certain wines they say like there's certain Brunello that like those should age and those you can go like 20 years and you know if they'll get even better at 30 and then there's other wines at that same amount of time they'll go sour and they'll get funky so it's so hard to tell perhaps Yap that I have I've never fucking opened at once but I downloaded it it's like vinhos of me you know who you almost went down with that it's got a powerful lid nice cuz that was like headed towards the board James name he's not even drinking I don't fuck with laptops in front of me anymore I've learned my lesson I was doing a show on Saturday my friend had a laptop she had a glass of water on and a salad on like the keyboard like what do you do like having a gun on your baby's head separate it yeah no but this was this was such a great way to do it I mean there's so like you can focus in on one kind of wine and really kind of learn it and that's a lot like that would be a lot of studying to learn all of wine and like go into a fancy restaurant and be like I'm just gonna pick from the met you can right right you know yeah I think it's like it's one of those things where you have to you really have to talk to someone who's put in the time yes totally yeah that's yeah my place here's something that I know a lot about pool cues right I know a lot about pool cues okay so if you come to me and even you say hey I'm thinking about buying this pool cue what do you think okay well here's what you need to know like that's that's a very expensive pool cue and it's expensive because collector's item because the guy who makes it is dead however in terms of like how it plays it does not play any better than a pool cue that cost one small fraction of what that costs and I could turn you on to a bunch of custom pool cue makers make a really good cue for like a fraction of what you would pay for that cue and I'm telling you like you would play with this cue and be happy with it for the rest of your life but it will cost you you know five hundred dollars as opposed to this cues that are fifteen thousand twenty thousand dollars and up really ornate and and and beautiful one and this is a lifetime your adult lifetime of learning about oh man you've been immersed I started playing pool in nineteen ninety ish 91 1991 that's when I probably bought my first pool cue what's it known as what's a good pool cue for bumper pool my neighbors had a bumper pool table when I was a kid it was badass it's the older brother Mark he was the dominant one because he was able to jump it over the bumpers and get on the yeah the jumping is a very controversial thing in the world of pool you're not allowed to jump well you can't but attack there's jumping and then there's bar table jumping right like when you play with people on a bar they think they're jumping in the pool cue but what they're doing is they're scooping under the cue ball with their tip like they go under it and it sort of makes the cue ball pop up in the air it's really like yeah miss cueing is what it's like wow the way you're supposed to jump a ball is shoot down on it and make it hop over uh-huh that's my jam have you seen this before yeah that's a McDermott it's like called the Excalibur or some shit like that that's a pool cue it is but it's foolish it looks like a sickle that the Grim Reaper comes together with well this was a cue that was made a long time ago was made back in the fucking 90s or something but that's not the most expensive pool cue in the world is that whole thing the Q 450 that's not the most expensive Q in the world no no the most expensive Q in the world is Gina Q Gina Q is actually right here in North Hollywood that's they call it the most expensive Q in the world is that whole thing the Q it's nonsense that's nice stand in a queue see it's a queue that hold all the blades and everything like that what would you do with not that it's nonsense I'm telling you it's not it's nonsense it's like having a car and you decide to glue diamonds on that q weighs nine and a half pounds I say you know what a real Q weighs a ha a very heavy Q very heavy yeah these 21 ounces like if you play with it like if you find out that a pro plays with 21 cubic while that's a rarely a guy will play with a 24 ounce Q like wow that guy's crazy what was the thing is nine and a piece of shit that's like the the women that get the the gigantic hefty hippity-hop s-- for boobs it's getting bigger than that when you're like okay like triples yeah that's not a real pool cue what's the one in North Hollywood did well he makes genic is his name is Ernie could Terrace and he makes all swords I have one of his cubes oh yeah that's Ernie right there look he makes I mean it wasn't me married to share know that Sonny Bono I was dead you're an asshole I got in this podcast now Ernie is I mean he's like a real innovator in the world of pool cues he makes beautiful beautiful beautiful but he had one that he made that was filled with like I don't want to say what the material was but I believe it on eBay every handle the handle was made out of solid ivory had gold and all sorts of other shit in it but it went for a half a million dollars it's worth a half a million dollars but I think the deal is that he won't sell it he's very wealthy that's really well all that well for me oh yeah yeah his his pool cues like in Japan and also all throughout Asia they're really revered like he can sell his stuff anywhere his cues are very expensive on the aftermarket too it makes them all by hand like that kind of thing well he designs them all and then he uses computer-controlled machines they're called CNC machines to put everything together and piece it so that everything's perfect Wow yeah but they're all like his designs and that like 3d printing no no it's it's what it is it's like you have a design and you put it into this computer and you you put the spec I don't know a hundred percent of the process but right you put your the specifications like how why do you want inlays to be and and they make them exactly the same size and the points fit exactly the same way Wow yeah that's all that's a super complicated stuff but the point is like if you were a guy who wanted to buy a pool cue and you just you know went to a website you rang your you're lost you lost like me trying to buy wine in a wine shop yeah exactly yes where yeah this is good wine though what is it this is new I didn't know you spoke French I do see fit Paris is going crazy right yeah you've been having these crazy riots no what's up every time I think about it visit in Paris there's some new shit that goes down over there I know it's kind of feels like a little like like a jewel box that is about to explode is it's not good is it workers we're gonna write it well the weird thing is everyone is riding is wearing those reflective vests what like see that yeah that works right now yep they're wearing these yellow reflective vests and lighting things on fire and smashing stores so like who is go change these protesters they've been going scroll back ups with my silent says 17 pictures oh it's terrible and it keeps getting worse it keeps getting worse I mean started November 17th when French drivers supporting yellow vests led a demonstration apparently has to do with oil prices rising rising fuel prices 280,000 people four people have died hundreds have been injured thousands of dollars where the property has been damaged the protest has started November 17th when French drivers sporting yellow vests led a demonstration of two hundred thousand people across the country to push back against the rising taxes on gas and diesel Act French president Emmanuel macron I love a nice Mike Rome as part of his many economic reforms announced the gas taxes early this year to minimize France's reliance on fossil fuels that's a fucking shitty way handle you know reliance on fossil fuels you do the opposite you cunt face well you don't charge people money you know you don't charge people extra money and make it more expensive than those unless you give them subsidies for electric cars you stupid prick yes don't you understand the American Way piece of shit I love talking like well authoritative about things I know what does it say let's go back to where it was the price of fuel that's it 30 cents a gallon they went crazy 30 cents a gallon trying to kill people gas already cost about $7 per gallon Wow fuck yeah so it's just gonna break people's backs and they no dry bread John Bush was leaving office and they jacked the fucking price of gas way up yeah dude there's people that were panicking yeah you know September 11th reclines everywhere all right and I just empty yeah but the price didn't I don't think the price rattling went up some places were charged like 25 bucks a gallon but that's that's kind of insane like that people used to have riots like that when when we would spike and people couldn't eat well I'll give you this they like in cars oh my god that's a shitty little car anyway he's not even part of the protests he's just me about this somebody was telling me about this I was at a little kids party I was talking one of the dads and he was telling me about this thing that happened this I think it was in Northern California it was a fire fuck it might not have been Northern California was a fire and initially they thought it was just a fire but then the CEO and his vice-president were both of their houses caught fire mm-hmm so then they thought it was like an attack on both people then they realized no it was a murder and one of the guys killed the guy and his family and then lit his house on fire and then went back to his house and lit his own house on fire make it look like they were going after both of them and he's the only one that survived yeah whoops that just happened in New Jersey a guy he's in New Jersey maybe that was it a guy murdered his whole family no his own family yeah and then lit the house on fire then maybe that's it maybe I'm getting a fucked-up version of the story I get drunk at kid parties to family Massacre disguises a massive fire New Jersey yeah that's it this is the story so um make that a little larger please it says there was more than a brotherly bond between Paul and Keith yeah that's right part of New Jersey versus vacation together and settled about 11 miles from each other in the suburbs in New Jersey but two days before Thanksgiving a horrific chain of events would forever tear them apart hos brother yeah that's what it is so I had a really fucked-up person say that name Canario quiero Kenny Kenny Kenny arrow became brothers killing his youngest brother his sister-in-law and their children oh this is what's fucked up like what what how does a guy go from never killing anybody to killing a wife and daughter so he killed his brother mm-hmm and his brothers whole family yeah oh my I thought he's no his own then he set his home home on fire with his wife and daughter inside tried to make it look as if the whole family been targeted his family got out of the home safely can you imagine the panic like what the fuck just murdered these people you don't go back go back you light your own house on fire you're like can you imagine like while you're lighting your house on fire thinking like the the intensity of this is gonna work I'm gonna get out of this this is where the plan goes and poof well it's really fun how does a person kill I mean I understand you're mad at a guy and you fucking hate each other fuck you fuck you and you start fighting and then you wind up killing each other how do you kill his wife and daughters how do you do that how what like what switch goes on like is he just trying to yeah because he's just walking around go back up it says it's killed his sister-in-law it said he's accused excused of killing his younger brother his sister-in-law and their children like how many children like who would he killed kids yes so this guy was never murdered anybody just walking around Colts Neck Township New Jersey yeah he's a business man probably never done anything really major in his life right probably like was that a like a business meeting yeah two days before with some guy what the fuck man just living his life talking about the Giants like what the fuck what is that his wife and his two daughters Oh several twists in the case of look at that look at that he then allegedly set his own home on fire with his wife and his daughters inside did you not hear me say that I thought you were talking about his his brother's family no no he killed his brother and family set the house on family on fire then lit his own house on fire to make it look like he was being targeted I knew that but I didn't know his he had kids in him his wife and his daughters were inside oh my god to try to make it look as if his whole family's being targeted his brother and him oh my god his family got out of the home safely Wow fucking unbelievable think about his kids right now we're like what did dad what yeah what Jesus Christ he oh my god was killed before sunrise scroll up there somewhere between midnight and 5:00 a.m. Paul Kenny arrow was walking around his brother's 1.5 million dollar Colts Neck home armed with a knife and a gun yeah brother's been in front of the white mansion when a deadly confrontation unfolded Paul fired multiple shots striking Keith fucking hey when you got mad at me for not following the story clearly did you feel like you could kill me Jesus Christ he walked inside found his wife's found Keith's wife Jennifer he shot and stabbed her and then stabbed their children Jessie 11 and Sophia 8 what then he took some documents and set a fire in the basement what were they doing like the week he fuckin stabbed an 8 year old dude an 8 year old girl in her sleep how - fuck - someone in her sleep it say in her sleep well it was 5 a.m. doesn't matter man he's there's gunshots in the house yeah I might have gotten up oh my god good lord what a monster a monster what was this guy like the month before like what the hell look at that normal-looking house shit that is the normal akin normal house ever do you believe that there is an always a presence of good and evil in the world like that it's not just evil deeds what this guy did was evil but do you believe that there is a real presence of evil that it's like a thing that takes over people or takes over you know what I mean like like like but good and evil is that more than just people's actions or is it like a force of nature is there a good force of nature and an evil force of nature that is constantly using people and using things as as a catalyst or as a okay instrument let's break this down I don't think nature is the right way to approach it because I don't think there's good or evil in nature and the nature nature is actually far more moral than humans are because what with nature is just about survival right redditors and prey and they kill things neat things but when animals in nature kill like what they call surplus killings werewolves will kill like 18 elk and not not eat them they're just they're just going on their instincts these things are there to be killed and they they can get them because they can't run away maybe it's thick snow or something like that so they just can't help it they just tear them apart because their instincts are they drive them to kill because that's how they survive that's other family survives their killing and their eating these elk and this is just what they do and even if they kill a bunch of them where they can't eat them their instinct is to kill because that's how they survive it's natural it's normal with humans it's very different because with humans there's consequences right and there's law and there's other humans finding out so there's deception and then there's there's selfishness and there's the the fear of getting caught and then there's your own you our own survival instincts internally you don't want to get locked up in jail you don't want to get caught for something mm-hmm so I think if I had a guess that this guy didn't think he was gonna kill this guy's wife and family probably didn't think he was gonna kill this guy they probably got into a heated argument and they they're stupid and he you know he's a Guinea he's that's my people yeah they did you stupid your people to can tiara they do stupid shit you know they're their fiery people and those those fiery people I swore off Italian girls when I was 21 a tiny girl take a swing at me when I was 21 I was like that's it for me I'm done some some look at something yeah and some women are fucking crazy and I believe in epigenetics you know I see how wacky my fucking own kids are what's epidemic epigenetics well let's Google so I don't bust up the the actual definition but essentially it's the way I'm using it is that there's certain traits that are not just environmental traits they're inherited traits and that you hear will pull them right the study the changes in organisms caused by the modification of gene expression rather than the alteration of the genetic code itself mmm this very there's better words than that there's better better definitions than that the study of heritable changes in gene expression there you go active versus inactive genes that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence a change in the phenotype without a change in the genotype which in turn affects how cells read the genes oh great now I know less about it I think there's traits and this is this is a very this is a very controversial yet very fascinating field of study because what they're doing is they're they're finding out that children that are twins that are separated by you know when they're babies right they go into different foster homes and they're raised by different families have incredibly remarkably similar characteristics lives loves desires like what they're interested in incredibly similar yeah and they're suspecting that a lot of the information of nature and nurture I think that's safe to say mm-hmm and I think that they're you certainly a lot of things happen to kids when they're young that shaped their life whether it's physical or sexual abuse whether it's exposure to violence or whether it's positive things like love and encouragement and and inspiration but there's certain information I think that's transferred from the parent to the child while the child is in the womb and when during during the conception of the child I think there's traits that come from the father and traits that come from the mother biological biologically and I think this is undeniable across species and I think this is why dogs like my dog has no fucking idea who his parents are he doesn't give a shit he's not looking for is that on 23:9 me doc exactly I grab that leash and he's like we run it today there and his what are you doing there it's so watched it yet three identical strangers no I have it but it's it's about this exact very thing right yeah did you watch it no I've started to like watch the trailers and stuff but it was a good way to come on Netflix oh it's all in that flex your dog's like wonder what my dad's doing now yeah why did he leave me homeschooler in the woods no but he's got certain instincts like he lifts up his leg to piss on things yeah I smells things like the end and he chases squirrels like there's there's things that are in he's a retriever right he's a golden retriever so he brings things back I mean that I had pit bulls before and they'll bring things back but you got to teach them right they don't want to bring things back and they definitely don't want to let go right they want to do is play tug of war with shit like but he lets things go and it's like natural for him that soft mouth yes yeah yes the same thing they hold things gently because they're used to retrieving ducks and animal and pheasants that people shoot that's what they were raised for yeah so he brings things back like when I get him up in the morning right yeah he stays in this little room and when I get up in the morning at 7:00 to you know take my kids of schooling all that stuff like when I open up the door he whines like crazy he gets crazy grabs his tail so how do you see the first thing does is to pick up a toy yeah Percy he picks up a stuffed in when it comes to me with the stuffed animal in his mouth like they say this is not something that we taught him yeah but this is some and golden retrievers all around the world doing the same exactly all around the world all right or the same exact thing there's certain traits yeah they've and I believe that Italians my people yeah my people I'm not saying this I - yeah and yours - I'm mostly Italian they're savage folk this is just a fact man yeah it's a fact there's there's a streak there's a streak it goes back to the Romans that's what I really absolutely 100% believe yeah and that I think there are certain civilizations that have a longer history of being civilized and and less violence and I think when you are were you dealing with folks that have in a real history of violence mmm in their culture and that this translates generation to generation and transfers down to the children right and I think this guy is part of that I mean it's like there's not it's not a coincidence that the Italian mob so ruthlessly brutal or the Russian mob so he asked me brutal excuse me no for sure there's definitely that part of it and then there's the other part of it that like you said there's there's the nurture part of it who knows what was going on in this guy's life that you know okay so here we have two Italian brothers right yeah raised the same way Italian a hot streak all this thing and then one brother together one Brotherhood decided to burn the house down and slaughter the family the other Italian guy didn't have that in his to-do list but not necessarily because I don't know if they planned it out or if he did it just because I mean he had a knife on him in a gun maybe he's almost crazy asshole that brought a knife and a gun everywhere who the fuck know who knows but they were in business together and you know people in business together it's not they get crazy and they get real resentful and you know they think one person is not doing their fair share or one person fucks up a deal or one person's costing the money and yeah now who knows but how the fuck do you kill each other so there's a baby man how do you stab an eight-year-old daughter will you take it in your hand yeah I have no idea but the Italians also like wine more wine please one of these 0% alcohol Heineken he's supposed to be the most delicious I've never had it but we will try one of these it's supposed to be the most delicious non-alcoholic beer not recommended they said that if you want to try I'll try non-alcoholic beer that doesn't suck get this Heineken zero zero so Heineken zero zero it's very the shit tastes like Heineken does there's literally no difference pretty damn good for non-alcoholic beer doesn't have that weird I'm lying to myself funk to it yeah it doesn't have that weird aftertaste if I was a junkie mm-hmm I would not want to try yeah it tastes just like it will drink non-alcoholic beer walk into a liquor store buy this you literally the gate of hell and the fucking demons are reached let me just test myself people who are clean are cool with taking CBD like is that mmm okay question well the marijuana thing is different because I think for the vast majority of human beings obviously there's a lot of biological diversity but for the vast majority of human beings I do not think that marijuana is physically addictive I think it's entirely possible that for some people it is but I think for the vast majority people it is not physically addictive it's more psychologically addictive so I think it's a different thing so if they're taking CBD with their I mean it depends on how they're taken if they're rolling up a CBD joint do they do that yeah okay but but doesn't some CBD have a little bit of too some of it well this shit has the tiniest amount of alcohol it says alcohol free but I think it's like what are the county row 0.04 alcohol-free beer with natural flavoring do you know Heineken is one of the few beers that you can drink if you are a celiac it does not have wheat it's not a wheat based beer so if you're gluten-free uh-huh you can drink Heineken oh maybe not if you're celiac but definitely if you're gluten-free that's not bad yeah I like it it's not bad at all it's not bad for the Haller ease of standard half the couch of a standard beer so those other calories of just pure alcohol I guess yeah right what if there's like a you know there's one episode of the Opie and Anthony show oh my god I forgot about this we gave this gal who they had this thing was her name was stalker patty I think that was really and we gave this crazy that you know how radio shows have these regulars yeah always come Western yeah yeah well they gave this one gal a breath strip like a standard Listerine breast strip and this is back in the day when I used to get pot breath strips that would they would fuck you up so hard I remember I gave a half a one to Thompson girl and we flew to Florida to do gigs together and by the time we landed it's like dude I want to tell you something I almost didn't make it almost telling these people to turn this plate around half of a breast chip would put you over an alternative dimension it was so strong so we gave this gal a regular breast trip there's a video of it online about oh it's like an hour long yeah yeah that had no so yeah had no weakness so Ari gave her this breath strip and then Ari proceeded to like to talk to her and she was like talking about Ojai she was she's so fun I couldn't go anywhere but we all knew that she was sober that's but then how she was when you're a person who's a like a whack packer right look this is hot chance or something is an issue that's not being resolved yes frankly it's not a yes widow a naturalized human being that would be the de this is not an actual a human right there's not someone's got their shit together though they're reading self-help books and fucking getting up at five and doing yoga no no no they're just trying to get through the day they're barely getting through I found this thing that makes them that they cling to yeah it's those characteristics are fascinating to me because you saw you find them in other things I mean you those characteristics of these people that find something to belong to and then they become a thing they become a part of that thing you would find those people at pool halls you find those people at martial arts places you find those people that hang out at comedy clubs it's like they're a little off but they find a thing yeah that becomes their the thing that they do all the time even if they're not like the comedian they'll hang out at the comedy right right we know those folks right for sure and I don't I totally get it I mean that's community yes I just want to belong somewhere we all want that thing just that's where I go and I know those faces and they know me and maybe I'm not totally a part of it but I can go to the pool hall and yes feel like I went I was wanted on my clothes the pool hall was a perfect place for that because it was a hangout like a lot of people weren't playing right if you had like three or four tables going there like so three or four tables would be like six or eight people playing pool but there might also be five or six people just hanging out maybe playing cards maybe right you know buying coffee and maybe ordering a sandwich or something like that I'm just sitting there eating it's important you know that that's I was reading a whole article about that by David Brooks the other day and he was saying that that's that uh economically were richer than we've ever been as a country and even in the last couple of years like poor people like everyone's standard of living has gone up which I wasn't really clear on I thought that you know only the rich people were doing we're getting richer but everybody was kind of being lifted up but were unhappier than ever before and the life expectancy is lower than ever before and we're killing ourselves at rates that are higher than ever before and he was saying that it's that lack of community that we don't go to church anymore we don't belong to those things that gave us meaning every day in our town and used to go to church you'd go to the pool hall or you go to that you need that sense of belonging and work is a big part of it and people now are in this gig economy and they're working over there working seamless they're doing different things they're isolated they're by themselves and I'm working with other people and it's he really believes that it's that lack of community and that lack of institutions is why we're very very unhappy as a as a country right now it makes sense to me it makes sense to me as a person who's a part of a vital community mm-hmm as a comedian you know like Jeff Ross was here the other day with Dave Attell and one of the things that he said that really struck with me he said I almost feel like I'm a comedian more than I'm an American I'm liking a comedian first Latin American second right I was like yeah yeah you if you're at the airport and you you know you run into Dave Attell or whoever it is yeah like it's like that's like there's a light upon them yams down from heaven exactly one of mine yeah hey yeah yeah you just embrace them that's why I always would always get suspicious of comics who didn't embrace me like as soon as you said I'm like I was like there's something more with this guy yeah yeah something like core comics that don't have any comic friends yeah there's very weirdos they're fucking real strange and they're always super selfish okay it's yeah I can't even like figure out exactly what it is but I'm just like I know that's not one of the good ones yeah especially if someone's like a successful comedian oh yeah that's really weird like you have the opportunity to hang out some of the most fun people in the war oh my god you're a peer of theirs and you give them a pass it's like family it's like no if I I did this gig in uh in Colorado once and just by chance it was like this corporate thing and there was another comic on the bill who I won't mention and I was like oh that's cool we're in the middle of like nowhere and at least there's another comedian here yeah he did a set split didn't talk to me just like there was no I was like I was like you're your dog like hey let's play let's play hey split I was like are that guy's weird that guys there's something and I am it's true I think it's less common now than it was back in the day and this is another thing that I talked about with with Jeff and Dave was we were talking about camaraderie that there's there's less competition now there ever was before me even before there was only a limited number of Tonight Show slots there was a limited number of sitcoms you could be on and that's what everybody wanted everybody wanted their own sitcom yeah everybody wouldn't be on The Tonight Show there very few of those very few yeah and everybody was competing for these very limited slots and there are very few HBO specials there was not there wasn't a lot and there was a lot of us and so it led to a lot of like jealousy a lot of clawing and scratching right now thanks to many things thanks to the internet thanks to YouTube initially then podcast and then Netflix it seems like the world is our oyster there's so much yeah all you have to do is put out good content totally and you could have your own audience and you could have his own audience yeah she could have hers yeah and all exist without having to purr poach each other's audiences yeah and you know I promote like in the beginning of if you're listening to this on YouTube it's not on it because it's something that I do in the beginning of the audio version of it but I'm always talking about people's specials that are out like then now the bumping mic special with Dave and Jeff Ross is out now they're not paying me to say that Netflix is another ham and you say that yeah yeah special with a christina pazsitzky special they're not paying me to say that yeah I'm saying that because these people are all my friends and I want them to prosper yeah I want everything new I want them to I think they're great and I want everybody to know that this is great stuff and if you if you're a fan of comedy I want to help you yeah fine it's like I want to be that guy the wine store going hey yeah you want to see an $18 bottle wine that I'm not your dick of it well more people now than ever Bo yeah yeah no I know he's the best ever never I've never seen anybody that makes me laugh harder I don't know if I if I enjoy him as much as I want as much as I enjoy how much you enjoy him it really is such a great thing just watching you guys when he's going off and you're laughing at him it's just it's like I could watch that all day I feel so thankful he's so real he's such a I mean he's just one of yeah he's so real especially if I have a buzz I got about a couple drinks smoke a little weed you know watch Joey I'm so thankful I'm just like so thankful there's a guy like that out there in my opinion he's that the leader of the charge because he's the most reckless and wild and many evil yeah so now now that he did that Netflix special oh my god you go see him people he is a fucking monster right now he's like he's peeking he's better than he was before and he was the best before now it's such a great thing like when you go to any club and then you come in and you just see whatever random people are there you know my wife was a comedian before we had kids and the first thing she wants to ask she asked when I come back is who who was there who did you see and it's like oh he's so Steve Byrne I saw the whatever and she's like oh she wants right because she doesn't she's not part of the community like she is but she doesn't get to visit yeah so it's like she misses that sense and we're very lucky to have that yeah as grown men to be able to like walk into this very fun community that you're a part of yeah gives you meaning it gives you a sense of belonging and that's what a lot of people don't have nowadays it's very like according to David Brooks that's the reason for everybody is malaise I think there's certainly something to that I think it's weird living in places where you don't know your neighbors you know and that's that's fucking weird I mean yeah Norton was telling me that he lives in this big apartment building in New York City and I think he said I mean it's got to be hundreds of people living in that bill he's huge huge building yeah I know where he is he doesn't know anybody we're it says no it doesn't know anybody says you try to say hi to his neighbor they look at him like he's a fucking murderer nobody's friendly to anybody yeah this is so weird they're like you're too loud stop making noise that's what everybody does to be will bang on the door bang a floor back in the rukon flicked yeah it's a weird thing and it's weird you know my youngest wants to go to church and how old 13 hmm and cuz friends what is maybe she has more of a she says more of a sensitivity and like she knows there's something other that there's something spiritual going on or mushrooms I think that might have been what kick the whole thing on and she's just she's searching a little bit right and she wants that she likes being able to sit someplace and and we go and it's not like when I was a kid like when I was a kid and we were Catholic the place was packed like you couldn't find parking like it was like it was a big deal that my father would be like we're going early come on get out of I'm not walking from the back and it was like a big thing now it's like you kind of roll up it's half full and there's nobody there and it's you know of course the Catholic Church has a lot of problems and but I think but every but every what do you mean my problem with you know all these religions have had a little kerfuffle no they haven't they have a lot like the Catholic Church now the Catholic Church is the worst it's the worst but I know but don't let me get sight okay but the the thing is we know so much now and we're able to see that all these institutions are flawed right that there's problems with all of them we used to people used to think my grandmother just thought church is the best and this is the best when they didn't ask questions you know now we know everything and we know that all these institutions are flawed and I think we're making the mistake that you can't be a part of a political party you can't be a part of a community you can't be a part of thing if it's not perfect but that's not a way to live you gotta kind of be a little ignorant if you're gonna show up you got to kind of not be ignorant but allow things to be flawed or start a new one go on yeah I mean the the right way to address the issues of a flawed institution and not just to accept them but to try to create a new institution that doesn't have as many flaws maybe that's not what we did but what our founding fathers did when they establish the United States of America the idea was to establish a place where you have an experiment in self-government and that's never existed before in the world and this is what the United States represents to the rest of the world outside of us yeah I mean this is what we again I keep saying we it's not a wheat but with the people that establish the United States dead was they broke the mold as to how a world superpower or a country it wasn't exist but how a country could exist and then that country I mean I don't think it's a coincidence that out of just a couple hundred years that country emerged the greatest superpower of the world's ever known mmm-hmm I think that freedom allows unprecedented activity in terms of innovation in terms of creativity and not being suppressed and not being in total fear for your life for any form of dissent mmm-hmm so any and this is this goes back to not just religion but any sort of any group yeah any any any group that's in control of any sort of a situation as soon as you suppress all the other people mm-hmm you you limit their ability to contribute right right and this is what is existed all throughout Europe and would existed all throughout Asia all throughout the rest of the world yeah when the United States came along and then when the United States came along all the sudden you have this unprecedented development and growth in this one place where people are allowed to be free yeah where we support free expression we support free religion each for freedom of religion and we separate church and state yeah and this is one of the reasons why these things are so important so when you get like religious fundamentalist wackos that say this is country was founded on Christian values that doesn't matter and doesn't matter if you're a peaceful Muslim if you're a peaceful Buddhist if you're a peaceful Mormon whatever the fuck it is we should all embrace each other we should allow each other a hundred percent freedom and as soon as someone starts restricting that freedom and restricting people's ability to express themselves you run into real problems because then you don't let these things play out in their natural order you don't let ideas play out where people get to examine those ideas yeah and change like look if you look at some of the more suppressive areas of the Middle East the real problem is that these people live not just as many real problems but one of the real problems is people live in fear so there's no real freedom of and there's also this real desire for conformity his real desire to establish that you are a part of the group that is one of the good ones that's going to abide by the rules and you are going to show everyone else that you were a part of this group whether it means throwing gay people off buildings or throwing rocks at women or soldiers all that stuff I was just gonna say like your life actually depends on usin for me yes I was with my friend the other day who's gay and he was saying that you're a gay friend he just stopped the show one just come on come on and it really how close he's close comes over your house so close whoa I didn't realize he can't go to half of the planet as an open gay man oh yeah he can't go to Russia he can't go to all of the Middle East there's parts of age like they will kill you yeah if you're gay in those areas I mean talk about I mean right what's gonna make a city flourish then gay people coming in with bold ideas let's go I mean I saw them changed parts of New York like it was nobody's business well and also I think that like the the the what's great about gay folks is when gay folks are embraced and they're allowed to be themselves oh my can express that and then you get to see that like there's a there's such a giant spectrum of the way people behave and think in the things that they love and if you don't allow people to express their position on that spectrum then you don't even know it exists right then you create all sorts of deviance because you know you're forcing them into some unnatural pattern which is one of the things that I think about the Catholic Church I think part of the problem is that these people are suppressed sexually like incredibly suppressed not just suppressed in terms of their whether they're homosexual or heterosexual but there's no sex you're not allowed to have any sex right yeah so how's it gonna come out it's fucking insane it's like sin saying in denial of the fact that you need to drink water and it's so upsetting because I'm really kind of searching a little bit because I was raised Catholic and I did like going I have what she has I did like going and sitting in the pew on Sunday was different from the other days and I yes so here people talk about being nice to each other and I got to see the people from my town who you saw running around but now they're just sitting there quietly and praying there was goodness to it and they went out and fed the homeless there was good stuff that came from it and she wants that I get that and now you're sitting in an institution though then you know the backstory of what's going on it's you know how do you sit there yeah how do you sit there so I'm said to her last night we should just go to yoga satisfy your spiritual side right but their wacky to man I mean oh look I go to a Bikram yoga I go to hot yoga yeah 90 minute hot yoga and that guy I don't think he's allowed to come in this country no he's the guy who made Bikram now know that I do not think he's a best case he got a little rapey well he definitely got a little he took advantage of his privilege his position our well yeah I guess you could say power but the reverence that people had towards him yeah they felt like he was a guru and so he would get these girls alone yeah and he would make him suck his dick or whatever right but I think see now this I'm getting this is very dangerous waters but I was having a conversation with a woman who is a she's actually an instructor and she said listen that guy is definitely creepy but let me tell you something a lot of those girls not only knew what he was about but they wanted to be with him mm-hmm they wanted to be with him because of his power and because he represented something special to them and then when he just like shot a load in their mouth and then kicked him to the curb then they became angry and decided they were molested they went into it willingly I do not know if she's accurate or inaccurate it was I was not there and I'm not a woman yeah but I do know that people have like I remember women throwing nothing themselves but making it like very clear that they were they had deep admiration for my martial arts instructor when I was when I was a young kid and I was practicing Taekwondo yeah I remember these women they were so in awe of my martial arts instructor because he represented the master of something that they were deeply enamored by mm-hmm and I think that's also what happens with these yoga people yeah it's seductive yes you know it's seductive you know there's and and also with something like that it's very physical and mental and spiritual it's it's sexual its sexual like yoga is yeah look I've never had any sex with anybody but I'm telling you when everybody's in there sweating and and mistake 'add I'm wearing these little fucking shorts and the girls wearing these little schwartz and and the teacher goes around and she like calls you out it's like oh she likes me yes I can understand how some of those people get intimate with each other after this is all over because they're they're so close to being naked and sweating together right you know and your friend is right in that there were some women I'm sure who wanted to be with him yes but it's he's not dismissing any rapey shit either but it's his responsibility because he has the power and knows what he's wielding like in a workplace kind of thing it's up to you to be the woman puts the brakes on it that's where it gets interesting yes he does not seem to think that he does have any responsibility at all for the people that are working for him teaching these classes and Jeff like he was right he did this HBO documentary was fucking they did this HBO interview about him it was so ridiculous this is the Bikram guy yeah yeah he goes there a woman that will pay 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm he says this see we can find the video so he's fully aware crazy crazy yeah he was he was dismissing the idea that he would ever sexually assault anyone he's like why would I do that when these women that will pay 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm well it wasn't yeah why it wasn't yeah it wasn't Bryant Gumbel wasn't there did I think they're discussing it right they're discussing this out of that comment you got to see the guy because he looks like because he said the comment to a woman and she was like this she was like what in the fuck did you say [Laughter] HBO's very Kramer breaks down million dollars per interview shit do you say where people go wait yeah holy shit yeah there's some things that are it's calling that you would call beyond the pale yeah I love just seeing picked you hear these stories then you see him he's like you're like grandpa he's like all loose skinned and he's balding and but that's the thing it's like when you're in a power of a powerful position like that he's a very spiritual and people will pay 1 million dollars what does it say from being circumspect a real sport the 7 year old went off on a rant claiming 5,000 women a day want to sleep with him four have committed suicide over his charms and people would pay 1 million dollars for a drop of his sperm see now I read a few lives in that world I would just shoot loads every day and then retire if you if you just drank ate a lot of sink a lot of zinc and like what makes loads oysters celery yeah really yes our vegan nonsense now began the celery adds to the pop celery people that's like some fucking celery Lobby no it's true celery does how do you know I remain red something porn people right mmm celery yeah celery you know what's Jamie got here oh here it is lying the most beautiful famous rich women in the world you have to sleep with women then have to sleep you know 5000 girl every day she cried thousand women a day want to sleep with you decided four of them you're saying that for different women for different women each killed himself because you wouldn't have sex well don't why I am harassing women people's pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm million-dollar-a-day every drop and that idiot are dumb to believe those trash to women at the trash yep I picked them from trash and give them life oh my god it looks pretty good for a 70 year old oh my god the last very long yeah get it dry up real quick yeah they get gross do you know why an oh man yeah so that spiritual thing like the heads but that's yeah yeah it's like the problem with it is you're still an animal right so if they have it's like we were talking about before where the Wolves gone these surplus kills and they kill all these elk and they don't eat them yeah again Wyoming there was a recent issue there was a teen elk that were killed by wolves and these surplus killings the real tragedy yeah these wolves can't help themselves it's just their instincts so his instincts as a man he has instincts to procreate right his instincts to respond to women that are sexually attracted to him and he teaches these classes in front of hundreds and thousands of people and everybody loves and adores him so in his fucked up twisted brain yeah everything that he said there made sense my favorite part of it was that woman Andrea when she when she clarified yes so you're saying you're saying four women have committed to it like I want this motherfucker has to be clear his nonsense there he is she doesn't change her expressions she's just like so you're saying yeah I mean look at that girl right now he's standing on top of a woman's hips as she's bent over backwards that girl is like he wants me he's standing over me this is late I've taken a lot of yoga classes nobody ever stood on my hips now they're like hey bro but I do like it when you're doing yoga and they come over and they like push your legs down and like yeah a little assisted retching oh shit I just spilled I spilled wine leave it there bro let it sink in it's good for the the patina I'm learning those those terms the patina so laid out there so when you're in the church the Church of yoga home or wheelchair and you're abusing your power mmm that's a different animal because you're dealing abusing with children yeah it's you know it's a totally different animal when we taken six-year-olds and abusing them it's a different animal yeah you know I mean like it's like there's levels of shit right like the guy killing his brother is horrific to me the guy killing his brother's wife more horrific the guy killing his brother's wife and then kid's impossible demonic it's like the book you were saying earlier like do you believe in good or evil yeah I don't know if I believe in it but if it did exist it exists in in the mind of men yeah and exist in in that time you know you know or if yeah but you know it's like what I had this bit that I did in my last special and it was about men's rights groups and there's a I I was trying to figure out a way to say this and make it be funny but it's so true that I said men commit most of the murder men commit most of the rape men caused all the war this is these are facts hmm like the most horrific things in our life are war yeah murder rape those are the most horrific things yeah in all of life means that pales in comparison and I think men steal more than women too yeah what but that that's the evil this is if there was a demon and the demon came down to earth he was only three things that it could get you to do yeah he would get you to rape murder and cause war right so if a demon was real yeah demon would be men I get I I said this as a joke that I get feminists look in the special it was like I get it if I was a feminist I'd be one too mm-hmm like I can't be one as a man because they're not real cuz like male feminists like they're just tricksters they're just like show me a male feminist that can pick up heavy things and run really fast right you don't exist you have a limited parameter where you're allowed to be a male feminist but yeah but I get it yeah and I look at the actions of men if you're an objective person you take yourself out of the human race and you look at all all human beings and you look at the horror that not that women haven't done awful shit and falsely accused people and killed their kids and we've done all those things sure some women some but the vast majority of Horrors yeah have been have been yeah by men yeah I know it's like I know it's a very primitive way to look at the world that there's good and evil and it exists in these certain ways pot that's good it's all good all right but a little hit of that don't get crazy I'm worried that I won't be funnier after I do this let's say dude you like Elon Musk you're a goddamn parent pioneer Jaime's going for three I think that 3-day me has hit problem if you if you see a video of the floor really are in a cloud of what's in May is amazing to me is that this is now a hundred percent legal here it's so still not federally right well that's what was funny about the Elon thing when Yvonne smoked it here it was like it's totally legal it's totally ok but in everyone's minds they're still like no it's not yeah well they need to let it go and this yeah why they need to let it go we're on your side you know I'm on I'm on like this did the good people of government law enforcement Fire Department and military the good people come on your side man yeah and I'm a STONER yeah I'm on your side I'm on your side a thousand million percent and making it legal actually helps all that because you don't have to go after these phony wars against it it doesn't just do that it makes people more compassionate I know it makes people look it's like everything else you can abuse beating off you know I remember when I was a million dollars a drop 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm you know if you're a person that gets obsessed with masturbation yeah like you could ruin your life yeah there's people that are poor in addictions where they watch porn 810 hours a day and they can't stop right this is like everything yeah it's I think you can ruin yourself with sugar you can ruin yourself with food you can ruin yourself with with laziness yeah you can get into a habit where you just can't get up yeah you know you can get into a comfort zone we just want to take baths yeah shit like yeah no I know exactly yeahthere's did Roseann say she did that after Oliver bullshit went out she just got in the bath all the time drank wine was I heard they said that is their safe space apologize it wasn't so so anyways I know it's a very basic way I mean we've been talking about good and evil since the time of the men were able and women were able to you know write and and philosophize and uh but it it I don't know it just seems to me lately like I've C it feels to me like evil and good is actually a force that were struggling with you know and I know there's I know like some people would say that's kind of a you know a primitive way of thinking but I do kind of feel like it actually is a very real tangible thing and that what makes you think this these your personal feelings is it based on like your intuition like what is it I yeah it's intuition it's like a vibe it's like a it's just like a maybe because I'm showing up a church and kind of like searching a little bit myself and I I am very much about good people doing good things and I've just been kind of conscious of it but then there's always like these this rise of evil that like comes up like what all sudden white supremacist or these riots or these horrible things against people in different parts of the world and it's it seems like it's this non knowing struggle look almost like it why hasn't it caught up yet to the way you look at the world a lot of people look at the world yeah it's a lot of people look at the world like like if Tom Papa if you were in charge and if you had to push all the buttons that would sort of decide how people behaved yeah that was a possible thing of course one of the first thing you do is eliminate all the violence right all the horrors of the world yeah and if and then also I'm sorry to cut you off but you also see that all those Horrors are done by these men and stuff who when you sit and like kind of analyze them and they've been the victims of a lot of things and there's like genetic victimization and social and it's like so where's that coming from why are these this kid that could have been okay ends up in this life of crime and ends up murdering somebody and where's that coming from is this just a genetic mutation or is there like a force of good and evil I think we're still we're still dealing with the echoes of the past that's what I really firmly believe and I think also the way maybe you and I have in this conversation the way a lot of people are having these conversations today just like us mm-hmm but basically the same sort of rational people sitting around with no agenda going wises exist all those horrors of life why why is all this injustice why is that there yeah I think this is the we haven't been here that long I just really think that's that's real and I think we need to absorb that much better our time spent in modern civilization versus the time of life on Earth is a joke the time on life on earth and in relationships the time of the universe is a joke right the numbers are insane yeah I can't understand that we we literally were monkeys just a couple weeks ago right well yeah the bit that I have my act about the United States being founded in 1776 yeah that's three people ago yeah that's three people go really yes yeah that's nothing so three people ago people were these creatures that had to make fire right you stay warm they didn't have electricity they didn't have engines yeah they they made boats out of trees and they use the wind to drift across the ocean while staring at the Stars with a fucking a gigantic harp looking thing right was that thing a sextant yeah the things that you figure out where the other ones are she had a trusted these motherfuckers had mapped out the universe well that was because you make it across the ocean yeah and a lot of people died of scurvy along the way like fuck man that is crazy not long ago dude that's so goddamned recent yeah when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history one of the best podcast ever have you I don't know if you're not so good but he has this thing on the Mongols called the wrath of the cons and what freaked me out is not just how crazy that world was back then and what unbelievable damage and destruction the Mongols created and how they just conquered empires just moved across the world killed millions and millions of people but was really fucked up was I think Google this to make sure I'm not wrong I think that was only like 1200 BC I don't think that was that long ago right yeah it's really recent that's really recent I think Genghis Khan died in the 1200 s if I remember correctly hundred ad not BC ad oh what did I say BC I actually meant ad yeah I said BC but it really did mean ad which brings more reason I'm a little stoned for a lot more reason but that 1200 well twelve necessity would still be still be pretty fucking recent but 1200 ad which is what I meant to say right so recent yes that's just not that long ago yeah that's a wine eight sour years ago right yeah ish other way 792 792 years ago a guy killed 50 million people during his lifetime with his actions right they changed the carbon footprint of the world I mean they know it's asteroid I mean they they so then you're saying it's right you're saying it's more surprising that we're doing this kind of stuff yeah and that we have electric cars and medicine and all this other kind of like it's more surprising that we're doing that than it is that people are running around killing him right each other Nazi Germany do that was 1940s it's crazy that's maybe crazier than anything you know if you and Carlin has some great stuff on that too in the history of World War one and World War two but if you're you're you're watching a documentary on that and you're watching those people move around especially that one that you showed me Jamie that's been digitally remastered when you see it in color is that is it Ken Burns it to that yeah I think so they digitally remastered some footage from World War one and you get to watch these people move around like in real time yeah you realize like oh these are just these are people they're just just like you I know and this is like a hundred years to go years ago we're involved in this crazy-ass war and then a few years later involved in another crazy-ass war yeah so why can't we figure it out dude because how evil is present I don't know I think I think it used to be the only way the people got by I think feeling all together and I think from going from small groups of people which like in these small groups of people they would have interpersonal conflicts they would have fights with members in the tribe but they would sort it out and there would probably be some sort of rule that they would all try to live by but then they would get invaded by people that didn't have anything and we're looking for your stuff mhm and they came over the top of the hill and they killed and they raped and they stole women and they just did that for a long-ass time man they did that for a long-ass time this was the history of the steps like that Dan Carlin maps out in this Wrath of Khan thing makes me go Jesus Chris imagine being born thin right imagine just imagine how crazy that meant being a baby that's seeing arrows flying around open do people are lighting people on fire and launching them on two roofs with catapults right this is the footage from World War one so look how they digitally remastered it and yeah Peter Jackson's signature ups the movie I believe or a documentary that's the craziest thing when you look at history and you think that well that was then it's like no they're just us just happened to be there really no different than you and me dude we haven't been here this long we haven't been here this long this is the thing like people that look like this that are wearing like uniforms and that are you know have like decent stuff nice wheels to their wagons all I can get that's real recent man no I know it's recent as fuck and there's been a bunch of different ways that people have done it you know it even like the Egyptians but isn't the act of like okay so we know like that guy lit his house on fire yeah we know that is a just instinctually we know and have known during even all of us this history we've known that that is evil like right you know what I mean it's insanely selfish it's not like went from having to like eat each other and that we're trying to get our act together know what I mean there is a we all know that that is such a evil evil thing I think it exists I think we have to fight it well it's it is evil but it's ego that's causing that right that guy didn't want to go to jail it didn't want to shoot himself mm-hmm he didn't want to kill himself and didn't want to go to jail so he decided he was gonna kill a bunch of people to make up a story he had a plot and his plot was to save himself all right you know and that's when people get trapped in a situation where they're allowed to make decisions and they're allowed to you know if not allowed to what if they choose to make decisions and those decisions are horrific and then they have to somehow or another justify those decisions because they never look at their own behavior there was a judge other people this is a pattern that people fall into yeah there was looking for other people to always be wrong right and they never grow and so like a guy like that if he was so psychotic that he could kill somebody and then he has this decision to make and this decision is to kill the wife and the kids still like he's just like always got to be right you know I'm saying like he's always he's got it he's trying to cover his tracks he's trying to lie always like this is a type of person I could do something like that yeah there's a horrific panner thought it might have been triggered by the murder itself so it's just a chemical flip in his brain that says now I can kill people like he hasn't done his whole life and he's just going to the subway and getting a sandwich with all the stuff on it and just be this like watching the Monday Night Football and then the next week he's like something flips and his brain is like no now I can kill I don't think it's all the people that I know and love I think in a fit of rage and a fit of rage he does something horrific and I think he's one of those people that tries to justify his actions so it just totally tries to figure out a way where he can justify it that they're gonna be in hell anyway because the guy's dead you know they'd probably think you know I mean thinking that deep he could you think what crazy man they come up with justification yeah but we came from Mesa like we said before this is an Italian dude like us right but he could have also we don't know if it's medicated do we know that you know that's a it's a big warning chemistry mm-hmm we don't know what he was doing you know I mean he could have been on something which you know makes people do horrific things do you think you believe in karma I think for sure that when you put energy out there it affects things around you in terms of the way people interact with you and that in turn affects the way they will interact with other people as well and I think there's like there's there's a certain amount there's an energy you put out it's you could call it that but that makes it sound like you got a crystal in your pocket right not really Energy's real it's like energy is a real thing there's a real right if I was if I was a murderer and came and sat in here there'd be a different vibe than what you're feeling from me yeah for sure you know what I mean for sure yeah a chronic masturbator well it's also people that are off and then struggling with the fact that they've done something awful it was like an energy to that yeah it's like a constantly being on edge energy yeah every crime and punishment its dos EF yeah I never read that oh you should read it no it's so he kills someone and this is the he's carrying the it's the guilt greatest description of the guilt just carrying that thing now that guy's gonna emit an energy but you don't think there's karma just for like you do something bad in this ocean so I think that'll happen I think I genuinely believe and this is no crystals in my pocket I genuinely believe that if you do something that you know to be awful mm-hmm that that has an equal effect coming back at you uh-huh like whatever bad that you've put out in terms of like doing something evil to a person then the way you feel personally like about yourself you will take an equal blow I really believe that and where's that blow come from I think comes from your own introspective thinking I think you're doing it to yourself and worse you know you might even feel worse than that / you'd say something rude to a person just because you're tired and then you realize you said some rude no you oh why did I do that any mean and then they could be like Tom Pappas direct it's not really not I just I'm so tired you know and you just asked me something stupid I'm sorry it's like it's hard to turn that around yeah you know yeah so you might hate yourself more than they even get mad at you so Karma's really you dealing with the energy it's not the universe saying now something bad is gonna happen to you you're kind of creating it with your own actions and your own stuff I think it's real dangerous when we pretend that we have any sort of real understanding of the patterns of all the events that take place in the world so when you start to say like someone something happened to someone because of karma that's okay the problem was saying that is what about babies what about babies with leukemia were they bad babies right what happened why did they get cancer why they died young right why did they die in car so they why should they that doesn't make any sense they'd have never done anything bad there baby but that's what you could say that you know bad shit happens to us all hmm but can you create more bad shit you're a possible cook too and it's also entirely possible that you're creating more bad shit but feeling bad about yourself because you've done bad shit so to create more of this negative energy that you carry around with you I think that's entirely possible too but I think that we also have this weird need to define things you know and I think that we're looking to this thing that we're calling Karma and we're saying that this is like this this definite correlation between action and reaction and between the good you put out there and the good that comes back mm-hmm and my take is that I think there's definitely something going on but I don't think I should define it yet because I don't think we really know and I think as soon as we box it up and and say it's this thing and this is the the absolute reaction that the world has when you put good out there good comes back good and I all the time folks yet people die I think we're I think there's I think there is an energy yeah and the you know we know it from the work that we do I think it's Bo and you stand on stage yeah there's an energy in that room that transference between you and the people that are out there and you're playing with it and it's a real thing yeah it's a very real thing it's like hypnosis well yeah yeah yeah it is and and then they can they can reverse hip hypnotize you they can bring this other energy but the other way so that there is this energy of all of us out there and running around it's it's not that far to think then there couldn't be good energy and there's bad energy and there's and is that ultimately good and evil maybe it is all generated from human beings maybe if you educated everyone and they could all be kind and try and come in it that way we could actually feel that there was more good but that's just more good coming from people I don't know well if you want to get really Spacey with this Shirley really Spacey it's the holidays you go ok well what what exactly are people doing that's what you do you what are people doing hmm what are they doing like what's our purpose to be looking here look at us from an outside perspective like pretend you're not a person right and you're looking at all the people like what are they doing yeah they're moving really fast they're spending most their time doing things they don't want to do and they're buying stuff bustling around so because they're throwing all this money at stuff this stuff keeps getting better so every year the stuff keeps getting more complex and more capable and more high-tech and more space-age this is bananas man I'm gonna watch I can call fucking Dick Tracy man yeah right yeah and that as people keep going on and on and on and on with this stuff this is we need some sort of energy behind this innovation and a lot of the Energy's conflict conflict and resolution conflict and resolution conflict and victory victory and defeat and if defeat makes you work harder and and there's all these like interacting forces that are constantly moving together I'm with you and that this a lot of it is expressed the success of this little game has expressed in material possessions the success in this game has expressed in Hamptons mansions and private jets and Bentley's and Pam I'm winning this fucking crazy game of stuff and there's a lot of value in winning the crazy game whoo stuff so we let these people acquire all this stuff and you got all these diamond that's key yeah but this is this is forcing more stuff to be made better and more innovation which will eventually this is where it gets space just of all I'm waiting for this part this is gonna be what people become people are gonna become some sort of symbiotic organism or something that's tied into electronics and that this it's happening now right it's happening slowly and we're making it with stuff and as we keep making stuff it's eventually gonna get to a part the what the thing you'd like to do more than anything have it in Han store experience on earth right right I want to be able to take pictures yes yes I wanna be able to email people yes yes yeah but I also wanna I want it to make my experience on earth better mm-hmm well then we're gonna have to integrate with your circuitry Tom papa and then live forever maybe maybe that's what the organisms are trying to do with their tour is getting that get rid of the monkey that wants to start the wars all the time mm-hmm right it's unlikely to that records that out of our goofy-ass just to beat evil if only some there would be a great science-fiction movie well if this is the future and they probably were already made it but if only some people went on board with a new enlightenment that you get from these like headsets uh-huh like remember the dude from Star Trek the one guy yeah which like from Sesame Street he was he used to be on Sesame Street right yeah he was the Lavar braiding rainbow levar yeah reasoning about levar burton marburg yeah yeah if we all had those things on there was only like ten of them what if I gone into those people bought into it and those things completely cure you mm-hmm of any just moving along I think that uh I don't know I mean there was maybe there is no purpose to us being here boys filter that's a really good cool air filter [Laughter] and Chevy yeah you barb added that at the auto parts store and put it in your dokuro dope old ones man when a fucking unscrew the chrome hubcap down I always liked a good wing nut and people don't remember man these people today you don't remember what gas smells like oh man you could fix your own car you could open it up and with a screwdriver and a high school education fix your automobile I was never smart enough or knowledgeable enough to fix my own car but I could do little things I can change my oil yeah I do a lot of things with oh yeah exactly house just redid the brakes once I did the brakes did the brakes that's a bold move when you're wrong I was poor buying brake pads was a lot cheaper than having some one guy know that did you have it up on a jack how'd you put it up on a jack everyone in a cinder block that held it underneath and damn it was a little nice it was a light little car at little pads mm-hmm put them in I probably had to get it fixed after that but but yeah you could fix stuff there was like a time when you could actually and you felt good but but yeah if you had to choose between one of those fucking rickety shit boxes that's like a rhinoceros on rollerskates versus your Tesla fucking no and I wouldn't put I wouldn't put my kids in one of those yeah that we were driving around in those death traps dude no steering no airbags hydroplane at the drop of a hat they were so engine heavy remember it was just big ass engines in the front they didn't know how to just slide all over the place it was so easy to slide your car back there it was totally beat with your friends just like yeah hitting out in this course today they figured out how to balance them that's like that's the big deal like if you like a Tesla or anything you buy a fucking Camry okay that Camry handles way better than a 69 Camaro yeah fucking no I want you to see what the death-rate way better of on the roads now with like new car it's gotta be it's probably much better I mean people they're much safer anymore but there are driving much faster too yeah but you don't have to drive very fast for it to be fatal they just didn't know how to make stuff everything was ruling class just look acyl metal and fucking sparks and it's fumes fumes were everywhere you've been driving be getting high from the fumes right I remember when I was working for a fireplace company in the summer in New Jersey and I was in a truck and we're in this truck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike right by Newark Airport and just the fumes from everything from the city from the cars it was just orange in the humidity of New Jersey I was like if I get cancer this is gonna be the day that it that it hit me and it makes people crazy it's like it's like throwing alcohol on fire if it's breathing that dust all day so disgusting pull up a video of the exam of the exhaust of a 1969 Camaro there is something - something - there's something smell of gas is a good smell it's not just that man if that sound yeah there's a sound oh how about this one even better 1960s 1970s Revell SS doesn't evil about that sound yeah that is America drive one of those motherfuckers around is very cool I mean they are they represent in a lot of ways what's great about America yeah the excess Nicholas exactly not giving a shit it's just so obvious let's go at the time fucking giant metal explosion contained in the front of the hood that's all that is a giant ass explosion box look at this whoo that's the 69 is it oh good lord but you know I oh my god this guy this guy this is gloriousness you see heaven on earth right here 1969 Chevelle look how pretty that car is man if this guy's across the street from me and I'm looking out with my coffee out of my window and he comes pulling out without his Saturday morning you know what I'm saying what this guy's an asshole do you hear her be with his new car you say that but I guarantee you if you were the next door and you just walked over and looked at it it would catch you in it spell cross the street it's just racket Jesus Christ why is your crime after be so loud yeah but if she's right next to you like wow 1969 huh and you'll start walking around it's pretty badass oh it's beautiful yeah they it's not you can't make a car like that today cuz it's not even remotely aerodynamic it's not a virgin hammock it's not fuel-efficient it's not safe there's a beautiful man they nailed it they hit this sweet spot and art and engineering that is the one part of the American experience recklessness yeah that's what drives everything that there there is that element of balls-to-the-wall let's see what happens let's discover and you could get good things out of it right but imagine this imagine something that's far inferior to the modern alternative mmm-hmm but makes you feel in a way the modern alternative isn't capable of feeling like if you see in 1969 like done up Mustang g/t what was like the big one that year GTA Rock one was at a Mach 1 what the fuck was the 1970 was it a boss that's what it was the 69 was like a boss and then earlier than that they made those Eleanore cars for that Don at 62nd but I think those were 1967 yeah really not that body style yeah like if you looked at one of those next to a 2018 Mustang the 2018 Mustangs look fucking great they look great that's it right there it's a Mach 1 yeah that's it oh that's right it's red rice dude there's a company that's making these now too they're called classic recreations mm-hmm and they're making these like and new versions of that car they take they take 1969 Mustangs and they rebuild them but they give them like real break so they stop good modern suspension right they make it so you could drive it around yeah that's that's what I'm interested in that makes sense to me is just pretty Mustang badass tires but look at that how beautiful is that it doesn't look like anything that you can buy that's modern but nothing remotely close no that's like vinyl they just right there they just nailed it whatever the fuck they did they nailed it but all these years later were like god damn it they nailed it right but they nailed it first you know a certain lunk head from New Jersey that doesn't do that for you yeah it does but I don't know look at that right like black hood you don't know young people would like that I don't know they like to start arresting they don't like they don't do that then they should probably go to jail somewhere that is pretty hot that's incredibly good-looking but it's also stupid Wow so sir it's just metal right in your chest cavity no no airbag need to do more last just in your face it's probably a little bit of that no I know it's junk and a car accident drive carefully and it's a wonderful thing to behold yeah I just my bat Mustang when we were in high school but if you saw something like that but it had air back you'd be cool with it that yeah no I'm cool with it anyway I'm just busting balls but I think it's a look at that little orange thing in the middle that looks closer to what I had I had a 76 Toyota Corolla call that up call up in 1976 Toyota Corolla with with the racing stripes along the side look at that bad boy look at that orange one in the second row that was it I had a 1984 Honda Accord pull shit up Jamie 84 Honda Accord were stuttering sparkplug that's a 79 you need the 70s those are cool little cars though that's okay I could fix that car though that's what I was doing the brakes on yeah it looks like one of those something like yeah that was white nice little shitty car Ivan legend just like I know what man here's the thing that's a nice car those fucking cars drive forever yeah exactly there are it's amazing how reliable Honda's are oh yeah they're so enjoy Otis oh my god just go forever just having that crummy car yeah it's a good thing but so you think back to your your point of view of the what are these people doing here hmm so they're building I liked where you were gonna make it of making stuff for what well because everything is electronically based and is this all instinct is or is it being steered by something why are we just finding our way in the dark and this is what's coming out or is there some plan well that's the heavy question it's really hard to know if there was a plan yeah I get I get why some would be suspicious that there would be but if you just see the whole nature right with the starting off of the tribal behavior and the invasions of the others and the wars that have taken place sort of non-stop right yeah you get this hyper-competitive team-oriented thing broken into countries well I think that with that and this like constant competition and this constant and then inside your country this constant competition economically and everybody just striving to achieve and do better and get crazier and bigger and that this is all leading to us just continuing to buy stuff mm-hmm like everybody that is involved in this is buying the newest iPhones the newest MacBook the newest this and most that right Xbox fucking how many X boxes have them no let's just say four four yeah yeah keep going get going they're gonna go Xbox five they're gonna you're gonna keep going it's what everybody does they want better shit you want VR we want VR we want hyper-realistic VR I want VR with no gear I want you to be able to give me a pill and that pill releases a bunch of nanobots that go through my circulatory system and my brain and juice it up with some artificial memory I mean that's what I want and I shit it out there like buckshot sounds right clink yeah kidney stone you shit it out like buckshot like little bb's coming out your poop this is I mean look beings always try to find safety right that's what they want more than anything they don't want to get killed they want to they want to be safe and exist eat whatever but they just want to be they want that safety so maybe our safety is going to come when we're out of the woods we're out of the wild we're out of the 20th century and we're just these insular things that never have to go out and about and live forever and just be mmm could be maybe that's what all this push of technology is is aiming towards yeah it could be right because you can protect ourselves in these little cocoons and and be yeah I mean if the ultimate threats always violence in war right that's the ultimate threat to the organism organism convinced commit violence in war against each other yeah which is why we make doors and gates and you know stuff to keep those things at bay yeah yeah but it's what the most fascinating things that people don't address like what would what would cause a person to snap there's no real concrete no concrete answer what do you think is the difference between and I'm asking this honestly killing when you're hunting and killing a human being I think it would be a giant difference like way you fell yeah how could you articulate it though I don't know I've never killed a human being but I would I would imagine that it would be I mean it would have to be some horrific situation where you're you're battling for your life you know which people do it does happen right you know we were all aware of it it's the worst possible scenario we would all like to think that everybody that we meet that's of sound mind should be our brothers and sisters I mean we should all get along right whether you agree or disagree about certain political issues or certain social issues like we should be able to talk through that as a community but like always hold at the top that we're all in this together and if I think that's possible I think that's possible and I think we could still satisfy this fucked-up desire that we have to constantly compete we can temper that with I would I think is the most important thing is finding something that you're passionate at because I think you and I are really really lucky that we found stand up and through stand up we found this thing that we're passionate at and we have a good time and we have fun mm-hmm some people don't have that so like if I if you were offered a job as a stockbroker and this is a guaranteed job you have a guaranteed contract for the next 20 years you're gonna make five times as much as you make doing stand-up he can't do stand-up anymore you would never take that no so even though you're a guy who does well you're not a business person you're a guy following your passion right and it's allowed you to live a nice life but that doesn't it's not the same as a lot of people what a lot of people are doing is just chasing the money so the the passion doesn't exist and they can manufacture that passion when it comes to like some desire to see their their team kick ass because their company's number one to be the word yeah it could be could be really that they are into succeeding in the business world and that's their passion they there's a lot of people that like that right but it's not the same as a guy like David Cho who's like a professional artist who's making he's he just follows his passion right he does what he wants there's a different kind of achievement there's a feeling that he has the way he interfaces with what he does for a living that's different than what a lot of people do so I would imagine that artists would probably less inclined to go crazy and spend all their money on stuff and buy things that make them look better or make them feel better about the fact that they work so because they're not trying to fill a hole that right right but if you're just you have a job for a company that you don't really give a fuck about you don't really give a fuck about styrofoam coolers hmm you know you really don't give a fuck about fucking yeah those rubber bands that people buy when they I don't give a fuck about this company right you're right a fucking guy does your business oh yeah okay well we you know we can give them tea for 1796 if we can work this through Bob talking about thousand bucks or want to be like I want to be fish in right guy wants to be doing something else yeah you don't you you're insanely fortunate that you don't have that in your life no but I think I don't think those people look a lot of people have jobs that they're not into but they the reason we're lucky is that our job is our passion a lot of people have the job that they're maybe not into but they love this other stuff that they do they love being with their family and keep teaching soccer or they love skiing or whatever like their passion is something else yes it's like we're lucky that our passion is our work like to combine those things that is a very very unique thing it's the most insanely lucky thing and ever you know me just but I think that for people that are like hyper competitive that don't find a thing that they really love mm-hmm then it really for many of them becomes about pursuing the best stuff yeah and you this is what fuels so many people for like these status symbols like if you have an iPhone 8 with if a kid sees you with an iPhone 8 and they got an iPhone 10 weird they can basically do the exact same thing yeah I Phone 8 has a fucking killer champion eight you know it's like the battery's pretty simia are tiny yeah baby but for status seeking people right very important that you have the latest stuff like you can't be walking around like David tell the other day with the iPhone to there's nothing about it tell it is searching for status no he's like I was saying that he's like a monk you know way he is yeah yeah you're right he's smart you know he's very brilliant guy he knows he knows what's healthy for man what's not so that's yeah it'll help but all his other stuff like he stopped drinking and ya know he cleaned himself up really well and the cigarettes are the only vice he has cigarettes and coffee who's saying that's his vice he's a he's a poet amongst us like yeah he's he's somebody that yeah that he's special it really is and he's a really good guy ya know he's so kind he's so kind just being around in his orbit I love four years every year New York he loved I love the two of them together ya know it's really awesome it's so funny I never would have seen that coming when I was when we were all young in New York I never I never would have saw him now those two Yeah right doing it I don't know what not for any real reason but it just never saw them intersecting I never would have saw any of us doing something like that yeah you're doing live shows together yeah that's a great idea it's like some of those shows you see those pictures from the Comedy Cellar yeah you know one o'clock in the morning like Dave Chappelle's on stage with Chris Rock and yeah looking around you know there's always like three guys on stage that's crazy I know I never I never understand that either but being around to tell like watching him all through the years like he would always surprise you like when someone's father died or something happen I tell was always front and center like helping out giving people money like there's - Jimmy Caan guy yeah and another force of good yeah a real force of good and a guy who like comics should really appreciate like if you're a fan of the art form like David tells really someone to appreciate it because yeah always creative it's it's like it's never douchey as always thanks for the memories that's one of my all-time favorite shit is hilarious that is so fun is a hilarious CD man and I think he did that in Denver yeah yeah I think he did that the comedy work oh yeah Wendy's Play Doh very cool yeah yeah that fucking in Denver that CDs brilliant yeah he's so good yeah I mean to answer what you're saying yeah your face here and it's photo I think that was when he was doing insomnia too right yeah that was them partying days yeah he says he says such a smart guy like he just decided at one point hey this is fucking me up no more drinking - no more drinking no more show I'm gonna do this mm-hmm think it's attracting negativity to my shows you know and setting me up as a guy it's gonna drink himself into oblivion no he was smart he pulled the pull the cord yeah those those you you're the party guy you're the life of the party guy he's heartburn this it burnt down yeah what's his endgame yeah or it talked around white he's he's doing it with us and run white run White's not bacon I tell you exactly Ron White's doing he's riding that fucking boat right into the rock it is he doesn't give a fuck and he's doing it with a tequila company Happy Holidays cheers my friend I set up my train under my tree NUMA what is it numero Juan is that his uh tequila company I just said I set my train up under my tree and you still show glom on tequila did you have photos or videos of this train on your tree um I think I didn't put anything on the Instagram probably it wouldn't be real if it wasn't I love it stuff in your life my kids are getting older there's like 16 and 13 and they were at school and I'm setting up the village under the tree and the train tracks and all the people like shop around the village and I was like doing it on my own because they don't have time to really do it and I was like this is how people become the guy in the neighborhood is like bring your children around look at my train set because your family leaves and you're like are there any children around look at my train set I could totally see myself doing that at some point totally well there's those dudes that they go Wall Close Encounters of the Third Kind yeah but make that giant one in the middle of the living room the plywood on the horse like yeah you that guy yeah you make a train around that yeah it's not that far it's really I can't remember his name Richard Dreyfuss to course Jesus Christ Richard Dreyfuss a great movie well doctor he's been great in so many things it was like always the unassuming guy jaws yeah man I mean him as the film artist he was he was Spielberg's alter ego really yeah be so good yeah he's so good in everything looks so young there he was man man oh man what a fucking movie this was cuz I wanted to believe so bad oh yeah I so wanted to believe they got me hey did you talk about Daniel Berg did you talk about that alien craft that came into her what happened we turned to our galaxy you did then won't the Hawaiian name know so it's over you didn't hear about that one the one that looks like a joint yeah looks for a big piece of poo yeah that's just a big rowdy copter it's just a weird rock I think now they said that uh some like legit people said that it changed speed and went in different directions and yet people legit people ho scientists Oh them guys said that it was uh it could be something hmm could be what is neil degrasse he say about it he's not talking right now yeah he's in a little bit of a kerfuffle kerfuffle what's this Jim Harvard scientists say aliens may explain bizarre interstellar object yeah I saw that and then I saw someone refuting Harvard scientists Harvard nobody wants to believe more than me bro come on Joe it's real well if I was gonna mask my spaceship to fly through the galaxy I would definitely make it look like a big rock yeah like a big asteroid right why wouldn't you driving through space maybe if they were like look if we just make this thing drive by them and don't change speeds they'll have no idea to stink asteroid they'll be psyched do we miss them okay I could call good call the guys someone just hits the gas I'm tired I want it's fucking taking too long what you got it the fucking cops are behind this damn shit god damn it Dave you're not supposed to just take off told you 65 you fuck let's start throwing this weed out the window why would it be so hard to believe a space rock traveling through space that would be the move right I mean if they are so advanced that they can travel through galaxies they can make this shit look like anything they want it to yeah when you doll it up radiation pressure with no rating thor's would be there was no air in space right so it wouldn't be aerodynamics what would it be momentum no go down a little bit I think it answers your question if radiation pressure is the accelerating force then OH mamama represents a new class of thin interstellar material whoa it has a different thing that's using for energy but as to what may have produced this previously unseen material it could have emerged naturally from the debris of the planet forming discs in a distant solar system going through yet an unknown process they've got a whole other way to mix we went from Toyota Corollas to this thing imagine as we find the only thing that echoed it does the like a rock right Rock hat is not smooth but it doesn't necessarily need this is where I'm stupid this is where places where I'm stupid but it doesn't necessarily need to be aerodynamic right because it's not going through air the vacuum of space right exactly so I'm not wrong there it could actually look like a rock because the only issue would be getting it into space right the aerodynamics is assuming that you're shooting it from a planet with an atmosphere and gravity cannot be talked about this way too stupid if you shot if you like about your launching it from earth into space right yeah what if you had it encased in like this outer area sort of like the space shuttle is yeah but then once you get to a place you could jettison the outside of it just like they'd get rid of those booster rockets they just fall into the bus integrate land on people other fish getting killed by a booster rocket fly space and hit you in the face didn't disintegrate but then they could do that they could release the shell and then they would just have the rock and the rock would move through space and it didn't matter what shape it was because it's in the vacuum of space we just get it up into orbit orbit like the space station go and build it in pieces and then launch it do you remember when that commander Chris Hadfield gentleman was on the podcast and he was talking about some kind of magnet that they have that collects subatomic particles out there in the galaxy and that we only know five percent of what the universe is made out of my gonna talk about things like dark matter and he was five percents the guys scientist space a real legit astronaut coming back from six months in space or whatever the fuck he was there for and telling us this Wow we've talked about that like you can hang with those guys for a little while and then you're like I don't understand what's happening now well it's also the I mean it's amazing what we do know amazing if they can send a guy to space and have them fly around the ISS or yeah I mean we'll talk about what you were saying about why are we here and what are we doing yeah like we haven't developed yet something that can go the speed of light we haven't like mmmm but if we do then the whole universe is open to us maybe that's what it is maybe the struggle of developing all the stuff is to get to a scientific level where we can really go I don't think they think the speed of light is even good enough really yeah I think damn it it was my goal I think that like if you wanted to have options available as to what planet you're gonna colonize you're gonna have to who knows like what if you Lana what do you land on a planet and it's like hey it's 74 degrees out guys guys it's all oxygen and nitrogen it's just like Earth come on out here come on out of here but it's only been like that for ten years and then cycle it's really fucked up but you're thirty years from now it's going to be a nice age again are all the people have moved there and they're gonna freeze to death is gonna be no food at all and that planet doesn't give a fuck that is all our science led us to that I don't even know if we can predict like here's my question can they accurately predict the atmosphere and the conditions and like what the temperature would be if a planet is from a sun-like do they have a calculation where they say oh this Sun is this amount of big and this planet is this far away so it's definitely gonna stay within a certain temperature range for the entire time that the planet do they know that like within like a death range I don't know trees they must death range is 40 degrees bro yeah you get to 140 that's a wrap yeah you're done yeah so like hundreds of naked 140 everyone's dead right you live in a sauna you're gonna run out of water I just don't think we're gonna make it we're not okay Mikey and we're definitely not figuring it out because we're saying this amount of big we're confusing the produce but seriously think about that just as a concept like maybe that is it maybe it's maybe all this like you keep thinking and you know you talked a lot about all the robots and the things that are moving us forward but why but why but why and I had the cocoon theory before but maybe that's not it maybe it's so we can really go yeah I've had the cocoon theory for quite a while where I think that we are like some sort of an electronic caterpillar that's building some cocoon and then a butterfly is gonna emerge because when right when I is a collective like we'll all be part of this I don't know I mean just the innovation and the computers and the AI and our integration with them that eventually it's just gonna get smarter and crazier and weirder yeah I mean it's only a matter of time before they make something that resembles a person it sounds too insular no it sounds too insular that it would just be for us to stay here on earth well the universe is so vast right that there may be I think it's more likely that we're going to go out of this that's a very good idea this is the steward sense it's kind of a sewer oh but is it though it's amazing well it's beautiful there's parts come on man we have a lovely life you ever been to Utah skipper you could look at the Stars or look at the beautiful sky on a day like today oh my lovely do you go outside this clouds float around just gives you just right around a Sun a little bit of contrast is the best lovely like why would how could you say this is a sewer because it's so many parts that are disgusting there's so many parts being because there's no because not not so many parts because we still have this evil this other stuff that's long at each other and knocking each other and it's still filled with right but he's very murder not right here right right not right here it's only it's in certain spots so this is the other thing that we tend to do because we have seven billion people on the planet and cameras on all of them yeah and everybody's got a Cameron we're exchanging these stories like yeah you're catching stories from an unimaginable number of humans yeah right and so even if we're looking at just our country there's so many people just la so many people it's 20 million people it's insane what's really amazing it's really amazing is not just how far human beings have come over the last you know hundred two hundred three hundred years but what's really amazing is if you just look at the actual numbers of times that people interact with each other and how few of them are violent yeah especially in a place like America in 2018 I think about that on the freeway also many people use it just right and they're all pretty much acting in an orderly fashion to preserve themselves and others yeah yeah no you have every now and then you have someone that's just crazy just violates all the rules just weaving in a traffic right driving 150 miles an hour and a residential community maybe it's just a mutation maybe that's just a mutation you know I think it is I think it is in the same way those things exists in like a biological system right you can get these little diseases little bugs little things that are off mm-hmm you know and then you have an immune selling that battles the bugs yeah like when you see stuff about chimpanzees err and there's like everyone's getting along trying to do their thing their struggles but then there's a real mutation like there's someone that there's one that kills the rest of them and won't be part of the thing you know that's what we have we have these kind of like renegade mutations run by evil yeah right we should all go back to what's what's interesting is that it's in large groups right and all of us together like the way we interact with each other is generally nonviolent however these large groups will decide by whatever you know whoever's in charge to attack other large groups and this is where the big death comes from right this is where the the real toll comes from in war right so but if you looked at the actual communities of people from one side or the other like the themselves together how much are they really in conflict with those other people probably not nearly as much as the people that are in charge would want them to be which right yeah which is a very split that it's almost like the mutation is in charge right because right you take two groups that are at war you put them together they're just hanging out drinking beer together we're all the same aides that probably have a great time together their leaders talk them and those leaders are the mutation that's when things get scary whether it's the Hitler leader or you know what would a North Korea do leading places they're talking people into invading places yeah that's some slippery justification yeah you know that's where the world gets very strange and and I think it's interesting that those people in those groups you know all come from all over the world or all over the country at least all these different places they're brought together right but look how we've progressed there's fewer of those kind of conflicts now than ever before right but you and I and I think a lot of other people would like it to be zero amount right yeah but Donald I don't know if that's ever gonna happen man but that's a weird thing to say because you would you would like everybody to be in a good place this world but you almost wonder if like many things there's like this push of good things happening and bad things positive and negative and that there's battle between the two of them is what creates all this momentum and all this movement that's the good and evil we're back to the good and evil so maybe we should go back to church look the priests did some weird stuff but maybe we it's good people in there more than evil people well the problem is with that church in particular there's still shielding the people that have done terrible things yeah yeah there's just no denying that there's if you look at the facts if you look at everything that's come out there's no denying that no it's a super unfortunate because I think the vast majority the people that are involved in the religion that aren't the people that are pedophiles right I think there are very good people that probably think about it the same way maybe your daughter would like to think about it that there's a place where people can get together and they exchange affection and camaraderie and and this acceptance of something higher than them that holds them to a certain standard and wants them to be good people and they for everybody good for everybody but if it wasn't for all that kid fucking guys all that kid fucking just ruined all that it just yeah yeah it really really is such a sad sad thing Google this because I've said this many times and I've never bothered looking it up that uh they're the reason why we can get another bottle that if you want to get fucked up ok it's the holidays okay so holidays um what were we just talking about good and evil and the for the priests and why they're ruin it and on you said go give that video look something up you haven't looked before a reason why oh that's it thank you thought that was gone forever I voted the reason why they forced priests to be celibate because what I had heard how was it son and this is not no scholarly work of my own I don't remember even reading the article I think somebody told it to me that priests were banging too many chicks you might have said it that way too many chicks man they made a mess out of it which I think I don't think that was it what do you think it is I think it was property I think that when priests priests own property mhm and if they were married and he died she would keep the property hmm if there was no woman involved and he owned the property and he couldn't be with a woman and he swore that he was just with Jesus when he died the property went to the church yeah yeah that's you know which is not much of I mean that's crazy it's wow that whole other part of Catholicism is the other thing that bumps me all the time when you go to the Vatican it's like wow this is beautiful but what where'd they get all this art where'd they get all these build I mean yeah the pillaging of fuck of raelians dollars were the shit all stolen from a time where people are starving the street see no this is how powerful religion is this is how powerful this pull is to search for good and to be a part of something is that we're in light of those things that you you see the wealth it's like going into like a pirate ship and seeing all the shit they got and then knowing what they do with these children both those things are you should just say no fuck this I'm gonna be I'm not gonna be a part of this at all yeah but the the other part of it is so strong that you actually will kind of say well yeah yeah yeah but I'm still gonna go to Mass on Sunday I think you know what happens you think that even if a priest is bad that the religion is still good you know right the the idea is this is like a bad guy who lost his way that this sort of human beings that are flawed yeah I got a lot of my drunk - men read my grandma's oh no my grandma's eulogy you know her name was Josephine but he kept calling her Geraldine they had to correct him it's Josephine look he was he was saying all these great things about her he knows I know and he had those Jim blossoms Oh Jamie brought in another bottle of wine I'm like savage Savage Jamie Jamie but I think you know you take a guy and you put him in that position where he can't have a companion like you're not allowed to have a love ya can't have a wife or a husband or whatever you can't have that it's a horrible thing to do fighting nature there's a kid that I went to high school with that uh became a priest yeah we all knew he was gay oh yeah I knew like it was it was like a thing you know like oh this is why he's gonna be a priest we get it right well that's what a lot of people say it's like that the church the other side of is that the church doesn't create pedophiles that like the institution attracts them because they know they'll be safe there well it's it's possible but it's also possible that so many of them that are active in the church and I don't know what this guy story was I barely knew him yeah but that he could have been molested I mean it's not it's not a small number of kids that were molested so very large so large yeah and you would never mean who the fuck understands what that would be like to be a young boy to have that happen to you and then get groomed and indoctrinated into being a part of this thing that does that to other young boys in the future it's your whole reality which has to be with some of them are and they're all doing this under the blanket of this thing called the church then when the church finds out about it the church moves people to all these different various places and they they get these new victims yeah and this happens over and over and over again you know this is one of the things that they were saying about benedict about the one who right before or cool closest yeah yeah yeah he had actively done that you know he was knowledge people yeah it was a part of that it's so bad so bad and it's such a shame Mary Catholic priest there are perhaps 120 in the u.s. already here's how whoa is this a new thing yeah the other article I found said there's about 200 Wow as of 1980 there was a rule change or an adoption of a rule change that allowed why does it say this is say Eastern only is that what it's saying that was something in the story of the video that was going yeah but they're kind of positive why I say Eastern Catholic like east coast East Coast West Coast not Mexicans are not by Brooklyn married in the house huh 120 Catholic priests married in the United States wow that was great policy change by pope john paul ii in 1980 which offered a path for married episcopal priest to continue their ministry after converting to Catholicism oh so you have to be a priest already if you Episcopalian and then you're allowed to have a wife and kids if you're Episcopalian right yeah for sure I love them convert ticket like cat Catholicism's the only one that doesn't allow them to have sex right yeah it's the only one with its littered with kid fucking right I mean coming up exactly cut the shit we were we are actually at Mass and he was talking about there was one thing from the gospel that was talking about being married being with a woman and then he finishes her answer happy holidays he finishes the he finishes the sermon and then he the reading then he goes into a sermon all about being with a woman and this is a man that doesn't come close to that this is a man that has experience it would be so much better for the church if he was a married man with children and then he could really talk about being in a family like who are you you know nothing about what we're dealing with on a daily basis yeah I never went to the Catholic Church when I was an adult but I would it would be curious to be there to be like a husband and wife sitting there in this fucking church listened to this yeah dude who is supposed to be celibate drone on about how you should live your life and what kind of relationship you should have right bitch you're dressed like a fuckin genie like a wizard son this is preposterous what are you doing what's that thing around your shoulders for why are you dressed like that on silk do you have underwear on it's really weird that we let people dress like that yeah like if you didn't if he just stood up there and had to be held accountable like that if the volume of his words were all he had like if you just made all priests and I mean all priests across all religions if they all had to stand on a flat regular stage with nothing behind them yeah and they had a dress like a like a regular person like you were dressing right now and no pointy hat no pointy hat no no fucking giant insane artwork behind you around too confusing yeah pedestal all that stuff fucks people up you go there and you see the the like you've been a realm right yeah he's Saint Peter's Basilica you see that yeah you when you go in there I mean you almost can't believe that your eyes are working correct right exactly you're almost like this can't be something that someone actually made yeah this is insane with no machines right just their hands and thousands of people like that that if you're in that thing you're gonna be so humbled and so they're gonna get away with a lot more shit yeah if you were in some weird conference room bullshit cups of coffee you know how you get a coffee machine and they have little tiny bullshit ass copies to it like white styrofoam cups the handle on it the paper handle the folds out and you're dressed in Joseph a bank what the handle is not that bad because they have to be a certain size to have a hand it's the ones of their little white ones a little white styrofoam ones those are bullshit yeah but they were put in the plastic the little triangular nobody's gonna buy your fucking connection today here the deal are in that place right you have to you have to sell it you're not they're not just gonna buy it I mean I'm not a dress like a wizard you stand up in the golden podium with a giant huge sculpture of Jesus nailed to a pass behind you and there's organ music playing you know I'm huge that's a that's a bits that's your act that's a good Act that's an act that's gonna look at that you know what man they should make that shit illegal the same way they made advertising booze illegal but you know what look how pretty that is though it's gorgeous so pretty wouldn't be that looks like a Christmas Mass or some bunch of belly dancers up there and dudes playing bongo drums and people passing around joint cannabis infused lovin would that be better than this bullshit well these are all just adults if we can get all those grown adults just passing out weed singing songs together well what was it in New York was it the limelight it wasn't Church that turned into a club people in the church see ya singing together with that come on man that's realisable too but you know what those people that are in those pews look like a thousand people right that's a big crowd mmm those people that are sitting there they are kind of high they're checking their watch right now and go when does this bullshit our dark enough of this guy droning off he's drunk Gladys he's fucking drunk there they go asking us for money again those Gin Blossoms all over the face he looks like WC Fields it's fucking the guys just getting drunk I put shit in the basket now they're coming out twice with the basket screw this guy hottest can hear you stop it God is gonna hear you Timmy's gotta go in for his doctor's appointment tonight what if God's gonna hear you but is the value of them having a place to go on that Sunday even though they hate it import the limelight is a gym now yeah the limelight was a yeah I saw a fishbone at the line hold on so the limelight does the dance Club yes is now a fitness yeah it was a church I can't tell which it was a market - it was a church oh it was a rock club so it doesn't laugh and they started selling shitting they should sell that shit imagine that it's your house Tom papa it's that would inspire you to get your party rolling live in a church it's it's a gym now do I work out in that church all day that would be my spot even if I had a gym house I definitely go to that gym feel the juice okay I tell people I say I tell people all the time she's always like I like working out like at my studio but I like going to places too because we know yeah because when you go to a place like there's a certain amount of juice yeah you know you're in a new spot but you're people around you that you don't know yeah you're out you're out and it's also as a comic I think social interaction is one of the least respected ingredients to our weird sort of stew things that come together to make a bit you got to fill the well with with those experience yeah you got to talk to people yeah it's like reading or just being out in the world it's important yeah it's it just all like all those things like eating is one thing you need to do but I think like interacting with people is just too goddamn gigantic so important I do this I'm the I do a monologue each week on out in America on live from here which is the new Prairie Home Companion and are you allowed to yeah yeah it's the new look it's the new Prairie home did anybody else call you that aside to call yourself that what the new Prairie Home Companion it is that it was Prairie home so you're actually doing this thing when I first got hired it was Prairie ho and then they changed it when Garrison Keillor got in trouble that was called live from here he I was confused yeah yeah yeah and and I do a monologue each week all the out in America I have been doing this about a year you don't tell me uh it's NPR I just I figured you would know I figured all things considered gross I follow all the shit you do I didn't know how you follow all this should I do I'm like yeah that's weird but my point is I do this monologue called out in America and it's me you it makes it's me glasses striving a light on all the good people in America right and I do it every week on NPR wear that suit like you own it okay but the reason I bring it up is not to plug it but to say it made me when I'm out on the road talk to people hmm I would get in the car and throw my my headphones on I wouldn't talk to people on flights I didn't talk to the person and driving stay in my room do my shit as a comic let's go when you kind of you're isolated and because I have to write this monologue each week I need inspiration I really want to shine a light um the good people out in the country I start talking to everyone I don't take my headphones out I talked to the driver I talk to the people next to me if they want to talk and it is talked about filling the well for your comedic you know yeah toolbox it's the greatest thing in the world there's billions of people they all are unique they all have a story to tell it's foolish let's be as a comedian not to talk to me sweetheart here they don't all have a story to tell there's some of them they might have a story to tell but you don't want to hear it well some are bad a lot of stories they're gonna be coming your way they do though I mean honestly even like the biggest slug you'll find you talk to them about their family about their childhood about where they're growing grew up with there's there is a story there here's a way to look at it you take the biggest fucking loser that ever existed on planet Earth and if you discover how on Mars it's the biggest story in human history where the donkey mouth jerking off with a bathrobe on on Mars it would be like the most important thing that's ever happened it's on the CNN fuck out there be like this can't be real community closer I'll show you have you seen it old man with a Duncan ass beat nom right but if you found an old man with a donkey mask beaten off in Venice I'm still I'm still interested like if I said Tom papa you ever see your life savings do you say yes or no there is currently a man with a donkey mask on wearing a bathrobe jerking off in Venice yeah you might you might want to lean yes me might if they're bringing it to you I'd be super suspicious but that's your questions my favorite not an underdog on that my question my question is do you think that it ever happened yes right everything you can think of is that confident that someone has jerked off with the donkey mask on 100% like a hotel bathrobe especially in Venice it's all about masks in Venice I'm a hundred percent confident I could say historically yes everything you can think of a second beach not Venice Italy right Italy with all the Bryant where all the Catholic stuff yeah yeah and plus the waters getting high on people panic can I ask you guys a question sure back to way in the beginning of the podcast when I was talking about wine and how I'm trying to learn about it and stuff the one thing I don't know about wine is when I do drink it I never feel that drunk and we've had a bottle and a half now yeah do I seem drunk yeah you should pretty fucked up don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me do I seem that different from before I mean you're all so fucked up too but no you seem fine yeah yeah cuz I always get home and I'm like I have to say I was kept my shit together yeah and then I wake up the next morning like no I was I shouldn't have done that well sometimes you'll hear yourself like on a podcast if you get really lit like when we did that sober October podcast I saw one of the clips yeah drunky words I saw the clip oh my god we were blasted we're in orbit oh really oh you're so hammered it's so stupid because I want to be like a gentleman that can drink and yes hold its alcohol and be like sir if that was your goal you have achieved it Cheers happy holidays because you don't seem and you did it more than I did today and you seem exactly the same as when we started I think you're projecting there was one point when after you smoked a lot you were going like that's what I did I kid you I could tell was a bit of a body hi well that weight is strong [Music] I think there's benefit to it I don't think there's like I don't think you should do everything all the time but I think this benefit I don't think you should exercise all the time either I'll tell you this when I was flying back from New York yesterday and knew he had this when I was on the flight I was thinking it would be so nice to bring a bottle of wine just chill with the guys and this that would be so happy and now that we're in that moment yes so happy me too so happy it's a good place I'm worried about Jamie's hips Jamie's hips so bogging you know that's alright actually helped a lot really it's laying on it and breathe in and yeah you know I have not used that yet I bought two of them about one for the house and one for the gym but that it's a what's called the so right like for your so ass muscle so you lay on it and have it like massage your inner gut area it works well apparently that's like a muscle that gets knotted up on people and I had it I definitely got it get knotted up on me when I was I was running a little too often I was running like four or five days a week it was starting to knot up yeah that's like a foam roller but like if you could have an elbow on that foam yeah and you lay on it on your back a couple different spots do they have like a spot in your shoulders in the front but yeah I don't know whatever my pelvis area yeah that looks be slurred it helped right you feel good though it's good yeah you got it it's weird the human body's all manipulable oh yeah malleable that's why Yoga is so good oh yeah stretching in general like all that shit so good but it's just so weird how like deep tissue massage and all that stuff works and how your body's like pliable yeah break stuff yeah sweeten things up and someone is really good at it if you get a gal knows how to use them elbows man I started running with my dog with my lab yeah and but I run on the road and the sidewalk right is on do you feel like I feel so guilty sometimes that it's got its little paws out just running on the road um-hmm is it hot you were now like to hurt no no it's the hardness of it mmm which streets maybe I never thought he doesn't seem unhappy she seems like she's havin a blast well it's definitely not as good as running the dirt race not I mean probably for us either no for now it's definitely not yeah it's definitely not it's weird you know there's not as much give whenever I see people running in the cities I go I get it you want to exercise yeah as you decided to make this whole world your gym well sure the other day he was crossing Wilshire it's just no shirt on t-shirt earbuds just one of them one of those dudes is doing this taking his pulse runs across light turns green he's just using the strip this is like 4:30 in the afternoon yeah rush hour and he's used in this place as his gym that's why I like running bird that's why I like running cuz as soon as you go out you're doing it any other nice body too we want to let bitches know he did who's slim and fit I don't get the that's what it was about probably more than totally through well Cheryl peacock move yeah no shirt on and it was just running around do you do yoga with your shirt off or ons right off off with all the gals there they don't give a fuck dude they're suffering everyone's suffering yeah everybody always keep my shirt on because I always feel like as a man I'm not supposed to be there so it should just make it less is a man you not supposed to be there even after you the remarks you heard by Bikram I'm well they don't but yeah everybody does look it's just too fucking hot it's too hot you don't want to have a shirt on you're that wet fucking hot thing yeah smothering you you know I might do the regular I don't do the hot hot one I want to see you in a jog bra Pro why can't a man wear something that just like like let go of covers is like a sweatband for your tits yeah it's called bra okay forgot to wear a bracelet what kinda is some bracelets yeah but it's okay for you to wear when I'm tennis wrist things yeah it was like they were like a real band yeah those headbands for your wrist I thought I was the coolest fucking I had those wristbands with red white and blue on them like that's right tube socks pull high up to the knee all the way those things called would you cross bands like tennis wristband yeah the headband and the wristband and they'd man yeah I probably had a headband too I had I had one that was pretty badass you know what was a big it wasn't too though you just go the one you just go on the left that was the cool move there was a time I don't remember what the time was but there's a time when vibe that's it right there sock tower lower two pieces large next time Tom pop and I do a podcast and wear them red white and blue wristbands they'd be awesome I literally had that fresh very fresh it felt cool yeah it's real cool it's gonna say something wrist band marijuana combination love being allowed to wear him happy for a guy working out sweat boobs thrown a lot of information so words that yeah why is it okay for a man to walk around with no shirt on and women can't was that what you're gonna say well there's that's obvious we women they definitely can but I've talked about this before I think I said I would just I wouldn't recommend it to a friend well I feel like don't go out there kids hanging out yeah if a friend tried to ask me if they think they should exercise that right to freedom I feel like it's I don't want you harassed you'd only get harassed right like I would would you wear like bikini underwear walk through a gay neighborhood on Saturday night at 10:30 p.m. when the ecstasy just kicked in your piece of meat how good do you think you'd feel walking through August SuperDuper gay neighborhood with like little bikini briefs on a sentence for whatever reason you obviously shave your chest it's funny though your chest is smooth this baby but but your back has hair on it it's funny because you're setting it up as a predatory kind of scenario but all I'm thinking is would they think that was okay would they like me would you be pumped or disgusted you know you'd be you didn't want the hassle that's what I tell my yeah I mean yes sir I understand that there's like a cool movement now and it's a time where women should be able to go out there and dress the way you want to dress it's not their problem it's the guys problem let's correct the guys rather than us right I love that but there's a lot of guys that haven't been corrected yet who are gonna hassle you and follow you in the parking lot yeah that's the problem those guys aren't woke once everyone's all well it'll be dangerous word to use I feel like people gonna mock it in the future woke woke yeah I feel like using woke now like an ironically it's super slippery I see a trap coming you do the jiu-jitsu practitioner and me it's like I don't like this move this is I know where this leads I see that I'm like what are you woke what the fuck does that even make up you woke up what are you 12 well it comes for my 16 year old so yeah kids today but what is welcome beam it means your brain is open you're open to stuff your problem is there's no real quantification there's no real there's no test you take the show that if you're whoa right right like you want to be a mathematician you have the fucking show that you know do math the professors check your work but you get through like yes congratulations Tom Papa you are a mathematician your PhD in mathematics it says right here on the paper like goddammit I'm gonna put this shit on my wall so you understand I know how this stuff works yeah but woke miss yeah anybody can claim to be a master of woke Ness it's like kung fu without fighting it's very dangerous ya know find what's Woking what's preposterous no one's defined by what's what's just not racist and not sexist and not homophobic but open-minded and aware of the the failings and the misgivings of all sides all right and with no bias right is that what cuz doesn't seem like it is isn't that woke I think you just described what I thought it was I would like that but too many people can jump in there's no there's no real clear understanding of like what makes and constitutes someone being woke like yeah how many of those boxes do you have to check stop Tom Papa had awoke Academy right and you took these people do you like bread or not like bread claiming whoa dude super slippery what's this Jane 62 New York Times Magazine our dig it look if you're woke you dig it oh man the perfect definition right Jane if you're woke you dig it that is insane that was my Fox man and you were copying my taste and grit don'tjump salty on me whoa look how they talked back then they were trying to talk people into talking in a way that made them seem more interesting I'm gonna say it the way I would say if I live back then hey could you be the guy on the left Jimmy no no no scroll is so we could read that whether his comments yeah what he's saying up top yeah okay that was that was my Fox man and you were noting that my Grace and great so how would you say that now that was my Fox man you a cop in my tasting of course it's girls yeah that's my girl yes thing no that's what they said I would use what words would use today yeah yeah he would say the fuck he doing with my girlfriend dickhead and he said don't jump salty on me I would say we're cool no worries no worries stop being such a bitch it's all good it's all good yeah and then it'll be like what someone's a bitch and then next thing you know people be hitting each other that's a darkness no men who are these two gentlemen to the risers of left it says Noah Webster I think that might be like Webster's dictionary ah Peter 1 Peter in the in the dictionary this squirrelly the letters are all blurred right I love that I love that doors if you're woke you dig it yeah if you're woke you dig it that's that sums it up man if you're woke you dig it after how did you find this Jam you go back to that typed and it's like know your meme Wow so the meme of the word woke yeah Wow look at that little image though scroll burger yeah that's so strange like imagine if that was contemporary yeah if that was your word like imagine if hipsters all sudden started wearing tails to their jackets yeah bowties and those tails it wouldn't be surprising because that's all about just I'm doing what you guys don't do so I'm going tails what a weird look though it is is so weird that's a look that like okay so like the guy in the center it's like Alex and Ani a-- those two guys both look guys in the center those guys will fly today Oh totally the guy in the left that looks like he's dressed like he's uh that looks like me on the road yeah but he looks like look using a Quinton Tarantino movie or something yeah he's Reservoir dog looks totally normal right black matrix black suit tie saddled or I could go to any restaurant anywhere and no one would even bat an eye they go host sir can I help you boom right in image good guy next to him but those two guys on the ends like what in the fuck are they he's got a a coat with tails yeah and those pants that are like flat across your crotch where it looks like given privates here's good way to look at it imagine you datin a gal and your pants got come over you know like you're really gonna love my dad he's an amazing guy he's real old-school dressed like that with coattails yeah and you start feeling like you're like you're in that movie get out he's got a handlebar mustache he's got tails yeah weird weird pants what they go into funny shoes you see get out yeah I finally watched it during sober October oh you did fucking fantastic yeah that's but that's what you'll be thinking if that's guys was dressed like that but the daughter was gonna lead you to something you have to run for your life but it is weird how like that suit has lasted yeah a long time well this was 1960 so I'm assuming that it was mocking the style of old so by the time 1960 rolled around the guys in the middle were dressed contemporary but the guys in the end like making fun of people the way they used to dress yeah kind of in a way or at least that's what represents those people well yeah they just defines their time that guy was probably around the 1800s it's just other guys are do you know who those guys are I believe Noah Webster Webster dictionary scratching his head is that guys putting out his slang so his slang is making Webster what the fuck that's not how you really say it so it would be like the urban dictionary like oh right Jamie and I sometimes get confused we have to pull up the urban dictionary and find out what the real word of a word means so let's pull up woke yeah represented today you know well no disrespect no cultural appropriation intended the fact that it was invented actually in the 60s is really weird it's just making a comeback like looking around when I typed it like what does a woke to see if there's anything if you dig it you woke mmm was to say we're knowledgeable about your community in the world with the willingness to access and critique systems of oppression yeah well that the end of this party is tomorrow yeah exactly yes I mean for sure if it really is a system of oppression but how do we decide what's a system of oppression and what is sounds like a nice Jordan Peters weird human behavior that represents that what do you manage interact with each other on a grand scale I mean that's is like I there are some legitimate systems of oppression yeah for real so figure out which one it is yeah before but putting that in like that's what woke is like how do you do how do you define what the systems like where does it where's the line get drawn right is the line hmm like why do women have certain jobs why do men have certain jobs how much of that is because of influence how much of that's because of their choices how much of that is just because of natural proclivities towards certain things well then you're talking about people that are coming after the hierarchy and if they're coming after the hierarchy who's to say that those people aren't part of the problem I love Jordan Peterson though it's just like hammers just yeah well then what do you what are you saying then who are you what do what are you you you buying into the hierarchy you just love like the exasperation in his voice no but it's true it's like then this true that that woke definition was like oh I'm with you this is all about being nice and kind and then at the end it's about attacking right well here's the crazy thing is the end part about attacking is where it gets weird because Jordan Peterson is a guy who gets regularly attacked yeah misrepresented like especially in terms of like that he's somehow another racist because some racists like him I've heard that argument it's a crazy argument doesn't make any sense yeah he's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination he believes in individuals yeah I mean he's more iron Rand yeah then I never say that right I know her name is iron Rand but I would say I'm drained instinct to fuck it up but it really is like his thing is it's like the power of the individual and responsibility and doing your thing yes and he's forced during this time of course he's under time but he's also under celebration yeah he's under he means been celebrated as well as attacked but much more celebrated it's under celebration where he's under attack he nice to hear that viewpoint articulated in such a clear concise way he's a genuine sweetheart of a guy yeah I mean I think if people knew him I think you know part of the thing is some of his views are very powerful and polarizing to some folks they have a specific idea of how things are and what things should bring in what what represents transphobia what represents sexism and you know these are all fascinating discussions as long as everybody is like just being rational and yeah and being honest about it but yeah it's good it's moving it's yeah it's it's moving the discussion forward it's like you should hear all sides and you should hear I mean what he's saying is you know in a lot of ways it's like very true and very real and it's like right but the presentation of it in these times it's like but he's very brave because he knows that anything he says there's gonna be a shitstorm in response well he's very brave in that respect but he's also very brave in that he's done a tremendous amount of research on all those different subjects he was talking about and when he talks about something from a scientific perspective he's not talking about it because it aligns with his beliefs right and he will in fact highlight things that don't align with his beliefs mhm and show that he has a hole in some of his thinking he'll he'll heal pause in mid-sentence and goes well I guess I'm wrong then right safe to go yeah and he does he has a hundred percent intellectual honesty yeah he's just he's not scared to take on this system of the way people think and behave and this system works both for a really progressive open-minded people that support most of the things that you and I probably support and it also the system is also in place for people that have more stringent conservative viewpoints yeah we have to look at everybody honestly right if you want to debate whether someone's opinions or one thing or the other yeah absolutely I'm with you 100% the problem is we start calling someone a racist yeah and calling someone a racist because you think that racists like him or calling someone a sexist because you think that sexist like him yeah or because he says says things that you don't agree with if you don't agree with them and you just dismiss them at this like as is really shallow sexist opinion the problem is other people are gonna read what you're saying they're gonna look into it and it's gonna seem silly right because the guy has volumes and volumes and volumes that you could read and that he has books he has all these different lectures where he discusses these things podcast really discusses things in really complex and well-thought-out ways you can't you can't say his race and what's just fortunate what's unfortunate is that he presents this stuff we should then our responsibility is to deal with the stuff deal with the ideas yeah not what does it matter who he is how he talks what is what you've been ger and who cares but the problem is the idea was the idea is what we should all then oh thank you take it whether you like it or not take it and then wrestle that idea and move it for 100% but we also have to be aware there's a real problem in calling someone a monster is not a monster right because then when real monsters come along yeah you already use that word up right that's this is like you have to be careful because there's real racists in the world there's real bad people yeah so calling someone a bad person just cuz you don't agree with them you fall into a very slippery ideological trap and a lot of times people do it just to get attention yeah they want to throw their hat into the ring they want they're there they're there say they want they want to get it out they want to make an impact they want that love yeah they want to be part of that they want to be part of the discussion and they might have very strong beliefs that they think are correct but I I guarantee if you if that those strong beliefs are that Jordan is a racist you don't know him well there's no way you could write is in there's no way you're really familiar with a lot of the things that he says about race right because he doesn't say anything racist he talks in terms of I mean he always emphasizes individuals yeah that's the most important thing that's that iron ran thing it's not about that it's a it's about the person you responsible for you doing you despite whatever comes at you because everything's always going to come at you yes and it's not a denial of racism racism is fucking horrible but what it is is a saying that like we can all we can all figure out a better way to navigate this then the shitty way that racists and bad people have done in the past right you know it was kind of racist I was I wanted to put African Americans in my Christmas village couldn't and you go online and try and look up African American figurines for whatever it's it's not good they haven't talked about not yet woke you go there are there they're prisoners there's prisoners there's like worker like there's not a lot of like just regular families there's definitely a lot more freedom of white people ok let's let's guess this let's guess this before we look it up yeah because this might be one of them untapped things that people forgot to get outraged about yeah is it possible that you can buy ceramic slave yes do you think so uh-huh well through a store maybe not on the Internet eBay for sure really yes you know how much stuff was put out into the culture of like alfalfa kind of representations of kids and slave children and how about that there was I mean I went through my grandmother's like keepsakes at one point it's like a shoebox of stuff and she just had a postcard from her friend it was to like black kids eating watermelons and I was like Grandma what is what the hell is this I was like you know 15 she's like oh it's just a joke but she wasn't it I only bring it up because that was circulated that was being pumped out all the time in the culture so there's definitely stuff you can get second-hand on eBay who's got a big smile on his face for a lot of different slave stuff like Roman slaves and slaves like long as their white slaves were good they would give me something so like Roman slaves that addressed like they were in that growling slaves gladiator movie oh yeah yeah gives your slave yeah you have to fight here okay so this is non it's not American so all those slaves are like that's isn't it interesting like it can't be like it's got to be like I didn't do it I don't fucking put them guys none of my people made them people slaves fucked up bro right like you have - yeah Middle Eastern you know ancient starts getting a little squirrel 100 BC Oh Rose rose but those are white people they're great they're gray 3d printed they haven't been painted they look like ordinary font they're up to them the person who buys them you know to make them as accurate as they write they look like Henry Fonda Douglas they had some white ass features though white hair they got white people hair you know I mean just put up racist don't want certain things typed in now exactly you know it's like that like that Alexa think you have an Alexa at home yeah Alexis listen them right now I know that bitch my friend told me like you really should just you really should take that off and I'm like why I'm like it's only when I talk she's like no they listen all the time there was another murder case and they confiscated the Alexa because they know the Alexa will have information from the last four days up to the murder that's crazy yeah that's crazy but it still plays my music so I'm keeping it so this is what is this a doll that you could make a slave it's like it's not like I can play Playmobil or something Lego ripoff hes got Lego hands chain around his neck I'd be mad if I bought that I thought was a Lego not funny like even it was you're a kid your parents like you said I want Legos and your parents brought you that you're like bitch this is not Legos some wack-ass they're supposed to represent a pirate who was formerly a slave in historical context it's easy to write that sentence than to make a new Lego a former slave in a historical context come on that is what does that mean I don't know that me represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context that means he escaped I know but that's a weird way to put it isn't it yeah isn't that weird it's so ridiculous racist toy instructions that's the news title other question mark yeah it was a fucking misleading news title yeah racist toy instruction - then after the break it made a fairly light notice how conservative they were you know they didn't make him super dark yeah even they knew that was some we can make them kind of brownish that guy looked like he had a tan looks like he was uh like a Spaniard yeah you know like okay nigga Montoya yeah you kill my father prepare to die like that's what he looked like like a Spaniard on a holiday with a caught a nice tan are you saying even the racist toy maker was like now dude don't go too dark yes I'm saying the racist toy maker was like you know what we just got a we got a play it's a goat this color yeah go with shoot for Guatemala that's it that's all I'm looking for do you go to Mass on Christmas no no mass at all I go to Willy Wonka's golden Chocolate Factory well it's all nonsense man why would I do that I'm just asking tradition because he grew up there no I never grew up that way we didn't have Church yeah we did blues for a very short amount of time to say I grew up that way would be hard because it was I was out by the time I was out of first grade oh yeah we're talking about putting me back in for second grade but we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco uh-huh and we didn't find a Catholic school you know Catholic schools cost money too you know you're right what the public school after that but I was just done I hated it yeah I I was in fear of those fucking crazy people and your parents didn't take you to church or make you good they did a little bit I think the idea was back then that if you had kids he wanted kids go to Catholic school you know there's a lot of people that did that in that neighborhood it was just a normal thing you did yeah and they were more strict and dude one thing that was for sure though like I had a conversation with my mom about it once she was like you know your grades were way better when you in your Catholic school I was like yeah it was fucking terrified wrong they beat the shit out of all live like that they never beat me and then they definitely threatened me really yeah they threatened to make me sit on a nail you gonna have to sit on a nail and the in the closet stay here all night I hope you brought your blanket they're like really mean when you're like a little six-year-old kid like that's fucked up it's just a weird oh it's feeling this to be stuck with these people for nine months and also from me it's like my parents are splitting up at the time so it's very confusing yeah and then I wanted things to have ordered to them so I wanted God to make sense I remember annoying people with that yeah like six years old I didn't know any people talking about what God wants what do you mean like you if God says this God wants that like I would say that oh you would bug six years old yeah right because I was a little kid who's dealing with my parents splitting up and there didn't seem to be any order in the world I was very nervous right so when I find when I went to Catholic school when I first got there I was I was happy that I was gonna go to Catholic school but then as I experienced it at six years old I started going this is ridiculous this isn't making any sense like first of all these people are so mean they're they're obviously being mean and nasty they're not comforting right and I was thinking as a six year old comparing them the way like my grandma was my mother was like these are these ladies are nasty right why is being so mean and I'm like these they don't represent God and I was like this is crazy right at six and then you can see kids getting in trouble because their parents hadn't paid for their lunch or this gun and there was like this really you tell your father to get that money in like there was a resinous to it that just didn't seem loving or it didn't seem like what I thought of when I thought of you know Christ and what I thought of really it seemed to me like oh no this is a dark little trap Wow it sucked into so that's what's remarkable about that is not just the age but that you went from really really needing it in a very real way cuz what was happening with your family to like normally you wouldn't turn that quickly like within a year that sounds yeah but - yeah it was over by the time I was out usually that change doesn't happen for 15-20 years well out side of beating me or doing something sexual to me the this the mindfuck of dealing with his mean nasty ladies scare the shit out of me yeah they're crying they were calling me a baby because I was crying oh whoa just not knowing how to deal with human beings when you're a six-year-old and this is going down you're like what have I done yeah I went from always being with my mom or being with my grandma my grandfather I was like everything's cool and then a sudden you go in school and this is what you're doing in school I didn't go to kindergarten I went to first grade that was the first thing I went to right so all sudden the first grade is like instantaneously being connected these crazy ladies Jesus I was like oh no yeah poor and then I would think about them I don't think what kind of like and I was think about why they so mean I remember being like six years old thinking this way I'm sorry nobody probably loves them like they don't get they don't have a family yeah they don't have to know off a boyfriend you know I didn't think at the time didn't have a girlfriend but maybe they do holla right but yeah sure they didn't the whole thing was that they didn't you know they didn't have any no connection with another human planet going to be lonelier or it more anger inducing yeah I was just dark they weren't they weren't loving people you know any of your children I asked about it they bring it up we've talked about God yeah my basic take is Jordan Peter said said something really lovely he said he behaves as if God is real he behaves as if God exists interesting not that he believes God exists cuz that's sort of a it's a bit of an intellectual trap right and you say do you believe God exists like okay what define God no then you're in the weeds yeah because do you think that I think that there's a city in the clouds no I don't write no I don't do what do you think that there's an energy is it possible yeah there's something bigger than all this thing mold is bigger than everything like if you talk to an ant and said hey man you think there's cities and skyscrapers and airplanes like what do you fucking moron get out of here bitch I'm trying to drag this dead bug around how are you talking anyway time for the fucking galaxy talk yeah first I get the fuck out of here with your 5g bitch at a time dragging this bug yeah so I mean in our perspective when we're talking about things no it's like we're we're so small the way we interface with reality so crude even though it's amazing yeah but I like the idea of the not going into the whole intellectual discussion about God but just like yeah just you know who know just kind of act like he does exist so great when it does make you it does make you act a little kinder yeah it's uh it's like a parent figure it's like okay we're not gonna do this because it's gonna make them unhappy I try to do what I like that when I'm at my best I try to treat people as if they're me living another life treat treat people as if they're just you know don't think people as a bother or don't and it's hard to do it's hard to do especially when you're busy or when you have your kids with you or when you're trying to get something done yeah it's hard to do I try and walk walk around thinking everybody is drowning in insecurity right that really kind of makes me give people a pass in the biggest and smallest ways everybody when you see people hustling do whatever businessman businesswoman looks like she's on top of her game yep person like on the subway who's obviously going someplace they don't want to go with no money in their pocket if you realize we're all just drowning and insecurity it just makes you just give them a little bit of a pass that that's been where my head's at been at lately that's a great place to keep your head because we all are everyone's balled up everyone even the person you yeah my are the most it's like ah well you know we're talking about earlier about the traps that you fall into as you're trying to achieve and do things you're also following the traps even with things that you love and you can get so caught up in you know the things that you love that you kind of forget to keep your you know your your your your when you're at your best like when what feeling keep that in close range yeah if you feel like getting away from you because you're too tired because you're working too much yeah he's like pull that back yeah keep keep it at close range where you are operating at your best but be respectful of that right and I think this is something that I've been guilty of in the past I wasn't respectful of the energy that's required to be at your best mm-hmm I just figure that like I'll just do these other things yeah but the only I really firmly believe you only have so much bandwidth in a day and this is coming from a person who pushes their bandwidth too hard all the time I think you only have so much in a day and when you get to a certain state you wind up diminishing a lot and then I think you want to diminishing a lot of the other things that you do like if you if you have like seven things cooking in the background on your phone it's not going to move as fast really actually does work that way some computers but people do that too you have too many things cooking at the same time yeah we all do all the time all the time and then you take 20 minutes of transcendental meditation and take your nervous system and put it on restart and just let it wash out this thing your hands-free coming out let it wash out 20 minutes okay because we're all under that all the time a hundred percent frazzled no matter how hard you're pushing or just coasting three o'clock in the afternoon two o'clock in the afternoon four o'clock in the afternoon that nervous system shot right we're all the same how do you 20 minutes what do you do talk me through you take your nervous system and it's the result of it is you come out and you've rebooted the system and you can now have a good part of the second part of your day do you have a technique used to use an app do you know I went to I I went to a transcendental meditation teacher whoa and in without the hippie dippie that's the biggest part of it it literally makes you realize just what you said we're all just frazzled and running out of steam at a certain point you know your nervous system is shot all that stuff that's happened just between 7:00 o'clock and 3 o'clock whatever would happen you're that nervous system has been dealing with a ton of stimulus all day long that meditation gives you a reboot and you can't it it's it's like a needed thing that's better than sleep that you that you're it actually yearns for hmm I'm telling you since I really started dialing it in and did it it uh the best way I can describe it is that it added another four hours to my day whoa yeah how so because I would just be limping across the finish line I'd be exhausted I'd be trying to do and with motivation and I work really hard I would push through and get to maybe you know two hours more of what I needed to accomplish and you do this effortlessly without struggle I'm able to just sail like I did between nine and twelve that day really yes a hundred percent do you think by using this practice you're alleviating tension so you're more efficient with your energy like what makes you that's part of it but it really is it really is taking this nervous system that is dealing with the outside world all the time mm-hmm and just giving it a real practical way to shut down flatline and then come back on the grid yeah yeah and it it like your physical body needs a rest your things need to be rebooted your nervous system is kind of this thing that operates all the time that we're not really that conscious of we're not really that aware that how hard it's working and this is a way to pay attention to it and give it a chance to regenerate that's interesting and long you been doing this you know I meditated for like since college just out of reading books and then probably about three years ago my friend said who always did Transcendental Meditation he said go just see if it dials you in it actually the stuff you are doing the way you talk about meditating it sounds more it sounds like you're doing too much work just go talk to this guy and I did for like three four sessions I went and just talked to this guy here in LA who's a transcendental meditation teacher and he just explained it and dialed me in on it and for the last three four years I've been just I haven't missed a day and three or four years yeah day every day seven days seven days no cheat day no cheat day how long no need for me to it's the opposite of what you want from a cheat day it's like 20 minutes where if you can get to in that's the best if you can get one in the morning and one in the afternoon then you're like Superman Wow but if you can get one in I'm telling you start to finish how long 20 20 minutes 20 and you do this every day every day every day maybe that makes sense man because one of the things that people remark about you is how easygoing you are like that like people said dude I love and tom pappas on your podcast is so easygoing like that you guys gel so well together you flow together yeah it's like you're you're tuned into so just present together we're just you know we're both you know yeah you're kind of not struggling right and that's what it teaches you you just cut this is a big Roaring River yeah and it lets you just kind of go underneath catch your breath and then come back up into it yeah do you feel that way when you exercise do you feel like when you're exercising you get into like a zone and you you reset your brain for sure I feel less I feel less depressed when I exercise yeah like if I'm gonna funk and I'm like and I go for a run I'm like my days different yeah it's weird it's almost like that funk is trying to hold on to control - it's weird yeah so it gets tricking your brain yeah do you feel like shit today let me just put these goddamn shoes on and go run yeah you know you feel so good but the meditation is different the meditation is like the the run will give me energy I won't feel so shitty I'm like I'm okay you know I feel good I feel alive and whatever but the meditation in a very subtle way five hours later when you're faced with a stressful situation you don't feel as just as you normally would yeah because it's just your name your nervous system which is very powerful has been rebooted is now able to go and deal with another situation hmm you should go see him okay I'll do it I'll give you the name of the guy he's a mate I mean he's not amazing it's not a guru it's not the one sperm guy it is not about him one minute it's not about a religion it's not about a people or a drop of much sperm this guy does will not give you his sperm he's just delivering the message of this little practice which is very it's not hippie dippie it's very practical practical you can use it yeah it's that's the best part of it um would you be if you tried the tank before the float tank no would you be interested in doing it you know we have one here you can use it anytime you want like I would like to hear what your take on it is yeah especially yeah especially if you wanted to practice those techniques in there yeah I think they'll be really interesting it's crazy environment man that would be great yeah you should do it I'll do it yeah for sure not today I'm drunk no there's a there's also you know there's a bunch of big places around too there's a float lab down in Venice and they have wood at Westwood and then what's the big place that's in Pasadena has the biggest one in the world people like I'm in like a gym yeah blows yeah you sign up go in there and float pass what he's got a giant just flow yeah just float in Pasadena shoot don't think have like 40 fucking float tanks or some crazy shit I don't know how many they have but I think they use all float lab stuff too that would be cool you know it's another interesting thing if you get the morning one and you know how sometimes you wake up you've slept you went to bed at 11 right you're up at 7:00 but you're exhausted cuz your night sleep was restless you've got up to pee a couple times Munoz you look back at your bed it was just a disaster you do those 20 minutes before you go about your day just before the kids get up just get 20 minutes in mm-hmm it's like a you it was more valuable than what you tried to accomplish in the eight hours spinning around in the sheets like especially for someone like you right who's is to create things yeah right to put your mindset into put into a particular place it's super beneficial if you're just creating things on time totally but it's for everybody right right right it's literally like yeah we're all just human beings just struggling every day going out doing all this stuff and it's like you could be you know a single mom living in a city taking the bus to work after dealing with your kids and go her nervous system is being bombarded yeah 20 minutes just to kind of sitting there on the bus you could do it on the bus by your with all this other it's not a pristine thing it's not a hippie thing it's not an um I was gonna say elegant but it is kind of elegant it's not a special thing it really is just like like a controlled damp in a way and it'll it just gives you more to go on we're all everybody no matter what you're creating no matter what you're doing we're all under assault all the time right yeah I mean not you know we don't equate it to war but there's like bombardments of your energy and stuff that's coming after you all the time you have to kind of tend to the system that's dealing with that yeah I think anything that gives you a perspective reshift or reboot is great yeah anything and whether it's going for a swim in the ocean and whatever the fuck it is yeah something that gives you a perspective reboot we yeah we get caught in some pretty gross ruts you know perspective reboot is a cool way to say it yeah I think we have these views of the world sort of we have this um these these patterns that we sort of recognize we see them they're out there and we get locked into them and we're just visiting the same websites and seeing the same people and doing the same things every day yeah and sometimes you need something different yeah some yeah the knock you out you need something that gets you to think about other stuff ya know maybe it's going to a place that this is why I travel so good I used to never get travel when I was a kid yeah I was like what the fuck wants to travel like being home but one of the I do like being home but one of the things about travel is it allows you experience the feel of someone's culture in real life like you're walking through the streets of Cologne Germany like you're like wow this is how these people live yes crazy yeah walk through the streets of Rome takes your side of yourself yeah it gives you this first of all it gives you this appreciation that there's different rules over here but these are still people modern people just like you yeah and then some of your ancestors came from here waiting but here they are where there's different rules millions of them millions of them then they got people that are coming into them from Africa and it's like whoa this is crazy I guess this whole thing is like fascinating this is and then you're about around you know Pompeii and you're seeing the ruins that we Mount Vesuvius erupted yeah all these people and you're wandering through all this stuff like this is fascinating yeah it's a long way from thinking about the three apps that you sit on your phone every day and get your news and get your thing and check your Instagram and check your face yeah that's a whole nother whole nother mind-blower oh my god it's a whole universe of other stuff to think about yeah that's why I love walking in New York like you have your routines of like where you're walking just get on the other side of the street and go the other direction you're a wild man it's a hold of the world just literally like when you're on your run with your dog and you if you just look the other way from when you normally are like doing your thing hmm it's a whole nother perspective it's a whole nother world it's crazy but literally just looking the other way running the other direction it's it's true but look wait it's it's not a small thing because we like the order we like that provides calm and safety mm-hmm if you're just going that same route all the time but then there's a limit I guess and you end up it starts acting negatively on your life and you're right if you're just a constant vagabond traveling around the globe that's probably not not positive either right yeah always going on there having a home I love home yeah I love home too I love home which is so weird in an in a career where we have to travel so much you know but don't you think that I like to say like equate it to good and evil but that there's some weird sort of balance in this life and that we do really have to experience negative things to appreciate positive things for what they really are if everything is positive if you're the lottery winner when you're five yeah yeah and you win that golden power ticket five hundred million Shammi when you're five years old and it's all made then you don't have to imagine that you growing up it ruined your life like listen little Tommy you never have to work again it would ruin your life are you talking about grandpa bought you a lottery ticket when you were five yeah if you'd be so nice to give us some of that money that would be nice but you have seven hundred and ninety million dollars like what grandpa yeah grandpa put it in a trust and it's all yours and you can have it yeah when you turn 18 but you could give us some of it now we'd be fucked yeah growing up being like Richie Rich yeah you'd be a mess you'd be like what the fuck be a mess you know a face full of cocaine chasing this feelings that you can't get just from practical everyday work remember that fucking commercial that cartoon Richie Rich oh yeah his comic books every day that every hit the Jersey sure I get his comic books he always had new ones that's gotta be one of the weirdest cartoons of all time a really rich kid really wins all the money in the world well all the poor kids would read it and go

cream sundae is in the very top yeah he's wearing the same clothes that we were mocking though that's right he's wearing the tails get up get up see I used to think about a guy like that like in the shining or something like that yeah and there's some Butler and I would think of oh that's a proper man that's a man that he's the guy from the shining and he's just gonna come over and be proper be a normal normal but then as I got older I realized like oh no no that's a guy it's just a guy and this guy is this fucked up job whereas to dress like he lives in another time period and wait on all these rich white people like what yeah it's a tortured man right there okay if you were a serious black rapper like one of them guys with diamond teeth wouldn't you get a diamond cold white servant like that guy yeah that's all white Butler's yes just like super super high-end guys England yeah professionals it's true I don't think he's a professional but lesser hilarious I love diamond teeth

lot of pictures of his lovely wife that would be a perfect picture for gucci mane his wife honey dollar bill behind him holla dollar bill y'all took a change it's so weird right what a crazy idea for a comic strip Bay Area rapper named Richie Rich so oh there you go yeah I don't remember being like you weren't really sending a message like money isn't important awesome when you want to be rich II get ice cream whatever you wanna do there's always the thing to they're always getting ice cream Cadbury the perfect Butler frightfully fits oh yes mrs. rich one should keep fit I exercise all the
