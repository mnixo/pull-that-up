- good hello Angela what's going on I was amazing you get those headphones on I was wondering you got the best afro in the game for sure very close yeah condenses I mean cuz sans got me beat the Alex he gets crazy yeah that's my goal as those are my hair goals is to get like a nice big like fluffy fro like his when he fights I always wonder like I get that seems like it would be harder to pull out of things don't you think no it's actually it's kind of like a you know those connecting joints where it's like it's kind of like a big ball that goes in but like when you pull it out it's like a lot easier it pulls out easier yeah it's kind of like a like a giant like that so like you think you have a good grip but then the hair just like you know if you put grease in your hair or hair conditioning or anything that makes it extra slippery right yeah I guess but like it's it's pretty it's just the fact that it can go small even though it doesn't look like it I feel like people think they have a better grip than they do like I'm like my I think my title fighted Invicta the girl locked on like maybe three or four guillotines and every time I was just like just like popped out if you look up going this deep is diva like I swear to god my afro gets me out of tight situations it's interesting with women fighting like there's options and one of the options is clothes like the way you wear your upper - like your top yeah have a big impact if you're a grappler yeah I always felt well I guess I don't feel like that anymore because I realize like we'll fold like the costume malfunctions and stuff it can be a big deal especially if you're like really packing you know but I used to like hate on girls who will fight and share it so I'm like come on man you're a fighter like let's just stomach out like this is like a fight fight cuz like things get tangled up and stuff yeah like especially if the shirt isn't like super tight or like even the girl that I'm fighting in Ã¶calan she she has something weird where like I think the other girl was like their shirt so like in between the first and second round they took a shirt off this is like fuck it this is like kind of messing up your groove well you get in options right it's not like there's that you have to have your midriff exposed which is kind of interesting because it should be uniform shouldn't it I mean women's MMA is the only place where you can make a choice to be stickier right if you're a grappler in particular if you have like a full shirt on you you can definitely hold on to someone better yeah I think so I don't know I feel like just a boob thing you know you can't have sits out like that and that as a fighter like it's okay for the ring cargos you know walk around the cleavage out but the fighters like I don't know they're trying to I guess make it more of an like okay these girls are athletes so don't don't stare at the cleavage well there's your you know basically in your underwear almost yeah pretty much pretty much bathing suits but I don't know I always had this joke of like my teammates that I was gonna get famous by being like the Nick the nip slipper like I would use like certain like muy Thai clinch techniques to just like pop the girls move out so I'd always get to fight the popular girls because like they knew oh she's fighting Paige Vanzant we're gonna see some patrons antony's you know and now it just like you know raised my style I haven't done it though but really I try it on the guys in the gym the head lifts the shade up anybody ever done that on purpose in a fight no I think the one person that backfired with was I don't remember who she was fighting but Leslie Smith's boob pop out once do room yeah in in one of her and Victor fights and she did not give a fuck she's crazy yeah she was hanging off my god you can see into her head yeah yes don't stop the fuck you don't stop the photos like this girl's gangster she's insane I love I love it she's K and she's so like nice like such a hippie you know outside of that it was like a really funny what is she doing now she's still trying to start some mm a union yeah she still she's still going hard with the Union she's in Bellator now um but I think like the beginning that she was working on was only four years see fighters I believe hmm so I think she's still doing that I think she's still fighting for the UFC fighters even though she's not an EEOC does that what it's I haven't looked into that like I haven't looked at like what are they what do they want what are they trying to accomplish what's not correct that they want to fix I think just any any grievances that the fighters have in general so like health care salary just things that everyone kind of agrees on is like not good enough yet in the UFC I think those are the things that they're working towards how does health care work are you guys covered in training or you only covered for fights as far as I know if you book a fight and you get injured I think they cover it but I think it's also a gray area where like they could not cover it and they're not legally obligated to fix you but I think in the past they have I'm not sure I can't think of any any examples where they haven't like you know taking care of the medical expenses of someone who got hurt but I know like a lot of times fighters don't claim it in time like after fights or it's like a little nagging injury that becomes a big deal further down the line and it happened in the fight but they waited too long yeah yeah either that or just you know just wear and tear from training in general like you can't I can't go in for like a loose tooth or like or like a shoulder that I taught in practice if I wasn't getting ready for a fight what seems so crazy because you're obviously fighting in the UFC of a long-term contract yeah you've been fighting in the UFC for years if you're training you're training to fight in the UFC yeah and I think I think a lot of instances they still take care of the fighter but I know like if you're like on the lower end if you haven't really made a name for yourself yet sometimes you know even if you just don't ask like you don't get taken care of it's not like it's not in your contract once you sign like oh I'm gonna fight this many fights but there's nothing in there that says if I get injured after signing this contract I'm covered medically so um so yeah I think that was that was the main reason I was like oh this is a good idea just because like I know so many fighters who booked fights just to get their injuries taken care of mmm you know or they though fight injured and claim an old injury and like and that's their way of fixing whatever they broke during trainings that sucks it's horrible it's such a fucking crazy way to make a living period yeah you know it's like you're you're deciding you're gonna throw your bones at someone and try to break their arms you try to rip their legs apart and this and then you're gonna practice that all the time and then you're gonna hope you don't get hurt in practice to the point where you can't actually just go do it inside the Octagon yeah yeah exactly and most of my injuries happen outside a camp because I'm either training stupid training with someone I who I shouldn't be training was like someone too big or too inexperienced or or I'm just like fucking around like when I'm fighting someone who's my size is a lot less likely that I get injured right but when I'm throwing my bones like I said at somebody who's way bigger than it's easy I can hurt my hand punching them you know break my break my like or break my toe like kicking them you know that's for someone like you who fights at 115 pounds it's even more difficult right because the lack of people that are your size to train with in you're also trained a lot with men and it's and create it's crazy because at a professional level like you're you're right there you know you just beat the shit out of Hannah cyphers it was a crazy fight thank you but that was a big fight for you yeah like you're you're in the heat right now yeah means you're right there so for you you're you're you know you're at the top of the heap in this championship realm right and to train with people that are bigger than you or to take chances like that like there's no other sport that would have that yeah you know yeah and it's like the lack of women as well you know because even if I'm training with like a bantamweight if it's a woman like it's not as dangerous as training with like some of the bigger guys like the like guys and girls are kind of like different sizes like if I'm if I'm training with a guy who fights at 1:15 he's gonna be like four foot tall you know so it's a it's like the weight distribution is different but like I don't know something about I guess training with women like the strength the the force that's coming at you versus the force you're giving to them though I just feel like it's a lot safer to train with love it oh for sure for sure but some people think that the opposite is that if you train with men like say if you were trained with a bunch of bantamweight men yeah they would be bigger than you yeah they'd be stronger than you but you get used to that then you'd be used to men and then when you fight with women they would seem smaller and weaker yeah that's that was my old like theory so when I was at like My Little Gym in New York I was only training with guys like the girls I would come in they weren't at my level and that's the same story that most girls in the UFC have you know they were at the top of their heap they were like the baddest girl in the gym you know beaten up all the other girls and hang with the guys and that was me so it wasn't until I got on top that I realized like everyone has the same exact background so everyone's tough because they were training with guys and you start to underestimate like how tough a girl's gonna be in there like when you're fighting like tooth and nail like you know to the death is basically like what you're doing in the cage until the ref pulls you off you know and then it's all hugs but like when you're given like a hundred percent the key it feels like just as strong as a guy you know so it's good to like still have those checks and balances like okay like yeah maybe she's not as strong as the guys I trained with but she is going as hard as she can or she's defending it as hard as she can or you know she's taking my punches that I thought like oh if I drop this guy with this punch then this girl's gonna get dropped too and it's not the case like she's just a tougher tougher so it's it's like a weird thing where like you have like I don't know of you have different stats like stacked in some areas that guys don't and then they have stats stacked in areas that women don't so it's like it's like if I was it's like if I was like a bantamweight guy who only trained with like light heavyweights you know like you're gonna be faster you're gonna have like you're probably gonna be more technical just because you have to train with people that big so if you fuck up a technique it's not gonna work but those guys are still gonna be bigger and stronger and be able to like muscle you hold you down that kind of thing so I feel like that's like a similar difference particularly striking right like with with grappling there's some really little guys that are impossible to tap they just develop really crazy technique yeah but what's striking there's only so much you could do you know if you're a lightweight guy you're not sparring with Francis and Gahan Oh er he better be really really really nice exactly hey or you better be nice it's gonna work well no I've actually like been told off for going hard with the heavy weights like women when I was like you know just coming up like super green and like I was just like I'm gonna kill everyone in the gym there's a little thing like running at you throwing over hands and like it went it land like my coach would be like hey you got it you gotta relax cuz like you're landing over hands on this big guy if he does the same to you he's gonna put you out and I was like shit I never thought about that cuz I just assumed like he wouldn't yeah well no I'm not that I just assumed that make me landing a hard punch on a heavyweight isn't gonna hurt as much as me landing a hard punch on someone closer to my size Frisch it makes sense not like Oh your neck is bigger yeah you know so yeah but it's still like if the guy is getting rot then right that's if he gets bad and far astray yeah yeah if he's getting his head turned and that's what like it your chin can only take so much so it's like it's a lot less than like if I was throwing a body shot you know like that's it's a little easier to be mean right yeah you've obviously gone through some improvements and some change like what's changed with you over the last like four or five fights because you you keep getting steadily better but particularly the last two I think you should be on a four fight win streak because there was get out of pronounce her name down Union yeah down in down in Yin yeah she and she's on this card too oh yeah I thought that was a bad decision but you you had her locked up in the chat so I get sometimes when I want to do commentary people get mad at me like either the fighters or other people but that was one where fans of her got mad at me because you guys were right in front and you had her in a triangle and I was yelling pulled ahead I was yelling pull her head pull her head you had it locked up locked up I'm like she's got it she's got it she's got it I might pull the head pull the head and people like you fucking dick telling her to pull the head if I heard you I thought your recorder idiot so let's see we're literally right there yeah yeah it's like you had it really it was so locked in but I felt like that was a shit decision it wasn't the worst decision I've ever seen we've seen some really bad ones lately but it was it was not good it wasn't so that would have put you on a for fight win streak right the Hannah cipher is when Hannah ciphers is tough and she's like physically tough she's a like a strong girl yeah you know and when you got her down and smash it with those elbows was like something's going on but you're you're on another level do you feel it yeah I did I did I don't know it's uh I had a lot of like I don't know I guess ups and downs in my career like it's literally like up-down up-down like one loss and one loss and I think after the Randa fight I fought random Marko's about this time last year and and I was just so pissed at the way that went down because I was like super nervous going into it I felt like this that was gonna be a fight that kind of set me above the heap because Rand is so tough and she kind of has that same like up-down that I do so I'm like okay this is gonna set me apart I'm gonna get a streak going I'm this is gonna be the fight that puts me in the rankings and I and I put a lot of weight on it and and I had like ESPN following me that week too so I was just super nervous and like the entire time during the fight like I wasn't in the fight like I was overthinking every musician like there was a point where I had ran up against again the fight seems like it was 30 minutes long even those like two minutes you know but like the moment that I had her up against the cage I remember like just thinking oh if I hold her here she can't do anything to me and that's like the exact opposite of what you should be thinking in a fight you should be thinking I need to hurt her you know like I need to hurt her I need to do whatever it whatever it takes to look like I'm trying to finish the fight so I hesitated my corner was yelling elbow I didn't throw the elbow ran it through the elbow and then from there I was just like like two steps behind I fell like and so that fog was a really weird thing for me because I had never really thought about the mental side of fighting like I thought I was doing everything right like I would visualize and you know tell myself all positive things and you know do do everything that you you think you have to do before a fight but that just kind of showed me like I'm not doing enough because I knew I had the skills to beat her but or at least the skills to make it look more competitive but I didn't show it do you think was the added element the cameras falling year-round that just put this additional place yeah like it like the pressure was already there and then I found out about the ESPN thing and I feel like it was just me over because I've always had this I guess this fear of losing too much you know and it started when I got into the UFC I had like my tough fight it didn't go well but I was one fight you know in Miami my career and I was in the UFC already so I went on to win a fight but then I lost two in a row and got cut and from that moment on I'm like fuck like people are just gonna think of me that's a person who loses all the time and then I went on a four fight win streak and Invicta but then when I came back to the UFC I lost and ride and even though it was like probably the fight that people still talk about to this day even though yeah yeah like I always get complimented on that fight but it was still another loss on my record so like I've always had this kind of I don't know like this great cloud looming over like my confidence because of my record did it help that she went on to do such great things well it did it did but when it came to fighting someone like Randa who kind of had a similar story where she is talented but she's fought a lot of tough people and lost to them or gotten like weird decisions against people I don't know I just felt like this was my chance to prove that I'm not that like I'm a better fighter than my record shows and so then when the ESP the end thing was thrown on and I just like it was just me begging up a situation that wasn't that big you know like it was no different from you know my fight with fasciae Yoder I felt more present in my drug fight like it was no bigger than those fights but I just begged it up in my head and I felt like it was a result of me just pushing down all this anxiety that I have every time I fight and not really addressing it so did you address it since then yeah when I did I just we we started reading like those uh mentally Mima has he read them and then he started doing like the mental coach thing for me but everyone everything every resource that I looked at says pretty much the same thing is that you have to focus on being present and being present each day and not like dwelling on the past not bringing the past into that present moment just trusting in your reactions and trusting in your your preparation and so that's what I've been doing is like I've I have been doing like more like actual visualization exercises and just every time I'm in the gym I just focus on being there at the gym I'm not thinking about like what's gonna happen if this happens what's gonna happen if that happens I just I focus on the drill we're doing on the exercise we're doing I go as hard as possible and I think just having that fight and having it go so badly forced me to go into the gym and just say fuck it you know and it is literally just like that fuckit mentality like that was the worst that could happen where you didn't show up he didn't fight to the best of your abilities exactly when I hesitated I didn't show up I didn't I didn't stay in the moment I was thinking about what's gonna happen next was what just happened you know what's gonna happen if I lose like I'm thinking that in the fight like when I went to the gym the next like literally like the next Monday I went to jail like fuck it you know and I just went hard and like the next sparring session I said fuck it and I went hard and like those were like the best firing sessions I had up to that date like people were guys guys who like you usually wouldn't really say much after I spied on they're like yo you're on something today like you you're like just like combinations and your volume and this and that like yeah you're really getting after it and like okay okay I think I've like kind of unlocked something's no it's really powerful the way you're addressing it that you're so honest about what went wrong that's huge because sometimes people make excuses or they come up with some some you know something that went that didn't go their way that should have gone their way and they don't address the real issue you're addressing the actual issue that was going on in your brain and you know that that's what it was yeah I think yeah it's like something I kind of had to learn from the get-go you know have you ever thought about going to like a sports psychologist I have I have like there I've tried a couple people in the past and I really just feel like everyone kind of says the same thing yeah so I feel like if you're getting it from any resource that's good like I started using that mindfulness app which one forget what is called little cartoons yeah and that really helped just like kind of calm my nerves and keep the anxiety from from being crippling sometimes what happens when you go to a coach is the fact that you physically go to someone and you sit down with the self this it's like a different level of commitment and sit down with this person this person formulates a strategy for how you address some of the issues that are going on your mind and then sometimes you can go to a hypnotist like Vinnie Sherman you know Vinnie no any Sherman he he's fantastic and he's done a lot of he's he actually hypnotized me I asked him to hypnotize me because I want to know what it was like it's very weird it's very weird it's like you're there but you're not really there it's like you're in a room next to you didn't touch me Bank no no I just wanted to I just wanted to experience what it was like and and then you know like sometimes I procrastinate too much sometimes I'm lazy sometimes of failure to get more work done than I do I'm like wanna know what that is you know and he is really good at working with fighters at addressing he does a lot of stuff through like FaceTime and shit to like keep using that he lives in England but he's worked with Joe Schilling he's worked with a lot of different fighters but he basically tries to get you to understand first of all you're already on a really good path because you understand what you did wrong right and then you understand to be more present those two things are critical that's everything understanding what went wrong letting it go you already doing that and then concentrating on what you're really good at and just saying fuck it and letting it go and expressing yourself being being you that you know that you could be when you're on yeah right that's it's like how to capture that and hold that thought and then bring it inside the Octagon and be able to recreate those feelings when you're actually under pressure of competition yeah like like does he like take out the watchdog she talks to you close your eyes you lay back and he just sort of talks you through it it's very weird so it's not like therapy it's you definitely feel like a change in your brain yeah you feel like you're in a different state it's a weird state it's very weird my stance like after was over I was like huh okay that's real as because I had seen like comedy hypnotism before have you ever seen a comedy hypnotism where they have much people come up and like you're having sex with you know Rihanna and you think you are and yeah a lot of weird stuff that people do in these comedy hypnotism shows where I was like maybe I don't think they could do that to make yeah I'm not gonna believe that I'm really on a cruise ship right now and Pirates are coming or whatever the ones where they like make them like turn into an animal or every time you say this word something happen and I'm gonna wake up in 3 2 1 like that okay but it is like you're listening to his voice but you're in a different state of consciousness very strange name but it's you you're able to put away the outside world for a brief amount of time and he concentrates on flow get new to a state of flow that flow state when everything's going great you know that feeling when you see things and you're you're hitting someone with someone with something before you even know that there's an opening there and I was in those those athlete books to just have a flow State thing flow state is everything right so getting to the point where you're at that enough for you is a quick turnaround a better thing because you're more relaxed you just bought it's definitely a better thing because I feel familiar with the routine and familiar with like being in a cage and one of the first things we started thinking about is what scares me so much or what what like gives me that heart pain and one thing is like being in the cage and like seeing the canvas and like just how real is because like when you see it on TV like the canvas is a different color you know like the you can see like the yeah the texture the thread in the canvas and you can in I don't know there's a certain smell like the perspective is different like I look way bigger on TV like than I do in person and it's the same with my opponent like they look like this little thing trying to like fight me and it's but it's like this little this real thing in front of me so it's like scarier than when you're watching it like watching the replay of your fight so it's a it's just like that I don't know just that experience of being in there you always scared me because it's I don't know it's just not familiar it's not it doesn't feel the same as going to spar or like you know going to train or wrestle or whatever because it's like this big like thing that we build up we have a date we go in there's more more watches are the Octagon before you're fired I like you know I like to you know if I think it helps but I think just being in there a lot has helped more than that just because like yeah like is that is that the area that I'm used to fighting in now like now that I've fought so much in like a short period of time like it feels super familiar like now don't feel the need to warm up in there whereas before I'm like I gotta get to the I gotta get to her you know earlier I got to fill the cage I got a feeling on my feet so how slippery it is you know that kind of no but yeah I definitely like being in there being active I train all year round like I don't really take big breaks unless I like hurt something so in most of my fights I come out injury free if I do have injuries from like a fight camp not from the actual really fortunate ya know I'm lucky so I want I wanna you know I want to take advantage of my health because I know it's not gonna last five how old you know 2026 yeah yeah that's the magic number no I'm 34 this yeah yeah we look great thank you when did you start training um I I did my first boy psych class when I turned 24 Wow yeah that's the thing right like you don't have the wear and tear of like a lot of people starting at 10 and ya know by the time they get to 24 they're two galaxies all fucked up and back Madison done see a growth to a little bit I don't know I feel like some something happens if you cut weight it certainly does yeah yeah so yeah I did I didn't really do any sports after I guess middle school and rear um middle school through high school to college and then after college I didn't do shit like know anything nah I was skinny fat but you didn't work out or not yeah it's weird if you see a picture of me from like right after college it's I look like this little skinny like stick figure you're like just soft girl it's really weird it's like when people see me now they're like holy shit like people from back then yeah yeah they must be freaking out now is she's a what yeah he's in the fucking watching UFC contender I know funny yeah exactly like nobody and I was so different well not different but I was like super quiet like all my life like in high school especially in college like I was always just like really shy and really like soft-spoken not surprising cuz you're very funny on Twitter I think you Twitter you're hilarious I was always funny just quiet nobody knew it yeah kept it to myself i crack myself up all day but uh but yeah like I'm just super shy like always awkward around like new people and new settings and like I had my tight-knit group of friends but like I was never like the popular kid by any means so what brought you into my class um I work out I just got married and and I also had an office job I was working at an animation studio and before that I had been bartending so I was like moving around and doing stuff and I never really felt like inactive but once I quit the bar job and was just doing that full-time I just felt like fat and lazy and greasy and you know everything that happens from like sitting down today so I mean you know you like you do all sorts of shit outside of that's just like you know stay happy it's all right yeah it was really cool discovering it like I was just asking around cuz I always want to learn how to fight but like boxing intimidated me and like that I don't want to deal with me like like they deal with me if I came in and when I was like ten but now some old ass fucking hey girl want to learn how to box but then people are telling me like Oh muy Thai is like really cool and I was afraid of getting bulky you know then they're like oh no if you do muy Thai like you'll still look really natural you won't look like you're on steroids it was like okay guys weren't afraid of that you're afraid of big shoulders I mean I don't care but back then I was like really worried about looking like a ninja - that's so funny cuz it's so hard for a girl to look like that without steroids yeah yeah you buddy see some girls who so hard you know like CrossFit girls yeah there's a few yeah there's a few that you definitely know something happened they grew up on a farm so you're 24 years old you walk into my entire class when do you get addicted to it first class man class first class my coach my first coach Brandon Levi does evolution Muay Thai in New York so that's where you were in New York yeah in New York yeah that's where I went to school and everything and first class I threw like an elbow and a knee on the Thai pads and I was like so hard like I never knew that I could generate that much power with my like little body cuz I was probably like a hundred and fifteen pounds like wet soaking wet you know at the time so I was just like oh my god like I feel so powerful and like ever since then I was just going everyday I was going with my husband like we were like getting in shape learn how to kick and stuff and it was just like a lot of stuff I never thought I'd be able to do I was doing it like even just throwing a head kick like I didn't like try out for cheerleading because I was inflexible you know I was like I'm never gonna be able to do this I can't do a high kick I can't do a split or anything like that so being able to get my leg up high enough to kick so in the head like it was like a huge milestone for me athletically I love a story like that we didn't do shit for like middle school high school you didn't do shit to you're 24 and then all sudden you get addicted to it yeah yeah it was crueler than me man 10 years later yeah you're a top contender in the UFC yeah that's bananas it's weird but like it makes sense to me because like any time I tried to do a sport when I was a kid I would just lose interest and I think it was because they were all team sports like I was on basketball team softball baseball whatever I ran track for like a few months and all of that stuff I was just like this is stupid like what's the point you know or that are I don't know I didn't like working with people but the one thing I was good at was stealing the ball in basketball so like I never made any shots like and I was really bad at like dribbling and everything but if someone got the ball and they were next to me I'd run over and I grabbed it I just like wriggle until they're just like like they would just get mad at me and let go the ball so I'd still it and then pass it to the girl that could shoot so yeah that was the one thing I was good at that's conflict yeah yeah maybe that was like a sign of things to come exactly exactly I like that I like that and especially because I was so shy outside of that then it was just kind of like my outlet so how long was it between your first class and your first fight it was about nine months Wow yeah so so right away you're like balls deep into this yeah yeah like what else deep yeah I was yeah I was really into it and I hadn't considered fighting yet but but my coach was like I think it was around the time have you ever heard of the wks mm-hmm so it was around the time of that and he was taking a couple people down and he was like hey you want to do wks you wanna have a fight and I was like oh are you sure like he's sharing ready and it was kind of half way because well I don't know if this is why he asked but once I said yes there was a girl that used to train with us who was also doing it in my weight class and he was like oh this is gonna be fine um so yeah I thought it was cool that he had that confidence in me because the all the other girls who were in the tournament had been training a lot longer than me for years even so uh yeah I was just like okay let's let's do it let's see what happens like I was scared but I also wasn't like putting all my eggs in that basket like I didn't think anything was gonna come from doing whites I it was just fun at the time yeah so I went and I beat two girls the little the champ regional championship or whatever and from then on I was just fighting they had the show in New York called Friday Night Fights and and I got a few shows on that or good a few fights on that I went 14 and all as an amateur more Thai fighter then when before I went pro I was trying to get an MMA fight just so I had like one or two amateur and I'm a fights under my belt so if I do decide to do it I have that experience but no one would fight me so I ended up going pro anyway had to promote I fights and then I had my first pro MMA fight two days before the tough tryouts Wow yeah that's so reason that's crazy yeah what year were you want tough that was funny so I think it was 2014 yeah Wow that's when the trails were and I think it aired yeah I think our finale was like that December well that makes sense now as to why you've gotten so better so much better over the last few fights you're still fucking learning yeah but it's not because it's interesting like what was it like your first fight when you you know because you here you are you're nine months into training you did it for fun and now you're really into it and then all the sudden you're inside the ring yeah I don't know it was it was fine well it wasn't fine it was like the fighting is never really fun I feel like I felt like it's just like this sprint like if you ever sprinted against someone and you really want to beat them like that's kind of what fighting feels like a lot of times it's like you're just pushing yourself to like this to like total exhaustion just trying to beat this person who's like neck-and-neck with you and it's just like your lungs just get tired thinking about it but so yeah it was it's a blur like I don't really remember it but I see you video and it's like super slow and and sloppy but I beat the girl up I like tossed around or ever and yeah it was really cool like I I think before before like they say go I was just like what the fuck am I feel so weird the day of like then I beat her and I was like oh this is cool okay I get it I get it you know and it was cool because I did a couple things that that were technical yeah you know I like grabbed her by the head and threw her over so that was like something we could practice and and yeah I've been another girl like maybe 12 hours later in the same tournament like those tournaments they make you sit around forever but but then I was just like oh man maybe maybe I'm pretty good at this like yeah maybe I maybe I'll do it again and then so you do it a few times you get 14 no as an amateur at what point are you thinking I think I'm gonna be a professional fighter um still not been really you know like I went pro just to go pro because like if you're 14 to know as an amateur like you're not getting fights anymore you know like you're not booking opponents or whatever I don't want to fuck with you yeah they don't want to fuck with you and it's about that time anyway like when I see guys with like 30 amateur fights like boxing is a little different but mmm wait I like if you have like 30 amateur fights it's like come on guys go pro already like no one else is gonna have that much experience and if they do they're like about the GoPro or you fought them like five times right you know boxing in the Olympics and um games and all these like prestigious right Muay Thai there's some amateur championships but there's nothing that's going to put you in a better position as a professional exactly exhausting like guys like lomachenko who's got you know 200 plus amateur fights right same with Gennady golovkin like he had I think he had around 200 plus immature fights as well yeah but those guys are winning world championships and fighting at the top of the heap in amateur boxing and then developing that skill so that like I think Loma chenko won his first world title like four fights in to his pro career Oh something crazy like that yeah yeah just different but like yeah I just I just know that for sure is that like everyone who's made a name for themself they started off with like fucking 200-300 fights yeah so yeah might I at least in the States isn't the same so so it was just time to make that step so I still wasn't considering that being my career of choice especially cuz like wait I you don't make shit like what's the most money you made us one more time fighter I think I made 700 bucks I was like about to make 700 bucks I wish lion fight was bigger yeah I meant lion fight it's like I would watch lion fight on access TV and I'd be like why the fuck isn't this huge it was an awesome show it's an awesome show the commentary was great there Pat Miletich doing commentary and if you watch the the fights they're bringing all these ties these world-class fighters a lot of the European guys they like god damn is some fucking talent yeah and it's so wild to watch I love more yeah I love watching I think my um I'm not sure if it was my first where I did two fights on lion fight so I'm not sure if it was my amateur fight or my pro fight but one of them I fought on the same kind of cyborg same kind of cyber I'm fine in life and that was that I think she only fought once so it was arena bars she fought twice she fought twice yeah first girls she destroyed it I think it was maybe a French girl or something okay but the first girl she destroyed like I think my coach my coach Brandon he was holding pads for me and her coach was oh do you remember people made a big deal about this the girl who got slapped in the corner oh she was fighting cyber coach slapped oh right he slapped the shit out of it and it was like oh because the girl was obviously she has taken some blows like inside went full cyborg on so she had already taken some blows and then she gets to the corner and the first thing because justice pack you know and it's like like do you do that a lot right doing that yeah no one's around yeah that's yeah so it was odd it was but I guess right I get slapping and fighter to wake up a little bit but like physically slapping them yo especially after they were probably concussed from go first around oh yeah you know so yes so that was the card that I was on oh wow yeah so yeah that was a really big deal for me like you are you fighting pro as a Muay Thai fighter and then what makes you say you know what I think I'm gonna make a leap into MMA tough tough yeah yeah the opportunity because like at that time there were no there was no strong weight weight class I was planning on being an atom atom weight fighter because I knew I fought between 110 and 106 so I was like oh I could I I didn't cut wait for it I just kind of dieted down to it doesn't Victor have Adam wait they do they do what is the weight limit 105 in the forum yeah so if Victor has a ton weight and that was kind of my plan but I had said like Invicta highlight reels and I didn't really get a response yet because I didn't have any MMA fights yet so that was kind of the scramble to get an MMA fight and then somehow like you know build up a record and get called by everything how long have you been training in grappling defense or MMA in general I hadn't been doing much MMA training just because in New York there wasn't a lot of it so you have like uh you have like those underground MMA fights like I had a friend who had done a couple of them is literally like you you show up you go to like a school in the Bronx and like you're in their assembly room there's like a ring there no ambulance like you still have to pay like 30 bucks to get in and it's just like so hood and match it and like we literally saw like a kid get matched up against a little person like a midget yes like Williams he's a little person he says you can say thanks Brad yeah it was a minute like like literally like tried to match him up and the guy was gonna knock this kid out like it was a man a man with man muscles and but it didn't happen how old was the kid the kid they were the same height oh Jesus so he wasn't a kid was a full-grown kid so yeah yeah that but it didn't happen but that was the matchup so that was that was the kind of thing they were working on there there were like fights like head gear no head gear some people I'd ever make love some people have boss and like it was all over the place I've seen a lot of those online yeah weird like sort of fucking half-assed yeah any fights yeah and it happened a lot in New York because that was the only MMA you could do back then like even a in a pro muy Thai fight you couldn't throw elbows really yeah because I don't know why but it was just it was connected to that MMA rule like could you me you could throw knees yeah yeah that's hilarious yeah plumb and yeah go throw knees mm-hmm but you can throw although you can't throw elbows those fucking people it was illegal but yeah it's crazy so so when I was in New York getting ready to fight MMA I actually got a call from Coach out in North Carolina and he's like hey if you if you come out here to train with me then I'll send you to Vegas to do this try out and you know get you on the show and I was like oh okay cool but I didn't think I was gonna get on the show I was just like oh this would be a cool opportunity you know so so I go down to North Carolina for for a few months I end up getting that fight that was like two days before I was like super like you know North Carolina show called like you s FFC or something or USS FZ and one of those so so I did that and and I fought a girl that I was actually gonna fight an atom weight but she pulled out so we fought at straw way I knocked her out and like the second round I think and and then flew to Vegas the next day so yeah yeah it's pretty crazy but like yeah it's still even on the flight to Vegas I'm like I'm not gonna get on the show they got girls showing from all over the place like they got all those girls and Invicta that I watch you know like there's gonna be like hundreds of girls here at the tryouts and like there was only like I think it was only like 30 did you have to spar the tryouts again just grappling that just grappling yeah so you go to tryouts you introduce yourself like there's like MMA media there and and you tell them like a little story try to get people behind you or whatever and then they had hand-picked already like eight girls to be on the show and those are all girls that I've seen fight before so I'm like whoa like they're gonna be in the show like they should just put them in like they already know what they're doing and but I was like guys girl just go and try out and show face and maybe Dana White would like what he sees keep me in mind after I have a few fights and I went there I tried out I did a grappling session where I did well against the person they put me up against like I just stayed on top of it oh how much crap when I do Dunbar go um well I have been doing grappling and on and off in between like my fights but every time I got a fight I'd stop right for like how long he'd been doing ground play oh I'd say I'd say about maybe two years two and a half maybe it's fairly green yeah like I'm also a white bow yeah fighting in a professional organization yeah yeah it's pretty nuts and so you stay on top of this girl most of the realm yeah yeah and in the coach the North Carolina coach he was a wrestling like straight-up wrestling guy so that was kind of what I needed at the time anyway so it was kind of worked out and I just like stayed on top of her in her guard and you know smothered or whatever and then and then the part that I shined was the striking part and my coach Brandon came down with me and we did our little routine and I did like you know you see the ties do like the 20 kicks left 20 kicks our we did that and then I started doing like a really high common I was like bad making noise and they're like Angela stop stop stop like I couldn't hear them over my yelling like they're like hey hey stop you're good you're good and I was like oh and that was before like the before everyone else was told to stop so so yeah and then I got like a pretty cool compliment from Dana after that he was like I've seen a lot of tryouts and that was the best strike and I've seen any child so far and I was like well I mean I'm sure he wasn't being super serious but I took that shit that I was like yo Dana White said that oh my god so at that point you thinking I might be on this fucking show I might be on the Ultimate Fighter a little bit a little bit but I think I overestimated what the rest of the girls were bringing to the competition like I thought like everyone was showing up with like crazy records like winning records but like at that point like especially for strawweight weight class like there were a lot of people just fighting whoever whenever it's just to just to make a paycheck just to like you know get an injury fixed or whatever so like like yeah you had a lot of girls who were strong weights but they fought at bantamweight before right you know where they fought in like bars before for like a small paycheck so like you didn't really have that much like hardcore experience outside of the the official eight that were picked so so yeah my chances were a lot better than I had realized and even though I only had one fight I obviously had a higher striking level than most of the girls that showed up that day so then all of a sudden you're on the Ultimate Fighter yeah all told you had been training for what at that time for years mm-hmm that is fucking bananas not done shit for all those years yeah now four years later you have a bunch of Muay Thai fights one MMA fight you're on The Ultimate Fighter like holy shit you're on TV that is a four-year whirlwind yeah that's crazy as nice for years that is nuts yeah I guess is like gone to college oh [Laughter] wow yeah and when you were on the show how bonkers was that it was pretty nuts I mean I I feel like I had a lot more fun than the other girls who lost just enjoyed it cuz I was just yeah I was just there for the experience like I think coming in there and this is kind of how I view my marriage tis like going in there with low expectations made it actually a lot of fun and now I'm still very funny way to approach it right people go crazy high with the expectations yeah yeah no one's gonna meet those expectations you're gonna be disappointed exactly it got married in City Hall I tried out for tough after one fight and you know living large how are you right now what I don't know I don't know I don't I doubt I'm ranked I must be I've never been ranked what is it how many girls are in the Hunter 15-pound Division I don't know I think I think five most most of them I thought I think I fought about half of them half of the top 15 yeah and the problem is I haven't beaten anyone that's ranked now hmm so that justifies them for not putting me in the rankings I would have thought after the ciphers fight you get ranked I don't and I haven't looked and I've stopped looking I think while I was ranked once I've be a higher name Morris marina morals do you remember her at all yeah your name spelled out mo oszi yeah but she just she just moved up the Flyway but she was ranked number 14 and I beat her and I was like who like waiting so am i ranked in the pop up like I gotta get at least 15 you know and the only thing that changed was they took her out the list and like I think after that like they put or no I think I finally made the list I was like 15 like months later but then Mackenzie Darren like Miss wait by like a gazillion pounds and knocked out a fucking ABC and they were like pluck it took me hostage rankings sounds like fuck those guys so after that I stopped looking and I think that was like another part of that you know that mental like stress that I kept putting on myself I'm like man I I keep losing I'm never gonna make this ranking I'm never gonna be valued as a fighter and like really the only thing that the ranking does is maybe gets you a few more dollars when Yuri sign your contract like the rankings don't really judge that much like if I go on a 5 fight win string streak and I'm not ranked it doesn't matter I'm still like a contender you know people are still gonna be like when is Anjali gonna fight the champ she's been killing everyone so I shouldn't put too much value into it and eventually the rink will come but like at the time I was just like man this is this is stupid like they keep doing this to me like I've had like it's not like I'm getting smashed by the top girls like I'm having competitive fights like the only fights that I got finished were the rows fight where I was super green that was my third fight she had almost won the ultimate fighter and then and then the random fire I just was like totally fucking fucking myself in my own brain so like aside from those two fights I had always been like I can I was I had always been competitive and I feel like even some of those I could have won if it was like different judges but like the rankings never reflected that so since then I stopped like once I realized that I tried to stop paying attention to it just because I felt like it was a it was affecting my own self-worth you know like I was doubting myself as if this thing judged like how good of a fighter I was right so yeah well you're in a learning stage still this is so that's what's so crazy about you is that you've only really been doing martial arts for ten years I mean that is fucking crazy because like ten years is when it all starts coming together as a martial artist yeah yeah and I think somebody told me that I think I have a friend who's an actor and he he was actually on the same muy Thai team that I went down to my first fight with and he's acting in LA now and when I was telling talking to him like man like you're really like he started like getting some bigger gigs and I was like man that's really awesome that it's all coming together for you and he's like yeah they say it only takes ten years like ten years once you start getting your groove in any profession yeah something the same way about comedian nice right so like I just rounded 10 years and things just fucking fell fell together you know like things have fallen in place Hannah Cypress fighting when I told you this online but when I when I saw it was like she turned a corner yeah it's like you see that sometimes in fighters you see like there's a moment where they break through where it all comes together and they're peat they're putting things together in a different way and you feel it you know if you feel when you watch them when you know that they've turned the corner yeah that's what I thought in a Cypress fight when you were on top of her hitting her with those elbows like that is you were so ferocious yeah I was like that that is that someone who's turn in the corner yeah you turn the corner you became a finisher I mean you finished two people in a row right yeah yeah and I think um I think I was a little angry with the reception of my last finish - just goes like well I didn't like I would have been okay if the fight went on because I was surprised that I got that they stopped it as well but you didn't think you got the props he deserved no I didn't get the props and I was like I got a show and it wasn't just that it was also I took a peek at the scorecards after the fight and they had her winning the second round and I was like get the fuck out of here like I think two other three judges scored the second round for for her so going into the third it was one-on-one and I I thought I was tooling her but I was still like okay I'm still gonna be aggressive I'm still gonna land these elbows you know this and that but it kind of uh it kind of showed me like dude you gotta finish his face yeah cuz even though I feel like I'm winning and like the punches that hit me aren't marking me they aren't like hurting me cutting me and I'm like I can hit them and see the black eye as I bring my fist back to my face you know what I mean like you feel the difference in power they don't see that like the judges don't see that so I'm you know I I have to like I feel like I have to finish fights in order to get the result that I want it that's got to be so frustrating when you're fighting as a professional and the judges I I mean yeah I say there's so many times the Houston fight was fucking bananas day I was so happy you guys went on that rant because I've been Dominic was going crazy John is so angry he was so angry and afterwards he was still angry fucking mad and he should be he should be it was you know the whoever the fuck scored John Jones four rounds to one over Dominic Reyes should never score a fight again yeah yes no way because it's like the criteria that you used to say that he was dominant one round you can't possibly use that for the next round it doesn't make any sense John one for sure the last two rounds and he might have won the third minor one the third I watched it I watched that fight three times since then that third round it's fucking close Dominic landed some real good shots but so did John so - John John came out great when he started that slowing down yep Donnie start slowing down and John started turning it on it was somewhere around the third it just seemed like the third is the fight that's the realm but one one and two are clear Dominic Reyes and that judge did not score the second round it was either I think the first round he gave it to Dominic the second round he gave at John Jones no you can't do that man judge that gave the third round to Jones one gave the second round I thought the second round was closer than the third and that the biggest robbery of the night was earlier yes Andre you'll versus Jonathan Martinez I didn't get that was a fucking robberies masks guns duct tape fuck you that was a goddamn robbery that kid one Martina has won that fight watch that you like and if when it was over when when they announced the decision we were like what the fuck is happening yeah that was the first bad one of the night I thought that was the worst one that was the worst one of the night that kg b12 that was going like crazy yeah yeah I said it to her after the fight I thought you want to fine yeah she's through way more shots she was more I mean it was a close by was a good fight you know but I thought she won that fight - yeah it's just fucking terrible it's crazy it's crazy is in like how do you how do you fix that you know you got to fix those Commission's the Commish I mean look Vegas does a real good job they do a better job than that ever ever they're getting better at it but they still have judges that have no martial arts experience in Vegas they still have that that that you shouldn't take place and there's a my other fight that I'm like fuck that fuck that I want it is the Courtney Casey fight I don't know what decision yeah went against you I won that fight - thank you yeah I did I thought you won the fight yeah but it was like I think well I have this conspiracy but my husband he like went in googled who are not googled but figured out who the judges were and one judge scored it 30 27 for Casey somehow it's like how the fuck you know like how the but so whenever he sees this guy's name now he's like uh shake oh we need open scorn yeah when you nope it's going to be announced at the end of the round should be announced to the audience who the audience boos the fuck out of the judges with the judges name and a picture the face yes because I went online after the fight to try to find pictures of some of those judges from Houston and they you couldn't even find their pictures I looked a couple of pages in a good figured out he's Google fool man he's good at it but I'm Jamie have a Google people that shouldn't be doing it yeah and I think there should be more judges I think three is crazy I think we should have like glory has five for kickboxing and I mean I think five is a good number it's a better number six probably even better yeah it's not a bad idea one French panel is actually a very good idea I definitely see a different fight from being there live and then watching it is a totally different fight well sometimes even watching what I'm I'm at the cage I you know I want to see it in person but sometimes I gotta look at the monitor and then look at the monitor it looks clearer I see things that I'm not saying just looking through the cage and for a long time judges didn't even have monitors you know yeah now at least they have monitors but I think you're right I think eight is the magic number hey those people fuckload of money they fucking do it did so you definitely need more voices because when you have something like a you know a decision that like the john jones fight with Dominic Reyes who I'm not against the decision it's not a robbery I mean I could see an argument that Donna gray has won the fight I like John getting the decision cuz I like the guy who wins the last rounds more I think it means more because like look if they're fighting to the death I have all my money on John because John Jones is dominating the fourth dominating the fifth that's a 10-round fight I don't think Dominick race is gonna make it right nobody's gonna make it and that means something that means something cuz a fight is it's look it is a game right it is a sport you're scoring and it should the score should count but I think the last round should count more that's how pride used to do it they said judge the fight over all the Edomites I do like traditional Thai rules just like they danced or no not dance they fill out the first round and they fight the second and third round and then like the fourth round I guess decides who wins mmm and then the fifth round is just a dance really yeah gambling and then they fight every weekend - yeah yeah exactly you know and if they really want it they'll try still try to get a knockout the fifth round but usually it's just dance we have to do something we have to do something it's gotten to when you get to a place like Houston wait and look I love Texas I love going there I love the people I really love Texas but that was an embarrassment and there's no way that that should be a place where you have world title fights there's no way unless they fix something there's no way I make you imagine I was surprised it wasn't in Vegas it's well you know they needed a good card for Houston ya know I mean it was packed crowd was amazing it was great yeah it's just but it but yeah definitely um definitely a weird night yeah so you are you leaving from here straight to the airport and going New Zealand yeah what does that fly is it take three years how much do you get then it's gonna feel like it it's like I think it's 15 hours so yeah are you worried about coronavirus and Shep and fly yes yeah yeah I mean I'm less worried about it then Adam he's like the worrywart of the two of us so I'm kind of like I'll be frank you know whatever but it's definitely like a thing that I should be worried about like I think it just showed up in San Diego cut like last week or something like - two people had it in San Diego and now that they're testing for their using a different test to detect it they're getting even more cases of it so so sorry came from I was just listening to a podcast yeah my friend Ryan callaghan's podcast today they were talking about it came from people eating weird animals from a marketplace like bats and snakes and shit yeah bro in China they eat whatever the fuck they can get a hold of sometimes they I mean they do this one lady who got arrested and she's got arrested for serving or selling all these different animals she was selling Eagles yeah I know where the people would get weird about Eagles but we don't give a fuck about a chicken their biggest shit the biggest yeah I feel bad like when it's like bigger than normal you know like like a really big elephant yeah yeah like a really big elephant so like really bad about you didn't just because I feel like it's brain as bigger so it's probably more likely to be like sentient have to be starving to death eat an elephant yeah it have to be like I'm trapped in the bush and I got a rifle I would never eat it like an elephant like just an elephant like there they're like so amazing they have incredible memories - yeah there's this crazy video of an elephant being reunited with I think it's a sibling or a daughter or mother or something like that and they hadn't seen each other in 12 years and they see each other they run to each other and wrap their trunks around each other it's crazy like they're not if that is not like a deer yeah you know deer don't even know what the fuck's going on they can teach elephants to paint themselves have you ever seen that no see this elephants can paint themselves they can paint an elephant yeah just with them holding onto the brush of the trunk they make a trunk they make the body they make the tail it's crazy they train an elephant to paint himself that's okay it's so weird to watch that it could be smarter than eight right or is it just the thing is the thing you wear it's hard to tell is like apes have fingers right they can move stuff around like chimps have incredible memories they have incredible short-term memories like chimps have better memories than us when it comes to like they'll flash a bunch of things on a screen and chimps can point out exactly what they saw if they get a reward like if they get candy yeah like they'll give them candy if they can lay out like some numbers and some things like in the correct order where you are I agree what the fuck did I see I don't remember yeah like we're burdened by too much information and data and all sorts of different things chimps can just do it they had that one motivator but their memories incredible actions of bananas memories that's cause for lack of a better term that video of the elephant with the the brush it's so weird to watch I mean apparently this is like they train this elephant specifically to learn how to do this but it's still crazy impressive because he's he does a really good job like better than like a four-year-old would like a four-year-old person like yeah you know one of my kids and therefore they wouldn't do as good a job yeah making a fucking elephant did it look in the mirror and watch it right how does it know you got change I'm trying to find the exact when you're talking about a controversial story I believe it is well I think it's controversial because they taught the elephant how to paint himself but it's still the training methods are probably used him I don't think is that what they think that's I mean though I'm looking the hearts of the video and that's what's coming up is like abuse or not abuse animal rights dipsh it's crazy I do feel really guilty about when I went to Thailand just to like train out there and I did one of those like elephant right I did too and I do thank you I'm glad yeah my whole family was like that was so fun like I'm not doing that again yeah my bad elephant so here it is look at this so he's painting himself baby yeah but I mean he's I don't know how you could say he's being abused I mean he's just doing that it doesn't seem like there's any weird motivators other than you know they shot him how to do it they probably gave him some trees no trunk yeah no I mean they they're all drawn themselves there's more than one yeah oh he's drawn a duck that they can do that they can create yeah something and it reasonably resembles what they are what's not so what they're making yeah and I felt like maybe a mirror in front of them no it's pretty close to what an elephant looks like what it says the truth about elephant paintings what is the truth well human it must be like a stencil that they had mmm they're just like tracing it or not tracing that but like they must have trained them to make a certain shape so I doubt that the elephant knows that that's him hmm you know but who knows who knows they could be smarter than all of us don't they say like fucking what is it what is it squid octopus and squid yeah really stupid smart but they only live for like a couple weeks yeah I think octopus live like two years or something so crazy but I'm glad you said that about the elephants in Thailand I felt bad yeah I didn't I didn't like the riding them thing but you fed them we get to feed them sugar cane yeah were you near Chiang Mai no I didn't get to go to any sanctuaries like the elephant sanctuary just like bathe yeah run around with them yeah you clean them and and then you feed them sugar cane yeah and then you ride them and I was the writing part I was like I don't want to do this I thought they had they have that big hook the hook when they so when we went to the one that we went to they have this like big pole with a little hook on there and it never like hit some or anything but it's just resting on like their shoulder like those like they're like training to like I figured like that was what they used to like get him to behave so it's like it's like someone sitting next to you with like a whip you know like you know what it could do it didn't do anything but you just know it's there no they displace one thing that I will definitely say is that they treated those elephants like pets yeah treat them really well they pet them and you could tell they had a sweet relationship with them like the elephant would wrap their trunk around the people and the people would rub their head they wanted to be around those people and then they would feed him a lot of sugar cane like we had these big stalks of sugarcane and they would make you --fill see the whole idea was a real pill rehabilitation thing for elephants and a lot of the elephants had been in circuses and zoos and things like that yeah and then they actually had reintroduced a lot of them to the wild and when we were there these elephants were not in cages they were free roaming oh that's I never it was crazy their power they just wrap their trunk around shit just pull it out of the roots and then just start eating it like but then they're also really gentle really gently they'd grab stuff out of your hands just like like they just like they fill your hand and then they grab the tree around it just like but they can hey I know they're really they're fucking smart yeah that's right a shit they can bring those elephants back to a place where they can exist in the wild because they basically everything that's in the jungle they just grab it and eat it they know what to do so while we were hanging out with them they're just pulling trees out of the roots and just eating them right there but they're their disposition so interesting it's just so interesting event around them it's big and gentle big and gentle I mean they're so fucking big and they help you get up on them they lift their leg up and you stand on their leg yeah and then you pull yourself up onto their back and then you hang on to this rope that's around them they didn't seem to mind that you on their back but still it felt like I would rather just feed him and pet him yeah like sure I'm gonna do that in a wild and I'd be like hey buddy then they go down to this pond and then you wash them in the pond and everything it was yeah it's interesting oh it was really cool out I wanted to go up to Chiang Mai but we were we were at this place called a jazz right there that's exactly where we were ah so pretty yeah that's exactly where and so you go out there and you pet them they love it they like keep baby elephants frolicking and all there oh my god they love the bathtub but that water is filled with shit oh shit in the water it's probably lucky in some culture I went to a wolf sanctuary this past weekend what's today I'm what Friday yeah Friday yeah they are abused well but being rehabilitated or something no no they're not abused but they're they're contained and that's what's depressing it's like most of them came from people wanting a wolf from a pet a pet they're like oh I'm gonna have a wolf won't be about us and then just rips your house apart and doesn't listen to you at all oh my god this isn't a dog yeah so big yeah but to me what was depressing was first of all they neuter them when they get in there they kind of have to because they don't want them to breed because they didn't create more of the same situation but then the other thing is that they're in this pen and then they don't get to be free so there's not like a big the the pen they were in it's not as big as a studio it's not that big for a fucking wolf yeah we Wolf's want a run and hunt that's what they want to do they want to hunt so they never rereleased them into the Wow no I mean that's listen to this though listen know how [Music] that's when we're leaving we're leaving there a howl then it wouldn't need to come back well we pens see how little the pens are though yeah we went into the pens and pet them look these people they're amazing and they're doing an amazing job don't get me wrong yeah I mean they're keeping these animals alive and they're feeding them and they do love them and they go in there and take care of them and Pat them but to me it's like that's a fucking wolf that wolf should be on a mountain somewhere it should be chasing down a deer it shouldn't be living like that they're beautiful it's just I did just bummed me out yeah made me feel like I went to a prison yeah you know like these are incredible animals and they're the only way they can keep them is to that's a forest client who's a wildlife biologist who's been on the podcast for it I'm getting kissed right there by a wolf they're very sweet like you can you can some of them you could pack and hug them and hang on to them and they like you you like people but they're fucking wolves like yeah you're you're not telling them shit like there's no sit lie down fuck you like they're wolves that's good that they have somewhere to I still rescue them like yes people who would have just like put him down and that is a lot of what they did they did keep a lot of them from being put down but but I left there feeling really depressed figure out what his name is but he has a huge Instagram and he has like all the big cats oh yeah what is anything called yeah I can't think of it but it's like something cat something thing yet some probably doesn't even say that but that's what I'm like big cat videos but yeah the guy goes and he like cuddles woman and it's always like someone who had a pet tiger who was like just gonna be cool no it wasn't mostly people in Texas yeah there's more tigers in captivity in Texas in people's backyards and there are in all the wild of the world that of what and are there like no laws with like animals doesn't give a fuck you want draft go get yourself a giraffe like you just have a tiger that might be fine like there would be more chill of like staying and like a so true so true I used to have a bit about them like they're the only animals I don't feel bad for at the zoo because they're walking around the zoo like another day with no Lions Lions majestic that's a random econo it's called Black Joe something yeah yeah that's right yes a lot like that black Jaguar something it's not I'm not sure where it is but yeah yeah that's it Jaguar white tiger yeah he's just cuddling shit he's in Mexico we're estimators porn sold in Mexico from horrible circumstances the most depressing shot I ever saw for sure was a tiger sanctuary in Thailand oh it was so depressing because they were all drugged cuz you take a picture with a tiger the Tigers landing like this like yeah like just like a drug prostitute around yeah and people like smile and take a picture and I said I am NOT going in that fucking cage and I'm not taking part like we we thought it was just a tiger sanctuary rescue Tigers you go look at Tigers I'm like be cool for my kids to see some Tigers but then we've got there I'm like oh no these people are getting and there's a difference because like they have little Cubs and so you go in a room there's a pen and these little Cubs they're tiny they're like a couple of weeks old or you know four or five weeks old whatever it is they could be around people six weeks old and you could play with them but they're super energetic to jumping on you and they're swatting things they're playing with each other and rolling around and then as they get older it gets to a year or two and then they stop they stop being natural then they all drawl drugged so you could be around the littler Tigers and there's a bunch of handlers around and everybody's real nervous they keep the Tigers away from you and the Tigers are there looking at you but they're there they're kind of yeah but they're not like a year old then you get to the full-grown Tigers and they just fucked up they're all drugged they're all drugged that's crazy and I guess that's the that's like my brain never thought of like oh yeah they must be drugged in order to be sitting in a room with strangers and not freaking out like yeah that makes so much sense CBD kill clips mmm-hmm like overkill pretty goddamn good right yeah that's pretty good 25 milligrams but if you go into that room and the cage rather and see the Tigers you know right away they're dry yeah and that's a nice thing with that black Jaguar tiger guy like you always see the Tigers I like playing there like swatting them around like the kittens you're talking about and like you can see like their claws I like retracted so like they actually like the guy they get just fun yeah they could tear him apart at any point but they're still like nibbling on him and stuff is this like that guy's crazy he's like like the big cat Steve Irwin I guess yeah he's nuts there's a few of those guys there's a guy in Texas that does not get it but he's got a tiger rehabilitation place it's the same kind of deal like wrestles with these Tigers employees with them shit gonna end well bro did you watch Siegfried and Roy yeah a lot of times they just decided to go tiger on you put things yeah the wolf thing was a real bummer I didn't think I was gonna bum me out as much but it bummed me out I mean I'm happy to those people are doing it and then I think what they're doing is amazing don't get me wrong but for me like just a feeling of the like being around that thing like other thing wants to run yeah that thing wants to yeah that's like your animal right like wolves like on was did you see it was that movie and at the very end he goes once more into the fray was that Liam Neeson's yeah yeah the gray the gray that was a good one I have a friend of mine who shot an elk in Elbert and the LT didn't know it but the elk when you know they shot it with a bow and arrow the el gran and died and they were trying to pack the elk out and these wolves started circling them they didn't realize they were in a Wolf's den oh the Big Shot the elk and the elk literally died right outside the wolf stance and the Wolves decided to claim the elk so their circle him so these guys had their back to a tree they shot three of them as they ran at them wild big wolves it's like real 125 pound wolves yes it's like yeah yeah you can find the video John Dudley who's a good friend of mine who was on the podcast talking about it he only had three arrows left and his friend only had three bullets so they're standing there with their back to a tree and they got like fucking 20 wolves around them to live to live in I have one of them on my desk at all so did they just back off after well yeah yeah once they realize that they're killed they killed three of them yeah the wolves are okay know that my friend John was down to one arrow cuz he killed two with his ball bow and the other guy is down to like two bullets yeah fuck yeah that's crazy no lucky man well those animals used to kill everybody that's what Little Red Riding Hood was all about yeah yeah yeah yeah do you know there was a ceasefire in World War one because they were fighting in Russia the Germans and the Russians were fighting and they were there was so many people were getting killed by wolves that they decided to have a ceasefire because the Wolves in Russia are just fucking ruthless is that like when it was snowing yes yeah and the Wolves were eating the soldiers they were killed they were killing soldiers that were on on patrol and they were also like when everyone somebody got wounded and they were on the battlefield they would just get torn apart by wolves in front of her I would make a great movie yeah it would make a great movie so they had a share communication back and forth between pretty sure was it Germans in the Russian and they said let's just kill some wolves for a while yeah and so they had a cease fire that killed wolves and they went back to killing each other damn yeah yeah so back to fight speaking of casuals how much around that how much you walk around that um I don't walk that heavy like I tried to like stay above 30 130 um but it usually it doesn't happen so I'll be between like 130 125 so you only have to cut ten yeah I only have to cut ten like I've never been a big straw way and what do you weigh right now probably like 125 and so you're fighting this weekend yeah I'm fighting this week so how do you do you taper off or do you just cut the water I taper off this week so I was eating like pasta for dinner like all the way up until this morning you know so like that's how I keep my weight on cuz otherwise like my metabolism just from training and running like I'll be at like 120 without even trying so if Adam weight was a weight class you would go there well that's the thing like it's such a big jump so it's a weird one for me because like 110 is probably like my healthiest weight class 105 I start to look crazy like nestled like traveltura low yes God sorry like I've posted a video recently and it was from like somebody was following me before one of my Muay Thai fights and dude I look so crazy like I look like straight up like is it on your Instagram or yeah yeah it's on my Instagram but I think you can see just like my cheekbones it's just like a still of meat there on a cake but like my cheekbones are so sunken in there yeah yeah like I look like my way inside I was probably about 113 right there really dieting hard yeah yeah like I'm my calorie counter I'm making sure I'm not eating carbs after 6:00 you know like carbs after sundown that was the rule like no carbs after sundown it's gotta be harder for women right well your body wants to hold more body fat than a man's I've never had a problem cutting weight like I've always been okay like I I think I just never tried to cut too much like I think if I was bigger than it would be an issue like a lot of girls they see who's cutting weight and how big they get and then they get scared so they try to go down a weight class below the run and so like I mean if you look at Amanda Nunez she doesn't she isn't really the biggest Bantam weight you know like she's kind of a natural mana weight like she looks about the same size as Anita answer off so it's like I think so I think so when I see that when I see her in like fight camp or when I see them both outside of fight camp they look about like the same size I disagree yeah yeah I think Amanda looks sick but she's all shoulders like her waist is small like she's not like I don't know she's not like built right you know like muscular yeah yeah she's just she's just a little broad but like she's she's uh it's not like cyborg yeah yeah exactly she's not like cutting like to the point where she looks like she's about to die yeah but she's still a world beater so like it's kind of it's kind of cool to see that and I think a lot of people perform better when they're not cutting a ton of weight just just because like you're and they're more natural you're moving the same way you move in training whereas if you cut like a shit ton of weight you're like kind of half cots you know like you're you're already like depleted and your brains not as healthy you don't have as much water in there yeah you're just weak air all around there's there's a point of diminishing returns right well you just cut too much if you cut a little bit you're probably pretty good but yeah like a lot of people become who they really should have been once they moved up and went like Maz Vidale or Dustin Poirier like Dustin Poirier just couldn't make 45 anymore now he's having a hard time being at 55 he's so big you might have to move up to 70 yeah and your body just like kind of fights against you like once you had all those like really tough weight cuz and that's why I'm not like super on that like oh my go to 105 trained like I might try it once I feel like everyone gets one missed yes yeah if it existed like I might try once and if I miss it I'd be like alright not gonna do that again you know but that's got to be hard to go through the camp like diminishing yourself in camp yeah like TJ Dillashaw is the worst example right when I'm down to 125 horrific and that's what I would look like like skin and bones and like muscles you know and like it it's like scary but at the same time when I did do it which granite was about eight years ago when I did do it I only diet it like I didn't know anything about like water cuts or like you know I didn't do hot baths or anything like that I would just die it down to about 112 and then not eat anything the next day and that was me making weight I really wish there was more weight classes in MMA yeah women's MMA and men's MMA at least with women's it's now 10 pound increments yeah it was insane when it was just 135 and 115 you had you had people killing themselves trying to a giant gap with women yeah gap is huge yeah and then the girls are so much bigger one thing my like crazy big like a cat Zingano was at Alliance for a little bit and when she wasn't at weight I was just like dude like there's no reason I should be training with you [Applause] right when she's not trying to 160 large lady yes I mean that a good way yeah in charge she's fucking strong as shit yeah she's an athlete she's an athlete big athlete yeah just tough I remember her fight with Amanda Nunez when a man that had a really rocked in that first round and that she came back to stop her yeah those amazes day when she won that fight and screamed poof it just gives you chills yeah it was like that was just like coming like from her bones yeah yeah like actually one and she went through hell in that first round that fight locked her up for a long time yeah she was talking about it on the podcast she got brain damage from that fight yeah yeah she's still like recovering from it like I think freezing yeah it's just it's Amanda Nunez is a freak she's a monster freak she should be put in jail for what she's doing he's playin well we're cyborgs you can see cyborgs going what the yeah yeah cuz like I said doesn't look like she hits that hard oh my gosh and then it lands it's just like whoa like yes she's got something going on like she's crazy how some people just have this weird power I got that touch and yeah like Deontay Wilder he's the best example of it's like what the fuck let Alex Pereira you know Alex Pereira and Rory he's the only guy that's knocked out Israel Adesanya knocked a mountain kickboxing fight he's a fucking freak it's the same thing he knocked him out with a left hook yeah one punch boom flatlined oh yeah he hits so fucking hard he knocks out everybody it's one of those weird guys where you know sometimes people just have this power it's weird freaky power yeah and I'm still hopeful that like that's gonna be me eventually because like you know Amanda Nunez didn't really do that for a long time and then after that catfight I think after the shevchenko the first schevchenko fight she just started finding her groove and finding that money mark and then she also just really took her training far more seriously and invested much more time in a strength and conditioning oh okay that's a big factor because the man who we get tired and that's what happened in the cat Zingano fight yeah it's in got she had cat Zingano really badly hurt in the first round but then cat just so tough she came back in a second and when i'm stopping her shevchenko fights you I think that's why that's why the rematch happened because Valentina just had a really strong last round mm-hmm so she's internet yeah but it's interesting how like you need weight classes you need those increments because Valentina 125 is just a fucking monster yeah she's a monster yeah she's so good it's such a huge gap - yeah it's such a huge gap between like and a number one contender and champ doesn't make sense it's crazy that fight I did my best to pump up Caitlin chick egg in and to make it seem like it's gonna be a good fight but all I could think of is like how is this girl gonna beat her yeah how are you gonna beat her well is everything perfect yeah I thought like numbers like if you're going just like volume you know I thought that Caitlin could like you know close the gap of it I didn't think so this is why because Caitlin she uses points she scores well but she very rarely knocks people out like she knocked down Liz Carmouche with a head kick right Liz survived and one that win in the decision right you like Valentina makes you pay she makes you pay so like all those like shots that she would throw the volume it's different because there's he put the shots out there and then back and it comes back at you just like whoa those kicks come back even you like fuck yeah elbow comes back and you're like whoa so now you're like now everything's more at a distance and you you lose your ability to engage you get nervous because every time you engage she's looking to take especially after that Jessica I fight oh yeah whoa yeah that was crazy I think that's the one that made me a fan because I was hating for a while yeah she beat up that poor girl that girl I think she's fighting is she don't know she's not fighting in Auckland right I do not know no no she's on their car but I don't remember they should have stopped that fight way does this mean but like after that I was just like man yeah like giving her all these props for destroying this poor girl and like she shouldn't have been in there against anyone but then after the Jessica I if I was like yo she's got something like she's scared she's a dominant yeah she's gonna be a dominant champ she's just a scary person she went down to the range in Texas and the guys who run the range were like the way that lady shoots she shoots like a fucking Special Ops soldier we haven't seen someone come in here and shoot that good unless they're a seal or a competitive shooter oh my god she's a fucking straight-up killer all-around someone stop talking shit about I dance yeah they're like hey guys see her groups like the group she was like pistol groups like everything's in the she's she's she's a special hard lady you should take her hunting with you oh she probably would fucking jump on something's back it's triangular she's a she's a lady yeah but it's it's people like that that make the rest of the division rise up right like men when Anderson Silva was just dominating everybody in 185 there's like who the fuck could beat that guy yeah it took someone like that to be that that unstoppable force at the top of the mountain it made all the rest of the division rise up and then as Anderson got a little older and you know those guys got better and Chris Weidman one up beating them and then the division comes along yellow Romero's gonna fight out of Sanya in a couple of whoo let me get my fight out the way so I could like be a fan again you know it's crazy yeah all the dance officers say I know again back flip and almost kicks Dana in there yeah I don't even think Dana saw what happened right there like they did in slow-motion you see his face like yo I had already flipped and Dan is like yeah I feel like what is happening was such a freak he's insane that's another thing that gives you cuz I like I've always been self-conscious about my age too like I think that started leader yeah because I started at a 24 I used to call it my like quarter life crisis thing the fact that I just like started fighting out of nowhere but but yeah I've always been a little self-conscious especially because like a lot of time like the UFC will hype up like a young fighter like she's only 18 getting this fight on the card and then like I'll see someone like Alex Chamber fight and they go the oldest fighter on the card is like why are you gonna put her out there like that so I've always been a little self-conscious like man like I feel like I have an expiration date but then the long the more I pay attention the more I realized that a lot of the fighters I do look up to are like my age or older so yeah I stopped looking at it that way I started looking at it more like my body age is still very young yeah you do any abuse up until the time you were 24 you didn't do any training at all yeah yeah I mean machine ready to be molded into a fighter like ligaments or intact and stuff I think it's really a matter of how much time are you doing it for because I think lint Randy Couture didn't even have his first pro fight until I think he was 34 35 yeah yeah go on to win the light heavyweight title the heavyweight title and all that stuff like goes into his forties yeah and then Dan Henderson still swim people out of like you see like what was it 199 you know he's gonna have a text to see if this is still happening Dan Henderson was supposed to have a bare-knuckle boxing fight against Chuck I don't know I guess money yeah well yeah so and why I mean money but also like there is part of me that's like I wonder how I do in a bare-knuckle fight you know like there's always probably like I always wanted to do that let the way have you ever seen any Leslie I always thought that'd be really cool cuz like punch in without gloves on like for me I'm like that's stupid I'm gonna break my hand but like kicking oh you're already fighting I'm already doing that you know like just kicking being able to kick like through their hand into their head like I feel like that would be a lot of fun and then there's headlights - yeah that's way they can do everything yeah it's like I already get head-butted when I fight it might as well make it legal you know use it I mean it is an effective technique particularly here in someone's guard you're on top and your biceps mash them in the face uh-huh that's what Mark Coleman used to do he just be like uh sneezed big weapons Mark Coleman back in the bare-knuckle days he would take guys down he would hold it didn't matter if you're in the guard or not he'd smash his fucking forehead right in your nose and then start punching you and beat the shit out of you and you know he was a gorilla back then Matt Mark Coleman when he was the heavyweight champ was like 265 on all the Mexican supplements wrestler I mean he had both things going on look serious wrestling skill huge power and no drug testing yeah and head butts and bare knuckles oh my god headbutt the fuck out of oh my god Killingly well it's one of the things that made Maury Smith's victory over him even more impressive as that was during the headbutt days and Maurice figured out Maurice was one of the first guys that figured out how important cardio is Maurice had crazy cardio so he was he would be able to survive the early onslaught he had good defense on the ground would protect himself and then once the fight got into the later rounds he started leg kicking the fuck out of Mark Coleman I'll never forget that because that was the early days of fighting when everybody thought that Maurice was gonna get smashed everybody thought that damn I don't know Maurice was great great guy he was an elite kickboxer good thing about Maurice it was a world champion kickboxer his kickboxing was way higher level than anybody had ever seen he was the first guy to knock out Conan Silveira back when do you remember those days watch until I was about to do it yeah like maybe like after a couple boys I fights I was like let me let me start watching his MMA thing but yeah everything that I've seen is like YouTube like from back in the day oh yeah well the good news is you got a lot of fights you could watch yeah yeah for sure we did we started like going back to like UFC 1 and I'd watch like the full like fight card and I'm just like holy shit this is crazy I feel like I remember watching it like with my brothers at some point and like somebody goes bad this is gay turn that turn you know like sigh like it's never like I never like sad and watch it until once I started like doing martial arts what's crazy is how much things have changed since 1993 yeah when people first saw hoist Gracie choking people off his back and they're like what is happening know anything now any little kid knows what a triangle choke is yeah yeah that's cool they know what arm bars are they don't wear naked chokes are everybody knows it yeah it's it's weird like people are famous now yeah like yeah I remember I went on did you remember there was a show called the best damn sports show period it was like an old school sports show yeah this is like mm something like early to that I was like Tom Arnold and I forget all the people that were on it but anyway I was telling them like I go the sports gonna be huge I go it's a it's the most exciting sport in the world and I think it's gonna be as big as any other professional sport they were just laughing in my face they're like like what are you talking about cage fighting there's no fucking way that's ever gonna be popular yeah what's up Jimmy the account that announced this back in September the Henderson Liddell fight is a parody account that people didn't catch on too Wow Wow it's still gonna happen yeah don't kid yourself Hector Lombard fought last night Saturday yeah that's the most recent event oh yeah yeah yeah one I thought about watching that it was weird I only watch the ones that backs on Beck Rollins oh yeah but she's a champ right yeah yeah bare-knuckle champ yeah she was killing in there she came to train with us again she was one of the first people who were at Alliance one of the first girls so that was one of the reasons I went out there and how'd you wind up getting Alliance you were you in New York I was in New York then I was in North Carolina and then that stopped working out like a bunch of weird stuff happens so I had to find a gym that was good for me but also had girls like it like the thing though saying about like training with women it's like after the tecia Torres fight I was just like yeah I was under estimating how strong this girl could be and born in Mexico it was in Mexico City I was I was there for that fight I remember these girls like that is crazy altitude yeah 7,000 feet prepare walking up the stairs to go take a leak is fucking high-altitude and I did the exact opposite of what you were supposed to do so it's like you either show up a month early or two days before you fight right and I showed up ten days before I was five I was like oh I like I made in ten days and it was like that was like right at the peak of like when you really start feeling that altitude sickness so I was messed up from the altitude I was sick from the I forget what they call it the month of Montezuma's Revenge it was revenge I was sick from that oh my god I was out wait the entire fucking ten days like literally like walking out 115 and so and you can see it in my fight pictures too like I looked like something out like my old boy ty photos you guys were like you were stuck in the mud so yeah I was so pissed because like right before we fought or when we weighed in and there are little faceoff teaches like hey let's make some money tomorrow and I was like oh yeah all right let's go let's go I'm like yeah we're gonna fucking stand it bang everyone's gonna be excited we're in Mexico they love boxing we're just gonna hit each other and this you plug it takes you down like on the ground and fucking like fucking what do you call it half guard and I'm just pissed I'm like come on man like just at least you know but yeah she hustled me when Johnson did to Dan Hardy back when Rumble used to fight at once I'm just still hard to believe I still have no idea how the only make it like was me one tough at 170 Wow so if he can make 170 I could probably make 105 he's a heavyweight now dude he's gonna come back and fight heavyweight in the UFC I saw him once in person and his hand about like country's my two or three of my hands like tape together like he's just he's my smell like I could like crawl into it we forget where we were but we were in the he was in between fights and he was 230 pounds and I saw him I go what the fuck do you weigh and he started laughing he goes I'm about 230 you're going to make 170 oh my god and then he had a hard time making 185 remember he fought Vitor at 185 he barely made I don't think he made 185 yeah yeah and then the UFC cut him and he went to the PFL back when it was the PFL and he went what is it world series of fighting back now yeah world series of fighting and then he fought on to Arlovski at heavyweight and fucked Arlovski up at heavyweight I was like this is crazy I was a 170 pound tough champ and I think he's gonna probably come back at heavyweight apparently is he gonna come back bare-knuckle as well well if they were from a lot of money like fuck I feel bad for whoever is on the other into that huge fist like yeah I just think got some lunchbox fish yeah I would get so hard I'm sure no one signed that contract like that's probably the reason never happened you know war yeah I still remember the sound that it made when he fought Cormier oh yeah and kicked him it was a punch we had mother punch too but he had kicked him smacked him in the face with head oh well I just remember the punch it was like that's right the first right hand yeah anyway like I think he'd like smothered um yeah beaten both Thompson yeah yeah but it was that first punch I was just like holy shit like we're all amazed like it you just heard that crack and we're all amazed that like Kermit was able to just like fucking walk through it and you know like shook it off but yeah that yeah knocked out over with one punch I was like holy shit that uppercut oh oh the big one yeah the pitches were crazy the Minotauro fight to knocked him out with one punch he was a freak man he's a real freak I'm interested to see if he does do I mean he just he was burnt out he said he's like I don't want to do this anymore and then he took some time off and he started feeling it again and now he's he's training with Henry Hooft he's hitting paths he said he's gonna give himself like six months to really get in shape and really retrain hard and let's get back to it but he said he might fight at 205 to was thinking about I mean look at 205 there's you know look there's John Jones and now there's Dominic Reyes and then you know young bloke ovitch who just knocked out Cory I mean there's a lot of a lot of moving pieces right and that guy fits right in there I mean anybody who stands in front of him Michael night-night yeah anybody yeah I'd like to see that I like I'd like to see I'd like I'm Anthony as a person yeah he's just exciting as a fighter to his his style is so crazy like you know someone's going to sleep you know but he could take it too I mean he's got a giant fucking jaws yeah yeah physical freaks it's a great time in the sport though there's so much exciting so many exciting possible matchups are you would you pump for like when you look at the would you have to be paying attention to the title fight yeah yeah yeah next month rather yeah no I'm definitely paying attention to that we surprised when you watch wheelie and Jessica and ROG not really like the thing is like I was catching and dried when she would run in and it wasn't until the third round that I decided to use elbows and I'm pretty sure I dropped there in the third round and she popped right back up but like ever since then I noticed that like she would get hit like she would get hit and rocked like in the in the Torres fight like teaching isn't known for having like knockout power or crazy hands but she dropped her like a good like two or three times and in the Torres fight so I can see that that chin was getting touched well you remember the you wanna Youngjae chick fight she just she ate a fuck load of shots enough yeah but it didn't look like she was getting wobbled no as much no maybe she did because like when she came back and fought tisha she was like going like wobbly legs like every now and then then like eventually she closed the distance and took it out but it's like she sacrifices her chin to get that distance you know and like same thing with the rose fight she was gonna pick the part the entire sacrificing her head to get in and get the throw or whatever and then finally like you know it gave out on her in the Whaley fight so I wasn't like super surprised I was I I mean everyone was surprised so I won't say that but I did see that coming eventually like I'm like eventually someone's gonna put her out just because it's not just the person's power that she's fighting but it's her pressure is so aggressive and she's coming in so hard so it's like her force versus the other person's punch when they connect like she's knocking herself out essentially yeah so um so yeah like I wasn't super surprised and like that was that was what my what I thought would happen when I fought her like I didn't go into that fight thinking oh man it's gonna suck you know I was like dude I can catch her like she drops her hands when she comes forward like my I can strike going backwards like I know I'm gonna catch her and like I can put her out because of the way she strikes so I've always seen that her hands were a bit sloppy even though she's super aggressive and the fact that she's so aggressive gives her that much success like you you can't ignore the fact that she's punching you as much as she is but it's still like very offensive and like with zero defensive minds so so yeah I wasn't like super surprised when someone finally did drop her but you know I hadn't really seen that much of a way Lee Sang so so I was surprised that she was able to get the title of that that fast have you ever seen her strength conditioning routine that she does know hard yeah she goes hard it's pretty wild free wild to watch it's very inspiring how do you feel like she matches up with Johanna cuz that the fights is real that's real soon um I I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be an even match I think she has a lot of output I think she isn't afraid to go to the ground I saw that and when she fought tisha they had like a lot of crazy scrambles she had good reverses for like teaches takedown attempts and stuff and and yeah just think it's gonna be like she's gonna force Johanna to move and to react more than most people I think like as long as she's like I haven't really seen I haven't really paid attention to like how much head movement she has but I do know that she just throws a lot of volume and wherever the fight goes she seems comfortable so I've never seen her in a spot where she looks like Oh what do I do here you know like you see people freaking out against the cage or freaking out when they get taken down and she seems to float she has that athletic flow through everything so yeah that's the one thing I think she has going for her but I do think Johannes reach is what's made her so dominate she's a big ol girl like watching her fight and drive there was a moment where like she's pushing and draught up against the cage and she looks like a bagel like praying mantis-like you know like just like biting someone's head off like and dried looks like this little thing so like she's a big girl with really long reach really long legs and everything so I think it surprises here back at 1:15 does she really do well I was gonna try to like fill in that last minute I don't know if you heard but it like kind of up to my like I don't know like props or whatever when she was about the fight Michelle there were rumors that she wasn't gonna make weight and so people were scrambling and then my manager what yeah I think I could talk about it my manager hopefully fingers crossed my manager got the call like hey um hey man I'm just worried about this you wanna fight and my manager was like well I bet and it would take it if you guys wanted her to fight and he was like seriously and he was like yeah she's crazy and I was there cornering uh my my teammate Lauren Muller at the time so I was there chilling uh where were we Atlanta I think maybe I forget where it was it might have been Atlanta but I was there chilling corner and my friend and and then my manager calls and he's like hey and it was like that time of the night that you know it's a fight off it was like it was like maybe 11 ish weird yeah yeah it was like 11:00 p.m. and I was like whoo and he's like he's like would you fight you wanna 125 and I was like fuck yeah and I was like I was probably walking about 125 at the moment like and if they I think we were talking back or he was talking back and forth and he was like well what about Michelle 115 he just wanted to know just so we can relay the message I was like yeah just let me know so I can like cut weight or not cut weight you know so I was sitting waiting for waiting for the call and then the rumors got like blasted and then people knew my name was in it for some reason I was just like who is talking yeah but like it went viral and I was and I just leaned into it I was like eh any time any place let's go and I waited waited and then yeah nothing happened Jana made wait either yeah yeah everyone was talking about it and then somehow somebody knew that my name was in the mix like Angela Hill might fill in for Michelle instead of fill in for Jana like and because she was like the name that was that they were promoting for the fight so so they wanted the former champ to get her fight so they were like all right if it comes down to an Angela bull fighter at 125 yeah so I was pretty stoked I mean I felt like Yoanna does a lot of things and it's similar with my matchup that I have now only she's a lot bigger Jana does a lot of things that I've seen a lot of you know and training just like in my in my first years of Moi's I like she has a very conventional style when it comes to Moy time and she's just very good at it so a fight with Jana is always something that I have wanted to have just because I felt like it would be something that I've seen before be like I'm not gonna be you know I'm not gonna be afraid of the clinch you know which is really good and I'm not gonna be afraid of the clinch I'm not gonna be afraid of when I elbows gonna come because of elbow sparred like my entire fight career so it's like it's like things that I see with her are less scary than a fight with someone that she's beat before like and rot or or Gedaliah or someone like that so we're gonna learn about her a lot coming this coming fight like what she's got left you know because that the transition 25 didn't really work out like Shevchenko was just a little do too much for shift ankud already beat her outside the UFC and then beat her again and then it just didn't look like she had the firepower to keep her offer at 125 and then so she goes down to 15 again but we know how hard it was for her to make 15 and that's one of the things that they had said her camp it said about her chin when when she fought rose like she just couldn't take a shot it was because she was so depleted yeah so we'll find out cuz way Lee hits fucking hard yeah yeah and she's like I don't know the Yanis so determined like I feel like she'd kill herself to make Lee mm-hmm you know yeah you know the long combat sports career when you know and at a certain point in time you got a wonder like when that catches up to you or you know one things that she was saying that she was in a real bad relationship and there was a giant distraction and now she's done with that and that was a contributing factor to a lot of her losses so we're gonna find out because you know when you go back to like when she fought Jessica Penang she was a scariest woman alive she was fuckin ferocious yeah when she was the champ and she was lighting everybody on fire she was terrifying yes she was so aggressive and so technical yeah she also had a lot of fighters who weren't that technically sound sure striking or at least not confident with their striking yeah you know so when she did fight someone who was good who could who was actually a better striker than her and Rose like the fact that just the fact that Rose could move laterally you know like Jana was always like a back-and-forth fighter because that's like her style of very muy Thai and Rose just moving to the side every now and then having head movement I think that really fucked her up and like it's hard when you when you fight someone like that for the first time or even spar something like that for the first time you can't find them you know all your punches miss you gasps out you freaking out because you're missing your punches then you're getting countered and it's like a lot to deal with for straightforward more Thai fighters that is a weird thing about more Thai right because we don't we don't have footwork leh we just stand a bang like really only a bitch you have run away from a fight you know like go to our footwork like Sancho Sanchez got crazy is like the only one licensed so since I can do everything but he's so good you would think that someone else would mimic that style it's it's it's one of those styles that are just so hard to mimic like in the sport traditionally is not his style he's very unorthodox so look at any unorthodox fighter you're not gonna see a million Dominick Cruz like copycats coming out you know you see like wanna do yeah they try but they're never gonna be down you know so so yeah Sanchez like that kind of fighter was like he was brought in doing this like very like kind of I wouldn't say still but just very like predictable style and he just made it weird and made it his own that's why he's so he's whose toes oh yeah only when I'm buying just Ally Schieffelin every flat foot no no never and like he always he always knows how to pull you know he can pull the the counters up so like he knows exactly he had a twitch in order to make you go all and then boom you know like it could be a foot it could be like a I don't know a hand like it give me anything cuz he just comes from all angles like he also throws he'll throw a head kick when he's two inches away from you yeah dude wild shit like he basically throws a head kick straight up in the air yeah yeah he's not seeing you do like the like weird like karate like you know like when they just like jump back and forth and then like he'll fake one and then he'll like dudes like the car and he's close to 40 now yeah which is amazing for a lighter-weight yeah for a TIE fighter yeah like that's like you start at like 6 not there you know well I think that style has preserved him in a lot of ways their footwork and movement stock because he's not he's not just catching and returning and standing in front like a lot of those guys do great he's always very elusive right it's not a lot of those lured Zil is pretty elusive but there's not a lot of like really elusive guards and bull call is just like kind of a march them down and hit them grab a fighter yeah but yeah I think that's one thing I really a really credit going to alliance with is just my movement has gotten way more fluid you know Del Piero is one of the most unsung heroes yeah like for whatever people don't sing his praises but he's excellent it's kind of like the theme of the Joe Haeg like everyone who comes out of there is like no one's talking no one gives like Jeremy the credit that he deserves no one gives them the credit they deserve I mean I guess I guess I'm a little more sensitive because I know them now and I'm like great but but yeah Eric definitely like no one ever talks about him but he's so good at what he does his corner work is so excellent yeah he gives you like real technical information in the corner and he knows how to break it down quickly like this is what you're doing wrong this is what you have to do right this is what you're doing great keep doing more of this look out for that when you do this do that yeah and he gives you all that shout you see people go ok ok ok like some people like you need to take them out you need to take them out I never saw that kind of like you know Eric's kind of a psychopath of that shit like like he's like no emotion you know it really takes a lot to draw emotion out of them and make you feel proud yes can yellow softy but yeah he's definitely like he's very stoic you know when it comes to that stuff which which makes it makes the instruction we're clear yes you know like there's no like there's no anxiety in his voice there's no freaking out he's just like just do this to this that was a good round you might have lost that round you know like he'll just give see straight up and say it quickly enough so that you can be like okay what next and and yes it's always been like really chill when he's cornered really it's interesting because he doesn't try to get any attention I mean that's what like attracted me to the gym because like you see a lot of people trying to big themselves up you know or name-drop or do this and that and even if the person like even if it's merited like they've proven themselves the fact that they have to I don't know convince you always makes you feel like the China hustle you yes you know so like when I had too much the too needy yeah yeah yeah so when I came to Alliance I was like yeah would it be okay if I train here cuz there were already like a few strong weights there and I didn't want to like you know come stomping in on territory and being like I train here now and he's like yeah you know if you want to train here train here 10% after your fight you know no contracts or anything just like if you end up not liking it here you know just go you can go somewhere else like there's no obligations and I was just like oh that's cool cuz I had just like come from a place where I had to sign a contract saying I'm trained there for this many years or however many fights I have and like it's just such a strange thing this goes sideways and then you're like a contract that's hard to get out of it and they want money if you even have another trainer they think they can like have a lawsuit against even though it has even though there's like zero that zero things that like actually hold you to that contract because like it was badly worded or something but like they'll still try it'll be an annoying thing too and luckily I was able to like part ways in a good way you know I just I just paid my coach and it was like I need to go somewhere where I have more training partners and this and that and he was like yeah that's fine so luckily it was chilled but like I've heard horse heard a lot of horror stories so like when when he said that I was immediately like oh that's cool like and that's how that's how my coach my first coach in New York was - he's like hey you know hey if you need to go somewhere to learn how to do MMA like that's cool and not know hard film Brennan Bears too little once he is not training there but he's still like her darn owner he's still like comes through when he is in San Diego Mercedes and he's in Philippines that oh so he trains in the Philippines - he lives there and trains - yeah yeah Wow yeah what a crazy career shift he's had huh I know this means one heavyweight champion I know one is nuts he's out there done it I'm like I'm like blazing or something right Filipino and you fight for one like whoo yes a heavyweight yeah I dig giant Filipino he's doing it he's like in movies out there and stuff really I don't know which ones I think I watched part of it but yeah he's like livin it up you know well he's so fucking big - yeah and I was like 240 something though yeah yeah no it's not to see him he's you yeah I like watching him like do peds like they had to bring out the big pad holder bag and he kicks the bag and it's like a big-ass heavy bag but it's still like folds and half when he kicks it like yeah he's he's sick but yeah he's he's like yeah he showed us some like cool clinch stuff and like cool techniques when he comes through and and he like he likes to motivate the like up-and-comers when he comes through so it was always like he was such a small light heavyweight earlier in the day well actually he was a small heavyweight remember when he knocked out Frank Mir this back when his training with Rob came it okay yeah I mean he he was fucking people up at heavy way and he was like 210 gene yeah he's really fucking tall yeah he wasn't like well you'd look at he didn't look like a heavyweight yeah yeah yeah it's interesting to see a company like one explode and get bigger and then see guys like Mighty Mouse and Eddie whereas and you know like world-class fighters go over there yeah I was sad to see my anyone let's go oh he was another one of my motivators like man I want to be like that guy you know I was sad to see him go in a way but happy because I knew he was getting paid yeah like they wanted him over there and it was a big get because at look him up for my money he's still the best example of a mixed martial arts fighter I've ever seen like you could say yeah you could say John eclipsed him as the goat and I think he did because John has beaten better fighters he's beaten the best of the best I mean Mighty Mouse knocked out Benavidez he's beaten good fighters don't get me wrong he definitely did beat up so who'd own the first round their first fight but he didn't have the same pool of talent that John Jones had to go through guys like lyoto machida Rashad Evans Rampage Jackson I'll go down the line everyone he fought is a fucking killer he's the time he knocks out Shogun who 23 years old to win the title and since then for the last nine years he stormed through everyone they put in front of him that's the goat I mean it's hard to argue with that just the level of talent but when you look at what Mighty Mouse was able to do to people when he's able to do the Wilson haze when he's able to do to a lot of guys were like good fighters yeah he makes it look like you have no business being in there with him yeah he's doing a whole different thing than you're doing you're do you think he's there and he's here and you think he's here and he's there and then you're getting hit and you're getting punched and you getting take it down and you think you're gonna get hit right he just could do everything yeah that's the thing that makes him so crazy is that he can do everything in the book yeah he's not a striker you don't have to just worry about one thing how about Ray Bourque how about when he suplexes them and then catch they went armbar on the one that's the one I was thinking of yes but it was like what the fuck just some on the way like movies yeah yeah in a world title fight defaming Israel now that was nuts something real special I felt like that put on such a crazy like level of expertise yes when he did that wasn't that the one before he got released I feel like that was his last well no I mean the one before he lost that was the one before he lost against I think you're right so it's almost like they were like well there's nothing else we could do like obviously you're gonna do that to everyone else so that I'm sure of that division was uncertain right they weren't even sure what they were gonna do with the division once the who the one and then now that Sahu doe went up and he beat marla mirai's for the bantamweight title and then they have this situation where they're gonna have Figueredo and Benavidez fight for the flyweight title so who table an is that title and Mighty Mouse did the right thing he got he got big money over there yeah they paid him a lot of money to fight one of sin they give him hard fights too cuz they don't have hydration over there either or dehydration so they you you fight it what you weigh which I think really is what we should be doing yeah and I don't think Mighty Mouse was ever cutting weight no she was always walking away yeah I mean he may be like 135 but it's not like he's not cutting anything like substantial and when he was fighting at 35 when there was no 125 everybody was just so much bigger than yeah yeah yeah we served that picture in the gym of Dom suplex in it yeah flyweight I mean he's he's spectacular over there he's doing really well you know and they've got fucking killers over there too like that guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez Timothy nuts you can a guy's a fuckin savage he's scary yeah they've got because just because you haven't heard of them doesn't mean they haven't been training for 10 15 years and have all these I feel like it's gonna become a point in time where there's gonna have to be some sort of a unification fight whether it's a Bellator unification fight because I still think that Diego Lima he's the one that I look at and I go that guy I think is he's elite at 170 like he might be as good as anybody alive at once I'd like to see him and there was a funny face off with him in Camaro you smart oh yeah so that he said oh yeah I mean I don't know if that's something the UFC would ever do but fuck if I ran the UFC that would really should happen yeah I really should happen I mean they have like female fly weights too that could be a thing you know like put into title fights there and there you know that would be fun doing and who I have to be at I see who I Annabella de did it like a monkey well if max has a rematch against Alexander Volvo canal ski that would be a good place to do it you know but I am do you know why that the big place is outdoor and you never know in Hawaii if it's gonna rain yeah especially like a like a destination like yeah it's probably gonna rain for like 20 minutes like right before you start title fight isn't sloppy just put some kind of a cover over just the Octagon maybe they could actually do it I don't know but I just feel like these other organizations whether it's one or Bellator they're getting to this point what you might see it and then Rory MacDonald just went to the PFL oh yeah that's what that is what they calling it right he used to be the world series of fighting that's the PFL right yeah yeah Rory just went over to that cool which I was pretty shocked because he went to Bellator I was shocked that and then he won the title at Bellator and then he went over to the PF emiliano sorted okay right yeah yeah gave away like six different million dollar tournaments right that's crazy I'm like where is this money coming no yeah but that's the thing that's something like one Fc or PF up they kind of have to do that if they want to bring over a guy like Eddie Alvarez or Mighty Mouse or you gotta come with the big money mm-hmm the other and if you and they have it they sell out gee onion places over there yeah are they doing that what is the name of the big one in Japan Saitama oh yeah yeah are they doing there like places like that I don't know there dude they do it in Singapore I know they're doing I don't know I'm fascinated though I'm I really like win this competition I like when something Rises like my one of my saddest moments in MMA is that phaidor and his prime never fought in the UFC when Cain was in his prime and phaidor was in his prime god damn that would have been glorious yeah to see those two go at it yeah oh that would have been amazing yeah you know that's the thing about MMA is that these these organizations are you know it's the UFC really and then there's everybody else the UFC is the top of the food chain and everybody else is trying real hard and every now and then someone will write like a Douglas lemur or a fade or where they'll get to a point we like huh I want to see that guy fight against the best in the UFC I want to see what's up but I gotta do it with a Bellator and risin mm-hmm like they've started mixing like they had a Darien Caldwell fight Horiguchi right and that was like I don't know that was just like a really big deal I feel like any time like you have the two it's kind of like team fights you know anytime you have that happening it's just I don't know it just makes things more interesting I think so I totally agree like I'd be down for that just someone has to rise someone has to become this undeniable force where everybody is clamoring for the fight and then the UFC you go there's a lot of money in this let's do it yeah right now that hasn't happened Bellator has never really gained the sort of notoriety the UFC has like if you were fighting in Bellator you know like people some people would know who you are but it'd probably be like less than half the people right you know it's like it's just a it's like the NFL or you know cute tips you know versus cotton swabs you know wants q-tips it's the brand name yeah and if you look at the sheer number of fighters that are elite in the UFC there it's on the best fighters in the world but then there's a few there's a few of those Bellator fighters that really fucking stand out and there's a few of those 1 fighters that really stand out and you go oh yeah they might be able to hang with anybody in the world yeah it's just gonna take time you know like the more they pay people the more they start paying out as well as the UFC the more you're gonna get those talented people to go there instead of you know holding out for a spot in the contender series and then once that like changing of the guard happens a couple times then you'll definitely see it you know and then it would probably be like undeniable at that point but I don't know probably and I don't know if it's gonna happen anytime soon well listen Angela I'm happy we got you in here I'm very excited for your fight this weekend tell me your opponent's name again look boo me whoa yeah Mary tai I'm excited for your
