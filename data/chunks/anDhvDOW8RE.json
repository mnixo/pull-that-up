join my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day Weidman was pressing them but Anderson was kicking him a lot in the legs yeah and I was looking I was like ooh like he's kicking his legs a lot I hit a lot of time like crazy taunting mm-hmm yeah but you know what Weidman did something really slick he did something really slick it's really interesting he threw a back fist he threw a punch and then he threw a back fist because Ana she was going he was bobbing and weaving and bobbing and we even like moving away from him so he figures if the Wrights coming and the left's coming so he throws a punch misses then throws a back fist which makes Anderson have to go that way right but then when he starts going that way the other way by catches him with a left hook it's a it's a beautiful combination it's a beautiful combination with a guy who moves his head a lot because you force him because you're not just throwing one in that direction you thrown a second one that so he's going that way yeah which is like when you throw a left hook yeah he's going that way so he's already going the way to avoid the left hook he's got to come back how many come when he comes back boom yeah he catches him perfect it was like it's brilliant beautiful time it's the setup before the fucking blow - well he looked a little slower than Anderson so he's having a hard time catching him and Anderson was staying on the outside and kicking his legs a lot but they had collided in the first round and he took Anderson down and wrapped one of his legs up and had him pretty tight it's like you might be getting a leg lock or attempting a leg lock and Anderson got out of it isn't that the fight - or at the after the fight were Weidman was like make your decision now you're either on board or you're not I think there was no that was another fight another there was another fight yeah I think that was um that was after Vitor sank after he beat up beat or he's like pick your tail yeah I was like on board I was like damn Chris you've had up to now to decide pretty good yeah you know he's an interesting guy he takes a loss like a fucking champ I'll tell you that he lost till you owe Romero by knockout and he was sitting on the dais answering questions later with us I all stitched up yeah and I mean he's uh he's a he's a stud you know fight I was hard to do my oh I bet ko tan Just Answer answer question with stitches over your eye you're talking to press people I've seen some guys real fucked up at perfect composure though he handled it perfectly I was at that Gustafson John Jones fight mmm were they I think they both went to the hospital brutal Tang rudl brutal fight um it was a decision fight I think yeah yeah then it was like the like they just massacred each other you know they're just beat the shit out of each other that was a crazy fight yeah yeah does a fight where John was talking about it when he was on the podcast was talking about how much partied after that fight over fortifying or partying a lot Wow yeah it was incredible fight remember how bloodied those guys were yeah I was a rough fight and gustafson shocked a lot of people yeah that's the crowd you could feel the crowd swell what I always call MMA this is the phrase I use all the time so maybe it'll start getting annoying - it's like extreme problem solving with dire physical consequences that's why it's a plus shit-talking right throwing that too high stakes talking shit yeah high stakes there's an emotions battle whether or not you can keep your emotions how will you handle pressure it's giant yes that's the thing about Conor McGregor more than anything like yeah we should say more than anything it's one of many things about him that's pretty interesting one of the most interesting things about him is he handles pressure like nobody I've ever seen yeah like when he fought Aldo for the title he didn't even look remotely nervous he was super relaxed super calm then you start to think though that you go how much of what you're seeing is how pressure is manifested through that guy you know I mean like for instance the press conference kind of mm-hmm antics you're like is that is that genuine is that an act is that how he handles the pressure of this high-pressure situation by doing a fucking you know bangbang show at right so like it but I personally find the guy which is I think what you want why someone becomes a star endlessly entertaining on top of being good so I you know I'm tuning into I want to see the fucking show he's the best shit talker of all time I don't know I've said that before about other well yeah before that I said Chael Sonnen was the best shit talker of all time I think he was for a while but I think Connor Connor Topsham and all sudden all also as well Connor has an additional significance to his shit talking because he knocks people dead right it's a totally different thing and Chael Sonnen not that he's not a fucking animal because Chael Sonnen is an animal and he's submitted Shogun who shell summons a very solid grappler sure came very close to beating Anderson Silva in their first fight he's a stud but what Connor does differently see Isis guys with one punch and that's a big factor in a fight when you're watching him and he fights Eddie Alvarez and all suddenly dings him with a left hand and catch him and rocks him early on you go coldly shit and you realize like he's fighting a guy now at 155 pounds and Eddie Oliver is a big 155 he's a big guy big muscular guy yeah the idea is he's going to be able to wrestle Connor he's gonna be able to grab them and grind him out the same way he did with Anthony Pettis mm-hmm nope nope Dillon with a totally different animal yeah Connors just got a totally different kind of focus as far as like the way zooms in on targets yeah and his precision it's just speed he's just dropping it in there with a hundred percent speed like that's a big part of what he's doing he's not loading up at all yeah the ability to stay cut like when you load up say like if you see someone coming at you and you just go mmm like all that's wasted time oh that's wasted time what Connor has is the ability to be perfectly technical in a firefight so like Aldo Xia charging Adam this is like 13 seconds into the fight all those charging at him and he knows how to just slide back and blam drops that left hand in honor is this striking the strongest part of his yes for sure his ground game is underrated he's very good on the ground it was very good defensively he's got good sweeps he's sweet Nate Diaz their first fight people forget that he's the kind of guy how much would you love to watch before he was a professional I did watch him before inspirational bar fights though oh geez you know he's been in some definite scraps I don't think you're allowed to like get 18 in Ireland if who haven't been in a bar fight yeah man we're going out tonight lad open your cherry that's probably the worst accent ever probably right up there but I saw him fight in this fighting age warriors i tweeted to him in like 2013 hmm before he came to the UFC I said I'm a big fan man yeah I want you to come over and did he yeah I mean like right after that um the UFC in him totally coincidentally I didn't call I mean I definitely probably told anybody listen to me about him yeah because I had seen him fight perform like this kid Isis people yeah his left hand is just devastating and he's got a crazy style he fights it is like wide stance and he moves differently yeah cracks guys I'm like this kids legit I'd like to see him in the UFC I never asked you ha ha there no yeah that's January of 2013 so it was almost four years ago did you did you think I'd never talk to you about what do you think of all the you know the talks of a him Floyd Mayweather fight he'll fight him very to you if I don't you think what kind of match do you think that well he's a lot bigger than Floyd first of all let's let's just emphasize that yeah he's a lot bigger so it'd be a real problem as far as like weight cutting mm-hmm cuz if they wet Laila Conor fight it wherever he wants Conor is gonna weigh somewhere around 170 pounds that's what he's at his best like in his optimum with no weight cutting yeah I don't think Floyd's that big I think Floyd uh I guarantee you he's probably not more than 160 do you think Floyd's bigger than 160 in real life the small dude guy yeah I've got a person who's really nice short doesn't mean weight but he's small what wait did he begin his career at Floyd Mayweather is all I mean I'm a huge Floyd man with a family and I think that when it comes to boxing I think he's like one of the most skillful boxers that's ever lived I really do technical if not the most yeah at 150 150 but that's probably what he last fought at like did he make when he met when he fought Canelo didn't he make him come down a bit he made him come down like 154 or something like that it sounds right something like that I thought it sounded great they had some sort of a catch weight fight I remember no and Canelo's fighting it while he's fighting in 160 now he's definitely bigger or is he fighting at 154 out of your love game is 160 right is that the holdup is the two of them cuz I think I feel like Canal has been fighting middleweight - like you fought Cotto what was that at wasn't that at middleweight or 154 Alvers Alvarez catchweight 152 152 okay yeah so he made Canelo lose some weight he cuz canal is a lot bigger than him yeah so canal probably walks around maybe 20 pounds heavier than that that's a bad motherfucker - he's good and Floyd Mayweather just boxed him up yeah what that's not there I'm here plop oh look at that just beautiful right that's the wonder um could is like put Conners skills just technical skills match up to somebody like the counter counter defense like I can't imagine they would unless Mayweather so out of shape yeah hey I'm saying on top of his game him on top of his game you're not gonna hit him he's gonna know I mean you have to be really top-level to catch him it's so nuts that that dude is so fast that he he box it like something yeah no box is a with his lead hand down yeah not even hip level mid thigh dimes well it's because that forces his shoulder over it's actually an easier way to block a lot of things if you're skillful with it he's shoulder rolling hmm yeah you gotta be it's not just quick and he's definitely quick it's very quick but what Floyd has over like almost anyone else he said he's got this incredible knowledge of what you're gonna do before you do it like he knows so much about boxing about boxing as a science from his brother or his father rather and his uncle uncle his uncle's Roger Mayweather was a black mamba who's an all-time fuckin exciting guy to watch in like the 80s and 90s he would starch people man dude him on those HBO shows they've never had a better comedy then Roger Mayweather moments it's the greatest oh you mean in between corners no when they used to do the all those 27 yes 24/7 he would fucking Massacre those legs the funniest shit I've ever seen and they edited it's so fucking funny one of those fights they were fighting maybe it was Alvarez or somebody and Albers was like we got to prepare for watches fights and and I just I know I'm just gonna have the fight of my life on my hands and then they cut to Roy or to Roger Mayweather he goes who the fuck is Alvarez like he's like Virginia doesn't even know who the guy but that really was you know then that was a big part of the preparation for I don't know if it in the end it was but for a long time when they were going how are you preparing for this fighter his answer and they're legit answer was like they have to prepare for this shit right yeah we're not preparing for anything he better prepare a lot you know and that's how they would approach it like we're not studying you you need to study this shit right now it was gonna be bad what happens to you seven points yeah it's a good point you know Floyd's an interesting guy um he's had his hands broken a bunch times yeah his hands rumors about like fights that he must have had broken handed no he has had hands that were broken and he's still boxed that what does that feel like sue just got a winner's mentality you know you can talk all the shit you want about that guy cuz it's fun to talk shit about him because you've created this persona the absurdly mayweather but it's brilliant it's a brilliant thing what he did is brilliant he created like someone to hate yeah but it's so talented you can't beat them and you're buying that pay-per-view which is exactly what you're hoping Canelo please Canelo yeah they're hoping Canelo can catch him ah they're holding Pacquiao could catch everyone yeah yeah they're a guy that he crazy a villain keep going down the line every fucking guy he's fought please catch him and maybe you know you saw with one with Mel Marquez he had a tough fight with Pacquiao and it shuts him down over and then he be like I got a hundred watches man and then that shut them all down people like they really fucking I don't hate at all I think that it's a sometimes that persona can just get kind of boring it's fun it's fun smart it's kick I came like alright man just I'm saying like Instagram he's like look at those money on my bed and here we like you I'm gonna do tonight I'm gonna count it and then it is hilarious it's funny it's entertaining but it is like one note he's to hold like bricks and money up to his ears long pretend he's talking on the money yeah hilarious cars like exactly ridiculous cars they're all white - yeah he's got like Bugattis and shit mentally this one they made three Jesus Christ oh my goodness what is that 100 million dollars that he got from what he was this purse from one of his fights he's like he was a promoter God is so insane he made a hundred million dollars yeah is where hippy start going crazy about income inequality there's the sack look at as he goes this is just one of my many checks gotta love these backseat drivers so worried about hate but look where you going yeah another gotta love these backseat drivers so worried about another man's legacy instead of trying to write their own ultimately I will always have the last laugh this is just one of many checks a cool 100 million dollars that I still have every dime of y'all still have to work however I'm happily retired at the end of the day it's them Benjamin Franklin's that matter to me so the joke's on you I've made smart investments sorry for those who thought that I couldn't read write or count here we go y'all call them watches I call them timepieces y'all call them boats i called me odds ya'll call them houses I call them match what what does that mean y'all chartered Jets and we own jets the money team there you go hmm yeah I got it I think he's rich I think he definitely has money I think so it's he's made a lot of fuckin money that's four he's excellent at what he does for sure across the board yeah I mean there's no doubt about it yeah but he's also it's how we left that's funny he's 49 I know yeah 49 another and he's the only guy he hasn't broken rocky Marciano's record yet right he's tied it which is really interesting I can wonder if that's on purpose I wonder if he doesn't want to break it well I think doesn't want taking time to chat about the pressure of it of it going away is the thing that happens like as the older you get like he I mean this is this is a good boxing retirement age for him mm-hmm it's like do you want to do 50 yes well it's got to be a meaningful 50 you can't rhyme scrub for 50 [Music]
