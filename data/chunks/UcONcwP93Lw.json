boom and we're live who are you calling I'm alright how are you hon a lot a lot of happening then yeah yeah first well thank you so much my pleasure this is amazing well dave rubin recommended you and i listened to dave room and almost had a whole lot of people's recommendations but dave rubin is one of them he's been an amazing figure in my life just in the last lesson even a month he just kind of was like my savior when like everyone was you know kicking me while I was down he was the one I kind of reached a hand out and so I owe him a great deal well we should kind of explain what kicking you while you're down means because it's it's more silly to me than anything because it doesn't really make sense but you tweeted a joke and it's a real simple joke James TV pull up the joke this is what happened Colin tweeted a joke about a day without a woman and everybody knows that a day without what without a woman was like that day without a Mexican thing or you were supposed to like well imagine if there were no women well if there were no women first of all there'd be no fucking people so yeah yes women are super important for so you just write this tweet joke ah peace and quiet hashtag a day without a woman I would laugh everything it was funny and I would move on and that's it so then I'll hold on a second put put put a look at look look go above that go above that above it look at that sent his tweet which was roundly condemned as sexist yeah not really true if you leave the gaming industry but radley condemned in the gaming industry for sure outside of that people I think normal everyday people that don't have an axe to grind about literally everything found it you know read it maybe groaned or maybe laugh and then kept going about their day like a normal person you're not allowed to have any personality well no if you work for any kind of a company that is in any way public where you can be targeted where they can say oh that's the fucking god go get them like anything that's remotely controversial and that is really remotely controversial it's just al Bundy yeah I mean it's not even a good joke penned and you know yes I heard you and Jim Norton talking about by the way that video that someone clip that out and put it up on some YouTube channels it's like that's like a that videos like it going to be a relic in mice way forever everyone was like I can't believe this what is going on this is so great so I really do appreciate you you know stepping up when I got your DM by the way on Twitter I was like this is what an amazing turn of events this has been for me so I really am appreciative of you again I just want you to know thank you but stop saying making my own comedy dog side but uh but uh at the same time you know I was in bed with my girlfriend actually when I wrote it and I had showed it to her I was like this is kind of funny right it's kind of stupid and she left she's an ER nurse and she worked the overnight shift so she was just getting into bed as I was getting up and she's like yeah that's funny then we didn't really think twice about it I sent it I got in the shower I went about my day and and then when I got to work I realized that it was a much bigger deal than I had thought and it was and and then everything fell apart and then was rebuilt very quickly so well you resigned from the company that you work for yeah I found it I co-founded the company yeah I owned a piece and you resigned because of that yeah yeah other reasons too but I mean that was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back for me yet what in the fuck man yeah I was just I felt like yeah how is it how is it possible that in this day and age that simple tweet by the way if you reverse the sexes in that tweet there's not a single man that would complain and if he did he's not a man yeah I agree and I say also that if a person that wasn't a self-described like moderate conservative or libertarian sent that joke it also wouldn't have you know gotten the firestorm that's the thing Joe is that I don't think a liberal man wouldn't have gotten a rash of shit and then sort of I think it made me out of the community maybe in a different maybe in a different place but not in the gaming industry which is almost completely hyper liberal sorry I've had a target on my back for years and that's I think kind of the point that's lost on some people is that this was just an opportunity no one was offended by this joke no one was aghast like I said on Rubin the second time I was on there I said like no one's crying in their shower or losing sleep tossing and turning over to any show and was well I hope so because that's what should find that person I have person who studied them in a lab but to me I was like no this is I mean it was clear a few hours later when I finally realized what was happening I'm like this is they're in for the kill now this is this as they found their way to get me and so why do you think they wanted to quote-unquote get you because you know I live in San Francisco I've lived there for ten years I was born and raised on the Long Island but I'm went to college in Boston and then I moved to San Francisco and it is this cartoonishly liberal as everyone thinks it is so it's it's and the gaming industry is there the gaming media that people have write about games and cover them and do all that kind of stuff they're largely there and it's a huge echo chamber they don't like when people penetrate the echo chamber and I made a name for myself in the industry over years I was the senior editor of the biggest gaming website in the world for years a website is IGN calm and and I was a senior editor there and I made a name for myself not only with criticism and with long-form pieces but basically I was writing pieces about political correctness in 2011 and 2012 people going after game developers people going after all these things and me kind of standing up and saying this isn't okay this character assassination a good example for everyone out there that doesn't know games there's this game called Borderlands 2 and one of the developers was giving an interview about it he and this was back in I think 2011 he said something to the nature of this mode this particular mode in the game is accessible for everyone it's like a girlfriend mode if you want your girlfriend the competin play this was like a heat said a girl he insinuated that women can't play games and don't know how to play games where every by using the term girlfriend voting people went after this guy and tried to get him you know and I wrote this piece saying like what the hell is everyone doing this guy just is trying to explain something he's not a sexist why do you make these assumptions based on this one thing about him and why do you want to ruin someone and that's the whole thing they want to ruin people so I was outspoken about this and I was outspoken from our support of Mitt Romney and I was outspoken about my support for Gary Johnson and my house book so they don't like that they don't like that stuff and and and I think that's pretty clear now so you feel like there's a sort of a reinforced type of thinking like a very liberal reinforced type of thinking that you must subscribe to if you want to be a part of this yes it's an orthodox it's a complete and utter orthodoxy and it's it's what's so kind of nice about this like the unintended consequence that I think is the silver lining of the dark cloud is people from the outside now saw firsthand like what I had been saying for a long time which was which was like I was kind of on the fringe I was kind of being pushed out and I got that literally thousands of people tweeting I mean Facebook messaging me and doing everything being like wow this is fucking crazy these people really are out to get you based on that you know you would think I horrible just offensive just truly awful thing do you think they're really out to get you or do you think they're capitalizing on a moment where they feel like you have a target on you and they like kick them he's down we got them and Indies but this reaction culture that we have like this over overreaction culture that we find herself in today it really does seem to foster that kind of behavior that people really like it when someone gets caught doing something or when someone says something inappropriate when you can just point the finger and then everybody can pile on yeah I think well let me put it a different way cuz I think you're probably right in a sense in the sense that I I never gained the benefit of the doubt with this group let's put it that way right so so it was one thing which is one thing the dominoes tip and it was and that and they were down as opposed to that's why I brought up the example before if it's one of the people that they actually liked within that insular industry said the same thing they might have been aghast but they may might have reached a hand out or given that person a second chance so I think that that all plays in into the you know I have the Gadsden flag as my Twitter I kind of had that first since 2009 I have you know I've not been shot at and flag being don't tread on running this make right exactly um you know I so there are just certain things that made me very different than other people in the industry and I think I definitely think that that plays well your twitter name is no taxation yet which is a reference to the American Revolution which I know you know a lot of people think well you know no taxes I'm like that's not what it means I can I can't fit no taxation without representation on Twitter that's why it doesn't say that yeah that would be a long yeah and yeah not necessarily long you'd have no room for tweak but it would make you very economical with your word yes that's what I love about Twitter you probably feel the same way I write something really long time then I have to parse it and figure out how to make it fit and I feel so very good for joke writing like for the skill of joke writing to make to make things more concise like I always tell people that I think the greatest joke writer or the greatest comedian is Joey Diaz because he says he gives you the most amount of visuals and impact with the least amount of words it's just bah bah bah bah bah bah he knows how to like sink it in really quickly and Twitter's like a good tool for that but not if that's a little ridiculous that's because you only bit back I don't know if that's the case how it is now but well actually it definitely is right like if I write to you um if I reply to you your name takes up a big chunk of what I tweak right you but what you tweet doesn't take up so it's like 140 characters would be limiting people that respond to you rather than you tweeting yeah exactly and the beauty is too as you've probably noticed is that I think in the last year whatever they were images used to take up characters you know and then videos and links and I think the links are the only thing left that takes up the extra characters in addition to the name but it keeps everyone curt but that doesn't stop people from tweeting 7,000 times in a row and put the numbers on the mug on it - yeah I know I I did it just yesterday when I ran into some woman in San Francisco that I was walking my dog I'm a Boston Terrier she was like a little sicker her poop was a little wet so I went and picked it up and I left like some you know just like smear you'd have to use your fingernails to get off the ground so woman who came out of her apartment and started scolding me like she was waiting by the by the window to scold me for this and I like what the hell is going on so I had to tweet out a few tweets about that just for posterity yeah the Twitter thing is very weird but here's something that I really don't like and I'm glad I don't see much of it anymore is that twit longer shit hey that's a loophole yeah we don't do that don't do that Ralphy Mays do that shit all the time used to read his tweets I'm like what the fuck Ralphie why are you writing paragraphs here you know what's going on yeah some people you know I've gone to a foot world like going in Photoshop make a paragraph of a text and make that the image there yeah I'll do that on Instagram - oh yeah I've done that before I've drawn written things down then taking a photo I said I was going to do that for a while but I think that Twitter is just too impersonal I'm going to write all my stuff out and take a picture of it I was just fucking around I think if that's the except like if it's the exception I think it's totally fine i don't want people ruining twitter I like the Curtis yeah it's good it's a good good format but it also makes it extremely easy for people to do what happened to you yeah exactly because there's nuances lost right yeah lots as long as well it's always lost in text I mean what we're in writing it's very difficult even if you're reading a book sometimes you have to go over the previous paragraphs to figure out exactly how this guy was setting this up but I think what's what's happening what you're saying I see there's two parts are like one like the example he gave before about the guy saying that it's like girlfriend mode if he just said it's like say if your girlfriend and play video games and she wants a really easily accessible you could do it that way but I people probably would attack them even for that yeah it would say what are you implying the girls don't play video games well that's simple it's always the implication right like everyone's always out to assume the absolute worst and now so I was trying to write about Mike this guy is just trying to make an example he's probably given 15 PR interviews today he's probably exhausted he's also a developer so he doesn't have much PR training right he's trying to just get the point across why do you have to assume the man is a sexist and misogynist because of this one thing it's I'm willing to die on that hill because I feel like people deserve the benefit of the doubt people deserve to make a mistake or get a joke wrong or you know all those kinds of things and I feel like yes people are allowed to exercise their free speech on the other enemy like I don't like that joke or I don't like this or I don't like that but it doesn't stop there with what's going on with Dave Chappelle this week I thought it was really actually interesting with his too special to Netflix hmm people are freaking out about you know his jokes is his jokes about gay people or transgender people or whatever what comparing transgender people to black people and you know saying that it's a ridiculous comparison right like I actually after I saw the compel all the stuff I went and watched the first one then I watched half of the second one I'm falling asleep so I didn't want to watch anymore but I was like this is funny and Anthony Jeselnik or Daniel Tosh or maybe people shit their pants compared to what's going on with this kind of stuff and and it's always this drama that that seeks to kind of it doesn't stop it saying like I don't like it it's often insinuated or outright spoken that they want to censor it or change it that's like where I because I was reading a piece specifically about Chappelle where they're like this close up questions as to what like how far should comedy go and like you know that's a that doesn't call and that's when the free speech argument ends for me that's what I'm like you're actually now talking about changing it well it doesn't work it doesn't work with us with comics it just doesn't work we're not going to do it it's too many people like it I understand what they're trying to do because when they live in that world of cubicles and human resources and very restricted patterns of behavior that you have to follow if you live in an office environment and work in an office environment rather you know there's a lot of people out there that are boxed into these terrible situations we have to pretend to be this thing that you're not and again you don't have any personality you don't you're not allowed to say anything ridiculous or silly and when you you have that kind of environment and you see someone who's free like Dave Chappelle you you want to stop it you and if you can if you can point something out that can oh look he's saying something that's inappropriate he's saying something I don't agree with he's saying something let's get them let's go get them and then also in defense of the writers that are writing these articles look they're in a bizarre environment where they have to fucking constantly defend like their position they have to constantly get clicks as to constantly get hits they can't just put an article out and nobody reads it they'll lose their job so they have to write about something that's inflammatory write about something that's salacious something that's going to get people excited I mean that guy that wrote that thing about you for the International Business Times I looked into that International Business Times and one of the things about it is that there was a think was a mother jones article about that website where they were told like that the people who write articles were given some ridiculous tasks like they have to get 10,000 hits per article day right right so that might have for people don't know there was a guy who wrote an article about Colin where it said kind of funnies Colin Moriarty was resigns after writing a joke a racist joke that targeted women it was a racist even remote known in the slightest but when you take into account the environment that these people are forced to work in and you say well this guy literally is forced to write something that's more fucked up than it really is so you have to get people excited about this in a way that's going to get them to click on it and hopefully get him to his 10,000 hit quota if that is true I feel for him in a way I feel I mean I think he's working for a shitty business you know right but it's the same way I feel I mean I actually you know I came from the editorial world where you have to get clean we were get it our expectations are way higher and you know but you have those kind of requirements no not literally I know some sites do but well let me have to tell you our quota yeah like a quota or like you get bonuses if you get you know a certain amount of hits whatever we didn't have that we were salaried whatever and but you would if you would be fired ultimately if you weren't writing things that people were reading right I tried to stay out of my way for you know writing inflammatory things actually there are a couple of examples where I wouldn't write a story because I felt like it wasn't pertinent to any information and it was specifically to assassinate someone care well we've got a problem here you have fucking morals dude yeah it was the door yeah yeah like no room in this business I had a I had a hype a high profile woman in the gaming industry tell me in an interview that was unrelated to what I was actually interviewing her that she'd never was once the victim of sexism in the industry ever and that was and I was like I could write this but this isn't why I was there you know I wasn't interviewing her about this and this is going to cause her problems and that's not who I am I don't cause a problem because then people are gonna then people are gonna you know jump on and be like well you know I experienced this and I experienced this and you're diminishing and we'll just cause they're some drama like why would I do that but it's not see this is where it drives me crazy that's a beautiful example of people being cool if she can say hey I've never experienced any sexism in this business and you'd be like wow the gaming industry must be really cool and this woman has managed to get through the maze with a bunch of high fives and people appreciating her work wouldn't that be celebrated hmm I became English you know what I'm saying like why does that have to be in some ways a target like why is that story of target like wouldn't you assume that if there is a person who can reach a high level prominence in this very complicated business right I mean the gaming industry is incredibly complicated especially how weighted everything is when it comes to male versus female stuff that whole gamergate shit expose us so much of that which was really confusing to people in the outside especially people like me who don't play game right I was like what enough fuck is usual animation of these gamer people yes it's confusing me too I mean it the the second story I think was more pertinent though which was this guy had like this guy worked at a big publisher he was and he was laid off and he had like this huge meltdown on social media and people were writing about it and I was like I knew him personally and not it wasn't really friendly with him at the time but I knew him personally and I was like we should write about this in a way what is this what is this serving likelihood meltdown he just he just had he was just going off about how he was just angry and sad he's a young kid that finally got in and then he lost his grip on the job and was and was laid off wherever he's fine now he's back in the industry but the I was like I think I wasn't cut out to be like this hardcore like don't get him journalism like at any cost because I was like this is going to ruin this get like why would I want to contribute to this threat to this I didn't get into this industry to pile on people to ruin their lives I got into this industry that celebrate video games to tell interesting stories about games to challenge people's minds and I always tried to take that with me where I was like I'm not going to write anything for the clicks I could I could I could write these so you said salacious headlines I can write this you know this dirt or this stuff I heard whatever that's not who I am that's not who I want to be and I'd rather contribute more positively to the ecosystem then then be like well I'll just get clicks for this today and this guy's got to read the story and it's going to be in Google and LexisNexis forever and it's gonna for what so I can get 50,000 clicks one day and then just move on he's not gonna be able to move on do you want you didn't do anything that is worthy of being writing about me writing about this why are we always after people well your mindset is Noble I mean it is a great way to look at things it's it's weird that it's so unusual you know and that most people would be more self-serving and would choose the paths going to get them the most clicks and hey if I got a fucking crack a few eggs to make an omelet that's how it goes yeah and that's not what cuz I don't want I never wanted a cannon to be turned on me even though it was actually you know I mean that hate like the is try to put out that energy that you want that's probably that's positive or at least constructive if someone like murder someone in the gaming in true yes that's noteworthy we should probably write about that if someone it depends on who they murdered right what what do you mean well some is a terrible person they murdered I'm like Punisher style well that's different I guess we can we can have that conversation I guess yeah no I know what you're saying man I agree of you it's it's again it's knowable what would your mindset your philosophy is very noble and I wish more people shared it and I think that when there's all these people scrambling around like we're seeing now you know trying to find their niche and trying to get attention and you find more of that kind of predatory behavior yeah I agree and well that brings me back to Joe to what we were saying specifically about we feel bad for these writers at these sites and to me like the analogy I draw is like I hate the TSA right there's normal people that work for the TSA that are just trying to do their thing but that doesn't mean I don't hate the system that they work under and think the system should change and it's the same thing here it's like yeah these guys are victimized by the set of circumstances in which they under which they have to write but that doesn't mean that the system should remain the same because they need to write those stories talking about the TSN okay because I know more about that than Mel Bob is sure about your business rather sure like what what do you hate about the TSN there infringe on your Fourth Amendment rights that beat there warrantless searches des legally sees things I mean this is written very clearly in the Bill of Rights so and I hate the whole argument of like well you don't have you know or you you you kind of pass by your rights or you know give them up when you're an airport and I'm like you know they're they're inalienable actually so I just have a huge problem I don't have a problem going to a metal detector or something reasonable a reasonable search yeah like well it's it's kind of reasonable because there are carbon fiber blades and all these different plastic blades that they can make now that you could really fuck somebody up that are not going to show up in a metal detector sure but it goes back to the first of all you know I don't think that we're going to have many problems on airplanes anymore I think that they're moving on to something else and no plane is going to get hijacked anywhere now that know everyone knows what's going to happen but do you as soon as you think like that that's when something happens that's that could be different that could be an argument I also want to give a shout that serious things happen my dad didn't retire New York City firefighter so it's it's I that create very Klein knew people that died that day but it's still you know and my dad could have died that day depending on the circumstances thank God he didn't but to me it was like I just would write it's like the old Benjamin Franklin thing you know it's balancing your Liberty in your freedom of security right and I think that we've we've given them so much power with Patriot Act with the TSA with all these things were like this is a bad road to go to go down and they're just going to take more and more so you know what is the Benjamin Franklin quote he who values safety over yet over over Liberty deserves neither state nor liberty you know I I think the TSA has a ridiculously hard job and I think the requirements that people have so what people request of them to make sure that they are safe and then you give them $10 an hour whatever the fuck they make they don't make much you know what you get is a bunch of under-qualified people who are tired and they're tired of working we do it like that the constant flow if you watch out I like to study people at the airport because I feel like it's one of the rare times where you could just stare at people while they're doing their job and no one gets weird with you because everybody's staring at that guy or that girl that's taking your license and scanning your ticket and all that just I just stare at them and I watch how they interact with all these people and people are fucking tired that's what I see I see I see frustration I see so many people in these lines and I see that people just being exhausted and then the people that have to deal with the people that don't take the shoes out sorry of taking shoes why are partially dog take your fucking shoes off man you see that kind of thinking right right just there on the edge all the time so you're not dealing with them well sorry you have to get shoes off because it's going through this thing it's not as one guys dealing with the short hold day he's dealing this constant river of human beings that are coming through and some of them have water bottles and you've got to make sure those dangerous water bottles don't get on the plane there's a lot of stupid shit that that goes with the TSA but how the fuck else are you going to keep people from bringing shoe bombs or knives on planes and it's really hard to do no it is I mean I don't think that the the the counter point would be to just get rid of it just right walk into a terminal and be able to get on an airplane but I remember you know if you remember too and a lot of people do we had the security apparatus before 9/11 these guys outsmarted the security apparatus by doing very specific things including like knowing how to fly planes and doing all the things that you can't popularly check for and also people get guns and knives and weapons intentionally through the TSA all the time so then I think well there's something like over 90% of like agents that we're trying to get through things through the TSA succeeded so these are these are the people standing in between us and Isis yeah they don't do it accidentally all the time they have stuff in their bag and it gets through and then they go what the fuck you know I mean it happens all the time yeah I knew a guy that that brought a ton of weed overseas accident like that's terrifying like here's a shit I know I meet like me too like I go through I bet just for anything you might leave in there and yeah I always come through just make sure there's not you know you never know what can happen but to the point you didn't mean to do that right it really wasn't that it was there it was yeah yeah yeah it's it's not a perfect system and it's not going to be and that's just the way it is it would be nice if it was more efficient it would be nice if people got paid better it'd be nice if it was easier and quicker there'd be a lot of it would be nice but I don't know of anybody that's come up with a better system for scanning people and making sure that they don't bring guns or bombs or whatever the fuck is a German airplane it's just bizarre that airplanes are the one place where we have so much fucking security we're malls which are filled with way more people than your average plane there's something about terror and flying where it's already terrifying like yeah you think you're scared now bitch what if it blows up in the sockets guy dude pulls a fucking turban out of a bag and wraps around his head and starts lightness underwear on fire you know that's that's what we're scared of we're scared of someone taking it to the next level because people are already tensed yes you're in a metal tube hurling through the sky at 500 miles an hour if it blows up while you do in that it's even more freaky oh my god horrifying but you got weird it's terrifying but like it's kind of strange whereas like that seems to be like the preferred method of Terror like that we're really worried about which is why the TSA exists in the first place because the volume of humans that go through a lot of places is probably commensurate with the volume of humans that go through the airport oh sure you don't have a single place that you could mention that is strict with what you carry around as the airport you could walk into the fucking mall with a loaded gun any day of the week any day of the week every single time I walk on the mall I am just never checked I know but nobody frisks me I don't go there any metal detectors you could walk in armed to the fucking teeth and that was going tot be the mall security guard the fuck out of here and it is a little yeah that's you BAE yeah like during Christmas time there are thousands of people at the mall thousands thousands and thousands yeah I agree I mean that's it's like it's more like the Israeli experience where like this this kind of shit can happen at any time anyway right a very vigilant about that I often wonder that as well like why doesn't even at a security checkpoint in an airport why not just do it there yeah like like and I really think it's that they you know to your point with the mall and all these kinds of things and these public places I think it just speaks to the fact that most people vast majority people are just good decent people that want to go for their lives for sure and that these terrorists could target all these different places I don't think they do maybe because they camp but probably more because they don't want to give themselves away for something that might be seen as minor like 9/11 was a spectacle wasn't only that 3,000 some odd people died it was that it was the spectacle of killing those people in that way and so I think that there's something that about that as well which is why I'm more scared about like a dirty bomb or something like that today than I am of anyone taking an airplane over because everyone knows what happened in 2001 so now someone pulled out a knife on an airplane and try someone's just going to tackle that guy and probably kill him oh yeah yeah so I'm not sure that's why and the guy yeah I know the guy tried to blow a shoe up or something like that on the plane that's why we have to take our fucking shoes off now but yet to me I'm like the the the threat has changed the threat is evolving and we can be vigilant in all these ways but then I wonder it goes back to like NSA and all these things like how much are we going to give the government and how much are we going to give up in order for safety I'd rather live in a more dangerous world's first personally and know that no one's reading my text messages or no one's throwing out my hand lotion you know or learn about harassing I saw these two women Australian women in the airport that's a phone when I came down to LA last week they were in wheelchairs they were they were going through all their stuff and like and I'm like what the fuck are you doing to these people just leave them alone and I actually went up to the math words and I'm like I'm sorry we hate these people too just so you know so this is not okay with any of us that there they were there for like a half an hour ago they had these frowns on their faces they were they look dejected this might be their first time in the States for all I know or go to peep map yeah there's what happens you come over here to check your shit take your pants off what do you got in there it's like will you packing the harassing old women they're right you know harassing I think I saw in JFK was like going through like a nun's bag or some like what what this is madness to me I'm like this is not be a budding everyone running on each other but it's not because if it wasn't if they didn't go through everyone thoroughly and they oh we're going to let nuns go through and then what happened someone who goes where else is a nun and they act as a tourist they or they are a tourist I like the someone is I don't know much about you probably know more about it than I do but someone was telling me a little bit about the is rate the way the Israelis do airport security specifically that it's it they it's like all about its they're not profiling but even based on race or anything the profiling based on like your behavior and it goes to your point like these are well-paid professional people that know what the fuck they are doing know they're looking for and they're in the airport and they see someone just acting a little weird well and they also do some crazy shit like I had a friend went there and took photos of some anti-semitic pictures some like Nazi swastikas on something so you know what these really guys did at the airport they shot her computer and they gave it back really yes Jesus yeah so there's that's a little over the top yeah I was a little over so there's that a little more balance than that I said can we see your computer and they opened up a computer terrible ISM is really accident I'd even know where to go with it there I just put a fucking halt she heard talk talk and they gave her back a fucking computer that's half hour later that's that's um that's a little too strong arm for me but uh until your point to the point like I don't know this I just don't like the security theater aspect uh but we all know what's going on everyone yeah because inconvenience these people are miserable we're miserable it's just it goes back down and no one wants to make hard decisions or even do what like really hard work like what works what doesn't let's do a studies let's figure out what what we're doing instead of looking at people naked in machines and what you also have to take the in well you don't really see anyone making machines anymore that's not real I know but back in the day but even back in the day it was just like come on man what are you worried about what worried it people are so silly worried about people seeing naked but the the thing that gets to me though is like how can you make it safer no one has offered up any sort of alternative to the TSA that makes any sense to me I mean I've heard people say the TSA is incompetent I fucking hate them they know violation the Fourth Amendment but there's no there's no alternatives that I've seen that they're even remotely responsible no I mean III think it goes back to me of like I can't speak necessarily to the level of a confidence because I'm not in security I don't know like what they're specifically do I don't know what their level of training is it just goes back to the constitutionality of it like if we if we and and it brings up those tough questions it's the same way I feel about about the Second Amendment if we start seeding what this means in certain situations and before you know it does continue to erode it away like and so when I'm like this is a warrantless search this is by definition a warrantless search if you went got John J and James Madison and all these guys and asked and somehow told what the fuck was going on and then said like what is does this look like right but you would have to go and get them and then go okay this is Isis and this is the internet and then this was Twitter and this is a this is how they send information through pictures with met a day you know it's encoded in the picture and you have to break it down that's where the message is like they'd be like oh yeah search everybody there we go my god you live in a terrible place city I got to go to bed in really process this you know like back in the day we only had muskets it was so awesome I don't know if I argument make sense to you but but to me it's I just feel like these are certain sacred rights that need to be protected in any way they can and if we want to have a conversation about like why we should cede this right in the specific way then you have to do it a little more clearly and to me I just I think people take some of these things for granted that you know what's stopping them from you know if these rights continue a road then what stops them from bussing in your house at some point be like well well they can do that and there there are some search and seizure methods that they're they're really being criticized for lately in particular for these for drug offenses where they just don't even knock they just break open people's doors and wind up shooting their dogs all the time shoot people all the time I mean there was an article written recently about the amount of people that are wounded in unnecessary like how do they describe that kind of altercation between the cops no knock no search 'less warrant or what is it I think they just call it no knock break-ins or something I don't know how they describe it but if you've seen the way the DEA treats any sort of a situation even when they just have marijuana they'll kick down the door if they see a dog they shoot it and then they make people huddle up in the corner after they just murdered your family pet and oftentimes they find like a pipe you know I mean there's many people that have been called on like someone has turned them in or someone has said something about them that turned out to not be true like hey these people have a grow-op in their business or in their house rather and one of them was a former FBI a couple that both worked in the FBI they kicked in their fucking door held them at gunpoint the whole deal went to the basement they're growing tomatoes and they're like what in the fuck these are retired FBI officers and the DEA broke down their door and pointed a loaded gun in their face and then found plants yeah you can eat that you can eat you can eat weed too but they can actually not bad for you I I so these are grabbing actually that one thing sounds familiar with the family at being kill I think I saw a video I got a lot of it not just one thing man one of them was a mayor and god damn it was it washing where is it where is it there was a mayor who the it turned out that the post office someone in the post office was running a scam and what they were doing was they were having we'd sent to other people's addresses and they were sending it through the post office and the postman would intercept the package because he was the guy who delivered that I drove it so he would get that package and somehow or another it got intercepted before it got to the postman and then they had a dummy postman come and bring it and then do the whole break down the door shoot the dog thing they chased the dog a golden lab chased him out in the yard the good the dog Ram like was running and hiding and they shot him in front of everybody and it turned out the guy who was the victim of this and his family who were held at gunpoint and zip-tied he was a mayor and so you know he was like what in the fuck are you people dealing like what is this you just killed my dog in front of my kids you know traumatized my family yes awful but you're making the argument of my excavating of why we have to take a stand you know like why we have to say like and that is it in that situation yeah yeah but that's not TSA though no but it is a Fourth Amendment issue that we would that are allowing to be eroding no one should be allowed to go into anyone's home without a warrant matter what but don't you think that you sort of imply at least a certain amount of consent when you get in that line and give them your bag and say here search this like no one's telling you that you have to do that short you could choose to fly with no baggage at all you could choose if you wanted to to send your stuff through the mail and it would probably cost the same amount as it would to pay that 50 bucks or whatever it is with Southwest if you wanted to send your package through the mail you could do it that way and just walk through with nothing on you sure you could do that yeah and you would still have to go through the machines all that I don't know I don't dispute that because I agree with you in the pre 9/11 world going through the metal detectors are having your bags you know looking at it through the machine I think that that's all reasonable I just don't like the people being pulled aside pulled in the rooms people just going to be kind of very disrespectful going through shit man I don't know I mean I have it I just is that is that a hill worth dying on in a way it is because I feel like it could just as you made the point it's already seen that mentality now in a lots of different places right I just want to see what that I don't want to see the end result of that you know that mentality is also the justification for the NSA being able to look at your text messages or being able to look at your emails and that's the big thing that was exposed by Edward Snowden that really pissed me off that so many people are so flippin about they were like hey if you're not doing anything wrong don't worry about it like that is wrong you can't say that because you can't look at everyone you can't just randomly look at everyone and look at the private information you just can't do that because the people that are looking at that are just people and that's the problem to TSA it's not even necessarily the issue being that you get to search people stuff to make sure there's no terrorists and no people bring weapons on planes it's who gets to do that who are these people are these people experts are these people security experts other do they work for the Mossad you know are they are they CIA agents are they FBI are they who's looking who these people are they competent why are they doing you go to the airport man you see what you see is a bunch of people and I used to joke about this that I think that is how do i phrase this million sounds less insulting than it used to be the old joke but the idea was that I think that the people who work at Burger King at the airport and the TSA they're the same people and they just reach into a hat today I got fries oh shit I'm on bomb do you literally almost like that you see people that are just taking whatever job they can get a hold of you know I feel for them I mean if someone comes along and you don't have a job and they say hey the TSA siren 15 bucks an hour okay cool what I got to do you get a stand here make sure people don't bring water bottles on a plane all right and then after like you know a 50th day of people bring in water and take your fucking water bottle out of the bag no you're doing yeah I might my frustration grows in that way which is people that in 2017 seem to have some VA because you and I I'm sure you do too I fly all the time right you'd you see all types right and it's like you always encounter the guys like have you not flown in the last 15 years ever to know that people trying to walk through the machines with their shoes on their belt it's like well that's right and then their inconvenience people that they'll push their bins through the you know down in the thing and just leave it there for someone else to push through my what is going on people just cunts there was this one guy was really kind of funny he was going through the metal detector thing and he had a bottle of in his bag and because he had a bottle of water his bag data check his back and so when he goes through they set your bag aside you know your thing goes to the line it hits the scanner and they say they pull it back check so this guy was like checking his phone and looked at the bag check I mean like 30 seconds had gone by and he goes I have a flight to catch excuse me excuse me I have a flight to catch and the woman who grabbed his back had said what are the odds you're an airport you got a flight to catch how crazy and she goes hey you got a water bottle in your bag dummy and she pull in everybody was laughing it was funny because the guy was getting a cunt right and the girl just kind of called him out on it and the way she did it was very humorous I got a good chuckle out of it yeah I mean yeah you see I always try to show to your point about showing some respect to the TSA agents I have my confrontations with them some what do you what kind of confrontation well yeah well just in the sense like just a couple of weeks ago I guess it was when I came down to see Dave I was with my girlfriend and they were going through they were going through a bag they held my girlfriend's bag but they were just holding it for like you 3.4 minutes we weren't in a rush but I'm like regard wasn't even acknowledging that like hey dude our stuffs here like we're kind of just standing here waiting and I'm like what and I said to my dear are you enjoying your a little bit of power right now I don't understand what like why you're doing this to us we said please and thank you we're doing like doing ours numb so there's these little confrontations I had a massive when I was in when I was installing high school because 9/11 happened when I was in twelfth grade and I flew down to 2002 or tell them to I flew down to Virginia to see my sister who was teaching down there and I they were going through my stuff my bags and so my dad I had a confrontation with the TSA where they were some of them one of them was like son do you know what happened or whatever you know and I'm like yeah I know what happened I'm from New York I live in New York 9/11 and my dad's a New York City firefighter yeah I understand what happened you know and like to the point where like like where they called over like I was a 17 year old kid and they're to the point where they called over like some cops and then they're just they like just let me go whatever but I was like at that point it was so so to me where I'm like why are you being so why are you disrespecting me like you're going through my stuff if I'm a little upset about that or I have something to say about that like I understand you have to probably deal with this all day but don't don't cuz I'm a young kid I don't know what happened because I'm a young man I don't you had no idea what my experience was were you at the funeral for a firefighter that you knew that died you know I was so like you know it's that kind of stuff always I think it showed a seed in me very early with them wearing like that so I acknowledge that part of it too you know where it's like there's a little bit of a chip on my shoulder with them I'm sure I never have a confrontation with them I'm always super friendly I go through say hi to people I just I just treated as like just this is what I'm doing now I don't say this is a big inconvenience I just say this is what you have to do this is what I'm doing now I do respect this idea that the Fourth Amendment is being violated but I do not see a better alternative if I did I would think that what we should definitely follow that protocol whatever the better alternative is I just think whenever you have non skilled labor in those sort of situations like the guy working the fries at Burger King or the guy who's you know doing that thing at the TSA you're going to get of what wide variety of people that need a job right and some of them are just going to suck at protocol they're going to suck at being polite they're going to suck it recognizing that this old I don't think they have any leeway either if some old lady comes through the wheelchair I'm pretty sure you have to check her just like you check everybody else and if you don't you probably get fired if cameras watching them everywhere so it's not their fault the organization itself the TSA I mean it's a diffusion of responsibility when you're in one of the people that's responsible you're at the top and you make these these laws and you pass them down to the people that are supposed to enforce all these regulations that you you know you've you've written down there's almost like there's a diffusion of responsibility from the people that have created those ladida they don't have to enforce them or not they're doing it so someone else it's someone else's job at $10 an hour guy it's his job to go out there and do all this stuff and so it's real easy for someone at the top who's not experiencing the interaction the day-to-day interaction with these human beings to be callous about it or to make like hard fast rules like hey if someone comes through in a wheelchair there's no leeway let him go but then again you have to think about it in their point of view like if someone was a terrorist and they did decide well here's what we did I mean they've it's been proven for a fact they've used children of suicide bombers so why would you use an old lady you know why wouldn't you use an old man why are you someone in a wheelchair you certainly could so you have to follow the same protocol with everybody everybody that goes through has to be scanned you can't let someone need not be scanned just because they're old like you've reached amount of years on this planet you wouldn't do anything fucking crazy would you Bob you know no not me you know you you you can't think like that because if you do think like that that will be your vulnerability that would be the path in that someone is looking to do something horrible we'll take I think that the I think the solution to bridge the gap in the way we feel about this and I come to some sort of consensus what might be and this conflict a little with my small government kind of mentality but it's just to say like it to ask the kind of fundamental question why are these people being paid ten or fifteen dollars an hour back to the Israeli experience these guys that are professionals they're they take a lot of pride in their work they make maybe eighty thousand or hundred thousand dollars a year and they you know not that they needed nestling need to make that much money but people that are professional should we invest more money and making this smarter you know it would be a substantial increase in our airline fees and other things I'm sure sure maybe it wouldn't well maybe maybe you know well we already pay a little bit of that but with tickets but I think you know homeland security might be able to maybe we stop dropping bombs on a bunch of countries and take some of that money put it on you know influence of that dari what else you suggest no more drones fucking communist who is this guy yeah I mean that what the Israeli thing is interesting because Israel has a mandatory military service requirement that I am not in favor for favor of but I am like part of the reason one I feel the I feel the benefit of it like you it's very rare to meet people that are more patriotic than Israelis you know people that are more more committed to their country it's like a very mean they feel very marginalized very targeted and rightly so and so because of that like people that I've met that worked for the Israeli army or that have been soldiers over there they have this very intense sort of view of altercation and of the world and when you're forced to do two years military service mandatory like they are you also have you're invested in this whole project of Israel I mean there's not there's no veterans and then civilians right everyone's a fucking veteran and you know when you deal with a country where literally everyone does some military service there's everybody's there's more chips in the game you know people are all in different different scenarios yeah I think you know I went to school with this girl that was Israeli when I was at Northeastern in Boston and I remember very clearly she had this you wouldn't very unassuming you would never know but she had this picture of her was an assault rifle shooting at a range I'm like this is so so interesting it conflicts because I agree with you it's like one of those things where I'm like I don't I can see both sides of this where I don't know that the state should have the right to exert that kind of power but at the same time does it have to be military services when a person turns 18 is it fair to say like just spend a couple years and give something to your country and whether it's you you you work in a soup kitchen or something or you do something that is for the society and really have some some investment in some skin in the game in society I think that that's a nice idea but I think that the way I feel about the state's exertion of power over the individual kind of overrides that but I like I like the idea in principle like the idea of saying like hey and it's also easy for me as a 33 year old that would be long Gremio to be like yeah you guys do it so at the same time I understand that argument as well no I think I'm completely in agreement with you I love the idea that they're all in but I don't want anybody unfortunate man on me and I want I want a kid if the kid grows up in America and then decides hey man I'm gonna backpack across the country now you can't you got to join the army you fuck I don't want that you know I want I want people to be doing whatever the fuck they want hey I want to be a fly fishing guide in Colorado no you can't you have to clean machine guns right right now fuck that you know I don't I love the fact that America has so much ultimate freedom for like what you choose to do and not to do look we we live in this sort of experiment in self-government and you cannot participate if you want to I like that elect you don't have to vote I mean I'm not be saying that everybody should fuck off and not vote but I am saying that I like that it's your option me too I think they have compulsory voting in Australia I want to say and look how that works out pumpkin kangaroos are everywhere dude crocodiles spider poisonous bugs shit got a place like horrifying but but yeah and no I've never been better but I live there it's like that's number three on my list yeah we're number one America number two Canada number three Australia that seems like a pretty reasonable list I mean either a good list just being in the gaming industry I know a lot of people some people I really love that came from Australia really friendly people but the interior that country sounds like a an absolute fucking shit show it's crazy but it's also really gorgeous it's wild I have a good buddy lives over there goes into the interior all the time and he he's one who sent me a video of a brown snake getting killed by some evil spider system is the brown snake kills you like instantly and it's an evil spider that was killing the brown snake I'm like what the fuck kind of a shit hole do you live in Adam he's a madman he's out there living in that shit a man like me would not be able to survive there this could camped out there he goes out into the bush and shoots buffaloes with bow and arrow he's and he's a maniac but the area of Australia is the size of the continental United States but there's as many people as less than the amount of people that live in the Greater Los Angeles area living the entire this whole fucking continent of Australia it's a nut that's incredible yeah it's like personally on the west coast and then it's just Sydney and Melbourne right now let's go Smith basically cleans Queensland Queens there's a few other places but the bottom line is there's a giant percentage of that place where you don't want to get caught dead no no IIIi I wouldn't I'm the kind of guy with like where I see a spider and I have to argue with my girlfriend who's gonna kill it so I don't I don't wanna I don't want you really yeah I argue I always have up bro it's always oh it always ends up on me but I hate I hate I have I hate spiders so so if I see even these little I hate them to get arachnophobia no I don't think I have that I'm not gonna like if I see one calling me I'm not going to run out the house but I'm like I don't want it's just a job I have to like really think about my strategy not how I'm gonna kill this thing yeah yeah it's one of those things where I'm like new so if I was not sure I'm just being honestly so I was in Australia you know super careful in Australia oh my god dude I see some of these things when people are outside barbecuing even in like Melbourne or something like that yeah and the camera pans that look it's a brown snake and I'm like holy Jesus God I wouldn't I don't know what is not for this the waters are filled with sharks you get past the sharks they're filled with jellyfish you get to the shore is poisonous spiders you go into the hills it's poison fucking snake is it about that part of the world like at least it's unbeliev an award and all that kind of self in the water and and they'd be box jellyfish of the scariest didn't really can kill you they kill you if you fall into like some sort of patch or where they calm a school of jellyfish if you accidentally stumble upon one you're a dead person you're fucked I mean they just you're dead instantly yeah really created their little tiny guys I'm gonna just warm onion their heart that jellyfish are always scary growing up on Long Island we had obviously harmless jellyfish but they would wash up on the shore sometimes and they're used to look at one of the companies are so string what is this Jerry Oh spider killing a brown snake another one so spiders just eat ground snakes all the time is according to the web is vehicle verifying webs are awesome horrifying and not me not to me snakes your cuts I don't know who's team I'm on I think I'm on team snake more than I am on team spies I think I am too just because they're less scary to me Plus well you can eat spiders apparently tarantulas are delicious they cook them a lot in the Amazon they've these big spiders that they cook and there are a lot like crabs they taste like crabs and apparently they're really similar in like their lineage they're genetic interesting yeah I mean if you put a piece of if you put a spider in for me I know what it was I'd be funny I know even if I didn't know what it was if you know it's like a chili when it's dead so yeah yeah if it's good if it's good if it's delectable that's why I shouldn't say I've eaten spiders before I'm done Fear Factor I'll eat a couple spiders I need a cave African cave glowing spider Jaime just freaked out you must have seen some things on that show man like yeah I'm pretty numb yeah I guess that explains a lot of your kind of more you've seen it all like an old prostitute I've seen too much you know 50 year old prostitute in Holland like whatever smell gonna stay right you can show or do to me that lipstick on my teeth I'm not even bother to clean it off I'm curious about it because you brought it up before but what is your stance on Snowden it seems like you're against the NSA all that constable what is your stance on him like I'm curious like what you think he should come back do you think that he should is he a patriot you know I think he's more of a patriot than he is a traitor I agree but I think it's a very complex issue when you give away national secrets and you're you have signed an oath that you're not going to give away national secrets you sign an oath of secrecy and we give away national secrets but if those national secrets are in the case of Edward Snowden they're very detrimental to what we think of as freedom in this country like if you have a bunch of people like you or me or Jamie or just a normal person and they work at the NSA and they can as he have said he has said spy on their ex-girlfriends read their emails go into anybody's email that you want to and check check them out and then we were also being lied to by the government about the extent of these searches and he exposed that but the president was saying it's just metadata and he was saying no it's not just metadata it's not it's the actual emails it's the actual text messages the actual photos that you're sending to each other they can get those they have all of those and that they're storing all this stuff people were horrified but this is also something that was exposed there was an NSA whistleblower from who I want to say 2011 there was a guy who was a I think he was a coder in the NSA and he's gone public with this but he didn't go public with this in the same way where he dumped a bunch of documents and and let people go through them like Edward Snowden did and he also didn't face the consequences that Edward Snowden did as well he didn't really he was criticized and you know it was debated whether or not him talking about it at all was legal or whether he should be able to but ultimately he didn't face the same kind of consequences I mean Edward Snowden can't live in America anymore I mean Chelsea Manning has been exonerated or what is hardened they're hardened yeah yeah said the word Department when you did commuter to such a commuted eccentric so the commuted the sentence and you know she's allowed to be free in May so in a couple months she'll be free but he's stuck in Russia and he essentially the difference being they said that Chelsea Manning uh went to you like went through the court system was tried and then Obama decided that it was a good enough amount of time and then he was going to commute the sentence so I kind of see their point there that that were Snowden fleed and didn't go through the whole but but why wouldn't he flee you gonna lock him in a fucking cage Chelsea Manning was locked in a cage 24 hours a day with the lights on with no fucking clothes in solitary confinement confinement for I don't know how long but it was a long period of time I want to say years I want to say how long was find out how long was Chelsea Manning and solitary confinement for because I know the way they did it was cold in there and they took away all her clothes or it was his clothes at the time was it Yugi and Wendy when you start saying him or her yeah I think a deal of that yeah I don't I think it's a ethical point when you're thinking back on the person before they transitioned like do you say that Bruce Jenner won the Olympics so do you say the Caitlyn Jenner won the honor of Jesus I don't know there was another way to say the wrong thing okay the former army analyst a two weeks in solitary confinement connection the suicide attempt in July no no that's just one the declined to discipline them with two weeks no but she's been in solitary confinement not just over the suicide attempt this is this is like way late that's 2016 go not not the solitary confinement after suicide attempt but just go to solitary confinement don't look at Chelsea look at Bradley Manning um solitary confinement yeah I was before he was tried yeah like you could say he and say he could you get yelled at I bet you could okay I'm a Yeller you will what a he but I think it's reasonable to say before the transition when you look back in posterity on a person maybe it's up to that person but I would assume that the pronoun would change the bellboy give a fuck it's ridiculous infuse it's so stupid there was a there's a case of transgender fighter who was a man for 30 years became a woman for two years and started beating the fuck out of these women they're okay and didn't tell them by the way oh so they didn't so the organizers were ever didn't know he didn't tell she whatever didn't tell the peoples and she was fighting but here's the best part about it I was debating with someone online and this woman said that she's always been a woman that this person has always been a woman and I said okay do you realize that this person fathered a child I said so even when he was a man having sex with a woman and got her pregnant he was what he was woman then and this woman goes even then I'm like okay we're done well fuck that doesn't make and this is a offense okay 23 hours a day for over an 11-month area ship and conditions that he also found might have constituted torture that sounds portrait yeah Juan Mendez has completed a 14 month investigation into treatment of Manning since the soldiers arrest the US military base in May of 10 he concludes the US military was at least culpable of cruel and inhumane treatment and keeping Manning locked up alone for 23 hours a day for in over an 11 month period in conditions that he found okay so yeah that was that was what it was was it was almost a year of solitary confinement and I'm pretty sure that he at the time she now was naked and they took everything away from him no books no nothing so it's really I mean oh yeah nothing to read man cold they keep it cold they keep it cold where you're like barely able to tolerate it holy shit what do you do you like what is your where did your one of the places your mind goes I would start doing kung-fu yeah I'll just start just our real good idea I'd be like Wesley Snipes in that one movie where they kept him locked up I think strip naked at night yeah I think that you know what they did was what they are allowed to do you know you're allowed to do whatever you want to do when you get someone locked up like that they don't really have the kind of rights that an average person does you get locked up for treason and there was a tremendous amount of heat coming towards us military when that WikiLeaks video what was it what was it called what did they call it something about collateral murder I think that was what the call was really wasn't the true with the drones or was it no it was a helicopter oh I know okay a helicopter shooting fucking horrific gunfire down on these people that turn out to be reporters and then the callous attitude that these soldiers showed in the video we can hear them talking about whether or not there are kids in the van well they shouldn't have brought kids like the whole thing was like really dark yeah and I think in a lot of ways exposure to that stuff is good because unchecked behavior is extremely dangerous that seemed like it was unchecked and it seems like unchecked behavior in a time of war is extremely dangerous and it was pretty obvious that when you looked at what Edward Snowden had revealed it was pretty obvious that the majority of the American people had a huge problem with it the majority of American people you or I who are doing nothing wrong I'm not committing any crimes I'm not I'm certainly not victimizing anybody why do they have access to my email why there's no reason no reason you just can like that that seems insane and that to me is a way clear violation of the Fourth Amendment then this weird sort of gray area not necessarily great if you're looking in from a constitutional sense of how they're allowed to check you at the airport yeah no I think that's a very valid and solid argument I think because my stance on Manning specifically has softened softened over time because I feel like you know when he or she what I don't know can we call our z uz I'm not trying to be disrespectful no I'll be in districts panel use Arkin son of a bitch sorry racist to RL I know that's what LexisNexis will call me a racist for the rest of my life but uh yet to me it was like I felt like it was it was very dating takes the time to people died because of that stuff like there are people that were put in danger because of the things that they were put out because it wasn't they didn't carefully comb through it and make sure that attention where people died yeah you could look they I don't think we look at upset breath because of the way WikiLeaks released it yeah because I don't think that I don't know they're gonna point out specific things but the way things were out it like I don't think all the names were blacked out I don't think like I operate the operations and process like people were in play you know that were being outed in that way I think the reason I was a little softer on Snowden was because not only was it domestic primarily a big which i think is an important qualifier but also because I think he went out of his way to not single any individuals out it was all about the apparatus itself it wasn't about like saying like general blah blah blah doing this and general or Admiral but it was about like hey this structure exists and it's really quite nefarious indeed you know and I think that so I was always to me my stance on him is he's a patriot you should be welcomed home and the fact that he wasn't he can't be I guess party hasn't been tried or whatever but the fact that I know that some people think that Obama only pardoned Manning because it made him look good with the transgender community and with the lbgtq community which i think is a little there may be an evening office so well because it's part of his legacy like as far as saying like yeah it's the same reason why you know how much Ford was hurt when he pardoned Nixon that stuck with him forever in a negative way well this is going to stick with Obama I think positively in a good way moving forward but I don't know that I'm not I'm quite that callous in thinking about reason I think that he probably had time to marinate on it mmm clearly she went through some rigors well also what's important to point out is that Obama's website the hope and change website that he had when he was running for president and when he got into office the original website had in it these provisions for how he was going to treat whistleblowers with with they were going to like allow people to release information that showed crimes and they were going to protect them they're going to protect whistleblowers it was a very specific statement was a very specific approach that they were having while he was running for president about whistleblowers because he was about exposing these egregious offenses and when once he got into office one of the things that happened after the Chelsea Manning thing and after the Edward Snowden things they removed that from the hope and change website they removed that provision about whistleblowers interesting because obviously he was obviously he was a creep was uneasy thurr hypocrite or is unable to keep that problem right well that goes back to the whole thing with snown when you're saying well you kind of take a hose you know to protect these secrets and all that kind of stuff but yeah I look at it you know I want people to be flippin with that kinda stuff like you were saying people to be flippantly being my well this is I have some sort of personal problems it's but I actually think it takes a level of courage like what in the fuck is going on here okay and also I believe that before he gave that information to Glenn Greenwald I believe he offered it to a bunch of different mainstream news sources like New York Times Washington Post correct me if I'm wrong and I think I was in the documentary that the I didn't see it so it's logical Dahlia socially try to watch in the hotel room what's up doesn't say which ones you want me look up I got that - no no one died as a result Oh suffered one which one don't want to earlier about shells about Manning okay it did it but it's Jimmy does it doesn't say anything about like that that was I remember that being contentious that they were saying the reason that they were upset about it was because they were like this puts people better in play in danger now well maybe that maybe I maybe the underwear but maybe no one actually does the writer had a USA Today piece I think about it and she got a lot of heat for Pope for even writing that jump in the first place puts people in danger that people died from they're out of his leaks okay so she got a lot of heat because they haven't oh oh interests probably what it is probably read that okay yeah man people again you a racist and people have died I mean Google says it but you know sanneh me like people need clickbait so with her writing an article saying that bunch of people died or someone died it's kind of the same thing they're trying to make something juicier sure I'd go even with the London terrorist attack you know a recent one yeah the one that just happened where people they've seemed to have identified the person good new sources that were that are what you think are reputable say it and then they have to retract it later everyone everyone's very quick yeah try to pull pull the gun first and be like what we have we have the story yeah they're all victimized as you know people that are just we're not in the trenches so we need the information we have to trust these people and and Trust is broken I think it a little yeah I I certainly think there should be some sort of a national debate on whether or not Edward Snowden is a hero you know whether or not Edward Snowden did something that benefited the American people because I certainly think the overall reaction the overall like if you look at what Edward Snowden did and then you look at what are the consequences of what he did I think it's good for us because we got to see that all these Alex Jones type conspiracies were actually true when Alex Jones is ranting and raving about the government living in your email one of the great episodes of the show by the way I love it yes but people were looking into that like there's no fucking way there's no way the government really looks in your email there's no way it doesn't happen but yes they do like that was that was a stunner to me and is for me was it I've been telling people that Alex Jones who's my friend and has been my friend for a long time I get Christmas so much by people prevent they're like he's so crazy he's such a fuckin right-wing wacko my Alex Jones is not right-wing he's not he's anti-government he's anti tyranny and and he might be crazy as fuck and he probably is but he's right about a lot of shit and that's where it gets really scary so he was talking about the NSA looking into people's emails and having the ability to like I found out about that NSA whistleblower the original ones he could find who that guy is I want to say yes yes pulled it pull it pull up that article I found out about that from Alex he told me about I'm like what and then I hear bill Binney the original NSA whistleblower on Snowden 9/11 and illegal surveillance now he was God I want to say it was before 9/11 wasn't it before 9/11 that he came with this scroll down or was it right after 9/11 he believes that 9/11 was preventable a month after it happened he resigned to protest from the National Security Agency been he was part of an elite NSA team that was which designed and built an intelligence gathering system to target and collect data on terrorism threats he belongs to an intimate group of four whistleblowers each of whom left the NSA after raising concerns about failures and the agency's intelligence gathering capabilities yeah so he's he was the first guy that was saying what they're doing is bullshit over he alleges the NSA buried key intelligence that could have prevented 9/11 he alleges the agency's bulk data collection from internet and telephone communications is unconstitutional and illegal in the u.s. he alleges that the NSA is ineffective at preventing terrorism because analysts are too swamped with information on that makes sense under its bulk collection program that totally makes sense yeah when you're when you have everything what do you where you begin yeah I mean all those things that he's doing that there's no way I mean who that's the thing like a friend of mine was joking around about this because managers I'm just not comfortable the NSA reading my email I go of course you're not comfortable I'm Nydia but guess what who's fucking reading your shit man nobody's reading your shit yet no ekta yeah it's that's not even the point right it yeah well goes back to the point we're making was with the Patriot Act after 9/11 they made the same argument well if you have nothing to hide right but the problem is as soon as something comes up like they go who's Colin Moriarty's been talking a lot of shit let's find out ways into Wow look at that a bunch of dick pic right right time to put those all under one that AE bro nothing wrong with dick dick uh but uh ya know III think I I kinda I think we're in the league with that I think Snowden's like a hero I feel like what he did took a lot of courage and and and it blow up his life I would like to if I go to Russia and I might go to Russia for the UFC I'd like to meet that dude I like to interview him he probably would talk to you Jamie you want go to Russia big pause we'll talk when I was younger and I was trying to think alike I don't hope thanks a lot him I don't wanna put you on the spot but if it was possible to meet that guy I would love to meet that guy I know if they just let you meet him no I bet it would be like really hard I know John Oliver met him Shane Smith did too yeah yeah that's right maybe I go with chain got Shane hook it up you thought I'd love to talk to you I mean he seems like initially he's probably caught on a condor costume surveillance you're assuming but I'm sure I would be I would be fucked when I came back they probably check everything oh my god I would like to sit down with that guy for a few hours like do like a six hour interview with him just pick them apart and ask like what is your life like now man like how many brushing chicks you banging yeah you're here over here every day you what do you how do you eat what do you would do to feed yourself like where's he getting these money he must get a stipend of some sort you have to assume right I mean yeah you I mean he's a guest of there so you have to assume that he's taken care of in some way right but I mean he probably has to keep his value high like at a certain point in time like they would they could say hey you're not valuable to us anymore time to live in Guatemala bitch well you keep I mean he's a very smart man so he must know at the highest level that he's a geopolitical pawn that like you said could be played in any way at any point you know if I was him I would just be listening to rosetta stone with Russia all day long I'll be like I need to find out how to speak Russian and I need to fucking go hide in Siberia so I'm here to grow my beard out yeah he's he's an interesting cat like I I'm somewhat fascinated i him I don't think we I think he'll come back at some point Neil deGrasse Tyson out a fascinating interview with him on Startalk radio where I was in Neil deGrasse Tyson essentially was saying the same thing that he thinks he's a patriot you know Anil doesn't really take too many stances like that are really political in that regard but I think as far as like data collection a random of just a blanket data collection of all the people in the United States I think it's it's fucked and it's absolutely not what we think of when we think of the freedom that the United States supposedly provides its citizens it seems like we're all under suspicion then we're all being under surveillance that's some really creepy Orwell type shit you know that's just it's not what we want it's extremely Orwellian and I it goes I feel like with Snowden sometimes people miss the forest for the trees with it they're very focused on the man at the act but they're not focused on you know one of the things that I were really interested like what is the complicity what is the level of complicity with the telecoms like what is the complicity with the government like forcing these people and and and there's a whole ISM and how many thousands of people are in on this and that's the whole that's the crazy thing is that Snowden who was a contractor not even really in the inner sanctum of the NSA where I knew all this stuff there are people running around out the people just acting like this never happened or wasn't going on it's a pretty it's not a conspiracy because we know it's true but it's a pretty big thing where I'm like focusing on Snowden is missing the entire point there's like why are although I didn't know one like no Sprint or t-mobile or anyone was like hey we imagine that kind of coup would have been for one of those companies to be like we're not doing this and in fact like we're going to tell everyone they're like what will this will make us look amazing well you know from a very shrewd corporate stance to be like will this be we don't like SolarCity honest that would never happen and if it did happen they would come down on that company so hard there has to be some weird sort of arrangements that these got gigantic telecommunication companies like Verizon or something has with the federal government we just have to be I think it's just protecting the bottom I'm sure that there's some something I can do but they don't care about anything but money well I have a friend who used to be a big executive at Google and she described to me some of the conversations that they had when they were dealing with the government and search engines and being able to access people's search engine results and then also with China like how when Google went over to China like there was very specific things they had to agree to with the government in order to make sure that they were there right they had a restrict the searches they had to they had to censor things I mean the government of China does not feel the same way about freedom as the government the United States and the government of the United States gets real sketchy with it as soon as you're doing what Edward Snowden has proven that they're doing you're getting really sketchy with freedom I mean you can land on the free home of the brave except I want to look at your dick pics except I want to read your emails right snapped I want to listen your voicemails except I want to be able to track your calls I accept I want to be able to know where your phone is at all times I mean that metadata from where the location of your phone is is one of the primary ways they target terrorists I mean people who are not aware of why so many civilians died in these terrorist attacks the part of the reason especially in the early days of drone attacks when they were trying to a target terrorists rather would was that they would use the metadata they would find out where the phones are so if your phone was in this apartment building they're going to bomb that apartment building it's like whoa yes it's very deep it's very technical and and I have no problem with them going to a shadow court and began getting like a permission to be like we're tracking this guy's for right now right which we're reading this guy or this organization's emails or people that are kind of within seven degrees of separation or whatever from this person they're at least have some sort of orderly nature to it right like Brian you don't need to be reading my emails or my you know I'm just getting over receipts enter my email where it's like what what why are you even storing all this into like what is what uses other than that obviously they want trends they want data that they can big high up data you know eagle-eye data and saying like this is the trend and all these kind of things but it's all ill-begotten because it's laying around it's not it's not right and that was a disappointment and that you probably feel the same way Joe is like after Snowden and NSA was a big store but then everyone kind of just wingin yeah and everyone kind of forgot well they're still kind of doing a lot of the same you know kind of thing we they didn't affect like we know about it now but we didn't we don't know this is a level of change that was affected really and you know we've known and and to me I feel like this is the thing where you have to keep the pedal down and you got to keep going be like this is not okay this is not right and and it's the same thing with them with the Patriot Act no today where everyone was really upset about that we have every right to be upset about that's really egregious stuff sure the NDAA I mean the NDAA what they've essentially done is they've eliminated the right of due process they can lock you up for as long as they want they can deny you any sort of a legal representation that's that's that's all been taken away from us now what what used to be one of the foundations of being an American the right to due process right to have a lawyer the right to a trial of your own peers or all that stuff is kind of gone now they just decide that you're a terrorist and they can decide you're a terrorist if you sell if you if you have weed on you if you're involved in illegal drugs you can be under the Patriot Act considered a terrorist it's really kind of crazy it is it's scary in the sense too because it goes back to what they were saying what this gentleman was saying that we were just talking about he was saying right there oh they have too much data they have too much to work with and some point some has to be like hey the guy was an ounce of weed or the guy well you know even with three or four ounces of weed why are we dumping him in wrong with all this stuff that she's going to muddy the waters more about the real target that we're really going after which is someone that's actually going to hurt someone or someone that's actually gonna call as a terrorist incident to me I would if I were them I'd be like we need less we have way more targeted data we need to leave 325 million people alone probably at least and here's another big part of the problem was that when Obama was instituting these changes and when the NDAA got passed and when people are saying well hey we're never going to use it this is one of the things they said we're never going to hold people without legal representation indefinitely we're never going to use the indefinite detainment okay but that's you what if a crazy person becomes president cut to president Trump right we now have a crazy person yep crazy person is now president and you're like well now what well what about these fucking crazy laws Obama that you passed me thought that it would be nothing but your standard politicians and hopefully Democrats from now to the end of time guess what now it's not now it's a guy who wants to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency now it's a guy want to drill pipelines through the you know Dakota access is a guy that wants to do a lot of stuff that people find to be troubling and this guy has the same rights to use the NDAA as you did and he's the new guy and he's kind of crazy yeah and that this is the level of restraint that needs to be shown by someone in that position because and he hasn't done anything yet you know I'd say he has used it but he's only been in office a couple months yeah give him time but to me it's like it goes back to the argument of executive orders it goes back to the argument of all these things where or the filibuster in the Senate where what's good for the goose is good for the gander you can't set up these these rules that are just going to backfire on you and then complain about them later to me I think it's a huge mistake that's why I have a lot of respect for presidents we haven't had one in a long time that are more restrained the president set that defer executive power and actually say like maybe the Legislature should be dealing with these kinds of things we need a man like that or a woman that has never done that oh I mean back in the mean it's been a long time too Gilded Age you have Coolidge and hardline and those guys but ever since FDR are really the imperial presidency grew in power and all these kinds of things and before you knew it you had a little Canaries in the coal mine with like I was actually talking to Dave about it last night with Eisenhower with the military-industrial complex and all these guy was amazing wasn't it yeah like an amazing like I really I don't think people realize how insane that is that that man said that will explain what he said and when he said it so Eisenhower was president from 52 to 60 similarly 53 61 and he was obviously one of the the instrumental generals in the Allied assault on Japan and on Nazi Germany and he saw the influence of the military growing and that in the Cold War in the nation there was a cold war that we were making bombs to make bombs that we were trying to have conflicts like with Korea which he tried that what she did end in the early 50s and so seeing that seeing me seed sown that of a perpetual war a perpetual war that the economy was actually benefiting from Jamie pull up that speech because it's an amazing speech it would be nice for people to hear it a lot of people are not aware of the tone and the way said it and it was when he was leaving office sorry if I'm not doing a good job of knowing okay no no you did great job okay and so and so he's a man of a military background everyone loved Eisenhower right Ike because of what he did in the war and the he two-term President Nixon with his vice present very popular but at the end he was like you gotta watch what's going on over here I'm telling you yes you can trust me I'm from that world and watch what's happening to clay play jammie it's a cool speech ladies and gentlemen the President of the United States good evening my fellow Americans we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that is witness for major Wars among great nations until the latest of our world conflicts the United States had no armaments industry American makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions how to do this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense of steps now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every state house every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society and the council's of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of Defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security in Liberty may prosper together Jesus it's an amazing at the time that was an amazing speech it's just prescient yeah like it's people understand and you know like before World War two you know we weren't a built up and militarized society we would militarize when we needed to and it was really Teddy Roosevelt all those kinds of guys that started kind of like getting a little more you know bullish in that kind of regard with the spanish-american war and the USS Maine and and then you know but the fight over World War one was real you know we didn't want to get involved we got involved very late and people take for granted now that we have just massive military we have this massive power but in the 19th century that not that they're you know you can't equate them necessarily to the 21st century we didn't we weren't going around running roughshod over people and like doing those kinds of if you were very isolationist that was kind of the American tradition and and so here that come out of eyes in Howard's mouth especially knowing his experiences in the war and his extended and deep knowledge of the military and what was going on in the world it's one of the great warnings of all time in the military and it's very wise in this part because you recognize that there's survival systems that are a part of any industry you know I mean it's a there's survival mechanisms and the industry wants to stay alive if all of a sudden there's peace on earth this gigantic industry there's multiple billion dollar-a-year industry I mean I don't know how much trillions a year right what is the what's the military budget per year six hundred billion dollars a year six hundred billion dollars of new spending so you know you have trillions of dollars with equipment Jesus Christ so that massive amount of money there's so many people that are involved in that and so many jobs that have to be preserved and so much of the industry relies on keeping conflict active/active and I think that's what he was trying to warn us about but it's so interesting about an evolved citizenry and that people need to be aware of it to hear that from the president you're never going to hear anything remotely as even close to his candid as that is today no absolutely not I think that even hearing that from a you know just to reiterate like hearing that from our Barack Obama for instance would be strong right but hearing that from a ulysses s grant or a Zachary Taylor or guy that's served right especially the level he served is like that that meant something to people and it and and I think that that's why that saying never went away but but under our noses it happened and what he said was going to happen is exactly what happened in Southeast Asia um in Vietnam Cambodia Laos he pretty called it from a fucking mile away well wasn't even a mile away because he was living there I mean he was in the heat of it in 1960 when he made that speech he think about the Gulf of Tonkin incident I mean that's just a few years late just a few years later they had a false flag that allowed people to get enthusiastic about entering into the Vietnam War and that's where it all came from right and it's the same you know some people say the USS Maine in spanish-american war in 1898 was another false flag or something that was they let happen or something that was blown out of proportion no pardon the pun because it was about the ship blowing up but yeah it's one of those it is a provocation that gets everyone involved and they had we had this nemesis it was good versus evil we were upset we saw I think especially against the Nazis we saw what the the stature of the good versus evil argument and we won so with the Allies so we I think we tried to perpetuate that immediately the Soviets became the evil right and then we created our bombs and then they created their bombs and then we just had this these proxy wars that we were fighting against the Chinese in Korea and then the Soviets in Vietnam really like all these things that were kind of you know everyone knew what was going on but no one I'm sorry please don't I was just going to say so I think that when the Soviet when everything started get peaceful what do they call it glass smashed in Soviet in Soviet yeah I do like a new era of like peace and prosperity with the West whatever in like the late seventies early 80s I think that the the the Boeing's of the world and the in the Halliburton's of the world were like oh shit you know and and become 90s pretty people we immediately found new targets and we should be wary of why that happened you know I'm not saying that we shouldn't necessarily fight we have to fight sometimes but to have this industrialized nature of it to have this need to lurch from one war to the next war to the next war the next war is not what a republic does it's what a dying Empire does well it's definitely what an empire that's dependent upon the control or rather an industry rather that's depended upon the control that it has currently maintaining it you need to maintain that that money you need to maintain those the business the business of making these machines and of having these contracts I mean it's a huge industry and like all of these unlimited growth industries it's very like every business essentially operates under this paradigm of unlimited growth or most businesses do most corporations do with account every year they want to make more money and if that's applicable to a company that makes tanks well every year they want to make more money they want to make more tanks we don't need tanks anymore well oh the fuck you don't you definitely need to oh look what's going on over here in Yemen no shit you need some tanks right exactly and that means Team America World Police it's really crazy that's scary and it's a scary waste of money - I like excited I don't think that we I really do feel like we should have the most powerful military in the world I don't think that there's anything wrong with that I think I'm right I think a powerful Republic can have those kinds of things but we don't need all these bases at our legacy bases why are we still in Japan why are we still in you know like say toxic shit or Godzilla shows up Trump's proposed hike to military spending is bigger than all but two country's entire budgets well that's cause we're America and we're better than everybody else yeah I want to say if that communist shit off my screen I want to say I mean this is incredible - I want to say I think this is right that if you split the military spending of the world in surge we we are responsible for a third of it ten countries are responsible for another third of it and then everyone else is responsible for another third of it we have four and a half percent of the world population so this is way out of whack when with with even our needs like our actual very need to protect ourselves I think it's just way out of whack right but when you get past those ten countries that their other third and then us that's 11 countries everybody else is using coconuts and catapults yes essentially our own rocks at each other so but there's relative tranquility like outside of the Middle East and in Eastern Europe with the with Ukraine and Rus there's general peace to be had in these countries that might not spend a lot of money or might not even have a lot of money to spend I'm not saying I want to live like they do or that I want I want to spend say I want a little outdated when Sri Lanka Bangladesh or something like that but I'm saying like I'm saying my own races well that's been established by the International Business Times jumpin but to me I just look at it I'm like we can spend this money wiser and we can have it we can we can ramp up and have plans to people forget and you know GM Ford all these guys were making our armaments you know Mitsubishi made the Japanese zeros IBM offshoots of IBM we're making frigging punch card machines for the Nazis you know like people people you know for better or for worse ramp up and do what they need to do in times of war to make money and so we could have a plan in place to say like hey if we need to ramp up but something bad happens if we need to go overseas or something if we have to go engage the Russians because they're rolling into the rest of Ukraine for instance we have the pot the we can we can take care of that without having bases all over the world well the problem with that kind of thinking is as soon as you say that then they realize well there's a lot of money to be had if that is the case so let's make that the case and then there's some weird fucking covert sneaky shit going down and you have an hearing on both ears yeah here yeah they are they their headphones irritating him I don't know I just like to hear whenever I did I do this none other the earrings have been in since I was like 18 I did not like I'm superstitious so I you're superstitious yes I don't like to you know not like over over at least over stitches but I'm afraid to take them out I'm afraid to do that but he never we the people tattoo in your arm yeah we the people and then I have Franklin's association snake I'm sure so you're like joiner died Wow so you're like a serious almost like a fan of politics yeah yeah we want to describe it sure I mean when I went to college I went to school for American history and I graduated and when I got my job offer in the video game industry I was about to start my graduate degree at Northeastern and American history cuz I wanted to be a professor at the time so my real passion was American history and American politics but I veered off into a different direction how do I know please go house you say so these are like relics so I got to use when I was like 20 you know how that's interesting and that's those are unusual tattoos for 20-year old yeah I just you know I love I'm really interested in the founding generation I'm really interested in their experiences and the American Revolution I think it's a fascinating revolution compared to a lot of other revolutions primarily because it is I think it inherently in some ways conservative revolution which is not common these were incredibly rich people fighting these weren't like poor destitute people John Hancock had something like one three three hundred and fiftieth of all of the value of the colonies under his under his name these people had everything their risk and everything to lose so it's like an interesting I think very principle revolution that they fought although if you read like Howard Zinn or something they would say that they did it to protect their money I'm sure they did but I'm sure they had all other motives as well of course and it's a it's sort of an unprecedented saying in human history I mean it's a really crazy Union that we've established over here and to see all these things that threaten what we find so amazing about it like the violations of the Fourth Amendment all the NSA stuff with Edward Snowden all these different things that we see that are huge problems what they are is also they're they're weakening the foundation of these ideas that were so amazing when they were first established in 1776 yeah and and to me that's why I think that they're worth protecting it goes it goes into the like is the Constitution living or not is it your strict constructionist or a loose construction has all those kinds of questions I think are valid but to me I'm like we can't we have this very unique vision into what the founders intended because they were one of the few I think people at that time that were like we're gonna you know the Federalist Papers are incredible if you read them like we don't have to wonder what they meant right they literally tell you exactly what they meant so when you go to Supreme Court cases I don't know that there are many Supreme Court cases that don't even reference the Federalist Papers because it's like well they said this at article 3 section 2 but actually in this paper that they wrote anonymously that we know Alexander Hamilton wrote here's what he said about it you know and now I think that's interesting stuff now how did this knowledge of politics and how did this fascination that you have with the history of the United States how did this get you in you know quote unquote trouble in the videogame industry with these people that are predominantly left-wing and predominantly progressive look quote I say progressive but progressive is kind of a dirty word now that is coming there's a difference between liberal and progressive well it would be great if everybody was liberal it would be great if everybody was progressive it would be great if everybody wanted people to have you know freedom of choice and and freedom to be whoever you want but that's not really what those things are anymore those things are like ideologies they're these predetermined patterns of behavior that people subscribe to in a very very rigid way how what did you find was an issue when people found out about your extreme understanding and respect for the history of the United States well they think it's they primarily they think it was like kind of a joke because not not a haha joke well like your your clown kind of because why because I believe in a small government for instance I believe in low taxation I believe in the elimination of the income tax and things like this these are these are rad but I don't actually have like not all my ideas are radical or even outside of the mainstream socially I'm probably further to the left than many of these people you know I think that it's it goes back to this idea and this is something Dave Rubin has touched on a lot in this show which I'm sure you're familiar with which is this idea that it's really all or nothing like they don't want to be an ally with someone that might be able to help them in X Y & Z if they disagree with people in a B and C so they could have had a great ally me and being like I've been pro gay marriage forever I've been pro-choice you know I'm for the decriminalization of drugs I'm for the legalization of prostitution I'm for a lot of these things that are very far to the left socially that we probably could find some agreement on somewhere and we can work on those things and get those things done together but because I say also like hey the income tax is predatory and really hurt people I own a bit I owned a business and I get to own another one now and I know like that I could have hired another person of taxes weren't so onerous on me and so I also stand on there and they're like this never happened this stuff that you just said never happened this left this let the left-wing stuff that we agree and never happened because you don't believe in because you have this one thing that we have a problem with now we're going to put it but but you're not being clear about that like what what is the issue when it comes to small government like you wanting small government what's the opposition to that what are they saying well they say like they make a lot of its insinuation because a lot of it isn't even things that I feel or believe so an example would be you know I see a lot of people say all the time like a column doesn't even welfare or Colin doesn't believe in unsocial security and like I never said that actually I just I believe that these things should be reformed and and maybe taken back a step but they even look at that as a push too far on the honda system I guess what I'm trying to say to you and I'm sorry I'm not being more lucid with you I'm trying my hardest is is that there's a you have to agree with in lockstep right if they see you in one way that isn't it that is is injurious to their cause or it said that is conflicting or contrary to what they believe they do not give a fuck about anything else you believe and that's the thing that always frustrate me what's so surprising when people really running me out on a rail out of the gaming industry with a completely innocuous joke which I think tells you everything you need to know about the the intent that they don't see they don't want allies in different ways and allies in different clothes allies right they want just they just want complete you know it's very well iam they just want you to be completely like them and if you're not like then they don't want anything to do with you and it's not even like I was advocating for anything crazy I don't advocate for anything crazy I don't think that doesn't sound crazy at all but what's interesting is it's we've kind of turned a corner we're in many ways the right is more tolerant than the left to variations in their ideology whereas the right is much more tolerant to people that support gay marriage the right is much more tolerant to people that I mean this is you fill in the blanks there's a bunch of different rights that the right would sort of accept from someone who also voted Republican the left isn't like if you got to the point where like I got in a heated argument with someone wants about abortion which I'm pro-choice but what I was saying well essentially but obviously it was a criticism of a Richard Dawkins boat or he's comparing a human embryo to a pig fetus or a pig embryo what I forget to what the terms use but I'm like well that's ridiculous because one of them is going to become a person if you don't take it out of your body right and that was the idea behind it like you can't you can't use that sort of an analogy because it's not true I mean just one has the potential for being a person I was being accused by this guy of being right-wing because of it and I was like well I'm not right-wing I'm just talking about the potential for life like a pig embryo is never going to be my neighbor Mike you know it's just not you know I mean of course but that baby I'm not saying you should be forced to make that baby a person and keeping your body when it's a few cells and then two weeks old and then say yeah I'm not saying that you can't choose when to terminate your pregnancy what I'm saying is you're terminating a pregnancy we both know what you're doing I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it but to pretend that it's not messy and nobody wants it to be messy nobody wants it to be a complicated issue they wanted to be cut and dry if you're on the left in particular it's pro-choice woman's reproductive choice the freedom of your body to do what want I get all that I'm 100% with you but let's let's not lie about what it is because as soon as we learn as soon as we distort the reality of what the thing is then we put up these ideological boundaries and blinders and we make communication very difficult and we make these rigid ideologies almost like a religion they're almost like dogma and when you really put it I mean when you do that you have real problems because people can't communicate so if someone does bring that up and say well you know what is abortion and then it's silence across the dinner table you hear people dropping their Forks and like what is abortion what are you doing you're at what age is it okay to have an abortion at what age is it not okay is it okay to abort a baby a day before it's born no no okay about a month before no how about two months before no how about three how about four how about five how about six how about seven where do we you know I'm saying yes yes where do we get to the point where it's not a baby and I think that's a viable conversation and it's a real kind it's a very uncomfortable discussion as soon as you'd like me saying it right now there's people listening to this right now that are in their car maybe there's a woman listening to this it's had an abortion like I don't wanna hear this and she was to shut it off maybe there's a guy who's trying to pressure his wife or girlfriend to have an abortion and he doesn't want to hear it but what is it what is abortion what is it right it's and this is what I always call this issue to me particularly Joe is a 60-40 issue what I would say is like I am pro-choice but I respect the pro-life argument and I don't think you should have unfettered access to abortions forever you know like what like you know yeah two months you know something like that 14 we I don't know I don't know the number of valence a number is 114 weeks too much right away but to me I'm like yeah what's habit you have you make a great point because it's it's it's it is this dogmatic sense of saying like it here's the way it is that's it it goes back to the you know I heard you talking about I was so I was so glad to hear you say it because it goes back to like the war on women right like there's just a whole group of people apparently no in the country hundred fifty million of them I hate women that that because they're pro pro-life for instance which is a stance I don't share but I respect why does that mean that they hate women why does it mean that like why does it always go from zero to ten you know for like immediately it's like and then and then there's all these lies mixed in like the the pay gap which is a fucking lie okay yeah okay yeah we lie it's not just a lie it's a lot it's perpetrated by Obama on TV talking about it I mean it's such a confusing lie it's just bizarre it is demonstrable false yeah and it is a lie so why do I heat here keep it why does every want to be so divisive why do you want to add more fuel to the fire when you can be like hey it what maybe we have problem XY and Z but this isn't a problem actually I saw it again recently it was recently in the news somebody brought it up and they unchecked and unchallenged this is explain to people if they were because I've done it too many Tiger explain to people what the real pay gap is and what what the issue is when why it's used incorrectly so the pay gap claimed by studies I guess the department labor something is 21 cents or something like that so I was saying I think something like 79 every dollar a man makes a woman makes something I sense that's true only if you take every man every woman take all the money they make and divide it by the amount of men in the amount of woman doesn't take into account careers doesn't take a look at personal choices women for instance leave the workforce to have families sometimes men are gravitating towards engineering or physics or things that pay them a lot of money while women tend to you know 10 maybe towards psychology or something like that I think the argument is something like 9 out of the 10 top grossing career choices are men dominated and 9 out of the 10 lowest chorea of money making career choices are actually dominated by women I think the only exception there is clergy which is dominated by men and so but it doesn't it doesn't adjust for any of these things so when you actually adjust for choices when you adjust for careers and the longevity and hours and all of these things that are relevant the pay gap closes to something like less than 5 cents and then there's even arguments saying that those could probably be explained away completely as well depending on the way I know Christina summers and some of these some of these people had know way more about this and I do have videos about if you actually dive in you probably can get rid of the entire number completely but the the it's preposterous to say that the women makes 79 cents for every dollar it's repeated ad nauseam the real issue is its implying that two people working alongside each other at the Apple store the man is making $5 an hour the woman is making 79 cents an hour less yeah 79 cents per dollar less right nitric significant and I like the argument because it's true you know why not why that was true why when the corporation just hired women slightly nine cents I should say it right seventy-nine cents to every dollar demand makes right I just yeah corporations would hire women if they were just as competent just as skilled and it's not that it's also men are more likely to die on the job and then more likely to pick way more dangerous careers like Forrest fighting forest firefighting whether it's a coal mining all those things are dominated by men and a lot of people died and I'm law enforcement of course there's a there's a bunch of issues with it but the problem is it's it's spewed out as an indication that we are an inherently sexist society and whether or not you can find sexism in our society I'm sure you can this is absolutely exist just as racism exists I don't think it is nearly as much of a problem as they're trying to pin it out to be and I think there's a lot of other factors involved and why men make more money and one of them may be the demand for a higher salary when they're being hired better skills at negotiation or more confidence in those sort of confrontations with employers or negotiations with employers I mean there's a lot of factors but it doesn't do anybody any good to repeat a fall statistic when it's provably false and then when people find out that it's false and they lose confidence and the information they're being given it's also I think it's that's one half of the other half of it is like what does it say about a person that just continues to say it anyway right like at some point truth doesn't matter anymore right like I want to have a I want to have factual debates I want to have like oh this is the starting point these are objective truths and then let's debate about those things right if that's your starting point if that's like a third of the entire reason why you're angry and in the streets in Washington DC well then I don't even know when you're angry about anymore to be honest it's the same it goes back to like Occupy Wall Street or all these things from like I don't know exactly what you're angry about and this is why this protest isn't working and isn't resonating with people I saw people in the March for women though the women's March thing with signs talking about the gender pay gap and so they had the time to make a sign they had a time to take that sign and nail it to some boards and carry it around what they didn't have time to Google whether or not that was true exact States fascinate its also fed and and I feel like some of them have to know right no Mike they don't on and no man it's like I've read this thing once that said that sperm cures depression in women and I didn't even look any further Oh Mike I got all the information in either I don't want to just debug ha ha ha ha I want to be rock-solid in my approach shut the laptop and walked out of the room I mean that's really what's going on it's like that sounds great if women make 79 cents every dollar man makes it sounds awesome this is a bullshit society just the patriarchy hatred patriarchy of evil patriarchy meanwhile you ask them you know you ask one of these feminists there's no reason with feminism if the goal is for in total equality but we all know that that's now we're really what some it does it means today that you know if you sit there and be like can you name just one thing that I can do that you can't just one like like one like I'm not saying like you give birth I can or something like something biological I'm saying like what can't you do like like if you really wanted to I'm not saying that you know like it's why I know for instance that you know the examples that people give and I haven't seen the specifics but I've heard it circulated that even that you know companies are so desperate now to hire women because of this this situation this optical situation that they're in where it seems like women are being pushed down that women in their twenties and thirties are actually making more now you know that there and certainly they're more likely to get a higher education certainly they're more likely be you know even graduate high school hmm so there are actually systemic benefits to being a woman and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that either but I just feel like what it golf goes back to that thing of like why are we fighting like what is the divisive nature can't we and this goes back to your question about the video game industry I'm like okay instead of you yelling at me about this we won't agree about this these situations over here but can't we advocate for these together or do you not want to be you want to you want to you know want my advocacy for gay marriage because I believe in small government you all my advocacy for you know transgender rights because I'm for low taxes I'm like okay that's weird because we can totally be friends here with the women's March I know that there were problems with pro-life organizations getting involved by the sponsorship level even Wow and it's like they're not women right there there lessor there's a debate about that one issue yeah palm range you said something that I want to go back to later what do you think feminism is about well it's argument about about equality right I mean to me a feminism was about equality and I think that this this you know I'm reading more about in the learning more about it so I'm still very ignorant about it but this more third wave what they call third wave feminism which I'm sure the term you've heard that seems to be more about a combative nature to actually you know instead of like saying like men and women or equal men and women should deserve the same rights in the same treatment and all those kinds of things it actually seems to be very anti man in a way like it seems to be very like and almost like the tables have turned you know like well why are you turning the tables like didn't you achieve what you wanted like in the first place which was just that we were going to be here together at the you know at the Nexus of everything I think under start of the problem is that reinforcing that fake statistic the the gender page pay gap that so many people have heard that like it was Sarah Silverman was just talking about it recently and some some big thing that she did I'm like that's not true but yet people just say it and no one stops them from saying a friend of mine there's a very educated guy said it we were having a debate about um divorce and he brought it up and I'm like that's not even true and unfortunately we were in a place with no cell phone reception so I had to wait until we got back to send it to him like this is not true like what you're saying is not true like you're repeating it is if you know but meanwhile you've done zero research on it it's a talking point that just gets reiterated over and over again without any research and it's convenient convenient to reinforce your argument it's a number it's a number that deals with a very complex and nuanced debate and I think that the idea of feminism is to me in a lot of ways very similar to the idea the men's rights movement I'm not opposed to rights for anybody I'm not opposed to anyway I'm very egalitarian and my ideas about the world but I am opposed to anybody that likes one gender over the other because I think that's foolish just like I'm opposed to people that only like white people I'm opposed to people that only like black people I'm opposed to people that generalize based on an enormous mass of human beings like men are shit women Rule girls rule boys drool you know I don't like it the other way either I don't like you the he-man woman haters Club I don't like I don't like any ideologies that lump people into these huge groups because I think it's moron think I think it's this stupid way of looking at the world yeah I agree and I'm the same way that the yealt Aryan nature is the best the live-and-let-live nature to judge people based on the character and the quality of their intelligence or whatever it is you're looking for in them shouldn't be categorized in these specific ways by sex or gender by race or religion by any of those guys I think I'm totally with you there I think we both agree that women shouldn't be allowed to vote right I mean yeah I know women have suffered long enough enough already at girls I used to think that joke was so funny I mean you can't murder that joke today was like like it said you know suffered you know suffragettes like women have suffrage long enough instead of suffering whatever I was like it's a funny joke I'd probably you know that would ruin my career too on Twitter but it didn't ruin your career it just it gave you platform honestly it's all it all balances out as long as you're being attacked for something that's not valid it all balances out it just takes you take a little heat and then you realize like okay I'm through that yeah it was scary for a little while at least Gary don't like you know I don't know if scary is the right word it was it was uncomfortable uncomfortable unsettling and you really saw where everyone stood right so one of the things I was talking with people about was you know how sad it was for me that no like very few people that I knew came to my defense and I wasn't saying they had to come to my defense and be like a Collin you know that joke was fine like if you didn't like the joke guts I don't care it's fine jokes fall flat all the time you know that your comedian yeah it's hard I don't do it professionally you know it's impossible hard to get on the stage and do that kind of stuff but to me I was like hey is anyone going to say that I'm not a sexist is anyone going to stand up that's known me for 10 years and say like hey we don't agree with the joke but what the way you're categorizing this guy who I know is not accurate and I heard that there were some fights behind the scenes with people and I got a lot of dm's and messages but very little in terms of public support that really hurt me yeah like that really really hurt me like and wounded me in a deep way and ruined friendships like that I had for years like their prime fake friendships men and you know and people probably felt the the need to toe the line you know toe this I don't say party line but the ideological ideological line mean the dogmatic line if you if you run into someone who is in any way involved in a sort of a dispute that makes that person appear to be a sexist you're supposed to pile on yeah and and and and that's exactly what they did and their thing that hurt me the most is that I didn't excite I'm not close with a lot of these people but people that know me you know there are people in this industry that are writing that were piling on me or remaining silent that got freelance work because of me that got maybe even got hired because I was on a hiring committee that put you know push for them all these kinds of things and I people used to take out to lunch when I was senior editors yeah they were doing if there's anything I can do for them some like that and everyone's just like no not going to say I'm not going to come back and help him out now and I tried to put that good energy out there I'm not always full of good energy sometimes I say negative things are bad things sometimes I make mistakes but when it come when a person comes after your character and you damn well know that there are a bunch of people around you that know who you are whether or not they agree with what you said or agree with what you do but they know you're who you are and they know the severity of what people are saying and they don't say anything that really wounds a person and that really fucking hurt do you think that what's going on in a lot of ways when people did not come to your defense is that what you're doing um in many ways is making a very complicated and nuanced perspective from a person in your in your stance you're you're kind of you're taking this this this path outside of the ideology and by doing so you sort of challenge a lot of the ways these people have been behaving for a long time and as soon as you do that they have to kind of reconsider these ideological boundaries they've set up in their own behavior and thinking and communication and that they don't want to do that and they don't want to do that I like to keep things rigid and simple and they also want to continue to progress in their career and in order to do that you have to kind of like have this predetermined pattern that you follow I think simple is the key word that you use ensel because yes they can't there are people out there that cannot comprehend how a person who believes in small government for instance will use the same argument that says the government can't touch my guns that's consistently saying the government can't tell a woman what to do with her body right that's consistent with a principle it says government shouldn't even be involved in telling you who you can marry and the manikins meal to marry a man in the won't you be able to marry a woman and I would go as far as to say that even a polygamous totally on the up-and-up everyone's in on a relationship should not the government governs right okay cancer they cannot acknowledge that it's the lack of governmental power that gives you that right in my perspective when they feel like it's the wielding of government power that ensures those those rights that's not that's not congruent then they don't understand how that how we they don't understand how we came to the same exact conclusion by going just totally two different directions and that's really that challenges them and they don't have the philosophical boundary bounding to figure out how that might be no that's the argument that the philosophy has to be bound in writing has to be bound within some sort of a doctrine it has to be written down on paper and established and enforced by a government that's that's like a big Daddy thing you know I mean instead of saying give the power to the people let people do whatever they would like to do as long as they're not infringing upon the rights of others and let's have less and less people dictating what people get to do right and that's that to me is Liberty yeah right yeah and they and they look at it oh I don't say they but a lot of people love progressives or dresses and I only want to look at them we'll look at and be like well the government has to ensure these things because these are not natural these are not natural right so these are not you know things that can be insured and I'm like but in the natural society in a natural sense we we have to have consistent rights i I can't in good face say like I have the right to wield a gun because the government can tell me that even though it's enshrined in the Bill of Rights but then say like oh the government kind of get involved in your bedroom though all the government can tap your phones all of the government I'm like no it's either all or nothing and if you and if that's not that's a philosophy that's too hard for people to wrap their minds around and I don't know what to say about that but to me it's to me it's pretty clear and pretty lucid the way I feel my principles are rooted in that philosophy also I think when people are seeking this sort of comfort level in in life and in their positions and I don't necessarily think people understand that as soon as you allow the government too much power you will never get that back as soon as they have power as soon as they can take away some of your liberties those will never get returned look one of the rare ones is marijuana it is a really what I was trying to explain this on the other day about this like it's incredibly rare that something becomes legal that was illegal as long as marijuana it's very rare like something has to be in just completely undeniably good for it to have gone through all the propaganda all the bullshit all the lies all the governmental regulations other people being locked up in jail for life or and then still come out on the other side on 2017 and be legal in a bunch of states recreationally yes not even also medically that's great to see but it's fascinating because it's one of the rare instances where Liberty lost is regained and most the time it's not no not it's an aberration and that's what people have to be really scared of and that's that goes to the plan it's like I don't want to give anything an inch because I am afraid of the consequences of giving anyone an inch that's why I wouldn't apologize for the joke that's why I resigned from my company instead of apologizing for the joke how could you apologize for that oh because it's too first of all the honeymooners marry with children all in the family level joke something you did have a four of a CBS writers room and and but but the point is that I could have probably apologizing for Ronald Emma but I'm like no up because a I'm not sorry so that would be a huge lie be like I have to now really recalibrate the way I go about my business with you know with my partners and with the audience because you know I didn't have the protections that I thought I would have when when the mistake was made you know I mean like I didn't and that was what hurt me so I I tried to do what I thought was the most principled and character-driven choice which would be like this is best for my partners who don't agree with me this is best for the audience you might not agree with me it seems like a lot of them do and this is the best for just everyone moving forward I'll have other opportunities with other things that I can do has it been any blowback targeted towards the people that were upset at you yes and the thing is that you know it's sad to see because it's not mine I I feel like I'm a pretty good natured person and I don't like CP seeing the rubber band effect going on where people now are suffering because they stood up and so doubt or whatever it's just that and I don't care about the people that were out to character assassinate me I'm talking about like you know my physics partners and stuff it's just that like no matter what I say will be twisted I tried to be very magnanimous and like very kind about it when I was on Rubin the second time and people twisted everything to just be a problem anyway so I'm like I'll just remain silent because I'd rather than misconstrue the silence then construe the words you know it was a thought it's not a problem no if you if you're not communicating freely and because you're worried about the repercussions I'm not worried about the repercussions for me I'm worried about voicing repercussions on other people that have no control over what I'm saying anyway yeah but even if even that it's like it's not your responsibility as long as you're communicating in an honest way sure the you it's I mean years thinking that's that's sort of the same reason why people didn't come to your support in the first plane because they were worried that if they spoke their mind they would be targeted if they said hey you know I know that this is going on I think Colin's a great guy I don't think he's sexist and my feeling on him is that it was just a joke and then they could get targeted and they chose not to the children ought to step up in a lot of ways you not speaking your mind in a clear way sort of sets that same sort of tone I think you should be able to speak freely I think you should be held responsible for when you say something and it's irresponsible like it's all wrong or it's hurtful or some ways and people make mistakes like that all the time and it's also we have to take into account that a lot of times people don't realize the consequences of their words or they say things in a flippant manner or they're tired or they're stressed or things come out that they don't necessarily believe in that way but especially when it comes to like something like Twitter or some short form short paragraph sort of a thing I think it's really important that we be given the opportunity to express ourselves fully and then to disagreements with that be categorized in an honest way and what I had the most problem with was not just someone calling you racist but that everyone was making it out to be this horrible sexist evil thing when it's clearly something said in jest and as soon as you can in that's my wheelhouse as soon as you start taking humor and something that people say that's absolutely meant to be just funny and make it as like oh this guy just signed an affidavit that women should shut the fuck up because it's better I mean that's really the worst case scenario interpretation of what he said yeah and and yeah I think that that was at this point part of it was again it goes back to this point of like it ignored everything like my body of worked two things I actually stood up very loudly for political and social causes many times there are huge videos I have of I think my feelings on the Confederate flag or like how I feel like when I think about the Confederate flag I think that you have the right to fly I just think it's in terrible taste and I understand why people are upset about it and I don't think it should be in I don't think the flag of a traitorous country should be in instituted in state flags in the United States that I think is absolutely valid do you think that it's legal is it legal to have a Nazi flag is it legal I have a swastika yeah I ought to see why wouldn't it me it's legal to have the Confederate flag yeah but you just can't have it on the Dukes of Hazzard well like it to me it's like I'm not talk about the legality of it cuz if you want to fly a swastika out your house you're allowed I think you probably allowed to do that I don't think kind of gear and absolutely for doing that but that's your right to be an idiot right the Confederate flag thing was just a sign for me because it was it was this it was this this this juxtaposition of saying look well we're talking about the legal rights but actually I'm talk about the taste right you know like to say like people don't remember what the CSA was I don't think a lot of people even fly that flag know what the hell they're flying where this country seceded from the United States they were traitors and or they're Lynyrd Skynyrd fans or they're a huge Leonard Skynyrd fans they're huge a big in Mississippi like you know but to me I'm like we have to have let's let's put this in historicity let's think about what we're doing here this country left to protect its slaves its right to own slaves any other interpretation of it is wrong based on on what was going on in the 1850s and it was leading up to 1860 these states rights advocate oh that's that's not what it was about genomics yeah it's not what it was about it wasn't about states rights it wasn't about any of those things was about your ability your economy would have fallen apart without free labor and these people left they caused a gratuitously bloody war and then they were let me--let both Abraham Lincoln and then Andrew Johnson just let them back in you know Jefferson Davis who was the president of the Confederacy wasn't murdered he wasn't executed you know like they were all let back in and for some reason because reconstruction went the way it did into the into the ulysses s grant kind of era of presidency people look at and be like well things kind of ended good and they're kind of like brothers again and I'm like that's not really the way it was with Jim Crow came up and so like that this fucking flag means something nefarious and you can't so it's your right to fly it and if you feel like that's a southern prizing more power to I love the South I think it sounds awesome see the South needs another flag but yeah you need to you need to know what this flag means to people you guys left you guys killed hundreds of thousands of people doing it and and you just fly the flag like the south will rise again don't don't you think that whether that's a bad expression the south will rise again is a terrible expression but I think that a lot of people look at that flag and it represents what we're calling southern pride which is nothing wrong nothing wrong with being proud of being from Georgia or wherever the fuck your creative states down there yeah but I think the the issue is what it means to other people you know and whether or not that's valid when you're not talking about like touchy feely like people being oversensitive now you're talking about a horrible war about slavery it's like probably one of the worst kinds of wars like a war because we would like T people imprisoned and working for free so we're willing to kill other people over it to fight for that right it's essentially what it was so it's to the people of today it doesn't seem like that because they're not living in 1850 they're not in the days when you know they would have these massive like like Gettysburg or they'd have these massive areas where people would be slaughtered I mean there's people to this day that's still find like civil war shit or they have these massive battles and they can dig through the ground with metal detectors and they find bullets and guns and badges and awesome it's great it's great it I mean I took the idea from Saving Private Ryan the guy that would take dirt from all the battlefields if they would go to him put it and put it in jars I he didn't put it they always showed it once in the movie but I used to go to all these battlefields when I was a kid because I was fascinated by my parents bring me and I would take I would go buy baby food and dump them out and then go to all the battlefields and put dirt wow wow that's heavy yeah I like yes what is this when you were a kid yeah like my mi teens and early twenties and so you've always been into this yes since I was a you know at my earliest memory is of being in the politics mystery was was the Gulf War which was like kinda lead up to it with Kuwait it's up 90 91 so I was like six or seven I remember you know Newsday is Long Island's newspaper I remember just seeing images and kind of maps and and I didn't really understand what was going on I can't even read most of the words I mean it's complicated geopolitical stuff they're talking about but I ever since that point I was very politically focused on my dad is a staunch like Rockefeller Republican like a paleo con like a moderate Republican in the old north you know people out there might know but like Republicans are pretty disparate group like Republicans in New England or Republicans in New York are very different than Republicans in Texas but they're both Republicans and my dad grew up just in sit and you know giving me things to read and feeding that fire and buy me maps and buy me books and with the clock radio and we would debate things and we would kind of come to these conclusions of different things and we disagreed about a lot of things still of this day but he's a great man and ever since then I was really really interested in I knew when I was fourth or fifth grade that I would study history and I remember in New York we had this thing called the Regents in high school which are like these testy state-run test you have to pass to graduate so like you take your class but then you have to take your final but then you have to take a Regents exam which is the state-run thing say like you know math you know whatever and I remember when I was in sixth grade my sister Allie who's six years older than me was taking the US history Regents like the next few days man and I helped her study and I and like helped I remember to act like she didn't know any really anything she needed to know I taught her like what what she needed to know just for this very rudimentary test and that was a stuck in my mind we look like I have a real passion for this I really like it I enjoy it I don't know everything I make mistakes sometimes and I changed the way I feel sometimes but it's always been a real real fascinating problem and now that you've left your company the which was what was it called kind of fun kinda funny and what was kind of funny kind of funny was the four of us that sounded the company were all at IGN in different respects and we spun off to just start our own YouTube channel about games and their culture and stuff like that do podcasts and we found some some good successful most of crabs landed on patreon and it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it but I felt like I needed to leave because I felt like that was the best for everybody well once that I mean how could you not they turned on you over that stupid fucking joke yeah I mean it's like that is a stupid joke was all funny it's a bad joke but it's not even that bad no I Prasad means a lot coming from you I like it stupid the reaction to is so fucking stupid it was stupid and I felt like you know I wish that you know I wish that things went differently I wish that you know we had a lot of fights behind the scenes I won't get in all that I don't think I honestly I think it's good I think it's good to I don't I don't no I I felt like I did what was right for them and I felt like we would have just come to this impasse again so I was like let's just pull the band-aid off and get to get this over with are you going to do something that involves politics now because clearly you have a deep passion for this yeah I started a new YouTube channel that the first video got April 3rd is called columns last stand and crazy it's already funded on patreon 38 another $1,000 of mine for yes well if people are getting that expression I do yeah okay I think it's powerful like there are things worth dying for there are things worth risking the others so I I reached 39 thousand dollars a month down and it's going to fall 39,000 a month people it's going to fall I'm sure it's going to fall people doing shit dude people are talking people are really trying to memorize this holy shit that's a lot of fucking money 39 grand a month yeah you're going to get thirty-nine thousand a month and you haven't even started yet yeah technically but but this is it's going to fall back down to the teens probably know what that was - relax with your humility well take it down well if you if you scroll here you'll see on the left side underneath the number my only stretch goal was to reach $10,000 so my my expectations were blown out of the water right and I really would I read into this show is is you know people are just sick of this bullshit this is them this is them speaking and being like we need a conduit that's going to get into the history and get into the philosophy into politics but also that will stand up and say like I'm not sorry for a joke people have the right to make mistakes people have the right to express themselves it goes back to the Confederate flag thing I might disagree with a person that fly that flag but I'm not going to go rap on their door and pull it off and call them a racist I'm just going to shake my head and walk you know because there are other things to worry about so it's people that like want more Liberty focus individual focus kind of things and and that's just people speaking you to me you know so the number will fall back down after the month I'm sure that's fine just on the Internet but drive me crazy is fake humility it's not fake exactly nobody out actually I remember I remember - the fall no people going to like me less but but but but my whole van it's really not fake humility it's me saying like I hear you and I'll do my very best for this the numbers keep going up the problem is everyone's gonna know what the numbers are and they're going to go around only need to give many money just 39 thousand dollars a month that's fine I'm fine should hide that number can you hide your hand but I feel like I want to I want to be I want to be honest with people and my god if you're on patreon you freaking kill gotta get that cash son but yeah you can't hide it but I wanted to be totally transparent what I keep telling people is as long as we keep a level a sustainable level of money which is way less than what I have now there'll be no bacon ads no product placements none of that and I want people to know I want I want people to be involved in the in it from its so columns last and it is about politics it's going to be yes so I want to do two videos a week between 10 and 15 minutes long each that are scripted and written and I know how to edit and so I'm not very good at the quality of the videos from a from an optical perspective you'll find better quality but I want the content to be really good and so I want to just do two videos a week one probably focus on history and one probably focus on politics so one that's more rooted in in philosophy that I'll go research and write I'm already researching and writing the first one I don't wanna ruin it for anyone yet but I think it to be really fun and then the second you know maybe the second video every week will be something about what's happening in the world and I'll talk to a camera and just be like this is the way I feel about this this is maybe why I go this way and just and just some stuff out there you know I want to treat people's time with care I don't have the brand you have I don't have you know people that are that are religious about listening to everything I do so I want people to like look forward to saying like Oh twice a week Allah might put up a ten minute video that I can just when I'm making dinner just listen to in the background and then go about my day maybe learn something or maybe feel a certain way or maybe I disagree and then move on and and and have something just be a part of people's lives now so clearly you put a lot of thought into this and you've thought this through uh obviously something you're really planning out well yeah I'm trying I mean like that was you know actually the when the number kept rising was horrified like at first because I was like that because I was like I haven't I have that about you like I hate money no I want to hit like I'll of course I love money but it's like the imposter syndrome where you never really know that you're earning it or whatever and I'm like I want I don't want to let anyone down I only have right now the intro video which is just me talking to the camera kind of with what my plan is I'm trying to really keep people engaged and putting update videos on and letting them know where everything is but yeah it was horrified because I'm like you know I only have the bandwidth to do two videos a week whether I'm making fifteen thousand dollars a month or forty thousand dollars a month and so if it's a it so I put out a video to everyone being like this level sustained or even a level that's in the 20s or 30s whatever it is I have to recalibrate what I'm thinking you know maybe I do hire someone to help me shoot maybe I do higher bandwidth what do you mean by a band a bandwidth because I don't want people were like oh we got a podcast can we do more videos a we can sometime like that's not the vision for the product I only have enough bandwidth in my mind tomorrow right and I know it doesn't create time and space right and the money gives me means in the future to maybe make the product more dynamic or interesting or hire people and do more but right now I just want to spend a few months to like be like this is what I'm planning I want to write these things I want to put care into them I want to give you citations I want to like have you give you further things to read and all those kinds of things and that takes time so you always like this like really hyped up and energetic they always have like this much energy but it was talked as fast I'm a fast dog that's in New York thing but I used to live in New York you didn't know a lot of people that talked though they do but you're like fucking ramped up it's because it's something I'm passionate about yeah you know it's I don't mean to come off as annoying right no no you're not annoying at all it's impressive thank you I I just try to these are the things that I I forgot for so long in a way because I was writing about games which I love I love games I think they're important they're an important piece of escape they're an important piece of art I think that's all great but being able to engage with someone like yourself with someone like Dave Rubin or someone like a Steven crowd or whoever might be I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last week it brings out an energy in me that we're both huh III was it hate he we're both I don't know I was on the phone so I have no you could been naked for all I know but it brings out an energy me where I'm like I can finally engage with people that know what the fuck they're talking about in this particular realm which i think is so exciting and so interesting we can have you know we had it we debated we don't agree on everything I think it's awesome you know that's a really cool that you found a very big positive out of this now you can express yourself more honestly and you can you can gravitate towards your real interest and yeah that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to use this as an opportunity for myself and try and use it as an opportunity to just carve out a little slice of the Internet however big or small might be where we can effect some positive change and like an idea you know ideas and learning and free expression and free thought and making mistakes and disagreeing and all that I think that's all great I want to use this as an example I want to get away from the orthodoxy of the gaming industry it's stifling it's strangling and that's why do you think let's go back okay because why do you think it is like that I why is the gaming industry so hardcore ideologically left-wing progressive like no variations no room for debate why is that well I think it's it's portrayed it's like it all that's funneled through a media that is that is hyper liberal right so it's similar in a way to what's going on with the media in news and politics these you know underneath the surface of the gaming industry there are plenty of conservatives and libertarians they they they hide the yeah they do a lot of them a lot of them oh I'm sorry I'm sorry good I'm gonna say a lot of them talked to me I mean I know people that are like heads of studios that feel the way I do I know people that are in the trenches at QA and doing like very menial things at gaming Stukas I feel the way I doing everything between I remember a GDC game developer conference in San Francisco which happens every spring six or seven years ago a guy pulled me aside the first time it ever happened to me and this is when I was kind of starting to make a name for myself and he pulled me aside he's like hey man I work at XY and Z and I'm it works on a big game it's like keep doing what you're doing there are a lot of people out there that agree with what you're saying but there's they're they they don't dare speak out because they'll get lambasted in some way look what happened to me over something so innocuous well you obviously you were saying that there's some pushback about your ideas before this yes what did you experience well so every time I would write a politically driven op-ed for instance when I was at IGN I had I was I was senior editor but I kind of had like editor-at-large qualities where meaning Furby left don't know editor-at-large basically in a way do whatever they want like they'll find something to write about I used to go away for date at the time and do research things and then write these big 50,000 word articles 50,000 words yeah the history of look at that kind of time dude well I I did I carved it out but what about people reading it oh it was in five parts um the history of Naughty Dog was like my opus Naughty Dog's is very huge actually in Santa Monica very huge game developer very talented aim developer I went and talked to nineteen people got about a bunch of primary sources and and all these things in wrote this piece that I really cared about and so but when I would write things like the political correctness piece about let me give you an example there's a game that was cancelled maybe five years ago or so it was pretty late in development so as weird as canceled a game when they've already spent a bunch of money on it it was called six days in Fallujah and it was a game about it was a third-person shooter I think about the experience of solution Iraq you know terrible conflict that was that happened there and people even on the right we're getting upset about thing like it's too soon it's it's this is still ongoing how can you do and I wrote a piece being like what are you all saying like this is awesome this is so great that someone wants to tell a story like this something and and do something like this and you just get it from all sides people will be like you know it's it's not sensitive it's it's all these kinds of things and then the girlfriend mode thing I wrote about where people were like oh you're a sexist and blah blah but I'm like I'm actually just protecting the sanctity of a man who might have made a mistake that's it you know instead of destroying him it goes back to this whole thing of like the loss - I'm sorry the the girlfriend mode the Borderlands story I told you was anything I and they were all going after him and going after his job and other things I wrote a piece being like hey yeah like if this is a farce guys like Brian he made a mistake maybe and I don't know that he should it was a soft target and they just went after exactly and it reminds me you experience blowback yeah every time from of that yeah every time what was the blowback from that from you defending this guy saying well he just really fucked up the way he described things but he was is innocent in that regard well you lose like social cachet when every time something like this would happen right no that's why I say like this was the moment the joke was the moment that they were looking to pounce really and I'm not saying that they were calculating everyone's waiting but they saw an opportunity and they took it because over time you lose respect over people because your political stances he completely reasonable political stances I think where they remember that you said this and he said this and you said this so this doesn't like really you weren't really how many debates with people where you were disagreeing with them it was simply amount of reaction to some of the things that you had written where they were trying to box you into some sort of a conservative group right and they would call me an email now it's like I'm a Nazi I'm all right I'm all right I don't think I actually I don't think I have one all right so I don't even really know what you all right means well I would like what is all right like welcome to me oh it seems like the far fringes like the Richard Spencer's of the world the neo-nazis and a white supremacist and any actual nationalists you know as soon as you write alt on something I feel like it's a message board saying like all right it's like so - it's a reddit saying yes it you know exactly so alright alternative right like what is it I mean I I don't I don't know the mmm you're it you may I do I hope not based on that based on their based on their characterization of it I just look what to me yeah I'm sorry good no well what is a what is how would they define you is being all right what would they say that that you have all right characteristics you can see these you know message boards for instance a lot of people were very supportive on reddit and all these kinda places our little more north for free thought but there's this one video game message board in particular that is just insane and there was a hundred and twenty five page or so at the read about me twenty posts or I think it might be be fifty post a page and I was reading it kind of hurt some of it that right because people are like first of all people telling me I said things I never said like one thing people like Collins that you know against you know his name is no taxation is doing believe that taxes should exist you I often talk about how I really like iron Rand and I really like Atlas Shrugged but I don't consider myself an Objectivist I don't believe that selfishness is necessarily or virtue I just think she's interesting and I think some of her ideas are interesting you know God forbid I exist somewhere in the gray area right and but they're like Colin's an Objectivist anis selfish and blah blah blah and I go kinda Nazi and he he's of races he's of saw her a lot of news was soft races they're soft bigoted soft race being like that he he doesn't he doesn't intentionally or actually overtly say anything but supports causes that are racist or sexist these are the kind of character assassinations that were going on basically people with on on bulletin boards with with yarn and map so that's what how I picture them like trying to make continuous connections and and and it's like these things aren't even things I feel and and things that I said or being taken out of context I often use the in video games one of the big things is like you know there's a need for diverse casts diverse protagonists and stuff like that and I often use the case that I used to use a saying I don't believe in diversity for diversity's sake I believe that an artist should tell his story know of an artist a writer and a game wants to have an all-white cast and that's what you think serves a story I don't think that makes him a racist if you want to have an all-asian cast I don't think that makes them a racist either I think that's what he wants to do and people took that as context of are calling me a racist and a bigot and all these kinds of things and it's it's hurtful because there's no one there didn't once defending me you know I can't I can't defend myself because I'll just make it worse so it was kind of like this hapless kind of situation that I found myself and then I tried to make the best of it I had a debate once about that with a friend who was an Asian actor and he was talking about the lack of roles for Asians in Hollywood and what a massive issue is and you know that he wanted to raise awareness of it I was like man but we're talking about a creative venture he talked about somebody writing a story like I think the the correct way to go about is to try to figure out how to get your own project through or someone else who feels very strongly about this trying to get their own project through but the right way is not for someone to have to compromise their creative vision in order to encompass the full spectrum of races in whatever story they're writing like it's still a creative story like if you want to write a story about a small town in Maine like Stephen King has done so often you shouldn't have to have 10% Asians in that story I mean you should that's not what creativity is about it's about there there are places and people and that way you're going to run into all black folks or are you going to run into all Norwegian people I mean and those stories are just as valid as a story that's fully diverse you know no I don't think that that necessarily makes anything better and I also think that when you're talking about that you're so you sort you're sort of talking about it like there should be a quota you know and like Hollywood should recognize the need for these people to be in films and movies and assist you you're you're making this politically correct sort of you passing these these judgements on this thing that is all about imagination I mean Hollywood essentially like what when you're making a television show or you're making a movie it's really about an imagination it's about imagination and vision and having that vision being entertaining for people and if you like only want to write about the people that you were in college with you were that you share a dorm room with you should be out allowed to and if there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing that that happen to be white males that you know we should probably try to figure out why but the idea that you have to force people to hire Asian folks or black folks or women or whether that's kind it seems crazy to me yes serve the story right I can give you a little glimpses to give you some context with what might be going on in gaming there was this very popular game series called The Witcher which is made by a Polish developer called CD Projekt there in Warsaw and it's based on the fusion of like polish kind of identity with this famous book series that's based on like kind of Polish war you know like kind of the Lord of the Rings but in Eastern Europe and one guys cartoon character that works at this website called polygon in his review was talking about how there were no there was no diversity there had and and everyone's like dude it's Poland and it's based on Poland of your Reich and it's about dragons and like goblins and there's some white guys and this is like what you're upset about you know and there's another guy making and I think you Slovakian I don't want somewhere in Eastern Europe making a game called Kingdom Come deliverance and it would be a very realistic look at something like the 14th or 15th century in that area and again they're complaining there's no diversity there's no diversity he's like there was no black people in this area in 1500 I'm trying to make a game that's true to the era does that mean doesn't make him a racist and and these are the kinds of this is the kind of bullshit but you see this in movies you see this yeah he shows it's not exclusive to gaming but it's but it's what I've had to deal with for a long time and I'm just looking at the root of it though what's causing it like why why do people feel like they have to put a black person in a game about Poland in the 1500s or whatever it was I think I mean I I don't thankfully the people that make the games don't care you're like they're like we're going to make our game right the people that are complaining about it they're virtuously virtue signaling which is not even the term I even knew what it meant until a few weeks ago like I heard people throw that term around I didn't quite know what a man I looked into it it's you know you know what it is it's the idea that you know these virtuous people so seeing people that attacked me for the joke I have to be virtuous and show that I am against sexism so I have to attack the man you know I have to do all these kinds of things in in this need you know but what they're saying when they when they when they're saying we have to have black people in this game in Eastern Europe in the fifteen hundreds what they're saying what they're really saying is you're racist you know that's that's the subtext and it goes back to this character assassination in this need to destroy I often use the example of you remember when Gawker wrote about Conde Nast CFO and out of them know I don't know what that story is so I what's that story about it's so on Gawker this guy wrote this story about the CFO of Conde Nast what is that Conde Nast is like this big conglomerate that owns a bunch of like you know smaller businesses they're they're pretty big company I don't know I think they I think they might even be in publishing so I okay and so they wrote this story and the entire crux of the story this guy that no one this guy I think is brother or brother-in-law with Timothy Geithner so that's his that's his claim to fame I guess but he's just a private citizen that works as a CFO that's a big corporation they write this piece that outs him as a game amp that he's having or trying to have an affair behind his wife's back with this guy all of this stuff just and I'm like I read this piece I'm like what is the purpose of this why and I'm sure Jamie if you want you can probably find it I'm a thing why did they run it um it clicks you know and it's actually blow up in their faces people are fuckin furious about this because this wasn't yet so there's the thing it's like they just out this guy for no reason destroyed his life Gawker on Thursday evening help disgruntled sex worker extort the chief financial officer at Conde Nast and brother former treasurer Scheck Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that is his name Tim guy area jettisoning any semblance of journalistic integrity and likely ruining a man's life in the process I'm telling you know you can go jump down the rabbit hole that's read about this guy this is such an example of outrage code of not even outrage soldier I've just character assassination so now I kind of remember this now I'm kind of remember in the story it's almost it's unfortunate there's so many fucking crazy stories so yeah so the he is married and has three children allegedly arranged a night with a male escort on a recent trip to Chicago when the escorts found out who the CFO was he asked for help with an ongoing housing dispute in other words trying to kick into the government because of his connection with Geithner allegedly got spooked and canceled their meeting though he paid in full for the you know whatever rendezvous they're gonna have in retaliation the escort went to Gawker which published the story despite knowing that doing so would play into the extortion attempt the site also published screenshots of the pair's alleged text message exchange including several photos mmm they shook this guy down and ruined him yeah ruined him ruined it probably probably he's going to have problems with his wife I get divorced now his kids are going to be in limbo he's going to lose his job and it's got to follow him around forever why right because he tried to hat you know it's not our business if he's cheating on his wife and it's not our business if he's gay and it's our business if he's trying to have a B with a male escort Sejal saw clickbait yep and this is and this is what it's all about it's to say I would even go further with Gawker which obviously ended up taking him down with Hulk Hogan it's like why because he's a famous person in his sex tape which is going to ruin his friendship ruin his marriage when all these connections what what kind of pleasure do you get out of that that goes back to the point I was making about how I wouldn't write stories about a couple people back in the day because I didn't want to ruin them mm-hmm that's not what I'm out to do and I feel like that so it all plays into the same culture the same culture of character assassination Neil Puritanism witch-hunting enjoyable romp utility there's a responsibility that comes with this that there's almost like a power that has not been earned this the power of whether it's social media or whether its ability to write blogs about someone like that or whether its ability to just to make tweets and just attack someone that this this this ability is really very very new and the ability to mass publish like it to make a tweet about a guy like you just decide Colin Moriarty is a piece of shit I can't believe that joke fucking sexist and then BOOM put that out there and then it gets retweeted over and over again like that people don't necessarily understand the repercussions of these actions that this is like there's there's an amount of power that they really haven't earned they do this amount of power and influence that have the eat that you have in your ability to express yourself today that's a really new thing I look at it a little differently in the sense that because I think you're right I think you're onto something there but I think it's also the mob mentality that that exposes the fact that say I was ruined forever right and they won whatever that means and then people go like hey you just ruined that guy why did you do that and they could be like oh he did it oh he did it oh he did it he did in other words no one's responsible for it and when you're when you're in this mob it's like it's like it's just with old-fashioned witch hunting yeah you know and it's done for strangely puritanical reasons I did do you think that there's also an inclination to do it because you're worried that it's going to happen to you and you want to attack first like this this is almost saying whether people want to take the the the vision off of themselves or they want to take the the scrutiny off of themselves a point and when you pointed at someone else enough and keep pointing it at other people they I mean eventually people kind of get it after a while but like this is that a little expression that if you want to look at like that with with girls it was always like the girls who talk shit about other girls being sluts are always the biggest flood right you know I mean there's this weird thing about people where if you're going after folks in a lot of those sort of situations what you're trying to do is take some of the eyes off of you I think that the I think is probably a huge element of it I find it strange because I went about my business in a different way for the same reason if that right I said so it's like I don't want to you're making the argument which i think is true that it's like don't pay attention to the man behind the curtain like there's all this stuff over there and my whole thing was like I don't want to be involved I get that you know get that and I believe you that you don't want to be involved that and I think that's very virtuous I think it's very nice that you think the way you do I think it's important and I think it's important that you you have this ability to express yourself and let people know that that is a good way to look at the so the least amount of conflict that you can go through life with the better you're going to be off as long as it's in unnecessary conflict you know and I think in this situation this is clearly unnecessary conflict yeah and that's the that's the hold in it and it causes this this rigorous kind of atmosphere where we can see it in politics to where everyone's mad about everything like Donald Trump or you know everyone's mad y'all so breathe today the pictures up going around on CNN Awards like it was literally like the Donald Trump afraid of stairs with like the Chiron the lower third and it's like and it's like it airs and it's like refers elevators yeah her gilded elevators but there they're serious I think a real question this is yeah this is the kind of stuff that's going on so when you did it sta IR or SOR you walk up and down them car and a IR s because it could be like the eat it is afraid of Stan but uh to me I'm like you know and that's why it goes back you know the fact is and I think this is an important component to maybe making you understand what happened a little bit better because you're not in that ecosystem but I think you can relate because you're seeing it happen elsewhere is that the gaming media is dying and they're dying because no one really trusts or cares trust them or cares what they have to say anymore people in ten year olds and 15 year olds today are not growing up doing I wonder what polygon has to say about the newest game they go to youtube and find a guy there that they trust and believe which is why the only people unanimously pretty much that came out my defense where youtubers because they know that they're the next rung of this evolution of the way we absorb and communicate and absorb information and have news meanwhile these people to your point or writing clickbait trying to stay relevant but no one really cares what they're saying anyway so they're in their death throes this is a way for them to take shots at multiple people at the same time this is what they did a PewDiePie this is what they did to other people and PewDiePie one was really egregious it was egregious but but like again a lot of that stuff was taken out of context yes and and awhile I don't mean PewDiePie was agreed oh yeah I mean the attacks on him oh yeah it was terrible what Wall Street Journal did to him this is just a sign of the time these are people fighting and I really feel this way and you might disagree but I feel like a lot of it is these people are fighting for their lives if I were if I were a person that was talking about open like journalists the journalists yeah yeah like if I were I'm sorry to interrupt you if I were right if I had written in the video game industry for ten years right I wasn't gaming it here for 14 years but if I was a ten year industry veteran and I had fewer than 10,000 Twitter followers and I'm writing for a site no one reads and I'm trying my hardest to stay relevant and to do my thing I'd be pretty mad too if I saw a guy that turns on his camera and speaks whatever he wants and gets the amount of views in 30 minutes that'll get the entire year why would you be mad because nothing to do with you what does it has a lot to do with you because there's only so much time and space for these people to absorb things and I'd rather famine mentality they'd rather go to you 350 million people in this country alone and there's many many more people of the world the idea that anybody's views is somehow or another taking away from your views it's just straight famine mentality there's plenty of lies to go around you're showing it right now with your your new project sure but I'm just like but I'm just saying like their thought process sucks yeah and ostensibly it's it's actually adding to their destruction because people are looking at this like the media for instance in political in the political landscape is dying anyway that the decline is happening Wall Street Journal put up a piece not too long ago saying that per-capita viewership on television is actually starting to be outpaced by YouTube so that's over now right so like now and that's not a video online or video on demand that's just YouTube and so people are looking at the situation and actually precipitating it happening quicker because in order to stay relevant they lie or they erase your pieces I think we should talk about what happened with PewDiePie like who the fuck is pewdie try and what happened sure do you want me to Laird yeah please go ahead so PewDiePie is is the biggest youtuber in the world he has 55 million subscribers and he's a millionaire just to be clear I've never I don't really know him very well I think I've had one or two communicate with him at some point but I don't know him so I don't really have a horse in the race he lives in Europe he lives in England I think he's Swedish or something of that nature but he lives in England and he has a massive youtube following every video he does will have 10 12 15 million views and you know you're on YouTube I'm on YouTube in a much lesser sense that's a lot of views and he pushed the boundaries in some ways in some tasteless ways as this is right and the thing that really caught on was that he was using this app or this service called fiber which is this kind of TaskRabbit kind of thing where it's like you can pay people to do whatever you want and he paid a sum of the things he did were otherwise but he paid these guys in some country to hold up these like death to all Jews signs or something like that as part of a joke and you know that's something I think is somewhat tasteless but he's trying to make a point whatever a point he was trying to make he's trying to make a point it was lost on a lot of people and this combined with some other imagery he had been using some like kind of fascist or Nazi imagery and some other things that I've been going on over the month I'm sorry if you want oh I know you went sailing I'm sorry and so eventually the Wall Street Journal caught Windom this Wall Street Journal obviously of a prolific right of center but still pretty moderate newspaper and basically went after been tried to the basic elite ride to destroy him and took a lot of things out of context then forced Disney's Disney owns a studio that funds him and all these kinds of things in cost a lot of personal and economic destruction for this a they intentionally took things out of context too and they distorted the actual intent of what he was trying to do especially with telling people to not be Nazis he was like mocking people that were being Nazis and they used that to say this guy is pretending to be a Nazi right it was a completely dishonest hit piece in the same vein as the Conde Nast it does the same vein as the whole Cogan hit is this right it's it's these people they've you know that term punching up they want to punch up and they think they're punching up Wall Street Journal's punching up now on you tubers but really cause a lot of hilarious well lunching up on a youtuber that's the way I look at anything on hilarious it this guy's a youtuber he's a guy by himself you're punching up to attack him because he's the king because he's the media elite I mean that's the media elite I mean it's like an independent reporter attacking the you know ABC news or something like that exactly and and to me it was like it showed a lot of cowardice it showed a lot of half-cocked thinking on there on The Wall Street Journal's part to think that this was going to blow back on them and it showed a level and and I hate using this word because I don't think innately it's necessarily a bad thing cuz I think it drives you forward but there's at the level of jealousy at play with a lot of these kinds of things that's happening what you were thinking about before when you were saying that someone who's struggling to get 10,000 views and a story they write is going to look at a guy like this that can do one video where he talks about farts and he makes you know his 7 million views or something like that I mean it's a million a year with him yeah and they're met and they don't understand it and I get that you know I look at some people that are famous or some people that are you'll have a platform I'm like I don't get this but I'm not going to like sit here and like of core raid on their parade that's their right to have an audience that's totally fine maybe look at yourself in why you don't have an audience maybe you look at yourself and realize that you've been doing this for so long and you're so proud of that why isn't anyone listening to you could it be you you know instead of instead of looking around for people to assassinate which is what basically happening here right I just I find it so distasteful I find it so destructive we're at the precipice of a very dangerous time because the trust in institutions no matter where you are now is just lost and a lot of it has to do and that's what I was saying with media precipitating the fall by not telling the truth by not doing the right thing I think the media in terms of pullet politics for instance is really rebounding from the fact that they thought Clinton was going to win so they thought they can get away with saying and doing anything for that means to an end yeah the Donna Brazile thing for instance where she was feeding questions to the clinton campaign yeah is so incredible so shows such a level of bias and systemic inherent bias they thought they were going to get away with all that now no one trusts anyone so when I see all the stuff I don't know what's going on with Russia and Trump for all I know he could be a fucking Manchurian Candidate you know but I don't believe a word they say you know like boy when I read this about Paul Manafort about slaying about blah blah blah like I don't know you lied about all this other shit I've no idea you're talking about yeah I have to really do my own research I don't even know who to trust anymore they did that to themselves and they precipitated their own downfall more and more people are going on YouTube to listen to people like you to listen to people even like Alex Jones to listen to Dave Rubin to listen giant problem it is a problem because you initially if you listen in the main well you it's a problem because you need people in the trenches that you trust you need someone in the press room at the White House you need someone in the AP that is on the wire that is telling you the truth but what I can't even trust them anymore express that's a big problem that's when people go seek out alternative sources of news and information and entertainment and that's what's happening and that's why they're dying yeah I'm well in many ways that you sure that big corporate model is insuring their own demise absolutely and and it's it's the race for cliques it's the race for money in the rain for prominence it's the race for relevance and not honesty not transparency and not a real objective sense of what the truth is and what the actual facts of a story are that's where journalism is a different thing now because it's now a entertainment show it's an entertainment show that also has the news in it but that's why the women are so hot that's why the women on Fox News are wearing these tiny little dresses and they have beautiful legs and heels on and they're talking about important issues but they're giving you a little bit an eye candy while they're doing it's so transparent to when I see that kind of stuff a mic was a very attractive woman and I'm sure she knows what she's talking about but I know why I know why she sits at the end of the table I like when they're aggressive - what could megan kelly she's attractive and she's aggressive yes she's smart that's what makes uh sexy yeah talking about but uh you know yes so we're in this we're in this weird this weird space you know yeah we're in this is just very bizarre space do you feel like this is like an almost an adolescent period in human communication that we're going through this weird growth period where we have this incredible access to information and the ability to spread it like we have now with with social media and with YouTube and all these different things where anybody can kind of hop in and all sudden get a platform like this PewDiePie guy PewDiePie wasn't a star it wasn't a politician he wasn't an actor before this just a guy yep and he connected with people and carved out this path for himself and pretty much anybody can kind of do that now I mean there's it's not easy it's not if it was easy everyone would do it but it is not insurmountable and I wonder what the next stage is in terms of the ability to share information if it's going to change past where it's at now and get to some new level yeah I think I think you're right in the sense that the internet specifically had taken off so quickly the world wide web you know is only 24 years old Internet's way older but the way we communicate with each other now is so different than even Usenet in the 80s or these kind of university university communications that they had going out of the 70s where they were sharing things amongst each other you don't need gatekeepers anywhere there are no gatekeepers you can go start a YouTube channel now find an audience gain thousand subscribers make a lot of money and say what you want and that's scary to the traditional gatekeepers and they don't like it and they're their fight against it is so transparent and it's so self-serving when I don't we need a media that we can trust but I don't think we need the media as it is right now either because the media we have right now is bloated dishonest partisan politically and motivated all these things that don't really serve a purpose to educating and informing someone the days of Cronkite are gone what doesn't that sort of set the stage for someone to come in and offer a viable alternative I hope so there you are Colin Moriarty yeah that's that's the idea is like just in my own way like I don't I don't have these delusions of grandeur that I'm gonna make millions of dollars and have this huge reach if you're already at thirty nine thousand dollars a month you better cut the shit with this humility stuff I just to do and know what you do and you fuck shop I just I'm just trying to say that I didn't have I left my you know I was making good money I own you know a kind of funny I I walked away expecting that I was gonna take a pay cut to do what I really wanted to do and try to do the right thing and it's great that people are responding the way they do I hope they continue to respond this way because it'll allow us to do more of it my advice to you stop being to turn with that and just do the best stuff stop being concerned with being humble about all this and it's definitely gonna drop it's definitely I'm not going to get a make I'm not I'm not going to be famous I'm not going to be forget about all that nonsense well is it's all like you're shackled yourself just I'll just try out the full word young man I press forward with intent you've got some good content man you're I
