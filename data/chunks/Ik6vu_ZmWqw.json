hello freak bitches we're not like in a I'm not like in a position where I'm gonna have an actual battle with someone yet you know I don't know but but but for competition you want to know for self defense defense I mean like I would like to see then you can't say that because that could happen on the way to the grocery store oh my god you run into some crazy messed-up chick once you get out I wish I had the the fucking man power literally - like we were in Nashville like two weeks ago for Americana fest we're playing this festival and we were driving under this bridge and there were these two guys beating the fuck out of each other in the middle of the street there was like a bottle over the face this one guy was choking the other guy who tanker no terrible it was it was it was poppy crackhead bullshit it's one of main puzzles but it was like obviously we called the police but like I had this moment where I was like I wanted to do something I'm like what the fuck can I do and I literally leaned out the window and I went stop I don't know what to do and I call the police but like if I were definitely stayed in my car right hunter person listen to me if you fucking if you're driving by two people beating the fuck out of each other you are not there okay you're in a car just because it's right in front of you that shit could be a hundred miles away unless unless there's someone in that mixture that needs you like if there's someone small and they're getting beaten up by someone big then everything changes but if it's too fucking so my point is don't always stop just kiss already don't always stop sometimes you gotta let two dudes be to the death it's fine just give them both rocks and push them near the edge let them fall stay and keep coal-mining you gotta keep moving okay geez need to flourish they need to find better streams of F of diversity I appreciate the perspective that's what I'm saying man don't always stop fights and what I realize is when they when they've recognized you as a threat when they identify you as somebody could do them damage they start going on maneuvers trying to find out everything about you're trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that they can dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a neo-nazi or whatever they can come up with anything they can grasp at because their strategy is to dismiss that is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speaker's credibility because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument yes they haven't been able to do that with me which is why feminists now refuse to bait me debate me on TV because they know they'll lose they can't bring out all they can't bring out look at this battery of dismissing they've just dismissal tactic so they've amended over the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've never had you know a sassy gay person come up and say it you're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts they've never had it before so they've never built up an arsenal to fight it you know so this is this is why I win and why I'll cook I'll keep winning because they they don't really know how to deal with an argument on its own merits and in any case of course the facts are on our side well it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war you're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to look up dirt on the opposition you're going there treating this is it's this is an ideological war it's not a debate about the facts of the issue and I think that's part of it because the left has always seen this as a war and the gender warriors you know have always been warriors they've always seen this in strategic terms I'm not sure people aren't conservatives are naturally more self-effacing conservatives tend to be a little bit cool a little bit more chill about things they kind of don't want to get I think they get very angry about things I mean Ted Cruz I'm not saying all conservatives how do you explain what's her name the Palin chick Sarah Palin these are the these are the outline is that even most conservatives find these people a bit much Mike Huckabee I think that guy's in is in the end who knows how do so much fatter know he was whole well I mean you know for got lazy got that no TV yes so fat because so I can't vote for anyone not enough rock and rollin I want my Co Rubio just because he's hot if we can't have Trump that I want I don't think I think people are silly so whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing I think there's a vast majority of people that aren't not very good at looking at themselves and they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their actions they just think that they're right because this is what they've they've been saying for so long and I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations as these women get in with you about because like when they're talking about what they think are social constructs things like gender identities the way people be and when you shatter that with the facts they're looking for some other weapons and there's nothing there no that you see in their eyes you know it's not really a debate about the idea itself it's just not what it's not what it's about is gender warfare that's why people like christina hoff sommers called them gender warriors because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say these are people who just hate men well they hate men they want to hurt men they don't want equality for women they want to be they want superiority for women whether it's architected into the education system or you know affirmative action or whatever it is they don't want equality they want superiority and fundamentally a lot of this but you know these these crazy extremists you know progressive third wave feminists today's version of feminism it basically boils down to misandry and it takes a gay guy because it's so dangerous for men to even broach this subject anymore and any man with a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the subject no matter what his opinion is and it takes a gay guy to go on you know Sky News in the UK and say I'm sorry the facts are not on your side and what you're doing is damaging to women it's to me really an indictment on debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express an opinion on this subject that it takes a fag to go and stick up for petrol sexuals if other men could say this they would be but they can't because they would risk their careers feminists always talking about silencing young people I see signs to men but we don't there's no like established number that everybody knows like oh if you eat this you how many memory ten all your fine this isn't because of the fact that it's illegal there's all this guessing and you got it takes a long time to figure it out you got to talk to a bunch of different people and get answers don't talk to Joey Diaz throwing off the curve don't worry about another one you're gonna walk on ice you might as well dance I saw
