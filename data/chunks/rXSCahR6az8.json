four three two one we're just talking about moving into woods together so good Hill tiny house with three pairs of shoes three pairs of pants maybe two shirts yeah that's it the last clothing you'll ever buy one coat yeah everybody's just out here chasing bigger and better Tom Papa just why why I'm starting to wonder I was telling you guys that I was looking at this houses for sale in Northern California in the redwoods it's 32 no 320 feet square tiny-ass the whole house it's got a loft the loft is where you sleep in a tiny oh the tiny thing below it is like a little tiny kitchen yeah a little tiny like couch area that's it like a houseboat like with like built-in thing it's kind of like a beach yeah yeah yeah they make those now think about how simple your life would be it would be but would you be content that's very small you'd be great for a little while that's very small three and sixty yeah that's I want to shower like that that that little tiny house that's three no come on that's that's not the one is it that's bigger than that that's a 20 foot it says 320 foot tiny cabin and bit there Oh oh my god that's attainable that's bigger than we mean it's still for sale this video let's chip in today got put up last year 320 foot tiny cabin in Big Bear amazing small house oh my god oh you know we should do Jamie so simple we should buy that place and turn into our big bear studio that's what we should do to fucking show I bet the shows up there I bet if we didn't show in Big Bear in the woods like that it would have a totally different feel to it yeah cuz you'd be hearing your guests screaming in the background being mauled by a mountain lion do a show up there how the fuck would you convince people to drive two hours till we get there people that are training up there or something like that maybe they could pop yeah like four guys cannot eagle of cannon Tito Ortiz or come over every day and then you'd be like okay I get it yeah Chuck Liddell you get it I get it Canelo's a pussy I get it I don't know I mean the fantasy is that that becomes a simple life you pare down everything all the aggravation you get maybe two bills come to the house would you go crazy if I didn't have a family it wouldn't be a problem yeah if it was just single Joe yeah no family no kids it wouldn't be a problem I would just go I mean I really probably think I would I would already have a place like that up there where I could just go and chill yeah I understand I was thinking of just a little place like that like a look a little hideout next to the house like Mark Twain had did you have a place like that mrs. house yeah it was a little octagon kind of a room and he would leave his house with his daughters and his wife and he would go up the steps and go into his little thing and on this table was just his pipe a box of cigars his writing pads his pens mmm and he just would hang out there and smoke all day and work and then he would go back home maybe that's enough maybe that cuts the edge off it gives you your isolation and your simplicity and then you return back to the people you have to feed it's a little something that'll work if you've got the people you have to feed if you don't have yeah you have to feed straight Woodsboro oh yeah caught up path well that's gonna be the real trick when the kids leave when they get big enough and they take off and run us down to you and your wife and then the wife ones get like five dogs she's probably like encouraging you to go get a cabin get another dog rescue a dog let's adopt a kid oh yeah they want to keep you tethered well tethered to little things there the nester yep they were the nest they if they if the nest is empty that's their it's their job they build that nest once everyone everyone in that nest safe and that's what they're built to do do you see you ever see women that have like a bunch dogs and you go like you know you want a kid right thank you no you want like it's how I just don't have the time for a kid like how much time you spend on these fucking dogs yeah like it's probably pretty close no it's just me my fluffy babies yeah maybe my just from a dog mom and just fluffy babies mm-hmm but it but what is it about people that want to further complicate their lives like what is it why does everybody always want big is that just a part of the the genes is that what it is like what is it well we have I think a driving us to always do more explore more push more right there's something built into human beings that have that and then we have a system that rewards that and capitalism so that's the that's the that's the board game that we're all playing so it keeps you racing to get more stuff in bigger house and more things right you know what I mean like if there was if that didn't exist if you weren't able to accumulate that stuff what would we be doing we'd still be striving but for other stuff but this is our reality so the it manifests itself in more cars a bigger house you know yeah it's like you're optics right you're always fine you always trying to survive but surviving is not that hard today right good point so you try to instead you know because it's not too complicated to go find your food right there's not a lot of like puzzles and challenges shelters daycare oh so you start thinking you know what in your car these cars 2 years old yeah no it makes you yeah you just keep going but then I think you do that long enough you start to realize hopefully that that stuff doesn't really make you happier it it does to an extent like you get out of your poor days mm-hmm you kind of like get above water and you help your family out you get some stuff you're proud of but then you just start adding more stress you know because you bigger bills and bigger taxes and all this stuff you've got to fill up it actually does the opposite it makes you more stressed you're not as happy and then you got to kind of strike that balance it seems like it's Jim Carrey's been on this kick he's blaming that to people because you know Jim Carrey said I'm paraphrasing him but it's basically his quote was I wish everybody would get rich and famous and they would see that that's not what makes you happy right you know people think that a if I was rich and famous you know I would be happy yeah he said I wish that everyone would get rich and famous so they would realize that that's not the answer yeah what does he say is the answer he makes to make paintings shitting on people mocking them that seems to make yes where's the peace and love bro its aggressive his paintings are all like shitting on people and mocking people clearly assholes but I mean it's not like he's like trying to accentuate the love in the world you're right this is shitting all over these bad people that makes us happy yeah I mean I don't know is that good yeah is it good to focus on the bad people like does anybody change their opinion based on Jim Carrey's art like does anybody I don't know I was like a big Jeff Sessions fan right so I saw these paintings yes and then yeah with Jim Carrey's got him with a giant fucking wart covered dick holding it out in front of them jizzing all over the Constitution yeah yeah I don't know that's always a question it's like how much how much of art that rails against something is effective in changing that thing you're railing against like does it actually have an impact is it a slow impact that does it change over time and I don't depends on the art here's here's an example I think Tina Fey legitimately changed the way people feel about Sarah Palin uh-huh I think she legitimately may have affected the way people were willing to accept Sarah Palin or vote for because her impression of her was so brilliant I don't people remember it oh yeah it was so goddamn good she looked exactly like her looked like her attitude and she said things that people eventually attributed to Sarah Palin because they thought that Sarah Palin actually said it cuz Tina Fey said it yeah she fucking nailed it did she's so funny her show Timmy kimmy schmitt have you seen that show yeah yeah my favorite show oh yeah it's so good it's Tina Fey's show yeah she's in it sometimes she plays the lead is great I'm gonna stick let me get the fuck out of here that is so crazy we're right now the audio folks we're looking at an image of Tina Fey as Sarah Palin right next to Sarah Palin and it's fucking indistinguishable almost it's so good Wow but did she do you think she affected people who already liked Sarah Palin they don't if you like Sarah Palin you don't know what you like they were out of their fucking minds they're I mean they're basically working with a less than functional brain you thought that that was a good idea that that lady could be running things yeah like that close to president she was a construct too you know he was an entertainer but not I mean Sarah Palin was a construct she wasn't what everybody thought she was like there was like there was one there's a story I'm not a hundred percent sure this is true but it makes sense that someone shot a caribou and then they drove her to the caribou they gave her the rifle and she stood over the caribou and took photos so that they could show hey she's a hunter she's like us us regular folk out here hunting caribou yeah find out that's true just a public relations kind of I need a we need a Google close yeah clarify believe it you know yeah of course you know that's all that's the way all its stuff is do I believe because I want to believe it mine as well well I wouldn't sound an asshole but a good down-home woman yeah hey look she was the governor of Alaska that's easy I could be the governor liable to yeah she had showbiz okay Sarah biscuits caribou after missing five times shown shooting caribou on the latest episode of a reality television show okay yeah what's amazing is how that she really fell off like wait a minute is she just shooting it freehand she had she's never rest okay why why would you do that okay let me see show this let me see how she does okay this is fucking stupid listen folks the only reason to do this does she have a rest shout out she's free handing this helpful okay look they got the packs on it now she's gonna arrest it hmm they said I rest a tiny little caribou to that carrot that's why the Carib was still around he's just firing that's a juvenile caribou no she hasn't shot yet let's see she has yeah she took some shots oh she took some shots and missed yeah okay that's why so she free-handed at first and then she needed a rest she should have used a rest immediately and I've shot animals free-handing but not never far away I shot a moose at 60 yards what's wrong with free hand in it because you're not as accurate yeah you know what with a bow well a bow is more accurate honestly a bow I'm more accurate with a bow at like 60 70 yards free hand not more accurate but in the range uh-huh then I am with a rifle and with a rifle when you get out you could shoot accurately on a rest like way out longer distances but when you're just holding it up like that it's based on you I mean you gotta kind of lock it into your body but it's hard to but isn't about steady no bow the thing is about the tension of the bow your arm is kind of locked out and attention of the bow you could kiss your arm pretty fuckin steady and I practice it every day like that right practicing keeping my arm very steady every day so all these stabilizer muscles in my shoulder a very drawing and having a gun out there just like who's just a little m and also there's like the recoil if you're not used to shooting and it doesn't look like she's used to shooting that didn't immediately go for the rest like a seasoned hunter would have either lain prone or throw their pack down immediately put that rifle over it and settle in the rifles resting on something gotcha you know but a lot of times they'll bring like sticks but they pod fails and we're making a reality show for TLC see but see though that there was a photo shoot they did see see me find this the shots fake do you think that though well I think it's fake well they just put a circle around them yeah but that's just for the for the filming the caribou definitely went down see yeah but I mean I don't think she shot it and it went down I think it's most likely she shot it and went down because you see the way she's reacting and everybody else is reacting that seems pretty real to me look it's not impossible to shoot an animal especially that's a juvenile caribou see how old their antlers are he's like hey guys what are you doing this is what you would call look if that was an elk you would call that a spike hey look it's people I'm just thinking about the production here it's like there's one camera on her mm-hmm and then there's one behind them but that means that they then have a third that's focused just on the animal and then it means there's three camera guys out there with them that just sounds like a lot yeah and the camera like hey I'm gonna be on TV that's a good point they might have recreated the the shot it's mom it's possible yes you know what man the reality is whenever you're dealing with hair quote reality shows right there's massive fuckery involved oh yeah and editing and please but back to whether you could affect it whether or not the art can affect the yeah what you think yeah I mean what Trump did during the election he liked calling people out and mocking them he really is that art no that's not her but he was kind of like a like a Long Island comedian like a insult comic yeah you know he was just like going after guys crazy Ted and a little water guy and I mean he was doing it was very much entertainment though lyin Ted crazy Hillary crazy Bernie no Brooke at Hillary Hillary and crazy Bernice in a defense Hetty said at a big rally defend him yeah he's for what further to the Texas thing he's in what are you talking about he's in a race right now with I forget the guys name it's Betty over work or patio okay so he's defending him in what way he's gonna have a big route he's gonna hold a big rally 400 come on this is that after they talk so much shit about each other than the hill grooves yeah we said yeah after his father was doing a major rally for senator Ted Cruz in October I'm picking the biggest stadium in Texas fine as you know Ted has my complete and total endorsement I like how he were endorsement with a capital e his opponent is a disaster for Texas week on second amendment crime borders military and vets he's you know there was an article yesterday showing all the times that Trump has been lying and it's stunning but one of the more recent ones was he was you know he did an interview where he was talking about goddamnit Lester Holt Lester Holt that's right it was Lester Holt right and you know he was saying that they fudged that interview and it cost them badly and so then they played the transcript they wrote this show the transcript of the interview they released the full interview yeah like there's no fudging no it just played it as is you're like what are you talking about yeah but he said safe like that right he said he says what you saw is not real the truth is not the truth well that was what Giuliani said yeah look that's their but that's what they're that just nothing's real except what I tell you is real I just think that they've realized that there's a certain percentage of the people that are with them that just need some wiggle room they just need somewhere argue they just need some conspiracy threat they're not thinkers right they just need a little bit of something that they could run with and use to argue so if comedians come out and attack Trump and you there's comics that are you know Bill Maher and all these people that come out and really go against him does it have any effect it has an effect it does for sure I think Alec Baldwin has the most effect uh-huh that important he does the impression that oppressions brilliant yeah it's very good I mean it makes Trump angry to a truckie shit nobody keeps watching it he can't stop watching it that alone as an effect yeah you know yeah but it's not it's it's like I've never seen a time where people are more angry at the press and like going along with the the conspiracy thread of the deep state yeah deep state trying to take out the POTUS I love how they call him POTUS - it's fucking Donald Trump you know no no POTUS is you know this and that he's gonna do this and clean the swamp like what it's a dog Trump why why you saying POTUS yeah see if you want to say Trump that's fine you want to say President Trump that's fine too you want to call him POTUS you're doing some sneaky shit he wears a hat that says 45 on it yeah one of the presidents that hats made and he has merch it's selling merch after the show I got painters cabs bumper stickers looking for a gift is this the Trump if you just wear one of these in a vegan restaurant you're sure to get punched oh my god that guy's gonna get indicted that guy that pulled the hat off of some kids and threw a drink on them you know water water burgers that what it was the guy in Texas yeah some some dude saw some the area's get the 45 hats hilarious official it's only 185 dollars to $50,000 it's on sale 28 now it's 1680 you can get my DVD you can get a buck you can get it digital download of my speech tonight how do you go from twenty

parade man you don't want president Pence listen you know I mean people that are not happy with Trump you got to understand you get him out it's not like you get Hillary in this doesn't work that way Bernie doesn't come in out of the hallway yeah yeah I don't know wouldn't you rather have pence I know people say that but I just want something somewhat normal I want someone that all pence is not normal yes she would been stabbed ben shapiro wrote he put a tweet up with a picture of a lady from The Handmaid's Tale when really deep trouble and he wrote prepare four pence yeah over the top won't be alone in a room with a woman yeah yeah how about Romney woman I just saw him on Jay Leno Show he seems like a reasonable guy it looks very presidential is that cool president hair I gotta be honest he seems Romney seems like a reasonable man he seems kind he seems like he respects it he's in morals he's a nutty Mormon for sure yeah you know why cuz all Mormons are just being a Mormons nutty they change the name you don't follow Mormons anymore talked about that yesterday oh yeah they rebranded yeah Saints that's right calling them a Mormon it's like calling a small person a midget oh is it

he loves running and you know you get a dog out in nature he's so and he's like the best dog I've ever had in terms of like listening and coming to you and yeah always checking to make sure you that cuz he's a retriever yeah you know so he's like super in tune with you right he's he's so fun like when I come home the first thing he does he sees me wags his tail comes up to me and then he runs grabs a toy puts in his mouth and then comes back to me like he's retrieving something yeah he has these instincts to bring something to me my black lamb has the same thing the same thing and if I don't have time to like play and start tugging with her because she's just like you're here let's go let's play yeah let's do when you don't you have to work and you get on the phone or whatever and they just like lay on the ground like you know I came home on an adult the other night like 1 o'clock in the morning you know from the Comedy Store and I sat on the couch to start writing and Marshall just comes over goes - what's going on what are we doing it's like like a roommate just lied down it's the best there's a great feeling when you're writing and the dog is right next Yeah right fucking fart you whoa dude did you eat a rat outside well I hope he enjoys the elk thank you man that's awesome you're welcome yeah he's the best let's talk about rad well good trick Johnny Cash was an awesome dog to like look at that face he's just lying on his yeah so happy he's such a happy dog oh man yeah my dog would be happy like that if I can find some good trails I don't have good trails I just take him to Runyon or something you know can he just run up Runyon yeah you just got to be care of other people's dogs like Marshall got bit by one someone's dog once you know some people just have dogs that just not that well you know socialized yeah yeah but if you you know you have a mono leash for the most part or you find a good spot where you don't have to have one lesion that's great it's just that's what I want to do other dogs are the issue right and snakes ooh rattlesnakes raus things have to be very careful all right around us out here you guys go up you're running dog gets bit by a rattlesnake taking your 1/4 mile from big you'll be okay the dogs be way better off than people I can run back with them yeah yeah you take them back it was a circular areum yeah I mean I might have to carry him Oh cuz it's really steep the stuff that we run on is like literally like super fucking steep oh yeah yeah mmm it's it's basically the last three quarters of a miles all uphill whoo yeah it's fucking brutal but it's great on the legs and the ass happy Labor Day but I thought when you got hit by a rattler you're supposed to like not move now you got to get out of there you got to get some medical attention and got to go what what it does is here's the thing you can't suck the venom out this is what people think right people think I just cut it and suck the venom oh this is what rattlesnake venom does what it does is it digests your skin.look it digests your flesh the venom does yes it causes necrosis so what it would essentially is doing is digesting you with venom this is the way they kill rabbits and things with that they eat and swallow they bite them and then they they kill them does venom and it starts to digest the flesh and then they swallow it whole and it aids in their processing of this animal wait a minute whoa so it so the snake hits mm-hmm a rat yep if he were to take his mouth off after five minutes would have been partially digested yes are you saying that it literally starts starts digesting yeah yeah it starts it starts decomposing and digesting so when you get bit by a rattlesnake a lot of times you need massive skin grafts and you have like massive tissue loss and necrosis this one guy documented he got bit on the arm and they had a med vac amount in a helicopter and then he had to go through a long series of operations to repair his arm she's like mesh and skin grafts and all these different things and it still was fucked up like years later his arm was fucked so if you didn't get medical attention why would you die well like what it would just spread through your organs I don't exactly know you you might survive a rattlesnake bite if you're going to get medical attention if it wasn't the most amount of venom the real scary thing is young ones young young rattlesnakes just empty out on you just like young boys coming from even storing it up you don't know how to control it you know the difference between like an 18 year old fella shooting our class Bill Hicks would say arcing ropes of jism this is a rattlesnake that's like thick like a fucking like a tree trunk yeah those I ran over one once this is crazy I was running with my not the last dogs that are deceased but my dogs before that when I used to have pit bulls and we ran over what I thought was a large stick in the road in the trail and as I'm running over it in the air I realize it is a giant rattlesnake thick is my form oh my god it was huge seven feet long geez he's just in the middle of the trail just completely stretched out like a stick oh my god just sunning itself and the dogs ran right over it and it didn't strike you it just no the dogs luckily listened to me and they they weren't aware it was but those dogs were crazy those dogs had been bitten three times oh my god my dogs have been bitten three times by snakes so they knew they just kill the snakes they didn't give a fuck so crazy if they're the craziest dogs they're so hardwired for combat right like the rattlesnake was like and the papal was like fuck Kilda they worried for a second he got bit in the face and at one time he got bit I've been bit in the face you got bit in the face Cup this is Frank Sinatra him that's great craziest dog I've ever had that dog killed everything he could his main game was I'd leave him in the yard you gotta kill lizards his main game was like it was like a video game who just walk around the yard or stomp on the grass looking for lizards and then dive on him it was like it was like a game damn just try to find lizards to kill how was he with people he was wonderful with people whose sweets would never strike go after a person no no he never been a person he was he was a little aggressive with his like wanted to play and a little kind of freak people out I'd like to play and pull ropes with you like he'd want to grab a rope and bring it to you in here and pull on it and he would make these horrific noises and people like what the fuck man I'm like he's just playing crazy but he was so they get a bad rap though if they deserve it yeah they deserve it they deserve yeah they deserve because you don't know if you're just walking down the street you see a pitbull off-leash people you should be cautious people don't want to hear that because they love their dog like my dog is different don't say that they are bred to fight that's what they're bred for that's where they came from that's where the breed yep no bullshit the reason why there's such great dogs is because they're bred the the good ones at least yeah have no aggression whatsoever towards people so that when the dogs are fighting they could go in and separate them with no fear of the dogs turning on the the owner interesting where'd they do this Ireland America America what do you think American Pitbull yeah that's what it's called right American Pitbull Terrier what do you think the Michael Vick thing was all about right there's a but I've been around for a long time oh I haven't been sure over a hundred years more a couple hundred years but the you know that was event originally going to be our national animal was it really before they went with the eagle did Ben Franklin sell the eagle I don't know the idea it was who wanted the pitbull I don't know I mean they use it as war dogs when they use them in the army that would have been a cool symbol sword but you know what the the problem with those dogs is multifold one they have a very high prey Drive like their their drive to attack things is very high right and the more they're bred for that the better like the more intelligent they are the more intense they are and people love them because of their intensity and their intelligence right loyalty towards their owners is outrageous so that love is deep that's why that's why the pitbull people because they really do if you say anything you they get really up in in arms about it they don't want them to have a bad rap but love those dogs don't get me wrong dogs but one of my dogs killed one of my other dogs oh really yes oh my god yeah you can't have two female pitbulls you can't have that two females they'll just go out it's just they never sort it out they never decide who the boss is yeah they decide they start off like they'll they'll figure they'll have a fight and then one will win and then you say okay well in a normal situation this one realizes that it's the alpha and then the other one will back off no no fucking way not with girls they won't quit girls never quit they go back to it what if one of them was hanging out with Marshall Oh they'd be fine they'd be fine yeah well she was fine with my male dogs it was it was the female dog she want other females around but she was not fun with my males if the male was getting attention and she wasn't she would get angry like you're stealing my attention and well she was a prison dog basically she was she was in the LA animal shelter for many months when I got her Bryan Callen just want to talk mean again oh yeah because dude you gotta get this dog he goes I can't get her my yard too small because his dog is so amazing so sweet and I went to see and she was the sweetest dog to people uh how old was it a puppy still yeah she's still a puppy but she was amazing but they're just fucking dangerous around dogs yeah you know my sister had a bull mastiff oh those are great great dogs that's so kind to people's like loving like you put him with children I mean it's a big dog its head is like gnar heads combined but other dogs other small dogs really it was bred for that and it would go and just any dog on a leash with an overly attached did not care and would just pin it to the ground that's wrong and you just couldn't get it out I mean that it's just in the breed I had a dog that was a mastiff that just died I just had him his name is Johnny Cash we just had to put him down now when walk anymore he was 13 and like this is the saddest moment like the last week of his life Marshall was in the pool and he was jumping around and playing with my daughters and everybody's having a good time and and Johnny wanted to come to the pool but he couldn't walk over mmm and so he would would take a couple steps and he'd be panting and his legs would be shaking and he capable to take a couple steps and he's panting and his legs are shaking he was just in agony so I picked him up all like 140 pounds of him was a big dog every time I run man I start coughing I ran this morning and then for the rest of the day I'm like when I try to talk I got like rope it's the suit it's the dirt I'm breathing India and pollen and I'm in the bottom of these canyons running through all the shit and the dogs in front of me kicking after I ran on the concrete today and I'm lay my point is I carried him so I had to carry him over to the pool and I sat him down there and he just laid down there and you smile and pant he was totally deaf by time he died like completely deaf like you'd be lying there you'd be like Johnny you hungry Johnny and then you touch me like where'd you come from oh really that's what bummer about big dogs they died so well 13s on that bad it was amazing he actually died like nine yeah eight nine they're ready to go that's what so I can't my dog's about eighty pounds and you know it's a big presence 140 that's a big thing in your house and to know that it's you fall deeply in love with it and it's gonna be gone and six seven years it's it's hard it is the sweetest dog to everybody dogs people yeah everybody just does the giant lovable recently Antoinette oh yeah a couple weeks ago I'm sorry let's be who's rough but Israel but it was really hard seeing him suffer like when I was wrong bring him in well the last year was rough last couple of months it was when do we do this it was like when do we when do we put him down cuz I don't want to come home and find him dead yeah but for a year you knew he was kind of it's a slow deterioration like I couldn't walk him anymore that was about two years ago two years ago I just couldn't walk him cuz where I

life it's not true just put that in the back so when I get high I think about it Cecily and fucks with my head is that what happens to me yeah oh yeah yeah that's number one thing you ever get high and then you realize oh I haven't been thinking about this at all and then when you're high it's the only thing you're thinking about for sure things that I you know should have been thinking about like a year ago leaking water how much water is that legal what if we run out of water then I have to think about all the water sprinklers broken I should just do it what's wrong with just do that why can I just make that you know lately emails there's no way I can keep up it's impossible now at this point do you have a number that you try and stay below in your Inbox no that's how I do it no if I

cluttered desk well I have more than one email account ah you know business from managers and close friends so that's and then this is this one for people that have known me forever right you know and then there's is a business one for people that I don't know that well you know that I'm like in my inner circle right but that's that's like that's a lot of emails bro it's a lot but you're important one is your inner circle and your business and that's not 4,000 that's a lot hundreds hundreds hundreds and a lot of it's nonsense like it's all nonsense but then you feel like you can't throw it out yeah if I could just keep it I have a garbage account I have I mean my one account that is yeah here you go down there but that's because I have an AOL account that I just anytime you're in a store any time whatever you sign up for something can I have your email can I have your email give it all gets that and that's why it it blows up but my private account my inner circle one under a hundred that's where I'm staying you got basically about four thousand big dick pill ads yeah exactly try this cough drop so you keep me from coughing his cough drops work I can't yeah they do work it doesn't I'm not coughing unless I'm talking and when I'm talking I just feel that in the back of my throat it's right at its it's like two hours after running oh ways yeah up up to two hours maybe after that it sort of goes away it's like my bag you have to run with one of those masks that they wear at the airport wasn't Ryan Massa yeah no no I'll be all right when tried his call for some coffee coffee generates phlegm hey I saw an article this morning I wanted to get your thoughts on it okay I was reading about that they're thinking about putting video gaming in the Olympics yeah and the way they were talking about it they they're like this is inevitable this is going to be in the Olympics and these kids consider themselves athletes the only hang-up that they had on it was that the video games are violent and they don't want to promote that but to me it was well wait eyes it was this really a sport this is the Olympics trying to cash in that's all that is I think it olympics are dirty I think it's a dirty business and this was highlighted by the movie it gross right movie and you realize how the IOC is in bed with the world anti-doping agency and how you know how they sort of function together and what it really is all about is making money and anything that compromises that making money they're going to vote against it it's just it's not it's a dirty business right and if they did have it in the Olympics what they would basically do is take these guys who are making millions and millions of dollars playing video games at a professional level yeah and millions they would make them work for free and then they would make all the millions of millions dollars but they say but yeah you get to be in the Olympics right it's dirty business I think the Olympics are dirty I really that's terrible yeah well is chess in the Olympics No why is wrestling out but chess you're actually moving pieces around video games yes you know use icons on the screen like why what do you mean they took wrestling out they took wrestling out of it they took really took wrestling out of the Olympics no yeah no they did yes they did no yes I love wrestling and they took it out they might have brought it back but it was gone right Jamie no no wrestling's not yes they took it out there was no wrestling in the Summer Olympics come on I'm not kidding for real for real that doesn't make any sense I know that's crazy why wouldn't I know heard of that I know there were there was a one point in time they were talking about it but I thought that thought it was put back in was the thing it was out for at least one and 2013 IOC voted to drop wrestling from the Summer Olympic program effective 2020 is that real yeah I don't know if it's happened yet so it's supposed to be for 2020 I don't know if it's I'm pretty sure was in the Olympics in the summer what's not 2020 yet so no I mean the last Olympics did he say that wasn't in I don't think it was yeah I think I don't think it was call him now Bob is your I cured Bob was on an episode news radio kicked my ass those episodes oh really I thought he was hitting on this girl that I was dating I guess tom pappas wrong yeah oh that's from the 70s 70s Jesus Christ nine eighteen 1896 go back to that and they took it out all right so maybe it was in last time but I don't know what the fuck you're talking they've oted against it now he's trying to look jacked he is Jack weightlifting back then let me tell you something bro that guy's not jacked he's jacked pure if they greco-roman introduced in Athens 1896 here they grabbed each other by the underwear it's a different kind of wrestling that's Lady Mary's mm-hmm pool area that is a rough fucking spot oh my god wolf I would have found this though they're adding video games to the Asian Games in 2022 and then it's gonna be a demonstration sport in Paris 2024 he's coming well I'm wrestling out those guys don't need it you know and this is my message to anybody who's a pro video gamer you don't need those people what do they offer they'd offer shit they want you to work for free they gotta make all the money you were already huge and by the way the people will run that they miss the boat they didn't see it coming they don't deserve it what about the athlete part of it and what about it you consider it a sport well no it's a game but it's a very highly skilled game I mean it's definitely something valuable like it used to be thought of as a frivolous waste of time right but now you can make legitimate money with it but you don't I don't think you classify it as a sport you mean they call it eSports right are they an athlete music is it is the top gamer an athlete the only caveat is that it's hand-eye coordination right there is hand-eye coordination indeed what do you consider a sport do you consider something you move your entire body or is just moving your fingers enough mm-hmm because like is pool a sport mm-hmm billiards is that a sport I don't think it is I think yeah gain it's a yeah it's a game that requires hand-eye coordination and control and touch tennis is a sport mm-hmm right yeah tennis requires full physical being full mental being yeah you're you're running around you're jumping back and forth you're swatting that ball there the shooting at you trying to get out of the way I mean the amount of endurance you have and stamina and explosiveness all contributes to your game would you make an exception for someone that's really good at Qbert yes that was my favor subway surfers in my daughter plays that shit she's a little wizard it's yes not a sport the only wand in the Olympics because they realize there's massive amounts of people that are watching it and playing them now right and they can make a lot of money now arenas I mean they're gonna they're filling arenas in Olympics you live part of it is a billion-dollar business yeah I mean there's a lot of sports that are in the Olympics that no one gives a fuck about if they're not in the Olympics right right like like that curling curling the ski shoot one ski and shooting one where they call that flan or pentathlon oh yeah there's the one that Bruce Jenner won which one was that that's the decathlon did he have to shoot cheddar now throw up spear or something no he did he did the javelin javelin technically a spear but okay is archery Archery's in the Olympics yeah is that a sport that's more of a sport right we're using your full body well not really me you are for like stability you're stabilizing with your legs and you have a certain stance mm-hm and if your bow is heavy to pull back then it requires strength but that's that's blurring the lines it's descent I think archery is essentially a martial art with a tool you know and then you're demonstrating but you could do it on paper so it's target archery but they spent all day they have target shooting in the Olympics mmm well as part of skiing right they do both they do it in summer - actually no girl that was just target just shooting hip you write that girl you tell me about yeah so that's interesting I mean that's close to a video game not really no no video games are wow I guess maybe but like we were showing that Sarah Palin thing which was trying to shoot off hand totally holding the gun out that's if you like that's more of a sport you try to shoot off hand or pistol shooting I would say like pistol shooting would definitely be a sport like when they do those courses you ever seen those courses that they do yeah like for training ready go light goes off and then you run through a door and then you turn a corner and tight and then you yeah and some are bad guys' some are good guys and then some sometimes they do there's a bunch of different ones they do and some of them are just targets and some of them are targets that are dressed up like people right yeah that's a great sport well that's a very physically demanding you ever see the Keanu Reaves footage no he's training for John wick - no please God make John wick three stuff of them running through Times Square on a horse shooting people in the head in John Wood 3 yeah they're doing it you haven't seen that no well just show the footage first of all the training footage for John why John wick - man that motherfucker Keanu Reeves he gets into it yeah he was training with my friend Higa Machado in jujitsu so they do Roboto Oh No here he is look at him give me some volume so like when you watch him shoot yeah in the movie he looks very comfortable shooting and even his martial arts like the stuff that he's doing in the movie is legitimate like it's it's doable it's real he's really training oh yeah I mean he's not doing anything where you go get that like right there's no road house moves like oh gosh last night I love road have I got home from the comedy store last night and I was gonna go to sleep at road houses I'm like fuck I'm staying up I stayed up it's the best going in the bar I watched it an hour and a half and till he killed the guy by grabbing his neck and that's my other closely you missed the big end scene in the house but so he's on a horse in John wick 3 Wow he's the real deal a Tom Cruise just get him back on the Chevelle why are you giving him a horse he's Tom Cruise in the 1970 Chevelle is the way to go not a fucking horse come on so he trains like legit shooting trains legit shooting legit martial arts Samuel Jackson isn't it oh my god Samuel Jackson not in is there a list of its like 10 films start being an actor until he was late in his career at early age oh yeah I've just read some reason how old was he I want to say 40 but I feel like I might be mixing them with some I'd be true that might be Rodney Dangerfield yeah the original John wick is a fucking great movie in John wick too is a great movie they're both great I watched two of them back to back on a plane recently is that the one where everything's on fire and that one scene where he's like coming out of an apartment John went to is one when he's fighting that Ruby Rose chick is a fight with Ruby Rose girl power I take such a good punch yeah Tiana's pulling punches yeah he's legit Tom Cruise he trains and does all his real stuff yeah Tom Cruise does a lot of crazy stuff right yeah you fucked up his ankle jumping off of a building to another building yeah climbing on the outside of planes hanging on does all that stupid shit yeah car chases he does that and does it themselves ya know in Dubai hanging off the into them building okay yeah he's a maniac he is a maniac yeah yeah fighting off them Scientology demons we're using angels using Angels just Seaton's Satan's are the bad things those are things that stick to you right I thought that was where like your soul like yeah that's who you are you are a feeding like in the shell of a ow I thought the themes were like the bad ones that came in you to fend off everything I know about Scientology I learned from South Park I learned I learned a couple of useful things from learning about it going clear did you see going clear the documentary yeah do you read the book no books crazy - I read some of Dianetics though I did - yeah yeah I've read it when I first moved to LA I bought it ordered it on late-night TV yeah I want to know I wanted my nephews to get to join up just see what would happen I year here let's go see what this does one of us gonna join the cult yeah it's too late for me get in there see what happen if you seem wild wild country yeah I've been reading his book the art shows book the art of living and dying oh yeah it's very interesting you know what's unique about him is that the things that he's saying or are like legitimately profound and very interesting and likely legitimately deeply philosophical like you're reading it you okay this is a this guy was a real thinking person and he was like deeply considering these things from all sorts of different angles and yet he allowed that crazy Sheila lady to run his call and poison people and but even before dominations but even before that he was collecting Rolls Royces and he was like he was he loved the love luxury but the problem look a lot of people have good ideas they try and motivate people it starts out like these nice intentions whatever once they taste money that's it it's over greed it just takes you over and you can't shake it it's like why would I be in a in a Ford Taurus when I had a rolls-royce well how about just get one rolls-royce bro I know but honey to power power and greed it's it's and celebrity and then you can't shake it will always televangelists when all this televangelist went down like they start off like preach and around the south dirty like in little churches then they start making millions of dollars and it goes all off the rails greed demon I'm telling you there's I guess they're similar I because like that guy from what you're saying he has some good points is summed up there's some stuff in Dianetics that makes very good sense right but hold on don't you do you think that all that good stuff is negated by a love of objects I think that it ends up corrupting them and they start making other choices that don't align with what they're preaching right yeah I think it's weird they're human beings we're all human beings and you start getting that power and then all of this money comes in and it is all sex there's also a lot of sex a lot of sex yeah that cult was a lot about just free sex everybody banging everybody it's funny how it all comes down to those things it always becomes sex money power and celebrity like that's a potent conflict they all fall from those things well these desires these great benefits to all those things right sex feels great if you have a lot of money you can buy awesome things and you enjoy them and you feel like you've accomplished something mm-hmm if you have a lot of celebrity then everybody kisses your ass and he would walk in the room his hands clasp together yeah everybody would go crazy but it's a different kind of celebrity right it's not his celebrity was not just like oh there's Tom papa dude I love your bread show right if it wasn't that right it was you have the answers oh well that's that's the ultimate power is celebrity mixed with God mixed with the answer to that yeah now you're off the charts well you get a little bit of that in yoga classes there was a yoga class that I used to go to where the guy was the instructor was banging some of the students and he was slimy it was like you could tell yeah he would sing in class like sing new songs I'm like bro you are killing my buzz yeah I'm out of there but you're so white like everything about it he was just like he was a slippery guy yeah like and his thing was being this this really spiritual yoga guy yes 40 year old women whose husbands were tired of fucking them they would really you know commit in him next thing you know he'd be giving them privates air probably you know talk to them about sensuality of course and their aura and then probably lay some shit down about you know one of the main problems in relationships is their the passion sometimes abs when there's a loss of respect and appreciation for each other as individuals as unique Souls yes I'm experiencing that in my relationship I'm so sorry here though so sorry to hear that the boundaries of intimacy should not be related is it me but I feel like I'm seeing the real you that no one else sees and intimacy should not be confined by a piece of paper you know I mean it's obviously that the vows of your marriage have already been broken by your husband who's not nice to you anymore let me write down the apart my apartment in Encino sweetie where the hot yoga guy to that touch with nature the hot yoga guy he got busted for sleeping with all these women and who's the hot yoga it was the high Bikram guy was he fucked everybody that he was accused of sexual assault yeah was attacking yeah my guy wasn't sexually assaulting anybody who's just slipping the dick in they were allowing it they wanted the dick like there's a difference you know but then there's something's but it's soaring it's a Power Move but some people say that that's abuse that the the yoga guru who manipulates the woman and and then fucks her that he is in a way definitely being guilty of sexual misconduct and perhaps even like something more egregious because there's a relationship that they have between the guru and the student right and he's violating that trust and that power dynamic yes that's Catholic Church but it's the same what do you mean that 40 year old married woman in a fucking yoga teacher is not the same as a little kid in a priest but it's using power for them to get the same thing oh no it's not one of them is rape and abuse the other one is a lady who wants dick well you didn't say she wanted ick you said you said he was just twisted their students now that's a violation if you're a guru anything that's a teacher and below you're using that you're manipulating that person okay but wasn't that like a big part of like undergraduate students and professors back in the day they can't do that anymore yeah that was a big thing no in my high school like the basketball teacher ended up marrying like his best girl basketball player hey and you know happy ending yeah it worked out oh well how old was she in him he was probably 30-something and she was 17 whoa when did they get my basketball I don't know after 20 years school during school now apparently it was during and then they ended up was it legal done no no in many states it probably was legal team in Jersey yes I guarantee you it was what year 1985-86 guarantee it was you could 17 was legal I bet it was legal really I bet it's about 16 was legal right yeah and not to say that there can't be a happy ending when somebody is the teacher or though I mean it's definitely a violation but it is a manipulation what's the age of consent in 1980 no New Jersey age 16 years old 16 yeah Wow I could have hit on this crew okay but hold on a second consent for sexual conduct 16 this applies to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct as a general matter this means that a person who's 16 years old can generally consent have sex with any adult and this is in 2008 that's today that's today so here's the thing how crazy thing like you know this Asia Argento thing so the 17 year old kid right when he had sex with her is in California so he's saying it's sexual assault because she had sex with him and then she got Tony Bourdain to pay this kid off three hundred plus thousand dollars to shut his mouth and then it came out that she was a hypocrite because she seduced this kid and fucked him and she had played his mom in a movie ten years prior when he was only seven which is really kind of his pictures of her and the kid when the kid was up like a little kid hoji she stayed close to him and called him like her son and he would call her mom something like that and then they got together and she lied about it and said she didn't fuck up and then pictures came out of her in bed with them and then her friends were these text messages she she's a fucking monster was invisible in a way was he of legal age when they had sex this is my point he was 17 at the time so we've been totally legal if this happened in New Jersey but it happened in California but this is all going on while she was making a big deal of Harvey Weinstein having sex with her 122 like jesus fucking christ like that was grip of Chris you know the whole thing's crazy but my point is first of all let's be honest about that situation I mean 17 he's gonna be okay I'm just saying even if it's illegal yeah it's just not the same for boys it is not the same should she have done it yeah probably not yeah yeah definitely probably not should she be locked up in a cage for ten years from doing that yeah she's a freak all right that lady's a freak yeah yes she was he was 17 but she's more guilty of being a hypocrite than anything did she stay in touch with him all those years she was playing the mom yes the real creepy pictures her in the movie with him when he was like a little kid oh but it's not as creepy as Woody Allen when he had his daughter sitting on his lap and then 10 years later that same daughter is holding his hand as his girlfriend in a brain in the front row of a basketball yeah that's kind of weird that's a little way creepier that's waiting you know yeah so weird I don't know if even a reason to make that comparison but the point is that kid would have no case at all if this is in New Jersey right it was Jersey which I don't think he should have a case does he is he prosecuting like well he he apparently threatened to go public with it he wanted money and they gave him money Anthony Bourdain did yeah and gave him a lot $380,000 my god and even after he got paid he comes out that is the most expensive dick that lady will ever get then he comes out comes it came out anyway no Wyatt came out I knew who released it Harvey Weinstein somebody somebody released it I don't know what happened but what they're basically showing is that this whole thing you know of her attacking being attacked by Harvey Weinstein it's complicated right maybe he did exactly what she said he did it's possible but she clearly is deceptive she definitely lied about this kid yeah the problem is the age of consent being seventeen if it was 18 or if it was you know if he was 18 rather or if it was like in New Jersey we're at 16 there's no case and she just fucked a young kid and I'm just gonna be honest the only thing that's creepy is that they had this sort of mom's son yeah I know what they talked about each other his mom yeah that's weird if she was just a hot 35 year old who had sex with a handsome 17 year old boy right yeah 17 it's a man it's not the same thing it's not the same thing if it was a five year old man a 17 year old girl she directed the movie - does that change yes she directed the movie movie the new one like movie ten years ago when he seventeen year olds we're a 7 year old rather hmm yeah I don't know man you know my my she was 37 when he was seven seven when he was 17 yeah she didn't make a move when she when he was seven though though she was waited till he was 17 she's a good person yeah he's enough she when she got close to the wire she's like I can't hold on anymore I'm never ready it's will you move to New Jersey I won't well here's the issue I don't I I just don't think it's the same thing now I think the only thing she's really guilty of here is hypocrisy and deception I don't think she's guilty of a sex crime even though she technically is in my mind I mean maybe I'm a maya sexist I don't know if I am I'm sexist against men well I just think I think the guy's gonna be okay I did you know I don't buy that he was so damaged but he was that damaged from her he would have been dead he would have been damaged from a girl who was his age - who fucked him and then didn't call me right that's the thing it's just emotions that's not a crime you know you've hear you hear this arguments like well a boy can be affected for sure everyone can be of eiected and when you're forced we fear like wow you know in some of these instances where the teacher sleeps with the kid and right and it's a boy and he's 14 and people are like oh come on he would love it he's a boy now 14 you're still don't know who you are you're still mixed up and again we're batard teacher-student dynein yes different situation she's manipulating you right so the question is is this dynamic equal to the teacher-student because she was the director and she played his mother and they she clearly had some sort of a maternal love like sort of relationship with him early on and then it became sexual later but then she says he jumped her she says the horny kid jumped me that's what she said in her text to her friend when she's being honest oh really yeah so maybe he did maybe he was in love and pining for her the whole time yeah maybe that's one of the reasons why he came out and wanted money in the first place she's trying to get back at her because she didn't wanna have anything to do with him anymore and maybe they had a couple of drinks together and she you know she just didn't know what to do when he started making moves on her and so she fucked him cuz she's crazy mm-hmm that's possible - yeah what is it is it a crime I mean what you're telling you're talking about a crime where if it was 200 days later it's not a crime like really is he gonna learn a lot in 200 days the laws the law Joe the laws the law mr. dragnet over there you gotta pay you gotta you know the laws are on the books for a reason Joe and then law says seventeen doesn't say sixteen and a half it says seventeen for a reason Oh Johnny lawyer over well they really does that's what it comes down to it yeah it's like we because it's so gray and because there's so many things that can happen you really have to be come down to well is there a law you should have to pull your pants down how much pubes you got let me see what you got how BIG's you dick you're full-grown the fuck out here pussy that's not fair pretty lady bang yeah I had a friend of mine in who grew hair when he was like 12 arias little Italian kid he had a mustache full 13 I'm sure his pubes were gigantic good he's Argento go fuck that guy he couldn't help it he would get a haircut it would grow back by the time he got my car it was just Italian yeah it's very complicated you know the thing it hurt too is you know she had a consensual sexual relationship with Harvey Weinstein after the alleged incident where he ate her pussy and she didn't want to well that's like the Cosby thing they keep coming back there was a couple that came back and and it's like you don't wait a minute were they aware that he drugged them the first time I don't know the details it sounded like it it sounded like they knew something was weird but then they came back anyway but you can exonerate someone from a rape just because after the rape you're friendly with them right because you know that's a big mental impact you don't know what's going on with not just that it's some people they want to mitigate the effects of being raped by turning into something different so they like maybe would establish a consensual relationship with the person after they raped them to try and take their power back a little well not just relieve themselves of the the feeling of being a victim like they almost make it consensual yeah it's like a weird psychological dynamic that you and I will never understand as men yeah we'll never understand and now cuz it's not the same it's just not the snow it's not so if she went back you know with Harvey right yeah like if a woman can't comes over your house right okay if you're a single guy am i in a cab little cabin yeah little tiny 325 you're in Big Bear you were in flannels you cutting wood okay and a girl comes over and she sucks your dick against your will don't stop I can't believe you're doing this god dammit and and then once it's over you like well I don't want to feel like I get raped I'm just gonna establish a relationship with this lady people be like shut the fuck up Tom papa get out of here was that Michael the difference is because you're a guy you're not worried about your physical safety this is the real issue physical safety I can't get pregnant right I used to work out at this gay gym I used to work out at Gold's Gym on Cole I say gay gym because it was looks like a lot of gay guys really obvious over tan you know gay guys like super thin tank top different muscles and fucking combat boots and real aggressive yeah leather like fucking paper boy hats off his mother working out I had a friend fucking gay but my point is then while I was in there working out yeah these guys would hit on you right you know and you'd feel like guys were looking at you and hitting on you and it made you uncomfortable well welcome to being a woman and not even really because I could fuck those guys up right oh I wasn't worried like if a guy try go to the parking lot I'd be like hey dude we're good this is gonna get violent yeah stop trying to fuck me right now like I can actually fuck you up whereas if I'm a girl I have to worry that I'm fumbling for my keys and this guy's behind me in the parking lot and they want to push me into the car and take my pants off this is a real concern for women that men don't have so our ideas of what it would be like to be in a non-consensual relationship with a woman where she sucks your dick against your will just not comparable it's a great point I mean that's when that Michael Douglas movie came out and it was the same thing it was the reverse she forget which movie was he she goes down on him and he's like no stop it it's a work relationship and he's like stop John you know attraction no it wasn't fatal attraction it wasn't behind the candelabra it was uh it was another movie and it would became like a thing it became like a like a joke because as a disclosure because as a man who was the star anymore anymore that's hilarious yeah so she goes down on him and everyone they were trying to make the case that it could happen to a man too and the culture was like now yes yeah she's a predator yes believe this get-off wrote that a fantastic sex thriller masterfully done that's fake news wrote that well good for them putting it out there and giving it a try like how they always have that like fucking WCN TV some shit you've never heard of w wor-tv [Laughter] for any quote yeah just take some wonky quote from some Boise news station some guys drunk when he writes that he's barely paying attention but now it's just someone with a blog yes like Don's movie Hut loved it when they were when I was watching Roadhouse last night he put a cassette Mercedes in his car it's playing music shoved a cassette in there and Plano like my daughter got a cassette from one of her friends a cassette player she's looking for cassettes yeah or something yeah yeah like she has a bunch but they're pretty obscure there's a real concern that everything that we have is digital you know and that we're going moving to Kindles and ebooks and all these different things and then eat downloadable music and less physical music yeah that anything that happens that wipes that stuff out anything that wipes out their ability to play it observe the recording we lose every that will be gone forever all information all of our information is becoming digital I becoming more and more vulnerable while we're becoming more and more aware and more and more educated that we're at risk like we're more aware that we're that we're being attacked like people are trying to steal this stuff and we're putting more of our faith in it yeah but what I'm saying is as we become more educated not even with that just the more information we accumulated the more vulnerable that information is it's not like a books that are like locked solid right now they're always gonna be there as long as you keep in a fireproof container no this is our our College itself is way more vulnerable than it's ever been before yet way more advanced it's an interesting than before that's really interesting fucking weird but isn't it all backed up on the cloud what does that mean this is I had dr. Robert Schoch on the podcast who's a geologist from Boston University oh yeah freak me the fuck out talking about coronal mass ejections from the Sun and that what what they believe happens somewhere around 12,000 years ago there was some sort of a gigantic solar event that caused lightning storms you know like when it's a storm and rain is coming down from the sky like fucking buckets of rain everywhere yeah he said it was like that with lightning and that lightning was literally turning the ground in the glass in certain places how long who knows mass extinction of animals really mass extinction of people but yeah like just lightning raining down on the whole planet yeah it wasn't Mike gonna know if he's right obviously it's a controversial theory and he was proposing but right it's based on what they believed possibly happened with coronal mass ejections from the Sun which can and does happen and has passed I always think about that like what's gonna stop like a giant asteroid all of a sudden like no way so they're happening all the time yeah it's just not with big intensity but why Mac why not have one buildup what hasn't seen a comparison of the earth next to the Sun yeah when they show this these solar flares are hundreds of times larger than the earth itself it's so crazy like but it's far away right guys yeah it'll be okay we're still gonna have a barbecue this weekend couple million miles and how many miles is the Sun away how many million there's the how many million yeah the moon is 200 it was in varies and you know goes a little closer a little further away but somewhere around 260 thousand two hundred sixty thousand 93 million miles Wow the Sun yeah 93 love the comparison the Sun in comparison to the size of the earth and you you realize you like Oh [Laughter] million times bigger a million times million times bigger than the earth yeah that's like the question say a solar flare pops off if it's that far away you're fucked depends on how about no it's coming for why you have a couple minutes just though that's am nobody look at that look at that 1.3 million earths jeez look at the little dot it's hot right there oh there oh my gosh look at those ejections look at those flare Oh No look how big those flares are and then look at the size of the earth like those that's common that's everyday that's happening all the time yeah you ever see video of it it's fucking amazing that's crazy it's amazing like what's happening on the Sun right now should freak everybody the fuck out and it varies you know it's like it's a giant nuclear fireball yeah it's just a constant look at the nuclear explosion oh my God look at that shit it looks so hot what a shit design right how you gonna heat everything out just put a big fucking fireball in the sky I mean it's basically like like a fireplace how crazy the system how crazy they don't work so good yeah it's crazy work so good yeah well it's one of the arguments that really dumb people use for religion like what are the odds that all this worked out this perfectly that were this close to Sun I mean come on man scientists are trying to keep the Creator from you Japan's trying to land an unmanned robot on an asteroid twice the distance 186 million miles away whoa and there next month excuse me next month they're gonna be we're gonna try and land on it yes sir Christ the Japanese I didn't even know they were in the space game it's orbiting it right now well the Japanese have the Himawari eight satellite that takes gigantic high resolution full photos of the earth from 22,000 miles out every 10 minutes somewhere around then oh yeah yeah well pull that up the Himawari eight what are the what's the details in the Himawari is one of the best things to use against these Flat Earth dorks like because there for the longest time one of the things they were saying is that there was no full photos of the Earth from space that everything was just stitched together know everything they don't know jack-shit they're so fuckin students very stupid theory real time but this is real time look it's night time how far away is the distance the Himawari ain't the same I think it's twenty two thousand miles Himawari eight that's a satellite 22,000 - yeah so yeah so the satellite is 22,000 miles above the earth and it takes real-time photos every 10 minutes in high resolution they're like massive massive photographs but they use it to predict weather and you can like you could literally see storms coming in and show so bad yes that's me look how you zoom in and zoom out no I have the no idea of a Japanese we're doing all this oh they're on the ball son they make the best cars don't break these Tesla's that shit's gonna run out of batteries in the desert Mad Max movie just shuffling trying to get to Nevada trying to charge my car with a phone some kind of queer it works for queer us up I'm just listening my footprint oh you want them electric car guys yeah how's that work out with your Conflict Minerals your electric car you piece of shit I just try to be nice to the planet nice how could those cars not run on solar power that's what I don't get especially in California like everything solar why don't you have a solar roof panel and spawn the car itself does regenerate the batterer hood should be so oh yeah you're right oh my god let me put all the known asteroids from 1999 to 2018 what whoa fuck we live in a shooting gallery look if the mass has identified more than 18,000 near-earth objects they're just floating around all around every rate hold on back that up again the discovery rate averages would it say 40 per week it's asteroids oh my god hold on back up chance of a large Earth asteroid hitting Earth is slim what but suppose what continue to monitor all known near-earth objects for any potential collision with earth they say with slim you know what until you know I was talking this one sign look at that right I was talking this one scientist he was like well you know there may already have plans in effect if they find asteroids it's not something that I'm concerned with they're already thinking about that and I think we'll be fine so then I talked to Neil deGrasse Tyson and I said how much time would we need to plan for a satellite or an asteroid hitting us goes at least 10 years like what 10 years ago 10 years and he goes yeah I go so we're fucked you as we'd be fucked I'm like no this other guy lied to me wait what do you mean 10 years from when for him when you find it to when we could figure out a way to stop it oh that it would take us to 10 years you're not just so asked to figure towards Earth you need 10 years gap time between recognizing is definitely on hit earth and having the ability and the technology to shift its direction couldn't you just go and shoot a rocket at it no bro why not doesn't work that's what happened in that movie which one deep impact or Armageddon at the Will Smith one right Jackson Oh which one was Samuel Jackson the president was it Morgan Freeman Morgan I'm Morgan Freeman did they give up on the me two against him seems like they let it go I think so yeah they tested the waters leave me alone I don't do any so what do you think about this louis c.k thing she has returned he's going crazy Kyle Dunnigan did a go to Carlton against Paige I can pull out his the best Instagram page the best it's the best if you're not going there louis c.k for his return as a volume hey Louie jumpluff what you did the comedy club set terrific nobody knew what was happening until you were standing right in front of them spewing out your material classic movie well thank you sir oh you didn't ask any what if they wanted to see it you gave them no choice but to watch you work it yeah if I just went there into some jokes they're good jokes no people are like whoa Oh too soon I'm not stage forever is your talked about the elephant in the room though okay start off with something like hey I just flew in from California at boy are my arms tired from jacking up for the airplane okay everybody was chapter they're forced to watch me best plan of my life though the way you crazy sure okay I gotta go okay yeah me too me too yeah areas my old roommate you guys live together New York City you know shit horrible one-bedroom apartment had no doors okay I was on a futon he was in the back we had no windows it was covered with roaches no sink in the bathroom look at you now making bread aunty thinking the president oh what a mess yeah a mess what do you think about this some people don't want him to come back some people think they should he be should be allowed to come back and he served time off and and then the argument by a lot of women is yeah but he hasn't said anything like he had won on anything yeah what is what you know what shows that he's learned anything like what what should you have to do I don't know I mean Louise very smart I'm sure he'll if he wants to keep doing it after this reception he'll probably come out with some statement or do something I don't know but the reality is what did he lose they took away networks took away his stuff just film distributors weren't gonna put out his film well the film but as a comedian from by all accounts the film a shit anybody who's seen the felt I haven't seen it yeah I have a few friends that saw their like it's just so creepy and weird especially in light of like what he was doing yeah it's just like no I'm but regardless whether it was good or not I'm just saying like right the industry said FX said I'm taking this show from uho said we're taking this stuff Netflix that we're taking this off definitely definitely lost money financially but those or and those are entities that but is that punishment or is that them exercising their desire to not work with someone who's been accused of something that they don't want to be associated with yeah is that a punishment I don't seems to me that they're they're making a decision of who they work with and who they're not work with right it affects him negatively sure but it's not necessarily a punishment well there's it I don't know it I think it would feel like a punishment sure but my point is there's these entities that can prevent him from making a living as a comedian though he can walk into a garage and if he has fans they're gonna come see him right he has he has that under his control yeah right yeah nobody can stop that nobody so he can do it it's up to him whether he wants to or not it's up to his fans whether they show up or not and it's up to the people that hate what he did and really against him to not go right that's well that's why this thing was weird was like he just showed up at the cellar which is like his favorite place to go and he just worked out material in the audience like Kyle is saying is just there trapped in there and they can't right get out they they didn't have an option to say I don't want to see him it's really interesting all the different spins though all the different women spins you know and what one one really bizarre spin that I saw was this woman was saying that this is indicative of the problem of all comedy clubs an aggressive male audience and women sitting there feeling threatened not being able to use their voice I'm like user boy I think we're gonna heckle yeah they're saying like you like you would be more empowered if there were more women so you could heckle yeah that's not cool like you're not supposed to do that at a comedy club if you don't like someone just don't laugh you know but like I mean this one here's the thing it's not your job or it's not your place to say that you don't like someone when the other people do like it you know if you're right if you're you can walk out yeah just like you're gonna see a movie yeah like you're an audience member right the deal is you're not there to perform the audience is there to just sit there and laugh or not laugh right but don't be rude to the other people that are enjoying it so as soon as you write your sensibilities above the rest of the audience well you're a problem right you've made if you decide like hey I didn't like this I'm gonna go home and write about it that's totally your prerogative that fine get up and walk out that's fine go somewhere else and talk about it on stage yourself yeah nothing wrong with any of those things yeah but this this one woman's take was like women don't feel like they have a they can they have the ability to speak out about it I'm like speak out like so you're saying like to heckle hey I don't want you onstage I know everything about you and your story and it's up to me want you to perform in front of me even those other people are laughing right and that these aggressive men were yelling good to see you back Louie aggressive men like well okay that's like there's a framing of this and this is one of its becomes this male versus female framing that sort of represents aggressive men sexual men doing things to women they don't want the women are sitting there in silence they don't want to be there and they don't have a voice because they feel overwhelmed and out over populated or outnumbered well the problem is those guys that that Harvey and him and Matt Lauer and people like that they are the poster boys for that so they're going to be watched very closely and has many more fitting to that I mean I get confused by this one by all accounts Matt Lauer had affairs right in the office with girls who worked with him so what was inappropriate that is he was having sex with his staff right right but he was also hitting on people who didn't want to be hit on was in his office yeah that was the accusations yeah it wasn't just he was dating them he was also you know making weird advancements in the office yeah all these guys all these guys you know they're all very complicated they're all very fuzzy kind of things but you know those guys are gonna be watched very closely as you see Louie just goes to this little club and does a set and it's national news and national debate it's like it's it's uh it's heady stuff Teddy stuff yeah but what's fascinating is that as a culture we're going through this great time of change yeah and this great time of introspective thinking and of observing our behavior and discussing our behavior and watching this is like you have the worst case examples of which my in my opinion is Cosby in the worst case example like drugging people Andrea I mean there's there's a woman who was on television on CNN she said something that freaked me out once she said it is entirely possible that Bill Cosby is the the most prolific serial rapist in history geez statement I heard that I want maybe she's right she's right like how many how many people does a regular rapist rape before they get caught yeah you know and that just I mean that's the number that came out against them and sure there's other people that yeah yeah that's like the far end of the spectrum right and on the other end of the spectrum you got like Louie mm-hmm who's did something's definitely you wouldn't want happen to your wife no your kids my friends I don't know the whole story you know Kurt Kurt Metzger was telling me that one of the girls who came out against him like they had been flirting like the whole weekend and talking about sex like the whole weekend and then he did that and then he had sent the girl a text saying I'm really sorry that I did that and she said don't worry about it look we were talking about sex all weekend and then when the accusations came out obviously there's more accusations that seem to be more egregious and she threw her hat into the mix as well right I don't know if that's true or not though the problem with a lot of these stories is you're hearing them third fourth fifth and yeah you don't you know all you know is he said those stories are true and then he recognized that he did something wrong and he was going to take time off so that to me is not a guy defending himself that's a guy saying yeah I definitely fucked up I'm gonna step back so he steps back for nine months or whatever it was and people are saying that's not long enough you didn't do anything no you got a so what what should someone do like in one of the things that Michael Ian Black said on Twitter before they tore his dick off stuffed it in his nose that was a crazy thing to watch because he's like super progressive very liberal yeah and he was saying that you know like that me too has to offer men a road to redemption mm-hmm and you know and a lot of these women were saying though like every road to redemption begins with I'm sorry which is a very valid point yeah a very valid point like you should you should have to say I'm sorry you know and I think he's said I'm sorry but I don't know what he said to the women I don't know what he said I don't mean he had the one public statement did he say I'm sorry and that one public statement and that Times article is the kind of like a veiled I'm sorry I think I don't know it's I don't know you know I I hesitate to comment on any of it because it's like his mess and like anyone that comments on it or comes near it or like that the owner of the Comedy Cellar everyone's got to deal with yeah the after we have the aftermath of what this guy did it's like why am i you know like as the owner of the cellar it's like why is he have to get brought in to Louie's behavior I saw at least a half a dozen articles written about what a piece of shit Michael che was for saying that he Louis deserves the opportunity to make a living right right I'm going after Michael che and is in his useless opinion like yeah you know but look it's there they're allowed their opinion that Michael chase opinions useless I mean this is one of the beautiful things about free expression now completely that's what that's what I'm that's where it's kind of the most interesting for me and I don't mean that I take pleasure in any of this because it's horrible for everyone involved but uh it's interesting like I said like there's companies that probably won't go back into business with him right but as a comedian you know he could put a show up in the park he could put a show up anywhere he wants it's really up to him and people can protest it they can not show up they could buy tickets by the thousands it's gonna be interesting to see when he takes that part of his earning in that part of his life in his own hands you really can't stop him yeah um in that way uh it's like it's how you frame I don't think I don't think Louie's a bad guy at all I think what Louie is is a pervert and I think he's you know he's into I think part of it is like being naughty in doing something that's forbidden and you know in getting away with it and having these girls like him for being a comedian and then doing that to them I mean this is my speculation there's a lot of weirdness to it but I don't think that he's like an angry person and I don't think he's trying to be hurtful I don't think any of that was yeah I think it's just terrible judgment everything I mean you could say a lot about it that's fucked up but it's like what it is is not he's not like he's not trying to hurt people I think he's just fucking weird no no I mean let's like think about what it is he's asking can I jerk off in front of you like it's the whole I mean it's like yeah when it comes to that kind of creepy shit is like the most considerate way to approach it mm-hmm can I joke off in front of you he's like literally asking adorable not diminishing the effect it would have on a woman who respects it yeah once you know she just thinks he's our friend and next thing you know he's got a dick out like I get it yeah I'm not that's not what I'm saying it's a weird thing because you don't want you those women were obviously very hurt and there's degrees of like oh they texted this or they said that to go out and do that to somebody in a powerful position and come out and say it and know that you're gonna get hate from the world you they were they were in a place that they were hurt enough that they felt that they had to say something and do something sure and you just want like on this personal level you want them to be okay right you want everybody to be okay you want them to be okay and feel like they had justice and coming out being brave enough to come out and say something well you also want to protect people from that happening again Yeah right right the only way one of the only ways it's like you gotta kind of you know this and there was there is a there's definitely a feeling you know the comedy world is like separate and we're kind of like you know it's a crazy environment and nightclub kind of a thing and what you heard when these once these women came out was no this is kind of inappropriate yeah that girls women can can't come into a club and just feel okay like they have to field all this stuff and guys hitting on them all the time like it kind of made you look at the scene and be like all right maybe this scene could be cleaned up a little bit as well well it's like what I was saying about really a worse version of working out at a gay gym so I get right if you go to a gay gym and you see men leer at you right get that feeling that these guys want have sex you and you definitely don't wanna have sex with them yeah that is how women feel all the time yeah and you and you coming to the comedy store wherever and you're trying to just start out as a comic and try it that's such a big thing already yeah and then you throw a whole nother layer on it that everyone's hitting on you from the doorman to the headline yeah that's got to be a big thing and it's like so I think that those women should feel good that it it definitely they should he made an impact they should know that they've been heard yeah and that they they shined a light on something that even people that were in it men that were in it were unaware of yeah they were definitely heard it's it's very difficult for people to consider really objectively consider other people's perspectives like really yeah you the people consider it in a convenient way like you know like they know what they can get away with but they do they really consider how the other person feels and things yeah and you know and that's on both sides it's hard there's inconsiderate women is inconsiderate men and then you know we both do it to each other and then people develop bad traits and bad associations with the opposite sex it's a very common thing that people do mm-hmm but I think situations where the discussion is so emotionally-charged like this mm-hmm it's good for us it's good for us yeah it allows the this this public discourse it allows this public discussion of it yeah and and there hasn't been like you know people that have gotten hurt by that have come out and said it like in our scene where they're like nice people and they've been attacked it's very few yeah but it was like hey there's some big important people in this scene and they're acting inappropriately and then you know you're right I think it's good it's definitely woken up and moved it further right I have a funny daughter I know you have a funny daughter who knows if they see our life and want to go pursue it you want them to be able to go to a club and not have to deal with a whole nother it's enough when you're starting out to get five minutes of good material and to get the audience to like you and get the respect of your peers then you got to have worry about someone following you in the in the parking lot I have a friend of mine whose comic and she got hit on by this other guy was a comic who shall remain nameless and she showed me some attacks that he sent her and I was like holy shit okay he said one of them was like I'm the only one that can make you cum or something fucking crazy a good jeez yeah it's okay bro yeah so then it comes down to okay so these women were heard obviously it's created a movement you know but it then it becomes a on the other side it becomes about but did this man's was he punished enough well and do we have control over whether or not he's allowed to come back as an audience oh like for a woman like the the thing about a guy being angry with you it carries that threat of physical danger mm-hmm you know that's a different thing I know I was thinking I was on a lake the other day and I was thinking about that fine line at the end of the night in a bar those meathead guys were trying to like hit on girls and when it doesn't work they decide they're just gonna fight instead and lusby know that they're gonna fight guys right like that's a that's a fine line between I mean they're both almost violent acts it's like aggressively hitting on women I mean like it's not gonna happen screw it I don't like the way that guys been looking I think it's just frustration but you know it's rated but it but for looking at a male doing that like it is an aggressive this is an aggressive animal here yeah any one manatee could have been I could have said yes and brought him home with me well I said no and now he's punching that guy in the park yeah don't get laid they try to hit on girls and they just beat the shit out of each other yeah it seems like it seems like it happens all the time well this section my body and you could be down you know when you're walking down the even in the village you're walking down the street there's just like an angry frat group of guys just like like raging drunk you know they were trying to get laid admittance earlier yeah male angst my points my point being that there's men are formidable creatures gross yeah and they're big and they're hairy and there's why the seven billion people cause men are gross and the chute loads into each other but shooting loads and the people especially at your weightlifting gym I had a friend I had a gay friend in in New York and that was the name of that gym there David Barton or something like that what David Barton it's like some kind of health club in New York okay it was it was uh it was mostly gay men and my my friend said he said no you don't understand it's really I mean it's to the point where when you're at work working out on a machine there are pin lights that come right down on your bicep like they're the lighting is made to make you look sexier well you're working out he said it was the greatest gym of all time they have like specific kind of lighting to keep I was Ross to it sure yeah I was on a curling machine right now there'd be a light that came from the ceiling like that hits where your bicep to make the shadows make them yeah peaks look bigger yeah yeah so it's about sex yeah you're working out yeah well if you go to a regular gym you see people hitting on each other all the time yeah yeah of course where is that it David Barton gym the one in Chelsea Dumbo's sexy what is that it looks like a bar what is that oh that's a machine those are cardio machines yep yeah Oh weird sex is a weird thing it is for sure well it's even weirder when it's packaged with advertising and sleekness and music and and then you see it in real life and people sex sells baby and then on this social media and everyone's sticking their ass out and you know it's like there's so much going on yeah so much we're so over stimulated with sexual imagery do you feel like you'll be grateful and you're old and your sex drive is gone no be almost dead then sad no bad it's about being an asshole and it's also about the the shit roll the dice that you get if you're physically unattractive what's difficult to get someone who's attracted to you yeah that's hard - that is hard it's that is an inescapable reality of some people's bodies yes some people were just they have bad genetics yeah and then they must be insanely frustrating that's got to be frustrating yeah but then you gotta just find someone else it's funny looking and then you don't want them make yourself want anymore to hit on you the way she hit on Michael Douglas do you know that people are mad that someone's playing the Elephant Man but that they're an able-bodied person this is them the most recent PC uproar that they hired an able-bodied actor to play the Elephant Man well how many Elephant men are in the Actors Guild it's exhausting it's exhausting keeping up with everything yeah every everything is outrageous everything yeah well this is the time like you said like getting outraged and discussions and then it'll kind of come back to a normal structure things in Elephant Man remake criticized by disability charity but you know what this is do you know you need a good actor yeah there's you just can't be happy and by the way here's the thing notice respect to the disability charity but a lot of these disability charities criticized this just so that they can highlight their charity and it's very good for the charity if they criticize things right because it makes people aware of it it becomes a big public story and then they get donations yeah it's not bad got to consider the source I mean they're probably just artists trying to make the film and you know who knows if they're good people then you know that they're gonna respect it no no need disability person in their person with disabilities to play a person with disabilities period you piece of shit but isn't that what actually shut the fuck up and let people of disability speak but I thought acting was pretending something that you're not first people of color speak then women of color then women then gay lesbian straight trans bisexual asexual intersexual then you you fucking white male bred painted piece of shit I just make bread leave me out of all of your crazy sex condom know what's going on with all you guys do you want to be an ally or not you son of a bitch look I'm just trying to show you the best cupcakes in New York Oh what are you doing in LA you get into film in LA yeah we did vetoes we did Vito's pizza where'd you go where's Vito's pizza dough's pizza right by Largo between Largo and is a good comedy store so good really this guy there's a good pizza place the best pizza in LA I'm telling you how good he came from New Jersey his name is Vito he's got a sourdough startups in the water no he says it's not about the water that's a farce he goes you just have to know what you're doing he does have good ingredients his crust is impeccable because he knows how to make the dough really yeah this guy's water and he's lying about it now Vito's the real deal feetoes got trucks of water in his backyard he's not telling nobody that looks so good so good if I was gonna go off my diet I would be that meatball so oh so good caddy looks very good as well mm-hmm everything this guy makes this amazing if you literally smell like my grandmother's have no levy toe you motherfucker I'm in ketosis over I got a fucking do this to me Vito come on Joe and you're off it and we're at the store will go to Vito's it's literally down the street I'm on it right now on the strip I go on and off I go on it for a few months I'll go a few months months yeah all right I mean I mean occasionally I have a cheat day so I'll it'll knock me out of ketosis for a few hours and knock me back just a few hours yeah right now I mean you would call it mild ketosis if you look at my piss trip I put it up on my Instagram uh-huh there's a chart it shows you like the darkest to the lightest oh yeah yeah I'm in like mid several been on it for five days days how do you feel I always feel good yeah I get used to doing it I'm used to it right so weird seems like I'm not on that spectrum and all it's cuz it dried out a little bit before I put it up - what happens if you eat a slice of Vito's it'll knock me down to that negative uh-huh there's nothing that quickly I would call that my slice yeah I'll call it I'm somewhere in the range of moderate moderate ketosis moderate but again that I pissed on it and I let the strip sit for a little bit and it dried and it looks a little weird it's disgusting anyway wait what it does for me though it's very good for my appetite and cognitive benefits like feel feels clear yeah yeah that's interesting I think there's a certain amount of fog that comes with carbohydrate consumption too much yeah well carbohydrate consumption in general and when you when you eat carbohydrates post carbohydrate consumption is a like a lack of mental clarity like a down turn of the way your brain function know what I call that sweet nap time happy yeah sweet sweet nap time nap time well you and I contrast in many ways my friend I try and dial it in yeah I don't eat this stuff all the time but you know yeah but hey look you loved it I do love nothing wrong with it I was a celebration of life and one of my favorite dishes on planet earth is linguine with clams when I want to go off when I was in Italy I was in Italy a couple weeks ago oh yeah where'd you go I eat it everyday Ravello Ravello yeah Amalfi Coast Oh Capri we took a boat to Capri and we ate there and this is fucking phenomenal food the food was outrageous like so fresh clams with the sardines man fillets sardine fillets with in olive oil so the best oh my god good everything but it was interesting they were Valentin Thomas who was a professional spear Fisher person she was on the other day and she was saying that the oceans in that area are completely over fished really yeah that's like it's almost impossible for a regular person to go there and catch a fish that's terrible over fished everything it's such a bummer being alive now it's such a bummer that every everywhere you go it's always the end of whatever it's the end of the coral reef it's the end of these animals running through the woods the end of yeah it's such a bummer you know like even like I tried to show my kids like nice nature videos like I used to watch with my dad and everyone at the end is like but this is going away just like it sucks some of it is going away yeah I mean it's it's how you look at it it's like we're definitely in a unsustainable path mm-hmm right in terms of just what we're doing agriculturally if you if you talk to farmers and you appreciate this what they do with large-scale agriculture you're not supposed to grow food in the same plot of land for a fucking 50-year corn and just constantly soy throwing minerals on the ground and constantly growing and then you get these mineral e deficient plants right you know they're just not the same and it's just not it's not good for you nuts yeah the only thing it's good for is like deer because deer can come by and eat all your your corn want you get a high population of deer in the area you're not supposed to eat you nuts was a feed cattle corn either no it has also like wildlife is supposed to exist in like wildlife habitat which is like forests and grasslands and meadows right and some Sun fed fed plants yeah they're supposed to be wandering around eating all these things they're not supposed to be existing in these massive thousand acre corn fields is so good it's just weird it's there You've like white-tailed deer to a certain extent this country have become like farm animals they're a weird farm animal that's not an offense right they're just always around farms just eating farm food yeah you're like my friend Doug had this interesting thought about that he was like these are he goes my cows are eating grass because he has a farm barn the cows are eating those the cows are natural right there or three in grass my deer are eating GMO corn and also the deer that are on my property that is a wild the wild animals are not organic that's weird it's so crazy so eating something that's totally unnatural for them to eat which is GMO corn corn is everywhere and it's GMO corn right because he's growing this corn them outside yeah it's like Monsanto corn right so he's growing this Roundup fucking sprayed corn he's deer eating it's a bizarre deer yeah but yet the cows that are in captivity are grazing naturally on grass and they're a hundred percent organic Shea's it's weird weird weird I was reading that that the whole fertilizer thing that we weren't able to get nitrogen out of the air until this one scientist did it fritz haber fritz haber yeah those the same guy who created Zyklon yes a Nazi right no no he was a Jew I was a Jew was a Jew in Germany and he was there took it well in World War one he was the guy who created the gas that they used to spray on the Allies and he actually at the same time he created the Habra method for extracting nitrogen right in the atmosphere which led to they think that the nitrogen in people's there's a great radio lab podcast on it i think it's called the bad show and it shows how sometimes good people also do horrible things right and Fritz Haber was one of the ones that they they highlighted but when he was when they were going to give him the Nobel Prize for creating the hopper method for extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere than write the air around us is 80% nitrogen but you couldn't get it out right couldn't get it out he figured out how to get like when we breed we think we breathing in oxygen mostly it's mostly nitrogen and then some oxygen uh-huh and he figured out how to get it out and turn it into fertilizer and use it and unsoiled and really increased radically the amount of food that people are able to grow he also at the same time figured out how to spray gas on on the troops so they wanted him for crimes against humanity they wanted him for war crimes at the same time they were gonna give him the Nobel Prize oh my god and then they used his gas for the family on his family check this out and his extended family because he created Zyklon gas but he puts on Zyklon a there's a smell that they attached to it so that you were aware of when the gas was present so like if you were working with it if there was a leak it was a very obvious smell the Nazis took Zyklon a and removed that smell and turned to the cyclone B which they used to spray the the people in the concentration camp Jews and his family got called his some of his extended family was killed with the very gas that he created oh my god yeah and then he died he was exiled from Germany the whole thing was horrible like his he was a Jew and so he tried to stand up for Jews as scientists and his people and it was like slowly getting pushed out as the Nazis were taking control oh my god and then he want to believe in the country and he dutifully had he had terrible health right and he died like he was going to Switzerland for treatment he didn't want up dying she's a little did his wife kill herself wife shot himself shot herself in the chest in in in front of well it was him and his son and he left his 13 year old son with his dead wife and then went back to war oh my god yeah she did it because because he was killing people yes all of his gases used right he was she was apparently gravely she was a scientist as well oh my she was gravely upset at the direction that his science had taken that he he was involved in this new thing I mean command you're the architect of this new method of killing mass extermination right but then here's the the other problem that's my crazy story it's crazy but but what is what does that mean like he's too good at killing people oh we don't believe in killing people by having them choke together to death on the fluid in their lungs it's built up because of poison we would rather you take a bullet to the dick like you were in war I can experience and that's okay but the gas is not okay like we have rules right we're supposed to kill the right way we're dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs that are completely indiscriminate wipe out entire cities kill hundreds of thousands of people in one blast yeah that's okay but that's clean gas that gas is dirty you're an asshole to use the gas bro terrible stories weird it's a very terrible story it's a weird story yeah so then he created so they took that and that's where fertilizer came from you know where he went wrong he was trying to fund the war effort by extracting gold from the ocean he was convinced that just like his hobby method of extracting nitrogen from the air he was gonna be able to because the ocean has gold in it a very small amounts of gold but he felt like if you could get it all together it would be a large amount and he could extract that gold from the ocean and then use it to fund the war effort sounds like you and I have a treasure once the bread shows done the gold show with Tom and Joe the harbor gold process is unique for several reasons it effectively is capable of yielding extraction efficiencies with complex ores in the high 90% range with gold purity in the 99% range pre-processing prior to process we carefully analyze the ore for the content of other minerals and/or constituents so is this is this something they actually use see maybe they usually yeah I think they use it for other things other than gold cyanide limited assignment video he was a genius yes but I don't the gold thing didn't pan out wink wink it didn't work but he apparently worked on that for years and years and just never ran into fruition well that was his failure but his big success he felt like he was gonna recreate the nitrogen method with the gold method right like figure out another way to just be a hero for Germany amazing an amazing story crazy what so now we're left with corn being fed to cows yeah yeah it is awful but here's the thing you know as I read about that stuff and you know you read about this it's such an unnatural thing that we're doing to the cattle to feed them this corn into Alisa but are we at a point where where there's just so many people on the planet that this is the only way you can do it or is there other ways to do it maybe like I'm gonna read you something because people are always complaining about the methane gas that's produced by cows and that was one of the big arguments that people would say with one of the reasons why people should not eat cows is because if you do eat cows like say if you're on like that carnivore diet and you're all you eat is cows it is a massive negative contribution to the environment right but Sean Baker sent me this scientific overview and it says in the environmental side of the United States the entirety of all plants and animal agriculture contributes to 9% of the total u.s. greenhouse gas emissions animal agriculture makes up about 4% and cattle specifically about 1.9 percent based on the latest EPA data if every single person in the United States gives up eating meat and went vegan and every single animal were to magically disappear the overall worldwide effect on greenhouse gas emissions would be about less than 1% difference but as I spoke with Professor Frank I say this guy's named MIT though her from UC Davis one of the world's leading authorities on greenhouse gases in animal agriculture and he said putting the blame on meat is a disservice and it distracts from the real issue of our tremendous fossil fuel utilization interesting interesting but there's a lot that goes it's not just the gas that's coming off of right it's this is the methane question right you know the the the the real concern that keeps coming up like I had this lady on yes and she's on this carnivore diet which it seems to me that she's got she had some matches massive autoimmune issues like had a hip replacement she was 17 her ankle replaced like a mass of arthritis issues and she's on this diet of all meat and several other people on this diet as well they're calling it the carnivore diet experiencing at least for the short term they're experiencing these tremendous benefits right so the critics are saying you're contributing to greenhouse gases in methane you're ruining the environment by eating beef and he's saying well not really right the the amount is very small in comparison to all the other issues it's like less than 1% of the greenhouse gases but then they also hear that on that argument that it's really oily at is being used right it's it's still a carbon-based thing to transport it to support the food from the farming all the way through the transporting to getting rid of the waste to doing all of it that there's for now but Tesla's making semis you know Tesla's constructed they're constructing these gigantic super cool looking fucking tron semis and they're going to operate entirely on batteries and once that happens you have automated battery controlled trucks then I think the real problem is going to be people out of jobs that's gonna be a giant Isis even robots yeah once especially for drivers apparently for men in particular some massive number in the millions of people in this country rely on driving for a living like it's a big part of their job their drivers it's a it's a giant industry well they say that's happening now will across all industries that they're trying to figure out yeah that automation is putting so many people out of work yeah I'm gonna talk to Bernie Sanders about that are you oh yeah no way yeah I mean Bernie been emailing each other really Bernie that'd be a great one John Joe Joe I'd like to talk to that guy yeah Wow I also want to talk to other people that are proponents of universal basic income and Elon has said that he thinks that this is gonna be a real factor in the future universal basic income so this is a Tesla truck that we're looking at right now in a video which looks like rolling is anyone in that Apple Store from yesterday and Iowa they showed it off that's crazy 26 cameras on board that's so dope where's the batteries is in the bottom it's the bottom of the batteries is that driving itself really or is there someone driving them no the trailer is all batteries the price is supposed to be around two hundred thousand dollars for one of those yeah dude this is what we do we buy one of those bitches and we turn into a roving podcast to drive us across the country that would be clueless we talk shit in the back wait it's driving on its own or there is a human driving it that one had a human driving it I don't believe these are in production yet so it's prototype I can run to that is the coolest I had a gig up in a last minute gig in Yosemite it was a casino up there mm-hmm to open for Smokey Robinson Wow what was that it was the coolest but meet him I did meet him I met him once before I there's actually a cool story about about meeting him but I I was gonna take the Tesla and I ran out it I was like yeah like I was like trying to plot like do it will I be able to do it get rid of that piece no problem no problem fucker they're everywhere now a supercharger near Fresno oh yeah just plan out eight hours in advance you can pull over eight hours let your shit charge up know what a good factors in that you're only gonna be 20 minutes of charge or 30 minutes of charge I'm telling you I out of here you do stopping for 20 minutes at a time yeah well if you stop and pee and get a coffee you need a book yeah go over your Twitter feed cars out there charging it was great get a goddamn car like a man it was so great Mustang Shh need something with some rumble to it it's such a nice drive don't you have a midlife crisis or something to attend to going through the Prairie of Yosemite what if you're breaded sunrise bread shirt takes off get yourself a Corvette hey laughing you never drive a Corvette life dream dude Tony yeah he calls us he says he has Corvette confidence dude I Drive it to work it's a game changer those are some drivin to the comedy store I get fired up it's fast rumbles feels especially to the ice house it's further away I have a VW Bug that's just shut your mouth they don't ever fucking just having the engine and your shifting and the smell of gas yes something to you I'm just kidding yeah very be chemical yeah but you have an old 167 oh those are the real one yeah it's beautiful little sewing machine the back it's fine they're so light too yeah you know a lot of they've done with those they've taken those old VW bugs and put an old Porsche engine in the back now there's a lot of people doing that yeah but the bus is - yeah so they put like a hundred and seventy horsepower old Porsche engine which doesn't seem like a lot 170 horsepower is not a lot but the car weighs nothing yeah more than that yeah with the gas tank in the front of your car and you got those little tiny skinny ass tires on it - yeah over the place I think the beauty of it is that you have the original engine you're just kind of puttering along yeah but everyone gets annoyed it's like a go like a slow clown car okay you off just to get around you they just don't even want to look at you know in this day and age I mean you think about how far Tesla's are oh my god those things are unbelievably fast it's another sensation it's a it's definitely satisfying it's not that gas well but there's a feeling you just sunrise was coming up and I'm just silent no other cars around just going through this Prairie we on the beach pokey Robinson let me shop for an hour and a half to get some electricity oh I can drive for two hours now pull over how much time do you have to plan out just for charging extra five hours I spent a good day up trying to figure out my Renault but here's the Rockstar move I'd met smokey once before in New York we did a charity for kids in the arts Kid Rock Kids Rock or something kids who rock her school of rock something like that anyway I'd met him before so I was excited to take the gig and I figure I'll meet Smokey Robinson it's an outdoor arena you know it's an outdoor event and they just used me to burn time for how the Sun went down then he could come out at nighttime and so I'm sitting there with a guy that I'm just talking to and smokey comes out of you know our dressing rooms or trailers because it's outside in this gravel driveway and stuff and smokey comes out he's like 78 now he's in all red Red Jumpsuit red cool jacket red leather boots and it comes out and I'm like I'll get to say hi to smokey SUV door opens he goes right into this UV and he drives literally 20 feet so and drops him off at the stage so he could go right up onto the stage he didn't even want to get his I didn't want to get his boots dirty on the literally put him in this SUV I'm telling you from here to the end of your studio they just dropped him off and he went right up on stage like that that's smokey that is a that is a kick-ass Rockstar move that's that's if you don't want to keep your you know you only get your boots dirty it's a good move yeah comedians don't think that way no I'm walking in my dress shoes across the think yeah just get them all dirty and fucked up I feel like one of the people that way yeah right exactly we're not rock stars yeah rock stars a different thing man totally totally especially that that kind of smooth this guy's been a rock star for a long time ever my parents were listening to him when they were teenagers you know oh I mean that's a long time that he's been still as the voice still has this cool moves is he like healthy yeah he can move well totally Wow he's got this really cool like does the exercise did you talk to I didn't know I would like to talk to someone that's that old that's been around for that long see what like yeah Jagger apparently is just an exercise fanatic yeah that's what I heard yeah exercise twice a day yeah and realizes like this is the only way the only way you can keep this up amazing yes I mean he's in his 70s in the way as body's gonna maintain health he's got of like consistently exercise so funny that he's next to Keith who's the total opposite way to go the miracles look at them smokey yeah Wow 1965 65 that pictures 45 already a star that's amazing God what does he look like today it was gray similar Smokey Robinson in 2018 is that him well that's Tony Bennett and Lady gaga so that's probably serious yeah that's go to that picture make that picture bigger it looks pretty goddamn good what's that good Lady Gaga looks smokin yeah she looks like she looks like somebody forget how hot she is she's in Paris born so many times told she wasn't hot like picture out of your mind you tell me you wouldn't smash you ever see those videos of her when she was like an NYU or something like doing just starting out she's super talented totally in a weird way right yeah well bury her own way yeah yeah she's amazing uh powerful smoke you rob look it's smoky yeah look we don't have any comics that are that old right now that are like reporting like what yeah once George Carlin died Carly was like our last great touring stand-up that was you know of that age from the 60s yeah no one else's like that that's still around no Joan Rivers gone Rickles gone though they were well you know who is um Bob Newhart yep still doing gigs so you take a long time off and start doing them again or something now he just would always kind of quietly do it really mm-hmm know kidding yes you know I've never seen right now you actually he was on Conan the other night and I was turnt gonna try and get tickets to see him in the Palm Desert burr and I were planning on going to see Cosby before the scandal broke oh yeah yeah we you know cuz we had we were talking to one night at the store and we had always heard like how good he is yeah gotta go see him you gotta go see him talk like Chris Rockets dude he fucking killed he killed for two hours he went on stage with no opening act yeah just walks out there and he starts talking and it starts crushing and he goes I was blown away and Chris Rock was saying this he goes I went to see I was like god damn man I'm an amateur wow we should go so bad and I were planning and something came out we had to cancel and then right after that something fucking something big came oh god that's terrible I saw Tom bill went and saw him I saw him I saw him my wife was pregnant with our first baby and we had I was doing Conan and then I was gonna have two weeks off before the baby was born that was gonna be the last gig I did we're gonna take two weeks off and just hang out before this new baby came we're living in New York and we went to see Cosby Seinfeld took us to see Cosby at Carnegie Hall Wow and we laughed for two hours it was a master class that he was so good so easy and we just laughed forever and went home and her water broke oh wow yeah we always felt like that all that laughing kind of made her water break but it was uh it was definitely impressive impressive you know it was impressive about it he would tell these stories and build the build it without laughs there would be like very few laughs for like ten minutes as he's telling the story and you didn't realize even as a comic that he was building this tension so when the laughs did come it was bigger than any laugh you've ever heard I mean he would just it was the building of it he's the confidence to not feel like he had to go from laughs - laughs - laughs every 30 seconds he would just let it build let and then it would pop boom it would explode whenever these recordings of him later in life like before the scandal broke like when he was in his 70s before like because I think now it would be impossible like if you go to see him I know he's not performing now but if he was it would be impossible I wouldn't want to go it's like so gross and so tainted and so yeah it's a shame it's like you have easi you'd have to watch him almost like a scientist and observe him before I wonder if it would think about it too like now if you watch even if he wants to recording you'd be watching it thinking I wonder if he right now in the back of his mind he's like holy shit I'm a rapist and they don't know I know you know I mean I haven't looked at anything that he's done since then I mean you know it's that was it's such a look he was trying to make a public relations comeback last year mm-hmm he did see if you find find a video of Bill Cosby holding court in a barber shop in Philly he was at a barber shop in Philly and they were talking about jazz musicians and like he was like giving them like you're giving them trivia questions he's barbershop jazz musicians then I was reading the comments and the comments were like we love you bill we believe you bill you know those accusers are assholes okay yes look at this give me some volume told me when I said this I said doctor take my shower yeah wipe the shower down I don't want the water running on the towel I don't want the mildew I want to let this travel to be clean and dry when I get out of it then I obviously surveyed in lobbyists may be with me probably but obviously you live alone yes so you have to clean up as my father would say behind you yes yes all right Julie when I was married I did the same thing looks really all independently take y'all yes good beyond the eyes are only unanimous what they when they left but they was independently they it's weird to watch him cuz this is life as well he's wearing that hello friend he kept he would wear that on stage yes sweaters that say hello friend he started saying that cloak dressing up on stage was a crutch so sometimes he would come out with just like his Birkenstocks and just take them off he'd just be in his socks he thought that being dressed up was like putting on too much of a show that you should rely purely on with spoken word of it well I mean I don't I certainly don't buy I don't buy you telling other people how they should do it everything I mean there's there's a bunch of ways to do it well of course if he wants to be comfortable on stage where a hello friend sweatshirt well he's fine but he was big at telling people how they're supposed to live right I mean what that was going to marry me that's so ironic about it cuz Eddie Murphy first of all would go on stage with fucking leather jumpsuits on yeah like bright red jumpsuits unzipped down to the navel yeah and then Cosby would attack him because he dropped that bombs but meanwhile yeah bro so gross so gross well hypocrites man I know strange like that kind of a hypocrite like telling you how to live your life while the raping people and how crazy how many women had to come out before it started to fall crazy that Hannibal started all off right Hannibal Hannibal just did a show somewhere and talked about it on stage and somebody recorded it yeah and then people like wait Bill Cosby raped people yeah you didn't hear Wow spreads through the culture but how crazy that like it didn't take just one woman saying he raped right it had to be like 16 well he had settled a bunch of a bunch of cases like he settled them and closed this you know close the story you know honey sealed the record yeah not exposure million really yeah and now he's suing one of the women who's testifying against him because she's violating the payment Oviatt right yeah dark so sick of everybody else's sex the hello friend is a nod to his son that was murdered it's a like memorial to him oh right yeah there's that article I just found from a long time ago like 1993 that he made a jazz album dedicated to him called hello friend did they ever find who killed his son and why yeah I think they did you like his car broke down right yeah like by the four or five or something yeah and he was like getting out to fix it and someone killed him was it uh was it just a random crime or was it a robbery I think it was it was robbery attempted say yeah robbery attempt did he have a nice car or something he had a Mercedes so terrible what a tragedy an American tragedy he's an American tragedy got up across the board high bottom he was so beloved and that's got Albert and the Cosby Show and the stand-up and the strangest things I'm hearing that guy call him dr. Cosby yeah dude you ain't a doctor anymore yeah they think they all took him they took that shit back everyone yeah was an honorary Doctorate right Yeah right from different schools temple and yeah nasty honorary Doctorate would you call yourself dr. papa yeah would you I'm now I'm a minister are you me too I'm doing Rachel Feinstein sweating she find steel sweat up and sit next Saturday shot the fuck oh my fourth one really you've done for yeah that's beautiful I marry people congratulations yeah it's a good thing yeah it's uh it's really great I actually do really love it it becomes very real very fast you know I spend a lot of time writing it and but once you're up there and two people are coming and you're doing it it's like mmm no this is a big deal this is special this is gonna be unique and divorced it's pretty great and that becomes a disaster I had no one that I married his divorce oh maybe get the magic touch bro yeah maybe you're the secret stop in the divorce rate of 50 percent in America that's right put a Chris Rock I would joke goes he goes and that's just the people who have the balls to leave cowards who stay and suffer this is Chris this is Chris before he was divorced was just kind of oh really because once he got divorce like he got taken oh really hey I don't think he had a prenup so he went down hard he was on stage he goes he goes my wife made more money last year doing comedy than Dave Chappelle great line it's really rough from comedies Louise tough times out there for people gotta be funny just to enjoy your life yeah make some bread make some bread with your family well sticky buns why not you doing your show we did eight oh eight and did you have any say over what cities you chose yeah where'd you go yeah we went to New York we went to Detroit Los Angeles New Orleans Cleveland Philly all good places nice all good we go in you just meet these bakers these people that are baking stuff and making amazing stuff we do like four or five stops in each city and they're all just great people they're just fun families just you know making cakes and feeding the community and it's great and you do them like with your friends in these towns like if you knew comedians that were in the town did you have him come with you no just you and this major staff again came in New York cranks to this donut shop but he was the only friend that came this season but I'd like to do more of that that would be fun now you're friends with Seinfeld uh-huh and he's a crazy Porsche fanatic yeah try to get you to buy a Porsche big-time for it no no he kind of like knows I'm not really that big of a car guy have you ever driven one I did he let me drive one one time because I've never driven it it was like a million-dollar car blue nine something s and it was just in traffic around Santa Monica oh it was really a bummer so annoying yeah it's a million-dollar car yeah Jesus yeah what is a million-dollar car the same as another car but they only made one of it I was in an older car yeah I was like from the 70s I think or 80s and it just they'd only made like this was like the second one or something but uh no it's like if I was into it you'd get on me and stuff but but you only feel it around Santa Monica like if you if you get an open road it would be amazing yeah do you have a Porsche oh you do I got a racecar I felt I've seen that at the store whoo that's not what you drove that three five six it's not no Sun a million dollar car and that speedsters on a million dollar car I was probably a 911 ass it was blue hmm it's probably a 911s from the 70s it was worth a lot of money right now I'm not an RS oh yeah yeah like that one that he's got above scroll let's go down that white one the white one oh that they couldn't get me country for a while right white one the white one right there there you go yeah that one Wow that's a very valuable car yeah that's a I asked for an RS from that's funny woman backs in some cherries did she three point three five three point three five what million yeah jeez oh my god yeah well you know when Mustangs are going for five hundred thousand well it says no no Jimmy it says worth between $14,000 and three point three five million for right yeah so what some lady's just backing up the car what's a big deal that one in the right hand corner is a million dollar car below that that's spider upper right hand that one right there that's a nine eighteen is that the one you drove yeah it looks like that okay yeah that's a nine eighteen that's the electric is that you Tom papa look it looks like me it's that is a that is an amazing car that's a 918 hybrid that wasn't it ridiculously fast car but you that's not interesting to you amazing that's just a Boxster no I I get into it I just don't know all this you know you gotta spend time like digesting that or growing up with it and I didn't have that you know I liked it I appreciate it I had a nine forty nine forty four poster and my car in my in my room I remember those yeah an engine yeah and those were you know what those weren't like the the best Porsches but that's what I kind of like that cool car excited about yeah they're very well balanced oh yeah I drove those on a racetrack oh yeah I used to race those nice yeah because it's like it's a very balanced car right he's so deep into it he's like his thing it kind of keeps him sane I think it's just that's where he puts his him and you know the extra time stuff yeah it's kind of funny that they both are doing car things let us shows good have you seen it I was on it oh you were on it yeah what are you doing my 1965 Corvette oh yeah wrong Corvette yeah I have a 65 Corvette that's a what you call a restomod so the what they do is they take an old car but they put modern suspension and brakes and a modern engine in it okay so it's reliable it starts up every time it breaks really well and the car guys think that that's not pure so it's not as good just like what it's like to drive an old car and to keep it old it's to me like okay good luck with that you have a good time brakes the Braun do they make it so it breaks better yeah definitely do that can they make it so it handles better yeah they can Oh what would I want to do Doug that's not how they do what am i in the flintstone days no brakes just give me a hole so I just take my feet at the bottom but but they get snobby about that stuff they can fuck off it's knobby there's a guy right he lives up the street from me yeah I had my car and I was washing it and he pulled by with the same exact car but his was like totally stock and he looked at mine and immediately he could tell like you looked at the wheels I was giant fat steamroller tires on it and I mean it's just modern everything is and he looked at the wheels he's like that's not stock I go no not stock and you can see he's like shaking his head he's like what do you got in the hood I go it's a supercharged LS one

airplane hangar yeah filled with huge it's like a museum it's the craziest shit I've ever seen I didn't know like I knew he had a bunch of cars I didn't know and so when I went down I was wandering around like holy shit yeah maybe he took my father and I through it let my father come after I did this Tonight Show and he was so nice I brought my father around and he was just blown away I mean it's you go through like miles and miles of cars things like you want to see the motorcycles what then you go into a whole nother place and there's a just filled with bikes he drives everything in there it takes everything in there on the road everything's street-legal hey I'm gonna take the steamroller it takes a fucking steamroller with like rubber on the tires there it is right there yeah in those fucking garage it's a crazy place it's so crazy it's gorgeous all the stuff on the walls all the memorabilia is insane yeah it is gorgeous and he has a shop he has like full people their mechanics working on the stuff yeah with 3d printers making the tools pieces and yeah he can literally make spare parts think of machine things look at that all from card on you had him on right yeah he's great he was great it's so interesting hearing him swear right like the people if you never heard the Jay Leno episode go listen to some fucking insane stories about doing gigs for the mob oh really yeah about the mob guys like yelling at priests and like how intense it was oh really yeah it's been around a lot of gigs he's done a lot of gigs he makes all of his all of his money for all the cars all comes from comedy I know his Tonight Show money all went to the bank is that insane it's crazy what are you doing with all that money bro it's insane Tonight Show for how many years yeah he refused to spend a dime of it threw it all in the bank no kids no kids just gave all that money just shooting loads into his car is that amazing often comedy look at that yeah he that front of that car is filled up with all his backed up come to that engine did you say what runs on jizz when that card that card oh no I'm not a car guy but that's weird right he takes that around with him imagine that Lee just back it up into man it was so it was on my Twitter I'm arguing at people that Trump I saw Jay once when I was in traffic on the cold water I just see this man you know it's all backed up from both ways it's just tons of traffic I see this man like running down the center of the traffic like who's this nut and it was Jay going he goes past the car picks up his hubcap that came off and goes running back together away he probably has to get that hubcaps probably no other hubcap like exactly yeah look oh my god that guy with him some dude oh that's rich he make rich rich Richie skinny tires are the fucking thing oh my god it's so weird it's a good show it's a great show yeah so much better for him than The Tonight Show in that he gets to be who he is yeah completely 100% so passionate about cars he fucking loves car he knows everything about them yeah he loves it well that's that's 73 Mazda that guy was actually there while I was there he was the next one we filmed my episode he was waiting to he's got this crazy 73 Mazda that's like fucking super souped-up really light to see what he rolled I heard he rolled it see that video what did he roll he rolled I think it was like a truck Seinfeld's rolled one of his cars yeah kind of like a baby roll Seinfeld had a baby roll yeah I think the hospital off the off-ramp no I don't think it was a big deal really yeah thinking once the hospital thank you almost died no oh there he goes yeah look at that oh it's just a car oh that's a Chevelle what is that superbee it's hard to tell what that is you got it oh Jesus can you hear it his reaction was funny at the end whoa that old dude shouldn't be driving yeah that's kind of the vibe that you got Jay was like all right I mean it literally one two what if that guy killed Jay Leno my name is too old to drive oh yeah geez that seemed like it was a while ago it was several years ago I think Wow it's that crazy 2016 that's when this video was put up yeah oh wow he gets out okay losing an old Barracuda it's tough to tell what that car is what is that yeah there's an old Barracuda oh wow that's the first model Barracuda which is a totally different looking car than the second generation Wow no body styles different as a weird-looking car they're cool though yeah it's good to have an obsessive hobby it's good and light yeah right even if you work hard and do all this stuff there's still extra time to put your energy into something yeah you know for me it's imperative yeah I figured that out over the years of my life like for me I need mine once in the comments that they just edited tomatoes look worse I'm trying to I was replaying that's really wait a minute play that by now everyone play it back for us sorry some people said they saw the unedited footage hold on dude again do it from the beginning looks longer goes guys shifting here's the flip oh he hit a wheel engine horsepower no way more than a hundred horsepower let me see this guy one way to know that they said of the same club back yeah so that's it landed that way mMmmm yeah I think that's true I think they're probably telling the truth I think that thing probably flipped once whatever whatever once it's rough it's hard to get something to flip a bunch of times like you got to be really flying to flip a bunch of times flip once but tie all the energy would be dissipated by the time you hit bang bang bang you know be careful out there kids yeah don't especially with those old-ass cars especially old-ass cars with old suspensions that's why I juice my shit up with modern stuff yeah take that a vandal neighbor asshole you fucking old dried fucking tires those old tires yeah no II tread you need a hobby you need stuff there's it's amazing like you could do all this work in like really hardcore your career and there's still extra time well not just that I think doing one thing only all the times not good for the brain I think it's good for the brain to be excited by a bunch of different things interesting I think it makes you more unique person makes more interesting with as a comic is I think is a very important yeah it's very important to have a more nuanced perspective ready to also have more information to draw from yeah like you're experiencing more different parts of life and also different types of failure I think different types of failure is good for you absolutely we know failure mental failure complication fail you so I think all that stuff is good for something off you're not good at yeah it's amazing yes it's amazing how many times you will feel like a beginner back at the same thing you've been practicing like you're making changes that you're like I'm kind of back to the beginning of this again what do you do other than the baking the baking is the biggest thing the baking is like it's really like my first hobby I never really had something like that yeah I put all my time into is always just stand up Wow and then and then the baking and now I'm writing more than ever before so I'm like writing sitting down writing concentrated for long periods are you writing comedy or just writing writing it depends you know I have that I'm the head writer for life from here the Prairie Home Companion thing and is that Garrison Keillor yeah they kicks him out right the new thing well he quits he retired before he got in trouble he retired a couple of years before oh he did yeah and that's why the but once he got in trouble that's when the me and the getting in trouble thing was before he even retired like it was no incident from beau yes yes yes yeah it was an old thing it was a kind of a muddled thing very weird yeah but then you know but when I had said that on the podcast that it was weird and then he just kind of hugged to check and his hand went down her back then someone sent me an article that there was more than one incident yeah several of them and then you know he had been and they didn't make them public and yeah I don't even know what they were but I know they had to they did investigate it right but they had to end up changing the name of it so anyway and I spend a lot of time writing for that then it went really from writing my book and then I got that gig so I continued writing at that pace and and now I'm you know continuing to write like that so I'd the writing is that is kind of it's weird because it's from doing stand-up writing this is almost seems like something new it almost seems like another hobby another different way to exercise your mind yeah it's different it's different sitting there and like writing stuff out like really parsing at it but it does make me think like and I haven't been able to crack it of like why not put that effort of that intense writing style into the standup you don't do that no oh I'm looser with it I'll write it and then I'll go perform it and then I'll come back and edit it but that Carlin did that at the end he would just write the whole thing and memorize it you know he would like like a book and then go present it I haven't gotten I haven't done that no no what I do is um I do two things one I write premises in word and then I have a program called Scrivener and what Scrivener does is it lets me take things into Prem into categories or into subjects so I have like like I have a title of a set I'll call it like my last special is called the one that's coming out it's called strange times and huh so I wrote strange times at the top of it and then I have all these different subjects in strange times right and then I can move them around I can shift them and each time I click on one it takes me to all the stuff that I've written about that subject and then I also can click on another little part of it and it shows me a cork board and on the cork board there's like these mujhko virtual index cards uh-huh and so of the index cards that I can move around each index card has like notes on different parts this is a very important part of the bit this is a this is a note about a study that was done that shows this is real all these different things and so I can move all those around but this way I can look at it in the little tiny on the side where all each individual individual subject is all in this one long column uh-huh and I can see like the set like this is a whole set right but then but no matter what it has to be really ironed out in front of an audience because right I can write as much as I want and a lot of is effective writing alone but it comes to life in front of an audience and changes yeah yeah change but how much will you write before you bring it out like will you ready a couple pages and do it or just little depends you know sometimes it's thousands of words for a couple minute bit and you'll take that up before you've tried it you'll write a thousand yeah couple thousand words yeah sometimes and sometimes it's just a few lines right and then I just run with a premise sometimes I'll just try to try to air a premise out and see where it goes yeah this is one that I'm working on right now that I just have so the the the set up of the premise gets a really big laughs and then I don't know where to go with it okay and then I'm fucking around with it I'm trying to figure out where where to go with my oh there's something there and I'm not gonna let it go yeah but every day I throw a little bit of water on it and I hope to see the sprouts yeah you know if you've got a great premise there's there is a great joke there there's something there definitely but it's one of those ones where I know okay I can't let this go you know there's something there but right now it ain't shit gonna take a while the only one that believes him is yeah yeah I know it's amazing it's so funny host writing something about a raccoon the other day I saw a coon with their hands and I was as I was writing about it I was like wait a minute and I looked through my notes and it's like I thought I had a really good raccoon bit about a year ago the audience told me this wasn't very good and I ended up quitting on it and now I'm like I'm back with my new wreck it's just sometimes you have to let it go and then walk around it look at it from the air and then walk around it look at it from the side hey Mel and then maybe sometimes something happens and you go off my fucking raccoon Tom puppets ready four o'clock time flies oh my god I'm not crazy oh fuck bro I know when I was coming here I was like I don't know if I got three hours in me today that's the last thing you
