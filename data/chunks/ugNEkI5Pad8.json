the Joe Rogan experience speaking of I don't know what we're speaking of but how we need to talk about Kanye just Oh Jamie's got crazy Kanye conspiracy theories / theories well first so first of all he's like he came out for Trump recently sort of he wore a make America great hat on but he also called Trump a bald thief lisent Li - he did yeah yeah well yeah he called him a bald crook or alcalde Kanye is a lunatic yo so I could care less what he says Amy loves Jamie sleeps with a picture of Kanye it's a pendant with a picture with his picture in it Jamis a big fan of two things nuclear weapons and Trump loves nuclear bombs and he loves physics class yeah here's here's here's what I like I well Kanye's a lunatic but I do like Candace Owens who is also new on the scene in my Fox News world you love that I love you have conservatives well and Candace is just like she I walked in from work the other day and I was like started listening to Fox News is on course I'm watching I'm like who the hell is this you say Fox News is on of course cuz Fox News just blaring propaganda through your house all the time yeah switch it up like have like CNN on the back now Fox News on and then I watch it I do watch CNN Alex Jones says 200 1:30 p.m. to watch him for Wars exclusive on Kenya skandhas and Kanye now exclusive I don't it didn't happen ever you like alive what is he gonna say featuring Candice and Kanye so I want to lump them in together but is he talking about them yes but everyone thought they were gonna be on this show together didn't happen for a Wars exclusive he probably called them Kanye it's Alex Jones I could care less that Kanye says I like what Candice says you chop one of my legs off and it's me versus him to the battle of the death I'm one of that fight tens I have 10 times out of 10 so you wish the fight kept going hundred percent yeah it's a weird way to stop a fight too when a guys not taking damage he's just got a leg that's not working properly well the problem was to you know he owns he basically called timeout and asked for the doctors to come in once you've done that the fights over I think I think the ref literally thought you know he should have just called the fight right your leg was broken or something like what it was his thought process I guess and then and then the doctors came in and then they started feeling around and they're like you know they're like right here I think his tibias fractured I can feel the bone I'm like doc I promise you just get out of here let me let me fight I got a current I got a ank a calf cramp or something I was like you don't just lie into him I just get out of here let me let me go I promise it's fine I don't feel a thing it's not hurt I'm good and then they stopped the fight and they pulled the stool to pull the stool for me to do so remember that oh yeah that's right what was that about that was my Commissioner that was that was New York Athletic Commission at its best like pull the stool then I fell in and then a bunch of people were like hey man did they call the fight because they hate they thought you couldn't stand and I said no I hope not because that would've been very unfortunate because I fell on national TV got Charlie Brown he felt like all Three Stooges Moe Larry Curly thanks for nothing doc yeah why did they pull a stool it was I don't know a mistake I think I stood up I think I stood up I was like hey maybe if I get the crowd into it maybe these guys will get out of here and let the fight go so I like stood up and I was like let's go you know and I'm sitting on the stool and I'm freaking looked at him just and I was like you better hope they don't let me off this stool boy so I'm gonna come break your face you know and then I stand up and then he pulls the stool and then a second later I'm on my butt exits cameras run off with 660 million in ICO earnings see this is like what you were saying about the Nigerian people getting online and them not knowing certain scams and them get it's like scammers find a way in every system mm-hmm there's not tons of scams out there they're just getting repurposed you know that just another trick they just put a little twist on it changes the name and it's a new scam yes it's all the same scams I show you might want what you want to know my pistol scam postal yeah I've actually never done this but it's like we're you you get arrested for what you bout to say well I don't know okay well I've never strong those motherfuckers come down on you I've never done it but this is something that I I think somebody told me they used to do in college I don't know I don't even know if it really works but like I said I got I wanted to send you a letter I would put you as the yeah just switch to return address in the send address throw it in one of those blue mailboxes hey there go hey no stamp return to sender now I send it you that letter hmm okay they probably know that one already yeah they probably do yeah probably yeah yeah they're probably what how'd it get all the way over here yeah they're smarter than you bro famous con artists in history right it was like this little tome it's smaller than like the smallest paperback and it was the biography of this guy Victor Lustig was his name he was famous because he sold the Eiffel Tower twice all right and he he had this this scam that he called I think it was called the the the Hungarian box I have to go back and look but basically what he would do is he would get on a boat in New York and he had this sort of beautiful mahogany box with a crank on it that had two holes in it and he would show all the guests that he would put a blank piece of paper in one and turn a crank and $100 bill would come out the other end and he convinced them all that it was a machine that made money and everybody would offer him an increasing amount of money for this invention and he wouldn't sell it until the last day when he would sell it for a you know 40 or 50 thousand dollars and then he would disappear and jump off the boat and in France and never be seen again people would yeah there it is what's it called Wow yeah there it is but but that's exactly what the morning's picture let me see his face look at that fucking creep look at oh wow let me see that box again wow that is crazy so there yes so it was obviously fake and and and but that's what the mortgage scam was they they they were taking basically blank paper these these subprime loans that belong to janitors who were gonna foreclose within ten minutes all right and they were telling people that oh we have this new mathematical process that allows that actually makes this stuff really safe and you can put it in your in your College endowment you can put in your pension fund and so all these people you know whose retirement monies were based on securities we're buying all this shit that they thought was was triple-a rated and that's that's how they woke up and you know and in 2008-2009 they found their 401ks or were you know wiped out by 40% or whatever it was I mean people were losing their minds right now over the past 24 hours because of Iran really what you're hearing is you're hearing a lot of the the the critics of the current president and apparently there are some that are saying oh he's you know he's in she gets closer to a military conflict with Iran well these are the same brainiacs that said well he was inching as closer to war with North Korea and they everybody was completely wrong on that I'm not saying that rouhani and the others in the Iranian regime might not you know decide to become more bellicose but I think they're I think they're looking at it wrong I mean the this idea that cuz there's a couple of parts part one is that they're saying oh look it what you know he doesn't have a plan P implying that it's either this deal which even our European allies say is inadequate right or it's a military conflict and that's kind of what the previous president was was all about we either get this dealer we're having a military conflict no there's other things in the works there's other options in that in that decision tree and so I think that's that's a false premise and the other thing when they talked about it over the past 24 hours anyways is that well look at this is gonna make it harder to get a deal with with Kim tell none from North Korea's cuz he's gonna think that we don't we don't support our deals well I look at a different way I think that Kim jong-un's gonna look at this and think okay they're not gonna put up with an inadequate deal right so he's gonna look at it and say well yeah that because nobody disagrees with the Iranian deal they want to talk about they want to talk about how look the Iranians are complying with it well the Iranians are complying with what they agreed to allow in the deal right which is none of their military sites the number of times inspectors have have actually gotten on and inspected a military site including Parchin the most important military facility in Iran since that deal was signed in 2015 was zero haven't been there because the Iranians didn't agree to allow any of those sites in this deal so that's like that's like saying that's like saying if you're a serial killer you'll allow the police to come in and search your home but you can't go in the basement right not that also a cult is put their bodies in the basement but I have you know I suspect that's the case so anyway that's it's an interesting thing and I guess I wanted to throw that out there right off the bat because I think Iran right now is consuming so much of the oxygen for it for people out there so people thinking that the reason why we're backing out of the deal is because the president's being unreasonable and we're forcing well you're saying it's a shit deal period yeah I think the idea that we have to stay in it because it's better than the alternative and the alternative you know being war is is not framing it properly I don't think that doesn't make any sense to me but I think that the fact that the UK the the the French the Germans have all agreed publicly that it's an inadequate deal and needs to be fixed that tells you something but it also tells you that they have real strong financial incentives for continuing to do business in Iran they and as do Russia and China frankly the other signatories [Applause]
