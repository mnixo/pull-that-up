the microphone for the people when they announced their table was tied to the PA system so you'd be in the middle of this punchline he'd be like so I said to the guy that was the Mexican place down no it wasn't a Mexican place it was a seafood place oh well that was the beautiful thing about being a comic in Boston is that if you lived in Boston you could go anywhere within like an hour two hours outside the city and work basically every weekend yeah well Tuesday through Sunday Joe yeah we were working seven nights a week at one point it was so much you know and and gosh yeah well it was amazing but it was also terrible because a lot of people were very bad with the taxes and they I always put my mother told me don't fool around with the taxes or the mob you might have been the only guy oh I bet I pay well you might have been the only guy everybody else got hamstrung yeah knock she got killed Kenny got killed and then when they got killed it was like hundreds of thousands years

was still my sponsor today you know how and he's a young kid and you know I said did you have a problem he says I used to go into banks with a shotgun everyone on the floor I go yeah you can be my sponsor Wow best thing Joe we got sober together yeah the same day oh wow yeah Wow 23 years yeah yeah it's that was a thing about that whole Boston cruise it it was all kind of tied to drugs oh and the comedy had that feel to it because the comedy was frantic you know and there was a thing yeah bang bang bang there was a thing about the guys who came out of Boston like still to this day they had like the fastest pace the most punchlines and the audience is there were used to that speed on any bullshit and they would tell you they would if you weren't good you suck tonight get off we would have there was there were times let's say this is gonna be new material my night anyone who doesn't do new material the minute you do anything you've done before get off the stage so Raj sniffy sitting at the back and some you've done that mean Joe a shot glass would shatter in a while look next it was and people like you said the audience's that came in there would come every week yeah so you'd have to get and they would not settle for any bullshit you know that blows that's no good yeah there was a there was a whole scene there it wasn't just a comics it was like comedy connoisseurs there were so many people that came to those clubs shows pull it up Mike it shows that with legendary will the ding ho on Wednesday night Lenny would put like 32 acts on we gotta get the show till 2:00 in the morning license that do the cops are complaining you got you got a stop and I go have a drink it won't finish up you know first the first night he took over when kremens left kremens was leaving and it was a sight Jesus job 85 86 so we're I thought it closed at 84 I could be wrong on the I don't know it was sure close before my I came in 88 you know you know what you're right probably probably around 84 I took over from Barry and so suddenly says to me hey man babby Schlieffen will you stay for me I'll double your pay and I go yeah all right I'll stay fifteen to thirty dollars right at the time you know and he says you you run the club I go haha man I'll get a guy he goes so it goes but a little buddy just got laid off and Paul the right to go well what if he screws us I said he screws us I'll tell my mother won't be fine so he comes in and the first thing he says this shit is I the food sucks close the back room close the restaurant we're gonna make that a show room - so you're open the front room you go through the kitchen and do a show in the back room then you come back then wait till it and we started we were doing six shows tonight but the first night he comes in I was pretty little because you're not going on tonight you're drunk and I go fuck you man I just got you a fucking job you fuck you I'll do whatever I want blah blah blah so he gets Gavin and they go come on man let's go in to cool the roads all nights are under cooler but the lines and gavel goes I'll be right back I go on air click that Frick's [Laughter] okay alright but he turned it into a gold mine we'd be doing six shows a night three in the front three in the back when Sweeney said that the guy lost it in a gambling game yeah Chinese dominoes over in Chinatown and he didn't pay his food tax and so I guess a year and a half later they came and locked it up well first they came and he would send a kid out to a liquor store to buy booze because they took all the booze so we'd have to buy booze for that night and then after that they they came and they took the chairs they took the tables it was a lost every but it was Wednesday night Lenny Thursday night DJ has it Friday night Don Gavin Saturday night kremens and Sweeney on Sunday night oh just killer show and what people don't know is that Boston had a different way of doing it so if it was the Lenny Clarke show Lenny would host the show right Lenny would go on you would do like what 10 15 minutes like that we're supposed to hit open with 40 you know what I came up with that joke that was my idea because yeah because it used to be you know opening me like closer yeah and I was always the closer I'm going hey man if I could host it I can do lines and smoke dope in between the guys and I said well if someone has a bad said I could pick it up I came here no be the buffer while stake it over that guy good and it just took off it was a great way of doing it yeah it really was and then you would kind of close it too right yeah yeah oh yeah oh absolutely yeah I mean you know there were different nights different crowds - like gaff like I I was always working Wednesdays and I'd be other clubs in but I was wondering what cam shoka's gaff had a great show and they didn't like me I was like Cavs crowd did not go for me they hated me and I said what the you know I mean it was a whole day and I had to learn to adapt to different audiences because the difference between Gavin's crowd say it was he was a smart motherfucker yeah he's a genius his fucking comedy was so sharp he would have punchlines you never saw coming Papa punchlines you never saw you were comfortable from the last punchline they hit you with another wow yeah it was the first time I saw him he came on and I watched him and I said to master shot I don't like it but those guys my first time I mean you know fucking lying gamblers well not off to a good start right like it was like competitive he was competitive and one night I was doing a show with him and some guy came on stage behind me he was coming behind me and gab jumped over this railing and scored the guy off and I said em and I was pretty cool because I got you back in him we will drove home to his place him but it was like three days getting I am we've been friends ever since but it's funny because he said to me honey I gotta ask you a question because if you could be the richest person or the most famous person what would it be oh but I was out the most famous singers really yes okay six weeks later SCAF I thought about it you're right I'd rather be the richest the fame shakes a bunch of bullshit he goes well I'm glad you came around see what I mean by smarter yeah he's nuts yeah if you're the most famous person you're just gonna get stopped every oh it's not that you'd rather be that dude that nobody knows well of course yeah I have 5 billion difference billion or not making it billionaire friends I think I'm like tip you know you know that pet pet pet Roger you know but I mean it's unbelievable I mean that to live like that you let your billion save him so it's these guys are just like that more money than you could spend more than you could spend yeah that's a weird life yeah weird like what everybody else is struggling but no one knows don't you have know what some of them people know you know but these people are like anonymous and if more money they kind of reject very clever god so yeah that's oh that's what I would like that that's the way to go yeah you need even if you were a comic you'd rather just do clubs just show up and do clubs and just do a set once you're on stage telling jokes either they laugh or they don't laugh if you're funny you'll kill it doesn't matter if you're famous you know I would like to I would like to be I like doing theatres now because it's a different crowd you know I I still do a lot of clubs I work Mike's club all the time thank often but I thank God for me yeah there's some people you know how when you work the club you get some drunk it all it takes is one person yeah you it cuz I still go with the flow I mean I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go and I try to keep it you know what's happening in the news today and somewhat of just oh man they break the rhythm you know and and I want to stab them you know but you can't well it doesn't always happen though that's the thing it does happen but it doesn't know he's right that's great but Len just can't block it out you know it's he's doing it no one there locks are worse than Apollo anything you just have a look on your face that he doesn't like what you don't think this is funny Weejun words a whisper in a sawmill Nick we're doing some comedy tour up Toronto awesome and maybe Ottawa some get all in and I was looking at him I was hosted I'm looking at him and he I think we smoked at the diamond it was a dark dingy Club and it looked like watching Lenny Bruce it was just like that so I'm laughing I step outside the room and this is what a pregnant woman goes oh my god oh my god he's gonna make my baby so funny he's a funny motherfucker and he's been going crazy lately because the Muller report got released yeah and they said that there's no collusion between Trump and the Russian so all of his Twitter all of his Instagram was just attacking liberals you can yeah yeah you can't retire you lyin cocksucker just like so crazy resigned this is so crazy put a gun he's telling people to put a gun in their mouth every time brilliant joke yeah he was a guy that made me think like oh ok you don't have to be like a little skinny guy to do stand-up alright cuz like he was this big back in the day he's playing football yeah women love them Nikki was pretty funny to start you know yeah I always have said you know he was having good shows and he just he was out of the club's every night and he just put and he was always angry from the boys from I had him on Newsradio we played my brother and you know de Paulo's always had this attitude that everyone's trying to fuck him over I got him this gig and it's almost like he made it happen like it was him and Brian Cowen and Epstein from Welcome Back Kotter were playing my brothers and on the episode ever they beat the fuck out of me we all beat the fuck out of each other broke bottles overhead we uh Bryan Callen threw me through a window and before the thing was cast I had told the producer I said I got this comic he's hilarious I go he looks like he could be my brother let's hire him he goes yeah perfect he goes can he read so I could see the reef so he comes into reeds and he goes yeah he's great perfect but the casting agent had different ideas she had a friend who she so she she cast this other guy unbeknownst to dieter and he made a deal with the producer and the showrunner and so they call Nick up and tell them that he didn't get the gig he's like what the fuck I didn't know you got the gig they fucking just told me I don't make the phone call and find out what happened and you know and she's like well I already hired my friend ago you weren't supposed to hire your friend like are you doing and she's like well I just you know I don't know what to do I already hired this guy go we'll tell him he's fired like this is real simple like the producer wants it the network wants him and so Nick came back and Nick got the part and he couldn't believe it he was like it worked out the world's not fucking me over I go to my friend I wanted you on the show and it worked out but it was like he was convinced he was gonna get fucked over he got fucked over he's like I knew it what what is happening yeah he's gonna be on the show great love I love that guy to do you know I I enjoy one you hear stories about people remembering where they came from and they help people out and when I was doing uh there's only Sunday comics at Fox and it wasn't it didn't start out well I always want to go in to detain the troops but when I got landing with CBS they said no yet millions proper you're not going anywhere so when the troops came home I'd show it got canceled that's all another different story I want to talk about that story oh yeah always it's interesting it's a great story so I I go to 229 pounds Marine base we pull up in a limo we blow anything up down and anything down up and I said I'm gonna like this place so we go in George Lopez there in George Miller a couple of comics nice so I go up to Jeff Altman and he's the host and I go to shake his head and he blows me I gives me a hi hat walks away I go what's this so they say that later in the show they said listen Jeff we have this kid I've got a purple hat he's back now and we want to unite him with his mother and he was that's kind of corny and he walks off a girl I'll do it and so I great now you don't cooperate smile you know I miss my family well that's great because we brought your mother in to be like yeah goes crazy and they said you want his job I said yeah give me a dollar more than him and I took over to suddenly comics that night yeah so I mean so then they said we go from like a hundred to seven in the ratings and they said what do you want I said what's your hire this kid Kenny Rogers and there's my head writer and I go what's he written I said we brought me a couple of letters from prison and one for no reason you told me what I want this what I want so they hire and they fly him out I pick him up at the airport we drive to my place in Marina del Rey and he goes which floor was yours they all of them you know I was living in like a three millionth all the place at the time he goes this is incredible so we get jammed up for three days and the third day comes down he's all banged up because lucky he goes I love you the man but yes I got a wife and kid now I can't fuck this up I really need the job it's okay all right we'll go to work we drive down to Fox and we put my pocket space at the top of the roof it's great and we're going by a Current Affair which used to be Marie Paule which is you see yeah your people suck you shouldn't even have all these offices we're killing him in the ratings they get all the stress so we go down and I said in my secretary hold all my calls we go in my office in this three countries so why three couches I said when people come over they might want a nap right so they said okay mister clock they're ready for Kenny so I bring Kenny and to meet the producers and I said just come by the office when you're done so 20 minutes later he comes person is my office you know I can't believe it you're the fucking boss you know what they don't be my job is to make you happy God he was great well that show was a great show but there was a crazy thing attached to that with your agent that wound up fucking over not just you but a slew of people one guy Oh Bob Williams oh boy what was the star agencies I would've what the fuck was the amount like oh yeah oh we fucked everybody and a little Seinfeld to nine dollars I don't thinks I felt what I slopped when i get lenny and i was making all sorts of money they said you need an agent I said I want Seinfeld and Leno's agent you know and at the same time they he was doing both of them so I figured these guys are the biggest guys in the business and he screwed them but they got their money back I was like the the lowest guy on the totem pole so I got to go fight two million dollars Jesus I mean it was bad I find what people were trying to keep you from killing yeah I went I found out where his kids went to school and everything you know but you can't do that you gotta let it go yeah but it took along whatever happened is that guy still in the business country he's in country music oh they didn't know yeah didn't get the memo oh yeah it was I was I was I was so pissed off I mean because not only did I have the show but when I went there everything was going good and I invited Barry Diller to at Fox he was the head of Fox at the time I would throw a party for the entire cast the crew everyone at Fox and they all showed up and you know I had I showcased a bunch of my friends so they could get jobs and Barry Diller goes from you've really done a great job for us I said I really loved you know working with you mr. Diller he said okay so later in the night this this Asian man came up to me goes you know everyone likes you but I don't get it and I said stick around hop sing you'll catch you on and I didn't think anything of it the next morning they'd give me like a main dollar bonus and they raised my my weekly salary I'm it was a lot of money he was like over two million bucks and I was going to Dallas to do the tack deck Texas State Fair would one of the man trellis is not not early no the other ones just some crazy name and I'll and in Dallas and he calls me said I got good news and bad news I said give me the bad news did you have a problem with a Chinese guy last night it said oh yeah yeah I guess so I guess well that's Barry Diller's right-hand man you're done he they they threw you off the lot they said I said what's the good news here we got your money and I go I want my job I said let me apologize to the guy I didn't mean it I didn't know any go no they've already taken all stuff out of your office and put it in boxes and you're done and now I do the State Fair and I'm going man it sucks you know I mean I want to get back to LA to try and salvage to you know to career you know because I mean this is another network that I'm no longer welcome at just from one conversation I've I've got stories I wish I'd never opened my mouth I mean no one's fucked up my life more than myself and not intentional right so we're doing the State Fair and this horse with a buckboard goes out of control and the horses swing and the what's coming towards the reviewing stand so I grabbed him the Mandrell girl and get her out of it just as the whole thing is wiped out and I'm said did you get that they kept on a tape yeah but that was that was the end of my career at Fox that's crazy from one conversation where a guy said he didn't like you how about this about one of them i'm at i have lenny at CBS and it was still good and then the quit the gulf war came out that that killed me and then they'd brought me back and we were hanging on by a thread and they said listen forget about the show we think you're a great actor let's give you a movie theory it says yeah we're gonna give you first picture two million dollars and then expects you to be the first of a million and then to me and then to me five million dollar three picture deal you know I can't believe this happened is that one question can you act and I said hey I make a believe I'm having fun with you and I get out I want hey man I was only kidding that was that was a pretty good get out and I and I got I just got some I feel fine make it dollars but just by being funny and in it and I said I'll never do that again so like that's gonna happen I read for this movie true romance you know oh yeah so I mean I get I get clean I get straight I work on the lines I'm ready so I go over and it's Ridley Scott of his brother one of the famous Scott the rectus a kid comes out I saw many people in there there's 13 that's because I always like to know how many are in the room cuz you don't wanna go in it so I walk in and and I look at the paper he goes you ready I go yeah I try to script on the floor he goes I guess you already goes hit the x was hitting from the left I was hitting frightened I said you better like it cuz you're never gonna look pussy again I guess whoa whoa whoa was it say look pussy I said write in the script he picks up say so like pussy I said well if you like it you look at right drive it home my agent Cosby says what did you do - he said you're a brilliant actor but you gotta get off the drugs I said I haven't done coke in two weeks I was serious for this part who's he get into Tom Sizemore is back that's hilarious guys who were like oh my god that's crazy that they got that upset I'm having fun I'm pretending I'm laughing with you I make them believe I'm having fun with you and giving you offering you millions of dollars isn't this nice you know that's a problem with people that have so much power they want you to suck their dick every second of the day and as soon as there's any deviation at all they think you're oh you think you're a smart ass you're done in this you know how like a power you know you know you know how guys sleep with women you know to get ahead I had a woman told me she wanted to fuck me but she was hideous [Laughter] yeah I mean there was look there was casting couches for both sides there was what I knew a lady who'd bang all these like sad little actor guys she was always she was a casting lady and she'd have these little sad actor guys so like look all squeemish and shit like look at her she's got that guy on a robe too and she would bang them all she would get these guys pardon shit fuck them all then she was she was aggressive not because I thing is though there's no victim there nobody feel sorry for those guys at all not even for a second a guy that fucks a lady who's a casting director like hey he decided to do what he wanted to do it's like it's such a different thing than a guy being a casting agent that fucks the actress I would fuck a dry cleaner for free dry cleaner what what do you want to do you know something bad at all yeah it's a different animal it's funny yeah but that whole models out the window now with all this me to stuff and after Weinstein got shot down I don't act I've retired from acting so I'd like to see what it's like now and wonder how much different it is how much it's changed you know I bet it's changed quite a bit well recently Joe I gave louia at the club you know after he heard about that and you know we called me up and said hey do you mind if I do a spot and I thought yeah sure no problem you know I like Louie wasn't arrested or convicted of anything and yeah so I put him in he did fantastic Cosby's what do you think I said yeah after that evening the backlash was just unbelievable yeah you know just I go how long is enough what does this guy have to do to try to get his career back right but he what is the backlash though because the backlash is not your your the actual customers right no it was they grabbed some female comics lot work and that I'm working for me and that's said that Mike locked the doors and put a sexual predator on stage and it was like everyone there enjoyed Louie and you know I'm just trying to help a friend okay he came in and he walked over me I gave him a big hug easy yeah we got no problem now you nitwit I said I would have called you if that trick right had given me a number he didn't give me in he goes that's not right now go I know that's what I told them they said so I bring him on stage ladies and gentlemen you know it's me to thing and everything here's a guy who who didn't touch any women matter of fact he touched himself that was the problem they just happened to be in the room and I said you could have jerked off and for me as long as you get on my shirt my shirt that's pretty expensive I said but he's a people you gave a job to the people that that turned on him he gave jobs to all right well there's a lot to that story I don't know there's a lot to that story that would make him look very different and a lot of these people that are accusing him and one day I think he's gonna tell us so he I had a conversation with him about it it's it's not as cut and dry as everybody thinks everybody thinks he had power over these women and he pulled his dick out and started no there was a lot of there was a lot of sex talk it was a lot of flirting there was a lot going on it wasn't that simple and he's very convicted he's very contrite about it is very very and he knows he fucked up and by the way he hadn't done anything like that in more than a decade it was a long time he's got a kinky thing I can't I get him I can't reject off if the neighbors are home I make weird faces so would be fun for anyone but he's a good guy rapist he's my sexual touch anybody caught the worst part of the wave oh yeah you know like if you're in the ocean and you could be in the ocean on a fucking surfboard and you just catch this little tiny wave and everything's fine or you could fuck up and be in the right spot when that giant wave comes and slams you in the head and you have the same intention in the same person and other in other times in history he would have been fine he would probably be fine today because everything is kind of there's enough of the females that have come out that have been full of shit like Asia Argento and the girl accused Chris Hardwick and then Chris Hardwick released all these text messages that show that she actually cheated on him and she brought him back and she's just trying to punish him for all this but these there's a few of those situations now where people realize well there's there's definitely sexual predators and it's definitely bad man and but there's also women who are taking advantage of this movement right and I think the world is sort of like calmed down a little like the Asia Argento that one was a big one hmm you know when she it turned out that she was calling Harvey Weinstein a rapist while she was fuckin a 17 year old right that she was she played his mom in a movie ten years ago when he was seven it's like Jesus correct like how could you how could you have that kind of hypocrisy but there's a lot of that in people that are screaming for attention at the frontal line of a lot of these things a lot of them have like dark secrets themselves yeah you know and like these people that don't want a guy like Louie to have a road to redemption they don't want him to work or even a guy like Aziz Ansari which is even worse he had a bad date with a girl like a bad date where she blew him like three different times and didn't want to keep going bad date that sounds pretty good for me it's pretty good no the whole thing was so crazy it's like there's there's more than one side to every story like that and to take someone's opinion or someone's perception of something as 100% the actual event that happened without any other evidence it's kind of crazy I mean I don't think I just I just think people have to recognize that Louie in particular he's been out of work he was out of work for ten months I've lost all of his shows long so most people think he didn't suffer from that $30,000,000 Joe people that think he didn't suffer Oh crazy yeah you're crazy if you think he should never be allowed to work again well he's not a criminal so what are you saying yeah I said sure you know what yeah I wanted to give him a fighting chance and I guess he is back doing clubs now and he's doing a lot of clubs and he was very that's it it's always trying to do yes you know he's building his act again doing clubs and some fucking asshole releases his whole act on YouTube so now all that material has to chuck away right so he was writing during the time he was gone but not performing right and then he puts together you know an accent you know look you know as well as anybody when you have new shit it's got some goddamn holes in it right I never written a bit ever maybe one or two in my whole career that was this that was the finished bit when I first did it on stage maybe one or two ever they're always clunky and sometimes you have ideas you're like why the fuck did I even try that one I'm like the Parkland shooter bit like he was doing that bit no it's a very unfortunate bit right especially when people who aren't in the club hear it and then but who knows what that bit would have been if someone didn't tape it yeah if you gave him a year to work it out right he probably would have figured out a way to make it where it wasn't offensive and it didn't shit on those kids in the same way my best stuff before cellphones and because I didn't know I just went out and now what I'm onstage I'm constantly thinking oh don't go that don't do that don't cross that line because somebody you know it's a terrible feeling that it's horrible it's not the funny shit that you and I have laughed out hard was something that someone definitely shouldn't have said oh absolutely they knew they shouldn't have said it that's why they were saying it they were saying it to make the audience laugh cuz they were like I can't believe you fucking said that oh yeah not like he means not like that's his actual there's no maliciousness behind a dive no you think I want people who spent 30 40 bucks to go out and that'd be pissed them off and ruin your night would you like for your date no I'm just trying to make you laugh so now it's a you know it's just so Joe I can remember back with you and Mike McCarthy yeah it was like who could work the dirtiest you guys would be in the back just dying yeah you know can't even get I'd say let's if we can walk the room suck in ever bro but I mean women wait wait LA Depp oh my god I remember one night I was feeling great and I said dad let me dude I was fucked up and I turn it on the ground and then I felt bad cuz they were just so upset so discuss women and these are like regulars usually come they started trying to win him back but there was a show in Atlanta whatever's a guy heckling me I said listen if you don't shut up I'm gonna come down and pop you right in the fucking face and I did I went I went off the stage and pop this fucking guy wait he was bleeding anyway and the crowd was on his it took me 45 minutes just to break even you know and then you kept going after you punch the guy in the face yeah I don't know it was you know I was doing a bunch of one-night is in with and I was because the crowd was a big crowd but spend like 300 people know I love being away and this guy just and I'm fucking hit and I went right up put the mic bang anyone down he was screaming and crying Wow and I went up in a baby boy that's the devil team Boston in Orlando you gave me the best advice anybody ever gave me when I was starting out you did and right after you brother gave me the worst advice was good advice at the time was smart advice you I just said Joe I think maybe you should try to clean it up a bit yeah and let it I love you don't change it you made me laugh you know because I mean I saw I've seen everybody I said when I started doing comedy but 41 years ago there was only 100 comedians maybe the whole country you know what if I heard of someone I would fly to their town to go on stage instead let's get oh you don't think Kennison you know and you know be Slayton in San Francisco you know people that dumb in Philadelphia could people I I thought were really good in it it might you know I would like to see what it is you know I became friends with Oliver you know that's awesome and then then it just blew up I mean you know now you don't even have to have an Acura on YouTube I've seen those YouTube guys eat shit yeah do draw people out to the club at night for a while they'll do it for what you trick people for a little bit unless they become good and they keep putting the work and do the act I mean and and and you know develop an act but you either can do it or you don't like Jerry Seinfeld one said very famously that if you're famous you have it buys you 30 seconds yeah yeah buys you 30 seconds in front of a crowd they're happy you there they'll give you 30 seconds and after that like okay what the country he's a fuckin good joke writer still slinging Comedy Store every now and again I think he's still in Branson but he comes down the store and I worked with him a couple of times he's good Yeah right he's got new material he looks good - he's healthy and then yeah yeah but um like if those YouTube guys they have a they have a shortcut right you know there's there they make funny videos on YouTube yeah they they'll get a crowd even though they're not really funny but if they put in the work they can pull it off look it it has been done mmm the most courageous guy I ever saw was Charlie Murphy yep because Charlie Murphy was essentially a famous open mic er right and that fucking guy would he started out hosting it would be him and Donnell and Bill burr and they would do these shows together and Charlie had never done stand-up mmm but he had the most famous brother ever and people would saw him on the Chappell Chappell show really so he became famous and then the guy had balls of steel man I did a 22 show tour with him and he had only been doing comedy for two years yeah and I had been doing comedy for more than 20 yeah and we were co-headlining so I would headline one night he would headline the other night and I mean to be able to go on after a guy who's been doing comedy 24 years whatever the fucking was yeah and go on after him and do 40 minutes was doing yeah and just the balls - yeah yeah yeah yeah and he was just go on out there like you own the place but passed away right yeah jeez hey I worked you know you always make it a point and people stay out of material one of the biggest things that all of us all each operator I never met him he was this big big fat redneck guy and we're working down south someplace maybe Florida and we're in the green room and he watches The Tonight Show and it's on and we're doing The Late Show and Kasich comes out does his monologue and after smile did you pretty he went out and did God know whatever no there was no VC eyes back then there was no tapes there was nothing I got you stole one of my jobs no my joking yeah but I do it better I got no you don't to it man that's all yeah but I do it better yeah he's young kids yeah man but I do it better well you know back in the day in the catskills times they all stole mmm like there was there was no honor amongst thieves back then and everyone just had jokes there were just joked jokes like he almost had like a tool box like oh I needed 3/8 and then as television came along and then people started getting in trouble for stealing you know robbed and got in trouble and a few other guys got in trouble and then it sort of died off until like I mean when YouTube came along then it kind of killed it there's a still a few thieves that are still running around to this day and some of them are famous but most of the audience knows now and if you look look at someone who's a thief and then you look at their Instagram comments like holy shit people go after them yeah people no no they know it's the darkest thing you can do when a guy works or a girl works forever on a bit and then you just come along in the finished product and snatch it and switch a couple words and pretend pretend you came up with it on your own well when I started I was working as a janitor in City Hall of Cambridge and I took the other janitors out for BS when he went through spring frustation alone we saw Sweeney and we saw Sweeney and Bill Campbell and M going oh my god Sweeney was just guys wow this guy do you like it I had a couple of guys it's a couple of comics but unlike the Janice it get funnier than these guys you should so I talked to George MacDonald about it at school the next day and he was yeah man you should be a comedian I go what's that he goes that's what you saw last night his house and we listen to Woody Allen album and I don't even know Woody I know Woody Allen from smoke I didn't know he was a comedian and he did that joke about hitting the moose up in Maine so I went on and I've been on stage before I went on at the but the thing always spring for streets alone and I did this and it was unbelievable change all my every stunt with supplies like a stair the relation and afterwards this little old guy comes in the back mr. clock you're very funny but you shouldn't use Woody Allen material what do you fuck you can manage and that was it that was it and I sucked for months I said but it was all mine you know it was crazy yeah there's a lot of guys in the beginning that's Greg Fitzsimmons and I used to steal from each other we have a deal though like a fuse because we both only had like 15 minutes and we had to do a half so I would steal 15 his he'd still 15 of mine and we were best friends oh yeah so we do that blow job material killed and fucking pocket that was fuckin pretty is that sure is you fucking it just the best guys there's no ideas you got to be heightened for Joey upstage with a notebook yeah you gotta go say that again used to do that Mike Donovan Mike so good - because Mike Donovan when I saw him I go wow this guy's so just brain real tech but everything and I used to take him out after shows and taking the breakfast and he would tell me says listen I'm gonna tell you everything you did wrong there's no need for me to tell you what you did right because you can tell but everything you did wrong and he would listen I go oh my god you know and he helped mold me and he helped make me technically abetik I owe him a lot everything Mike Dunn was great he helped me as well he told me to record all my sets yeah told me the old tapes at this stage oh sure I never know you know you might say one thing and you forget you say it but that one thing might be to make the bit ten times better Joe I listened to him and I taped everything what I was doing Eleni Bruce thing and he used to tape you know and so I didn't realize he was taping his act I know he was tape and talking you know so I would write when I first started doing it I would write for hours and I would go down to kitchen say mom what do you think it is and I tell her Jessica's I don't know I guess it's good I really liked that rib day like a rep down shit right now she goes that's why hides by 57 varieties get over you're not the only funny person in the world like oh yeah she was gin taking shit so I'm working to dooms one day and Pauly Shore I'm up by the pool apology I turn around who's II would but Rip Taylor right so I said mister tell ya would you talk to my mother and so did bring a phone out there to pull this and is hello Jean its rip Dylan you here so he's so nice I told you he was funny idiot I ended up doing Hollywood Squares we've got to be friends of a good guy good guy he made me laugh like I was funny he was a hilarious guy he was Hollywood Squares me he took over that show yeah if you saw Hollywood Squares a trip Taylor wasn't on you like he's the funny one yeah he's the guy you want to hear talk yeah Donovan told me to record all my sets and he you know he would who explained to you the fuck meter - oh that was young comics to this day don't understand first time I ever heard that he goes well you broke the fucking meter I go what and I didn't even realize I was doing it yeah and and now what I'm working with guys that I like there yep I said you don't listen you don't need the fuck there drop the fuck that you don't you don't need that the jokes fine without it you know yeah I mean they go you and I go don't don't do what I do but you can do it when it's necessary and when it's necessary it'll mean more if you don't have ten other unusual well unnecessary with Mike you know he he tends to use it where he he wants to use it where he's about the guys on in front of him you know he goes I don't want you doing it just for the sake of doing you know and he was you know he's Mike's a great guy and he still tapes every show well he's a great comic and yeah he's just very aware that you can the audience get numb to that word weird doesn't mean anything you don't hear it until he goes up and then when he goes up you only hear it when it's necessary right it makes it's it's a presentation the issue because if there's a guy in on you some comics would use the word fuck the same way they used the word um fucking liking guy with the fucking thing he's got his fucking hat on and his fucking shoes are tied in this fucking and just by the time you say and I'm like fuck you it doesn't mean anything right I used to open a stove before Leno any would say to me you know you're really funny but you don't have to be that filthy you don't have to I said yeah but but I feel like I'm selling out yes you're not selling on your cashing in and my mother I was just said you can get more work and then I started doing corporate cakes and people say listen Lenny we don't care if you're mildly amusing as long as you know say fuck the rating and I want ya in my flight 20 30 grand signs of autograph so I mean so you did so those are tempting that's the siren song that's like that's where Jay made most of his money oh yeah I mean he would make hundreds of thousands of dollars well he needs it he never spent his tonight all of his money went to cars that money came from gigs yeah and he never put out a special he had one special in show time way back in the day in Philly me give me a million dollars that's gonna cost me money but his whole thing was he didn't want to do it because that material was gone yeah once he did it right but but he would go to these places and do the same act like two years later be like what the fuck but he just had this polished oh oh people said to me hey man I really don't care for myself I said listen me I said I used to open from and one matter was that Nicks and I was supposed to 20 minutes and whatever I was hoping for someone I'd do my time and get off that's just respect and he come in and he goes oh okay so anyway so now I do about 45 and standalone crowds go crazy and I'm walking I've in my mind I'm gonna follow that fucker you know in a minute he gets on stage within two minutes it was like Lenny who he was that good I mean it was a Springsteen the car is amazing don't know I don't know great streams to go on Letterman back when he was young that the crazy dark hair he was the edgy comment oh yeah which is hard for young guys too he would do a two-hour show and it wasn't too much right you know it was killer yeah yeah he's extremely underrated as a kinder and I think it's unfortunate that he doesn't have like a great body of work other than Tonight Show monologues people think of him as the guy with Tonight Show mano he's a great stand-up anyone that that I see that is it's really true I give it up you know it's but here's the thing you make me laugh you know I like if you if you're successful in it and I'm not getting them there you know yeah that's good for you you know I mean I don't belittle anybody for this success I'm the same way you know but but if you make me laugh then I I'll pay to go see if you make me laugh it's a waste of time to worry about something you don't like because obviously other people like it alright yeah I feel the same way about music there's a lot of music I don't like it's fun they sell millions of albums right I don't care yeah there's no room I just want to I just want to laugh if he could make me laugh that's that's why some of the people I hang around would just kill and we go out we go out to dinner everyone puts their cell phones on the table off beautiful you know that's nice you go yeah we can't be so you need some nipple to take you down you know God so many people are fuckin interested in just looking at their phone all right now if I wasn't is all the same if I was a young kid coming up now I'd be an animal because I wouldn't care oh you can't say that right now and the thing was you know when I started people say oh my god what a funny take on that night what's no funny take it was what I actually thought rather than you know popped a balloon and take them know I'm crazy I just oh yeah cuz that's why I've never thought it was funnier than anybody I just know that I'm sick and I just as they under the guise of humor it works yeah you know it works well we were very lucky that in those days in Boston I started in 88 but in in those days there was remember in Warrenton stream yeah you had you had the comi at the Charles yeah up the theater above downstairs was the connection right over here was next right and over there was Duck Soup right that's fucking crazy it was mighty God he opened one club what was that Club in the hotel Brad yeah what was in the basement Joker's okay this place would hold over three hours a beautiful room at one night I had Mike binder come on your mic sure it might bind it I just know she's done a documentary right now on the store I said do some time I'm in the back in backstage don't lines and he brought the entire audience with the dress of the dress room and this is da the comedians are hot at work well the other comedians are on relax relax it's just stunt coke it's not real you know so there's no other place like that like the scene in New York was very different the scene in New York there's the never they never did the hosting thing the way they did in Boston there wasn't as many clubs that were like close together they would talk to the crowd yeah there would no joke we from and yeah it's a little different now now there's a lot of jokes but I think I tribute that to the size of the rooms in New York you're on top of people that's the first thing I noticed when I moved to New York I was like God the fucking audiences it literally would be like I'd be standing on a stage and you would be the front room everyone's so close yeah the old catcher Rising Star Dangerfield stand up New York stand up New York on top of you I used to go down I take the train down and stand in my way for a number to go on it catch and that put me on last because I was from Boston and I go when I burned it down and you go hey man you know he should $10 $10 would they give me that about that I might get onto the night out and go back and I did that for years and finally some good like bells it was good to me and even Piscopo gave me a break and some other guys but Mike said what do you go to any outfit let's book why go to me ah guts let's have them come to us and the thing always just like an explosion yeah there was no place like that scene and I feel so lucky that I started stand-up in 88 in Boston I feel like I just caught this way you know yeah it was where'd you leave Joe 91 I think or 92 did you go to New York or LA New York dear I got signed by Jeff Sussman okay that's when I moved out and then that one year I was driving limo then when you went to LA at the baseball show you got what hard work but Mike's time yeah and if anything about Mike's dad I always wanted to work with him I just he's great yeah he's a great guy yeah he's add a ton of of incredible body of work so we do a movie together we do something up in Canada and we get in a beef you and my stars yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it so hey I said he said something what we were drinking and we were drinking like lebackes black ice you got the hangover before you get high it was that powerful shit right and he said something goes hey man I waited 10 years to work with you in a deck and he said something I leap over a table fight broke out that a bus yeah oh yeah I was on him like a spider monkey I was I was like 350 at the time so what I well I landed on him he went down you know and they they broke them they throw us out and we're walking out he goes you know very disappointed in you disappoint me fuck you I'm disappointed in you I waited all this time to work with and we made up but it was never the same what year was that oh shit I don't know a long long time ago probably 25 years yeah same day 192 oh that was probably even before I met him yeah yeah I will have him in 94 yeah yeah last night on Dumb and Dumber he's a great guy yeah nice I you know I was drinking well you know it was a pretty epic movie sake it for damn I go what's this he go well this is pretty money I go what's it for well you know to buy food well we get fed there we go well you know what I spent it right you can say it was crazy you know but it was fun yeah you learn yeah you learn yeah um yeah so I moved to New York and I think wasn't either 91 or 92 and then I moved out here in 94 mmm so was it in New York very long and then you get Newsradio no yeah I got hard ball got canceled not both that was what's that fucked yeah what a fox his first shows I don't think so no I'm married with children and Simpsons and there was a lot of shows on there they were doing sitcoms though that's what yeah wasn't very good it was a lot of problems but it was also an interesting thing to see that the pilot was really funny Jim Breuer was in the pilot the pilot was great but the pilot was made by the creators of the show and then once the network decided to pick it up then they started bringing these network hacks to come in and turn it into some bullshit fucking show and it was terrible they rewrote scenes and it was it was a disaster so I got to see like how really funny writers and really funny actors can put together a really funny pilot and then that show could turn into dog shit because of network meddling and executive meddling and then to go from that to news radio which was like the polar opposite that was just they get they bet they didn't give Paul sims much grief at all they let him do whatever the fuck he wanted because he was coming from Larry Sanders show and they knew he was brilliant and then they had you know I'm working with more incredible it was the luckiest gig ever I couldn't believe it you know I'm working with those I never even took acting lessons nothing I mean I I had a couple acting they made me get a coach when I first got a development deal and I think I took like four or five lessons with this lady so I had they give me a deal and they said you gotta take acting lessons yeah so I went to the sacrificing this one okay we're gonna be a tree I don't know okay I in this and the same we run everyone caught on like ants for all ants nice that's it see you later what I don't know why would be an ads cuz what fucking movie am I gonna be a giant no that's not what I'm looking for and I left and I get Lenny two days later they all fucking quit it was crazy well the problem with acting classes is I mean it's good to practice like to learn how to read lines yeah but it's just pretending no I'm not saying I'm Daniel day-lewis or I know how to do it like one of those guys that's a different level of acting that's it but if you're on a sitcom right and if I'm a sitcom I'm playing a guy like me right and it's just it's just like stand-up but easier that's what it felt much easy said but what's what what was it difference I said well okay the difference between doing a sitcom there's a camera and if something goes wrong we take it again and I can throw bottles at you oh my god what I opened for Aerosmith leaves to come and see me at it stitches all the time and I had no idea who they were and someone said you know that is I said yes Amaris rock bands in the world you know I was at the disco because it was the you could get laid it was Apple that was like I was like Travolta in Santa Fe right which it was fun I mean that was it was crazy so they so I was a fat guy I could dance I was like Gleason you know but they come and they said we want you to open for a sec oh yeah no problem so why go over to the Orpheum Theatre this is what one of them any comeback soon after but they were still getting I think so I mean I go in with the crowd is going in you know and they're saying hey man I heard this a comedian tonight we're gonna fuck him up and I'm listening to this I'm going hey man I'm the comedian it's myself some guys Lenny Lenny so they call me what are you doing I said well I'm going to him no no you're going to stage two I don't even know they had a stage story so I go back in there all I mean it was fucking wild so I go on stage and they stop booing right and it's like runway lights iris pretend he's incredible lights I couldn't see and this is but 438 did throwing bottles and bottles smashing all around me right dodging shit I can't see it coming too bright out of its lesson so this kid throws a milk that hits me in the balls drops me to my fucking knees I'm like it's so Steven Tyler has his body I dragged me through the curtain cuz I'm right by the curtain on cuz I'm backing up I'm trying to get a couple granules here it is come back tomorrow night so oh my gosh I go back to the next night like a rally and they see you want to go to Japan with us I gonna see you gotta figure a workaround oh oh well you you learn I think of you a good comic you learn from your mistakes if you don't you know you're not gonna you're not gonna proceed and I did I had I had the pleasure working with I work with who's pretty woman who said she gear no no the guy who sang pretty well Oh Roy Roy Orbison yeah I think that's how bad my mind is that so I'm with I'm with Kenny were up for about three days I said I gotta go to Worcester I'm open for Roy Orbison I'm almost out of gas I'm out of blow I'm exhausted I pull into this place and I go up there and it's just food bigger than this whole table all this food you're my daddy today so I just thought rev I'm like a bad black he's got those glasses and it's for esa's you're the comedian I said yeah he goes the bridge once I do show a great show I come back boys you're a fantastic man well you want to go on told us I got asked me to go on a Robert oh yeah that that work would rate your house you know yeah and it was so good to me oh man he goes Lenny you're the funniest comedian I've never seen know what the Vegas in Vegas well he was great it was it was amazing the only person I have all before that I really had was juice Newton she was such a bitch to me man young guy you know what I was doing like the Cape Cod you know she was like a country star right so my buddy showed up my on my high school boy climbed up and they took the juice token off and they took the lettuce and Lenny yeah I didn't work out well yeah is that what she was pissed about her no she was just pissed at me I don't know I mean if she didn't want a comedian oh but I don't know you know I mean I was excited about meet now you know she's just I know Justin but to play with it okay my heart's or some shit I don't know she had a one big buddy of mine who was in love with her he had a juice Newton poster on his wall yeah every time I go over his house I remember his name it was Mike you know who opens up for Metallica is brew and apparently he's fucking sensational oh yeah he's a big Metallica fan and he does a game show yeah he's just so he doesn't give a fuck no he just wants to make a live and have a good time you know he's not trying to get more famous than he already is but he's if you get a chance to see Jim Breuer oh yeah hey Stuart I took the wife gets to Africa it was tell me about the trip to Africa for Metallica no no just well I think they were there but he moved a wife and kids over to they've gotta stop take my kids to Africa but they were gonna have to get malaria shots well you know what I mean but not only that but you know this is like AIDS no I don't mind lies and I don't care much thank you it's gonna fuck my kids no but wait wait wait let me finish you got a mosquito at AIT's a bite you what happened that works you don't think that works I don't think it works that way well we we gotta find out yeah but that was what everybody was worried about my show it's not just me but in the 80s that was one of the big fears was that mosquitoes mosquitoes gonna give you know like one guy would have HIV he would get a mosquito bite and would fly over to you and it'll give it to you but it's monkey in the tree a tree monkey this isn't they isn't that out the age thing started I think this is a there's a lot of confusion but they think it was probably from a hunter who was hunting a monkey and thunk the pocket on an in fucked my thumb cut himself while he was cleaning the monkey while he was gutting the monkey because this is a very common thing it's it sounds disturbing but what they call bush meat and what bush meat is basically any kind of meat from any kind of thing they shoot in the woods they would shoot monkeys was a whole different thing you know a bush people what the fuck are you talking about like no it has a bush anymore oh god that's porn change the game they change the change that's the the biggest influence of pornography in American culture is not just that people watch it but it changed the way people grew in their pubic hairs oh yeah I grow my nightshade up because it makes me feel younger they get gray it's like this yeah yeah Bush but anyway that's how aids apparently they think HIV spread from patient zero was a guy who cut himself while he was cleaning see it's informative show I didn't know how it worked yeah I might be wrong about that well I was wrong about the mosquitoes don't be hotter I just don't think that it I don't think it's as is transmittable it's like say well area all right say say mosquito got mosquitoes transmit malaria yes right well what's the difference between a good chunk of blood going to dead you know I mean I don't think it works the same way I just think it's more difficult to transmit which is one of the reasons why men typically don't get it from sex they get it from needles you know women get it from sex cuz the guy comes inside of you and you know that's how you get HIV this is we can't operate send that sample give me a nice hair back Bush clippings in his swing he still doing radio does he still do radio no it's good once a week I think oh he was on zlx for a couple of years it was making good money is there a radio in Boston anymore kiss and Toronto was the pioneer yeah with the five survive that really helped boost comedy in the eighties he was a big proponent yeah he helped he helped me an awful I remember what one night he came in he said you know he's gotta make the move no I don't wanna smack you around because you know this ain't gonna work he said why don't you come on my show I don't know how to do ready she's like your best community I'm the best DJ to work I tried it we were selling out you know status I mean it was just incredible every time we go on a show it promote it was it was in Grand I really I really appreciate it his help you know but he still around no no no unfortunately passed I went to see him two weeks before he died they said max into Mass General so I went in and he started laughing and then she nearly choked and I uh I said man what's going on oh you know it's it's not good Lenny only got a couple days this is it aids he said no I said so I kissed him on the forehead mosquitoes I can't be taken again what happened uh I don't know you know I don't know but one day it's a lot of things weren't bad you know and you know it's Maddie in the morning still around always he was huge back when I was delivering newspapers yeah Jo he's gonna be on the arrow almost 40 years now had a TV show before the radio gig why would you yeah I did that yeah I did that show what well he crossed me once it is you yeah and I flipped out night I threatened to fight him so I went on the sports channel and I said I will drop 100 pounds Oh Maddie Siegel for children's cancer and Barry and Elliot said we'll put the chairs will donate the chest will put lounge chairs in the way and someone donated the venue and it got really crazy and there man he said listen I'm sorry you know and we were doing an event that his mother passed away from and I said oh how can you know I'm sorry I pause so we're back to being friends because we're friends a long time but then you know I mean sometimes people you know you know one thing about you that I've always had my eyes I liked you before I even knew you're a bad I said just like you're nuts I didn't know you were you know stone-cold killer but the point is what you have such a way and and and other friends of mine that are just really you know dangerous people very very calm you know even when people you know push you to the limit you you know which is good I wish I did that cuz you know I've been sued a few times in you know I've learned you know I've learned to keep my hands to myself you got oh yeah oh how was it by that it was a an NBA player that I wanted to come for the Celtics Howard he I think he's with Charlotte now and I'd see guys planned he just turn and look you know and like Logan makings for the Patriots people would smack him in the back he turn around just give that look and they'd be back way I always admired people that could control the madness you know makers I you don't want to let the genie out of the bottle no that's when you know things can people die yeah horrible decisions when you're in a rage yeah yeah also you gotta be like if something does happen you got to be able to stay calm while it's happening then you see where the shots are is when people get frantic the adrenaline starts pumping you start hyperventilating and freaking out you don't see things you don't you don't you know you can't see things that are happy it's how people get hurt oh yeah you learn how to do that when when in competition right competition you can never freak out you never could be emotional if you're emotional you lose all track of what's happening you know you lose your breath you get tired quick I know you get that adrenaline I have much respect for people that you know MMA and in martial arts only I remember college my freshman year at college buddy of mine who was a fight okay Jimmy file create fighter Golden Gloves champion everything he said Lenny I think you could be a good fighter so he took me to this gym in Springfield and I fought this Nigerian he was he was my Nigerian Knight made only bet he'll take a week I was like 220 he was like 235 you know and couldn't even barely speak English we got no we got to ring him for the first 30 seconds I was I was awesome but he hit me with his shot that put me airborne I mean I was out cold before I hit the mat and I woke up and it was staring down me please don't get up man that wasn't gonna work for me you know I mean I've never lost a barroom fight but probably out of fear and just you know the fight-or-flight you know I want a boat that they both get get let's fight and get out here as fast as we can it's always a bad idea like but the thing about bar fights too is like you not fighting one person you know those other dudes around you you can't see them hear about it on the phone they come over well weren't you a bouncer a great woods joke yeah yeah yeah I was one of the security people and I quit during a Neil Young concert because Neil Young one of the things that we would do is we would catch people bringing in booze would always have to check people's bags when they were coming in but the other thing that we do is we try to keep order in the lawn you know great lawn area well one day during a Neil Young concert they started having bonfires in the lawn [Laughter] people lighting fires and we tell these people to start put the fires out and I remember I had a good friend his name was Larry Jones he was the whole the whole staff of employees was like there was a few guys was guy named alley cat who ran he always wanted to open up a place called libations and alley cats libations and victuals I never remember I've always remembered that you want to open up a bar that was his dream but first time I met alley cat some guy had stolen one of the golf carts they had a security golf card some drunk kids stole the golf cart and they beat the fuck out of him with walkie-talkies never forget that I was like Jesus these guys aren't playing yeah and you know I might have been getting like twenty bucks an hour I don't know what the fuck yeah but I remember think of Jesus I don't want to get in actual fights here because I was competing at the time to nineteen years old so that was when I won the US Open and I was I was in the height of my competition days and this fight broke out on this lawn and they were all Taekwondo black belts all like either national champions or state champions there's like five or six of us out there and my friend Larry who's like the nicest guy in the world he was in some sort of altercation with this guy and I see him slam this guy in the stomach and drop him I'm like fuck if Larry's punching people this is bad so I had always brought a hoodie with me because I was a coward as soon as the fights break out I would put a hoodie on over my security jacket zip it up I'm like fuck you and I quit I walk right out the fucking door with everybody else and I just never I didn't collect my check that week I was like you can keep it I'm not dying now it was broswer break it out people were taking people's asses and hitting people with chin there was fire everywhere and my preservation instinct kicked in I was like there's no fucking way no way I'm getting involved that was my last day on the job did you ever work there I mean perform there yeah no I never performed there I never performed it but I got to see a lot of guys I got to see Cosby perform there I saw Keenan Standish in there I saw Rodney this was in the rodney bathrobe days so rodney was backstage and one of the guys who I worked with saw his hog oh yes he would be fucking full naked underneath this bathro but he had a giant dick I've spent hours per day we shot this movie out here we always abolish box and he's come on kid let's go get out so and he starts taking somebody takes the robot but now we said be careful with this dope this dumps really I said run em and smoke at 30 is I'm finding us I'm telling you to bring your shit Indians bring this in and Cano said and I'm past Calabasas way when I live in the marina and I goes I tried to tell you well the back then they had like California weed today is preposterous I mean it's it's so strong that some people are having psychotic breaks and people have breakdowns and losing their mind mentally it's 20 times stronger than what we said and I smoked every day I used to I used to smoke him work out I'd smoke I'd ride the bike I'd smoke I'd swim I love to smoke I just got I got I thought it was more creative when I was smoking you know it's just like like columns or linings man I got writer's block okay but it was just I mean yeah now they tell me it's and now it's legal what I did about it what's interesting is my wife's friends openly smoke pot now like whereas like when I was younger like if people found out you smoked pot they would look at you like you're some sort of derelict like you were doing stone yeah even if you were successful even if you were working every day even if you showed up on time if you were a pot smoker he smoked open a Robert Mitch Mitch oh yeah his downfall well it was it was a pyramid oh he said dope smokers don't smoke dope it's a gateway drug I go you don't know what you're talking about once again I was wrong well everything's a gateway drug if you really want it to be huh you know but Rodney that those days of the bathrobe days were his best days it's a full on I don't give a fuck days he didn't give a fuck it was just váradi gave lenny one of his first big national breaks on the HBO special in who was on your special with you lenny Chimel hicks dice Dom I got my rare Carol Leifer very syllable Barry Sobel to this day one of the best specials ever yeah it was it was nuts you know because we were out here and rodney was auditioning everybody for it and Mike said go ask him so I said hey Rodney I said we could take a look at me kid I've seen people with 20 without no no and he walked two and he turned said hey if you can be in New York next week I'll take a look at Mike's it'll be there so we flew back to Boston we took the train down and mike says you have any they were gonna do a gun I so so I go into the bot and this Bill Hicks sitting at the barber they said hey man nice to meet you I said Midwife yes it's me and you up for the best spot you know I spotted some made a best man will have a have a drink after he goes I'm drinking now and I goes wrong fucking answer I went out I punched the fucking phone book there's a long ago I was so pissed and Ronnie was who wants to go first I do so I went on and I fucking burnt the time running us Jesus Christ now I get you're on the show now I said it's not my problem man Rodney's in the bathroom of course it's so we forgot to be good friends one night we left there and we went up to the Tavern on the Green okay and he's in the world she's in the bathrobe we don't blow and drinking smoking and we get out we go up got some nice people so you saw Hicks when he was drinking stage yeah I only saw him after drinking I saw him post drinking yeah I saw him at Nick's well the first time I saw him I saw him at the connection I saw him at Nick's and I saw him at the connection those are two places yeah I mean we became friends after that but I mean it was that was you know I'm after a good guy you know it's sometimes it's the competitive juices oh yeah I don't know sure what it is that was the well one of the things that comics of today talk about is how is a different thing in the community now like the comics community is very supportive there's no competitiveness anymore it's not the same because it's not like everybody's up for a limited amount of slots on like an HBO young comedian special location or Carson there's none of that in fact everybody helps everybody because everybody does everybody's podcast everybody supports everybody we work together on the road together it's like it's a different vibe oh yeah when I was coming up it was like that it was all cut cut yeah and everybody wanted everybody to bomb after him yeah I always felt I said look if one of us makes it we kicked the door down for everyone else yeah but people will make it ahead of me and they were slamming that door shutting but I and that's why I had to go from LA to I come out here and make no money yeah hey Michiko you you'd be funny if you are red tired okay I'll get a red tie so much better and she was great to me I mean she she went when I broke through that's right there yeah I know I love it so she said to me joke joke joke I go isn't that what it's supposed to be you know and what exciting it to be I don't know I don't know I really don't know but but but she said you're not gonna go away I said no I'm not gonna okay you're regulation what's that mean no they get like $25 now no I don't what pay for my back and yeah so I flew back and forth from Boston and he got me working everywhere and I'd make enough money to live out here and I did every weekend for 18 months but it was so smart that you did that because you were one of the few guys that left Boston right all this brilliant communication Sweeney and all these guys don't Tony Hawk's yeah there were guys that you know if they went to Boston and and get on stage yes during the 80s in the early 90s I saw some of the best stand-up I ever saw in my life what guys would murder it's hard to be serious yeah yeah had to yeah yeah that's a row you couldn't look the guys in the face yeah Rogers ago wow you're really sucked yeah they were ruthless but the level of comedy was so high yeah like on a Saturday night you could see Lenny Sweeney Gavin Steve Wright all on the same show yeah and it was crazy and then they would occasionally at Nix Nix was the biggest culprit in this where they would bring in some local some national guy Skippy yeah brought in Tara family died who would sell some tickets right but then they would set him up and they'd have to follow these guys follow fucking assassin group I mean it was it was crazy was a murderer's row I have some of the best comics ever I remember Richard Lewis came and I love Richard Lewis and I think he's a great comic but he came in and Gavin oh hey man have you seen this Richard Louis I said no because watch this special so I watched him and I go yeah it's gonna be cannon fodder he goes what I go he goes listen I'm telling it's a lot different from from filming and being on stage at Nick's so he came in it was me Sweeney and Gavin and him and so we go on and we burn it down and he goes on and then he goes back to the hotel 57 and turns on channel 4 and sees Joyce go hey work butchering him in the reveal and comes back and he goes I can't believe this is happening I go hey man listen you're a great guy open I said we'll take care of it he goes really I said yeah don't blow him throwing shit out the window so you guys were insane and six months later I do my first movie the wrong guys with him and he says I never forget what you didn't boss him for me he was so nice to me you know and I was a wreck because I didn't do movies well it's a terrible position for a comic like him to be because he wasn't that kind of comic like a guy would pontificate and you have these long pauses and stories stories and funny but yeah these people don't joke to be set up right like if he had a like a low-key opener he would have fun which I bet he got most the time on the road and and not not crazy it was a very unusual group guys of guys in Boston - because they're all giant dudes like between you and Gavin and Sweeney and NOx they're big men oh these are big intimidating men who are doing stand-up you remember the the doormat Billy sure Bigfoot he nearly killed me one night right well Dorma that next yeah yeah yeah so these kids come in and go hey man he goes were sold out it's $200 yes come with me walks down to the front row takes four kids from child sounds screw get out and puts those jobs down here come back next week I mean that's how it was it was crazy it was insane you know keep your head down Oh young comic or keep your mouth shut keep your head down and don't get on anybody's bad side oh they told I did I was doing the connection and upstairs was a show with I don't trans transvestites it did I did people dressed up like guys dressed up like women bring forth it was titled a drag queens yeah yeah yeah so I go and there was no there was no heat and all the heat was in the in the middle room at the connection I got ladies baths it's going up there see some guys sing and dance and a dress freezing their ass off right halftime break before the next show and Billy comes storming in the back room at the connection he goes who's Letty clock and Steve Freud goes come with me and they take me down to Nick's and they take me now in the Sun I go you know that fucking show you're making dinner at that bag show you made fun of what we're producing that you ever say that again they'll find you dead in the fucking River do you understand oh yes I do stop it so doing no they were stone-cold killers yeah he was friends with my buddy Joe Lake who was my boxing coach and I brought Joe Lake to the show on it and there were buddies together and Joe Lake was a savage and I'm like he's friends with this guy these are animals he said he's in jail he was yeah it was a bunch of animals then and people were literally getting paid in coke oh yeah my first gig down in Florida I did a place in Sarasota it was a great weekend the guy goes honey so it's in the week two grand he goes how do you want it you want it in cash or coke and I want how about half and half then I get whacked out and with the Tampa to see Jackie the truck how did you get it I really don't know it was like I was so fucked up back then it was like time travel you know you can give me blow and booze in a car and I could end up from Sarasota to Tampa you look at that on a map that's not an easy gig that's not an easy trip no and I would just show

the high school words male strip right and they don't and I said I'm emceeing you know and I gotta do comedy between so I go Kathy is a Kathy O'Malley here your kid fell down and hurt his head fuck

fucking drivers you get Dordogne [Laughter] [Music] someone who's a crazy Rhode Island was always fun and then when Kennison when I first met Kennison out at the store I said oh my god it was like a rebel I never seen anything and I've seen everybody I said this I call him I go you gotta see this fucking guy he's nuts meds I'm bully he's like this preacher with this comedy it's insane and so uh we bring him to Boston and Nick's is the first stop fired I had to fire him after the first show why he showed up all fucked up and you know I got him some blow and he went on stage they just it's

know eat then I'd ride Rover every way Wow yeah pretty crazy yeah when I mean I would have you seen that new TV show the marvelous mrs. Mason no everyone tells me it's a great show it's a great fucking show I mean it's not historically accurate like the way they talk it's like they're doing kind of modern stand-up but they're doing modern stand-up back in those days and the woman that didn't exist like there was no woman like mrs. Mazal historically I could took a long time before I mean she was more rowdy than Lenny Bruce was in the television show but it shows you what it was like back when people are just getting arrested for saying things and it makes you realize like Lenny Bruce that fucking guy paid he paid the price and we're all benefiting from him well you know when when I first started there was one book the last laugh that was all of us about money it was no no movies no no documentaries anything and I wanted to know as much as I could about all the guys who came before me you know cuz I'd watch it I remember I saw Alan King to stand up on a TV anyway oh my it was unbelievable I said fantastic then I saw him as an actor and he's amazing and I get to work with red buttons you know I mean I mean I mean he wasn't commanding but he was really funny you know and I mean people that that came before me I knew every single one I might I'd studied them anyway and this was before YouTube and stuff I'd I just read whatever I could find on them and it was I would tell these young kids coming up I gotta look at the guys who came before you and that not interested at all you know I what I saw a Gleason Gleason was what I wanted to be I I just thought Jackie Gleason was just amazing you know and I I want to be like that guy you know because he was incredible and it was people who realize he was a stand-up you know no Gleason's it stands oh yeah one night two-ton toni collette that was giving him shit and the boxer and Gleeson tackled him and come out yeah it was incredible you know cuz I met hot Connie you know Jackie Gleason was obsessed with UFOs did you know that nah but I got kind of dig it too man that's a story this guy told it to me some guy was a rock band dude he told me the story and I don't know if it's true but the story was that Gleason was friends with Nixon Nixon said you want to see some shit yeah Nixon took him to 151 it was I don't think it was area 51 I think was hangar 18 which is a there's an Air Force Base and I think it was outside of Columbus Ohio and they they supposedly had some fucking crashed UFO there and Gleason built a replica of it or had a replica of it built in his fucking backyard in New York Wow I went to the homestead Air Force Base outside of Miami it says the actual version where are you getting this from just google it I mean it's a rumored story so I don't know yeah well I got it from a guy in a band might might be bullshit but he gave me some book on UFOs he was telling me about this and but the Jackie Gleason apparently was obsessed with UFOs well I I believe this there's got to be something out there yeah I don't were it I mean that's it no every I I did money you were so shows and I've been around the world and it was every time I thought I was in off the coast of Turkey someplace and the commander the base took me for dinner after it's and I got him drunk I got a pretty truck I was so bad stomach I'm pretty dark and I said hey man you guys let me ask you about area 51 he goes got stolen so biggest this conversation happened and he I gotta take a cab to find my way back to a nuke base that that no one knows about right so then we're uh I mean I'm at the dunes there some long ago that was and I'm with these guys in the Air Force and I they said man we really like show with fancy husband I got him drunk I say man what about every a51 and they said mr. Clark good night and they walked away so now me and Mike a golf him with these blue angels and he goes you're gonna ask Michael no the second year we golf with him again I got iPhones tell me about every 51 yeah well he goes I was flying a plane and I had malfunctioned I land there and they came out and they pretty much blind fall to me took me into a building and they fixed my jet within 35 minutes and then put me back to my city whenever here and I went oh my god so I don't know what's out there yeah but that was here's the thing that was an area where they were testing all sorts of military equipment they were testing different new like that's where the b-2 stealth bomber yeah they were testing that there and in the spy plane yeah they were testing a lot of shit yeah yeah so there was a lot of top-secret stuff there right didn't necessarily happy aliens I understand that and I'm hopeful trying to find out i but I'd love to go there man oh man but you can't even try if you drive up there Joe by the time you get your camera out there they're on you yeah tell you what you get out of here we'll lock you up you know it's it's not good so they don't even go there anymore they've moved to a new area they've they've actually because it's so heavily scrutinized because of Google Earth and all sorts of different ways you can see things they've actually moved to another area but I read I read everything I could find about that too and I think I think I read the book area 51 two years ago and basically at the end of the book it was like Hitler had these you know his guys experimenting with the Jews and cut and put their arms on different ways and had a had an aircraft that was looked like a spaceship and it crashed and his people came out with him crazy answers but they're aliens and that was in the book you know so they can't shut the shit out of it I know they'd Hitler did experiment with some sort of disk type ever gotten off the ground yeah what the deal was but the most interesting stories the story of Robert Lazar Bob Lazar who was a guy who worked at area 51 and he got fired because his wife was cheating on him and they were recording all of his phone calls and taping all those conversations and they found out that his wife was cheating on him they thought that he was gonna be emotionally unstable and so they didn't tell him why they just released him so then he brings friends to watch these what he said was were alien crafts that they were experimenting with and they were flying these things around that had some super advanced propulsion system that they were asking him to help back engineer and he brought friends do that and then they got arrested for doing that and when he did that then he started talking about it so he's been discredited by a bunch of people but I don't know who's telling the truth he says that they they wiped his college record so the new one but people said they went to school with them and he definitely did work for the government but under what capacity who knows but his story's fascinating and you know I want it to be true oh yeah you hear it you want it to be Joe they used to fly the team of people that worked at area 51 from Burbank yeah every day Flyman they'd work and then fly him back it's like they didn't stay over well there was that one airport outside of Vegas it was right outside like that where the Riviera was yeah you can actually look out and see the airport and they would fly them the people from there but it's like mark Jets yeah I wanted to be sure of course yeah you want it to be true we flew up we would we did once dynamo Bay and Wow it was amazing I would Colin Quinn Greg Geraldo who's a little kid on billions Mike Birbiglia yeah and Gaffigan Gavin and someone else I don't we flew in like a CIA plane and we did the show Jesus Christ yeah yeah it was pretty pretty amazing and I tailored my show to the marine set with it he's a young guy and during the week they said basically I could really lifted the morale of everyone it's just uh what do you wanna do I want to go over to the presidents you know not actually do it scream at dimension oh we can't have that you know I did but anyway we do the show and we'll even like three days later and I get to the airport I'm the first one day and I see this little 8 seater plane and I go so to spanish-speaking guys Campania nobody no-nobody right so I go into the gift shop and I buy a giant like water thing so I get I can piss in it and the guy shop who wants piss we're gonna play and we fly it only took a second I were to fly in this was a four hour flight in a eight -
