the Joe Rogan experience what was that kid like I mean it was it was frustrating they didn't like cuz it I started when he started Late Night with Jimmy found I was one of the first guys there and they didn't like any of my jokes like it was just it was it was whom ossible to mean or just like this is gonna make Jimmy unlikable like it wasn't about being funny so much it's like coming off as smart and and friendly you know and likeable that they that's what I was there for a year and then they barely used anything I ever did but they knew I was funny they liked me and I thought for some reason in my head I thought that if I quit before a year that it'll like follow me people like what happened with Fallon well you only there a year that like and then I when I left it was like no one would have given a shit if I'd left after ten weeks you know wouldn't have mattered at all yeah it was it was good an interesting experience but I did not enjoy it being a writer for other people's voices has got to be very difficult it's I mean for me it's impossible it's like I write in my voice and you either like it or you don't like I've written for Jimmy Kimmel Sarah Silverman and if I loved a joke they loved it too but with Fallon it was not the case you know he was it was almost never okay he might he may he would laugh at the joke but he but I can't say this I can't do it what are they trying to do what is he trying to do he's trying to be like middle America like there's a not a market for that right is that what it is he just wants everyone to love him you know he just wants everyone to everyone to love him that's like not a bad trait to having a late-night host right probably the best trait to have ana late-night host mm-hmm I'd like to see him drunk one day just shitting on everybody though I think that'd be hilarious his Louis doesn't do that oh yeah I mean I've heard that he quit drinking I know that's true but he would like he liked to get drunk and like in like shitty bars and like hang out and like with the with the staff and the crew like he was he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink he wanted to go out and go to some weird bar there was like in a subway that no one knew about and have beers like he was a he was a fun drunk you know but he did a lot yeah there was always those rumors that he's got a problem Jimmy Fallon's got a problem yeah yeah do you think that's like the pressure of just being this like super friendly sweet guy on TV wanting everybody to love you they like oh my god get me a fucking drink so I can cut loose I'm think that could be part of it you know that's why I was always thought like with my persona like let's be the meanest person you can so you can it allows you to be nice offstage the other thing too is that how would you let's just say things are going to shit really quickly right right there's a nuclear power plant that's gonna blow up any second now any second how would you are you like I know you're an outdoorsy guy you hunt you kill harvest as they say sorry how long do you think you could survive if things went to shit really quickly if you have to survive you have all the money you want right mm-hmm but like how long you think you could survive in the wilderness it would be very hard it's not easy and not only that you got to get through the winter so you're gonna have to build some sort of a shelter but is it water there's no winter here that was there I mean that's in LA but in Big Bear which is only a couple hours in northern here yeah I mean there's plenty of places we could drive in a couple hours you could go to Big Bear and then you can go down to the beach you could experience the desert yeah you could experience a lot of different climates it would really depend upon where you were stuck and what what you would eat so the thing is if you want to stay in the LA area you're dead because you're not gonna be able to eat shit there's nothing here would you stay in your look would you my great give your kids why you got to get out of here so you'd leave you drive your Tesla right which cars no way what no way it was a big debate that I had if in a crisis situation right uh-huh would you take the test Oh what would you take what would you take I have a Toyota Landcruiser with a v8 gallon gas - oh yeah I got a apocalypse mobile but so now I was I got I got shit on so much for this I said the same exact things I listened in a no-shit situation I would leave the tussle behind who argued with you about that a lot of people I leave it behind I take my pickup truck yeah Tacoma that's right deal with gas 500 as well you know in the emergency crisis situation you don't have access to the gap what if the gasoline didn't work the liquor store you fill it up with alcohol will run where we had the hurricane in Florida well now every was saying like you have that the gas pumps wouldn't work because the electricity was shut off but the supercharged is still working you could get to your destination still unlike Tesla's use less energy it's like at the end of the day I happened to pick up truck with like two shotguns and like five things the gasoline and be fine I don't understand that yeah they also make tanks that you can put in your gas tank in your of the bed of your truck where there are like these survival tanks as far as you want in your mouth yeah and they more and they drive thousands of miles there's a guy who actually there was a podcast that I was listening to this guy who is like an extreme prepper and he actually made a trip with one tank of gas yeah from Arizona to Canada damn he drove all the way up to Canada all the way across with one tank of gas because this massive tank in the back of his pickup truck right feeds directly into his primary gas tank yeah yeah and you can get these they're like these survival tanks and you know the hosts like hundreds of gallilee you're also a target I probably should I probably shoot it the guy's car do that I don't know how sudden you're Lawler the lights go off for five minutes want to kill everyone you're starting fires shooting cars yeah so so then alright so you leave you take your family right have your kids of your wife wait where you gonna go you hop in your Land Cruiser where you gonna go you have a real pal what are you gonna bring you well you would have to bring things to start a fire and things to kill animals right those are the things that it would be very important I would bring guns right I bring bows I'd bring ammunition and arrows but I would realistically realize that first of all I'm not gonna make more bullets and I'm not gonna make more arrows am I gonna do and how long am I gonna last camping marijuana no okay no no I'll be just trying to stay alive yeah but you'd also be trying to stay alive for a long period of time right you might want to bring it that's the paints no really what no it's not gonna that I mean marijuana for pain relief I mean I guess it works yeah that's not what I use a pain at night the impending doom years yeah you'd be freaking out even more I'm freaking out plenty I just can't wait to the day where they can do it genetically where a woman really becomes a woman like a man becomes a woman or a woman becomes a man but guess what even if they do here's the issue if you knew that a woman took steroids for 30 years and developed insane tendon strength and muscle strength and then stopped doing steroids it is a scientific fact that you are going to keep a very big percentage of those gains what are the game what is the percentage at 30% at 40% whatever the fuck it is whatever percentage that you would keep after you get off the steroids that is significant and even if you're not currently on these performance-enhancing drugs your body has been artificially boosted to this superior level through these drugs yeah and you lose a lot of the feminine you know you lose the breasts yes and that might not come back well I mean I think if you take estrogen there probably Carl right I don't know a fucking doctor I'm a moron but what I do know is when this is we're in nonsense land yeah okay it's not it's not saying that someone can't become a woman and be a woman and call them a woman I'll treat him like a woman I'm cool with it I'm a hundred percent cool with it right I mean as open-minded as I come with this but this is this is unfair for women which is what's so ironic about this yeah because everyone's supposed to be looking out for women if you're looking out for women but you're also blindly progressive to the point where you let and shit like this fly well now you're not looking out for women right because now women are in this weird position where you putting them at an unfair disadvantage right fucking crazy I agree was it the first one yeah that was 43 and 51 days 43 marathons in a row in 51 days with no training either definitely I did have training about 6 weeks training yeah which is not a lot but they did they said that you know sometimes if you run a marathon you should train for nine months before that you know and I thought well if I'm gonna do 43 that's gonna be I won't be training forever I can't be bothered with that so I but you know and this happened in your Civil War in maybe in any war I don't quite encyclopedic about yours over warned and revolution motivating but it's world war two but try on the spot training you know training as you go along that's what I did the first ten Matins trains you for the next 33 what was it like when you go over the first day though the first marathon is okay fuck my first days okay because well it's all in your head there's a more mental than it is physical and so the first math that I've heard of people running marathons run walk stagger not very fast we'll get it done boom the second marathon is we cuz you go I've done one I'm on the second and you can't really rejoice you can't punch the sky you can't put a medal around your neck you already you got up at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning and you're it's midday and you're you're going through your second one then get through the third one and then you through the fourth one and then it was raining and my feet was shredding and all of the moisture it was yes it made it too soft you know and they were rubbing on the on the running shoes and I didn't know however how do I fix it when I'm actually wearing on it all the time so we started bathing it in surgical spirit which you call something else it's a it's an ethanol methanol anyways it's some sort of alcoholic spirit and it it takes the moisture out of your feet and so stones it's come out which a anyway if anyone doesn't have some surgical spare if you google it now you'll see what it's called in America but it's it's some sort of alcoholic thing that just removes moisture and so it made my feet my toes like little stones and kind of tough and actually that got us through and then I started and also apparently because I did 27 marathons in 27 days in South Africa in 2016 and that was the temperatures were crazy on that but it seems that the body will switch on a healing property that we've got latent in ourselves that we don't use and you will heal quicker you will heal faster the more you get so I got so you get stronger both the British one and the South African one I got stronger as I went on really the first 10 days are the other key thing and after that it's kind of easier you're used to it your body just adapts and he understands yep this crazy asshole yeah so and the brain goes what kind of mouth and shall we run today as opposed to what kind of marathon yeah well I think that's what the brain is doing cuz the first day that is going you're gonna do what this marathon but be okay the second day the brain is going now we're gonna we're doing another one third day fourth day fifth day this is insane and then day ten the brain is going okay you're on this kind of kick or something I understand let's let's try better Mathis don't push it too hard you know you the brain starts talking to the body and somehow it levels out roundabout main then it gets surreal math at 18 math and 23 I remember marathon 31 just so weird there's a lot of there are subconscious behaviors that go on time why are people so goddamn crazy I don't know trauma you know that Carl Jung is it the Carl Jung fucking the line that says that which we don't work out in our subconscious we will act out as fate in our lives how about that cuz you will relive patterns you'll relive trauma you will relive these patterns and you'll do it on your own terms and you'll wonder why you keep far why do you keep dating the same person why do you keep falling into the same problem why after two years does this go bad what what is that well there's a way to actually creatively at least sit with that and observance and be aware of it that's what therapy does your kiss you may the unconscious conscious that will direct your life and you will call it fate what a great quote Wow until you make the unconscious conscious yeah I mean there's a lot of fucking strings going on it will direct your life and you will call it fate knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people yeah well that's you that's why I like Nietzsche niches niches idea was like look man you can have these false models of life which is a lot of times life is a bitch right and you're not gonna you're not gonna be a computer you don't want it so what you'll do is you'll go it's okay meek will inherit the earth that's alright now you have money but is he happy is he happy you know there's a lot but we make all of us do this we make excuses to not live our best life and he was like man live dangerously and try to be the best you can be just work your ass off and if you have to die if you have to take risks and die leave a good-looking corpse is the idea of turn your life into a fucking circus [Applause]
