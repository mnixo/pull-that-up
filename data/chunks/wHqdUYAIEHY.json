the gyro can experience my friend was taking the adderall but the drop-off at the end of the day was too much for him it's really starting to drive him crazy because he would feel great throughout the day be very productive and then he'd have this big drop-off well that's when you start your drinkin that's cocktail hour I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that at all but I am saying a lot of people who get a lot of shit done or taking adderall no shit I just clean out I just clean out my closets which I have never done in my whole fucking life because I can't focus to do that you know but like I said fucking I'm I'm I add well I'm planning these fucking closets I'm half shit in there from 25 fucking years that I was afraid to throw out I count it I had something like 1,700 black plain black t-shirts wow I know how did you count those all I want to gave up after the first couple of hundred because I was donating on wow that's incredible well I'm not gonna do that again that's when I that was pre adderall behavior that was pre honoring yeah adderall made me see oh shit I had enough fucking black t-shirts so adderall give you clarity why my fucking kids like that I put you rehab give me shit about my fucking hair all Tommy's like Mac no it's not like I've never done math except for you know two times I'd marry Tom Arnold but aside from that you know now I would never get into math think it's nothing like adderall I think they've got it down to where it's very effective for a lot of people I'll tell you one thing it's real effective because I got in the back and forth of everything to wade mirror thing going on yeah it made me I I used to bite my nails so bad you know I liken down to nothing cuz my dad he did it too and and but I quit for a long time that I went on adderall and I started biting my nails and then I had to keep it down to only two nails that I could bite I allow myself to bite only to Nate but it perfected my fucking nail biting tears because there's like no nail left at all and I get really good at it so good at it now but you give yourself two nails do you have specific nails yeah these two are my biters so adderall let you save your other eight fingers essentially but it kind of forced me to do these to them hmm so it's bad it's good and bad but I have clean closets and you know what I learned final draft tell you learned it from that to write scripts I was able to fucking focus great software yeah I think there's a lot of things going on there's a lot of things going on this life and I think we should acknowledge all of them you know we should acknowledge the most importantly the mystery of it all that's one of the big things that drives me crazy about someone when they say you know that this is this and that is that and the you know the way you should live is this and the way the government should do is that and the way we're gonna solve this is by that like maybe not maybe not like are you really so sure that you're paying attention to what the fuck is going on we're flying through space like we're on a spaceship if the spaceship was a hundred feet wide you'd be freaking the fuck out right now the only reason why you're not freaking out is because it's like thousands of miles wide but it's still a spaceship you're on a spinning fucking thing and at nighttime you could see the space you're flying through and you're spending a thousand miles an hour in a circle and you're floating around this giant nuclear explosion and that's around other bigger rocks that are flying behind you and gas giants and then other galaxies and other universes and on and on and on and you're just hurtling through it while you're worried about what's on TV and why The Walking Dead has so many commercials and why gasses for two hours and if you imagine if this was let's say put yourself in a position where this really was a dream and you had a lucid dream where you're aware you know is that what you would want to do with your dream if you're going to sleep at night and you were saying you would worry about all of these inane things never actually be in the present moment never take an adventure never go on a risk never love because you could get hurt no if you if this if you really did treat this like a dream you would do as much cool shit as possible you know what has put as many good things into that dream as you possibly could and not not be so fucking stressed out about all this nonsense you know and and I think we've been talking a lot it's kind of been the theme of this podcast but if you actually did if this was a lucid dream you know you would live it in a different way you would live it to have some fun and enjoy you like what can I fly so my lucid dreams I want to fly or breathe underwater breathe underwater is cool - that's a good one yeah it would be very strange if one day as it was proven that we are really living in some sort of self created reality it would be like really traumatizing for a lot of people that have fucked it up like this is what I made but it's like remember when you were in school and like there was a project and you had to use your hand to make a turkey and you put your hand down and he drew around and then you know everybody did their own little turkey painted it and then the teacher would put them up and they would all look at him some people's turkeys look like dogshit it looked I didn't know what the fuck a turkey looked like they didn't even know how to draw around their hand like everything was a disaster and other people had beautiful turkeys well your life is a work of art your life is like a hand turkey that you make in grade school it's you could do whatever you want with that thing you can make it super dope no no you can you can make it so it looks really cool if you put the effort and time into it if you really focus on it or you could just half-ass that motherfucker and draw a bunch of squiggly things don't look anything like fingers some eyeballs that are floating above a stupid fake turkey head yeah and everybody's like what the fuck's wrong with Bob I think one of the one of the coolest pieces that I've seen and I have to go to the bathroom so I don't know if you want about but it's Alan it's called Alan Watts inception is the name of the video on Google oh yeah so that's a great video yeah
