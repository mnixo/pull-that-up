guy looks like Chuck Norris and asuna was a him this is Chuck Norris and we look like what and he brought him to train he did training few years back at the Gracie school in Babylon it's a long story then he said train AFER's and when he stood 20 fires we become very good friends it was amazing like something right away he invited us to his house and he's a great guy me an amazing persister hanging out and by that time I remember his to make a movie one movie a year he worked for six months make a movie and he has six months off when we met him he was six months off literally he trains every day but when he trained he doesn't go home we have lunch he hangs out got your movie they suddenly become good friends then one day he after few months after train office he invited us to the valley where he used to live in and soon and said look I have surprise for you guys then he took us to a shopping center right on Ventura Boulevard and he shows a have a gift for you guys and he shows us a one of the unities mats red is like a school then he said look this is for you guys that's your school then we look at to him like for Ventura Boulevard run on the streets I said check I don't think we can afford that is there none don't worry that's my building you guys have to pay anything I just want to make sure I don't have to drive there one on one and four or five drive that Redondo Drive and he gave this cool to us like what can I tell more about his guy that's know and that's why we have this school in the valley because he used to live in Encino the schools in Encino then we stuck coming here then here we are Joe Hogan Tarzan came by to our school yeah that's amazing wow what a great guy if you got into the office and you found out something about aliens if you found out something about UFOs would you let us know well tell you my wife would demand that I let you know is your wife a UFO not actually lot of UFOs no it's just birdy what is going on y'all better access the records you don't have any access okay you let us know though all right I'll be on the ship world outside all the show house Lee's all right you know you know what bothers me when people pretend to be ignorant of something and they're not how so well when people like like for example with this like there's something like oh we can use this to to create some dislike against neil degrasse tyson or what it's generally it's generally politicians do it right when they they say something and they're like oh I didn't know that was offensive or right it's like yes you did but you know your followers didn't you see what I mean like you can give me any time I'm trying to trying to think of an example okay well well with the mass shootings right so that sort of whole thing of saying that Trump's tweets had nothing to do with it yes they did yes now they date it indirectly but yeah it did normalize and this guy used the same language of the you know invasion etc so you can't say that it's completely unrelated you know I mean you can't you can't don't pretend and again it's not saying directly but but you can't pretend there's no connection right right and they're actually pulls its quotes there are people who are intelligent enough to know that but they'll say no no there's no K and it's like yes there is and you know they were don't feign ignorance that's what I mean right well you know the guy in Dayton who really fucked up one was that guy's an Elizabeth Warren supporter who actually wrote about gun control I mean he was just a horrific suit homicidal fucking yeah psychopath and listen that you have to have some there has to be something wrong with you to do that you're like even you know it's regardless of your political beliefs there has to be something wrong with you but you can be sparked you can be egged on sure yeah by the words of leaders or political people or powerful people and people of influence perfect way to put it yet people of influence and that's why I think people of influence have to be responsible in what they say yeah you know but but this but neil degrasse tyson this is a different thing I think this is just a case of a scientist pointing out information without you know like like you know you're talking about earlier dorks nerds whatever you want to say that where it's like yeah well this is just information I'm not trying to be emotional in people like well you have to be I'm happy just connect you even though you're from a lab environment you have to understand not everyone is but that's not that's a one of the more uncomfortable things about today with social media as if there's a bunch of people that are really just they're just authoritarian they're they're they demand certain types of behavior and they do so under the guise of compassion they do so under like they're trying to enforce the way people communicate like the Neil deGrasse Tyson thing this you use there's no indication whatsoever that he was minimizing the deaths but pretending that he's doing so do you know there's people really in the Bigfoot sexually there's like all these novels written about big thing just good day to tall Armenian no no that hard they ever go to Glendale everywhere go to the Galleria there's this Bigfoot this is a very localized reference there's Bigfoot you want it a Bigfoot or eyes you get it Bigfoot erotica yeah I mean it's like really common what if you had a small deck like you always hear about the really tall guys with the tiny dicks and when I say hear about them you hear about this you look at this seduced by Bigfoot like it come for Bigfoot Virginia Wade big fairy is by Lolita young wait a minute narrated I mean this is an audio book you know what they say the bigger the Bigfoot the bigger the error in the bones what is that I like a guy with a really hairy dick you know like you like people say listen people say they don't like too much hair on balls I say get it all the way under the shaft look at this absolutely buffing Bigfoot what is happening I like that name Zanna wait wait wait gay Bigfoot look at this last row and I'll probe what is gay Bigfoot look he's smoke I'm sorry after he fucked look at that what the fuck a mouthful of sasquatch I've met that man like one of the door guys at the Communists burger that's one of the what door guys I got fired this is a whole genre of erotica there's a bunch of women that write these books this is Virginia Wade lady is uh she's apparently very prolific with her Bigfoot erotica she wrote he's quite a few of these how many does she have that was 13 at least 13 come for Bigfoot come for Bigfoot number 13 just make shit up then there I was walking the dog and the dog had a heart attack and next thing Bigfoot's dick is in
