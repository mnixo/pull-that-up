hello Alonzo what is up Joe good to see my brother man it is so good to be back it's my first time seeing the new joint it's absolutely amazing yeah I thought you'd been here the new spot no like I said you were building this when I did the last one and this this is when you said you could do everything here it's like yeah this is the bunker I don't live that far from here come on so when the bomb hits I'm like yeah I'm going to Joe spot well if you live in here in the neighborhood you want to use the gym it's always open bank come on down I'll bring canned goods purifiers yeah if the shit hits the fan Bernie had me nervous Bernie Sanders was just here he had me nervous about climate change whenever someone brings up climate change it's like a bill that you didn't pay like fuck yeah it's it's real and okay so now I'm gonna do my first shameless plug for my new special August 23rd on Amazon Prime it's one of the new wave of Amazon's yes I'm very excited about this yeah they're they're testing the water so it's good to be in so it's called heavy lightweight and I call it that because I do some heavy topics and then I mix it in with lightweight shit cuz that's like if you do all heavy like it's it's wow that was depressing yeah and you know and I talk about the climate change thing but it's like to be honest like look I'm a black man 57 I got what like 10 years left I'll give a shit like statistically god bless you Millennials I wish you luck but I had a good run no so man it was amazing 456 thank you yeah and don't crack it well and this is why I talk about right up until the day it does right so like like literally right til the day before I die look great and what happens some bitch died from what black Ben black his whole life shit just caught up with him you got the fucking diabetes sickle-cell and high blood pressure in the same day a wave of malady but no but the the climate change thing is real but I think the big problem is it's slow it's not dramatic so people it's easy to not think about it because you know that yet oceans rising but it's inch a year right which you know I may not that may not be exact but you know what I mean it's not a lot right so people don't people don't see it with the urgency and that and I think that's why you have the young Congress people talking about it because they're like hey this is gonna be in our lifetime right but then you have the older generation where it's think yeah you know it's interesting I'm pretty sure and we should check this make sure this is correct and I think we learned about this from Randall Carlson that the increased co2 rates also increases vegetation because vegetation and greenery they right yeah the the increased rates actually this is like one of the greenest times ever yeah but I wonder how does that offset versus the there's less land for these plants to grow on you know what I mean like so when you look at like mmm rain forests jungles things like that like there's the opposite of that was it's a that it makes it harder for it to grow but we know what article says that and is there any articles that say that's not the case because it seems like that's not something randall would lie about he was talking about how this is like one of the most green times ever and the increase of forests and and green trees I want to say cus I'm seeing both of them then so the very first things that pop up are high carbon levels make it harder for plants to grow from Think Progress second thing increased carbon dioxide levels and air restrict plants ability to absorb nutrients it's from science G USC it's of another country I think Sweden then I think progress sounds like a bunch of fucking hippies NASA says though well it's making a greener for now yes so I would buy that the thing about the thing and it didn't miss funny like what science you have to check because you have to see if there's a political agenda you have to see if there's a political agenda behind the science right yeah sure well wouldn't ask I'd go with what NASA says I think they're they say go scroll back up please co2 is making the earth greener for now and then a quarter to half of Earth's vegetated lands have shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide according to a new study published in the journal for natural climate change on April 25th ya see an international team of 32 offered authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort which involved using satellite data from NASA's moderate resolution imaging spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very high-resolution rady radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index or the amount of leaf cover over the planets vegetated regions the greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in areas to two times the continental United States blah blah blah so Randall was right I think but I think either way we're fucked and then we'll just be we'll all die in a very green planet how much if everything melts if the polar ice caps melt like where can we live in South Dakota oh shit I don't know I don't think so I'll make it in I don't keep inside you know I don't think so like like you know they want California to fall into the ocean right you always hear that bit right city it's like yeah and the tidal wave will kill you yeah you know I mean I don't know I don't think that's safe because it would be such a drastic change I mean right so much of the Earth's weather is controlled by the polar ice caps and magnetic poles the the rainfall you know glaciers and it's all interconnected right so when the Hurricanes are getting stronger right right specular yeah so if you lose like the oceans control the Earth's climate because the war you know having to do it evaporation and and so on so anyway for sure you shouldn't be getting weather information from you or me listen we got to to expert scientist here even we've been talking about this for minutes but no it's it's um it's real yeah but it but it is something I think it's definitely younger people are gonna be more interested because it could be a major thing like if you're 30 now when you're 60 this could be a real real big issue it's a bad time to buy real estate in Miami no you don't well you know when is a good time to buy real estate you found out you have stage 4 cancer but you do have a large bag you know I love that you mention that because it this has been a thing so the the weed industry being legal right and they say there's all this money that people can't figure out what to do with right the banks don't want it's like Miami was built with cocaine money what happened to those money laundering guys who cleaned up all of that money built all that real estate like where are they now different era I can't believe that there's not people out there who can figure out how to clean this weed money and boost the economy they will be able to figure it out but it's gonna take a long time and the people that are trying to figure it out right now like the the weed dealers that are selling it legally but then they have all the stockpiles of cash they've had their have to uh they hire hire mercenaries and they hire Blackwater guys at shit fucking special ops guys to watch their money they really have to I'm my old condo I rent it out right so I was renting to a guy his business was he handled the credit card transactions for the weed places for the dispensaries and stuff and that you know the bank shut him down and this and he didn't pay the rent late and I was like I got the only guy in the weed business who can't make money like I'm renting too there's one guy in weed who can't I was like listen man I take cash just pay the rent late like how do you everybody's behind it selling weed on credit cards and you can't pay your rent how I end up with this guns are people flying here to get some weed in my guy nothing you know what really took it on the fucking chin is Amsterdam remember when people are talking about going to Amsterdam let's go to hims to get high yeah get high here stupid right these windows up that's true they still got the line of you see of like a video montage of all the guys coming into this yeah just over the last couple weeks Joe just ruined Amsterdam tourism yeah the Amsterdam tourist board is like why is he picking on us what did we do fights over there but they fucked up when they made mushrooms illegal they stopped people from selling mushrooms and the cafes now is that because is why would they do I don't understand why they would do that because I don't want to say it's regulate but no it's dorks go over there and blow their brains out they eat too many mushrooms and freak out and try to jump in the river and yeah that's what it is dorks it's always dorks they ruin everything yeah you know it's it's weird it's weird to me because it's like listen if you can't heck get a handle on your drug tourism yeah just don't do it but I don't know it could be done correctly I think if you want to do drug tourism correctly first of all you need to check people make sure they're okay find out what kind of medication they are and do a blood test on them find out what kind of medication oh look at your on SSRIs you can even tell us hey stupid you're not supposed to take this stuff right this is gonna fuck you up next yeah and it really really test them then you know find out about their psychological history and start them off with a nice light dose today today's Tuesday today we're going to give a nice light dose like a half a gram yeah that would be it just just yeah you know this is how much you get I don't see how you react exactly and then then come back on Wednesday right you think about it for 24 hours come back on Wednesday and Wednesday we're gonna give you two grams yeah baby got got to cut you off yeah and then you come back on Saturday and you get that five oh yeah just do it right with doctors nearby and IVs filled with vitamins I'm sure that's why they don't cuz who's gonna pay for all of that part it works you know it's same door if you had like if you could save up your money and have like a real safe mushroom trip like a legit safe mushroom trip at a medical institution where they've got everything locked down and everybody's safe and the mushrooms are safe and you have people to pay why I haven't done mushrooms but would that fur no you want right now no thanks man you know I'm retired now you know that from everything yeah yeah yeah yeah we talked about this like when did you retire 88 Wow yeah that's crazy I mean you know no no I you know I've been high enough that I don't feel like I'm missing anything so when you talk about it it's like fascinating to me but that but then it's also that case of like now like I don't want to be that high you know what I mean but and again I I don't knock what anyone else does but this is what I wanted to ask you if you did it under those medically supervised conditions would it still be as much fun yeah it's fun no matter what as long as they leave you alone while you're tripping yeah long as they don't bother you you know okay that I mean I I say I have no idea I have no frame of reference so I can't say like that would be you know not be cool what I don't know fuck with CBD at all no it doesn't get you high yeah I know and and I don't again I don't knock it I don't necessarily have a reason to fuck with CBD I'm not in like any kind of pain or anything like that or any you know but I don't knock it as a treatment I know it does work and then there's benefits to it it's just not something you need that I need or that I do you know it's like the knees right to need my knees are kind of trash but when I work out and stretch and warm them up they're not it's not bad and I've talked to doctor and doctor like yeah eventually we're gonna do a knee replacement but you don't need it you know knees arthritis just you know you don't have to do a knee replacement yeah dem stem cells which is something I may do my mom did it I know I've heard you talk about it and that might be the way as a matter of fact I have a friend and she's like in her she's around 80 and she said yeah that's what they did for her knee they did stem so my mom had her knees replaced before she passed away and she said yeah that's one of the things you inherited from us bad knees it's like in the fans like thank you but but she also made me funny so I couldn't really be mad at her she did great so I was like I'll take the funny and the bad knees the bad knees are workable yeah I'm telling you CBD first of all is gonna help that because it reduces the all the symptoms of arthritis like Dave Foley his hands were fucked up he had like some severe arthritis in his hands CBD completely cured it he clearly straighten his hands out his hands were always at like a slight Bend now now he's got a full range of motion in his hands he's blown away by it yeah my knee problem is impact you know just Paul or basketball Haskett ball yeah so even the meniscus and all that's right all trashed so even now like I can do most like I can't jump you know I can run I can do so I did this CrossFit I tried CrossFit and my knees fall up and I went to my doctor and he's like cross what the hell is wrong you jumping up on boxes my my my doctor's diagnosis for 90% of my problems you're old don't do that you can you can fix a lot of those problems with stem cells a lot of those problems yeah it regenerates tissue reduces inflammation it does a lot of amazing stuff now and and I haven't researched this at all I mean you know I've heard stuff my stem cell knowledge is about equal to my climate change right I've actually had a bunch done on me well this is what I wanted to ask you about so I know when you talked about it early on you went overseas right you left that was my question because I've heard people talking about going to Panama Panama Asia yeah they're doing over there but dr. Reardon who's the guy who treated Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad he actually treated my mom my mom was in risk of a knee replacement you know she's in pretty you know pretty bad pain and the doctors like you got to get an e replace and I'm like okay maybe you have to get a knee replacement Michael but before you do that let's send you to Panama and they'll they'll do this full three-day stem-cell procedure they use IV stem cells they they they blast the area over three different days they hit it with stem cells mm-hmm and you know my mom is 73 so it was a while before it worked she you know for the first four months she was a little discouraged she like I don't feel anything different you know I don't know if this is working and then somewhere around five six months she started feeling a lack of pain and the pain just start stop gonna just stop being like a part of her daily life right and now she could walk and it's not bothering her she was I'm walking with no pain I can walk up hills with no pain and she goes I want to do it again so I was like fuck it let's send you down again sir she's she's headed down again to get more of it but you did it here yeah I did it here well I think now is there a difference yes they can they can go ham in Panama they go ham they just bring a fucking bucket of stumps there's they don't have the same regulation right they do in America so they can get away with a lot of different stuff and dr. Reardon who is one of the pioneers of this and he's written multiple papers and yes you know scientific journals all about the benefits of stem cells and it's particularly effective on people with neurological conditions people with neurodegenerative diseases of like and he's written extensively about all that stuff but when he came on I mean he he blew me away and I had already had some success with stem cells in America where like I had a full-length rotator cuff tear in my shoulder right and they injected it with exosomes which is like the most advanced form of stem so these who was the waste they used to think is stem cells they felt like when you put stem cells into it injury that the stem cells were repro liberating this area with new tissue but now they think that the stem cells I'm sure I'm butchering butchering that's if you're scientist now I think they think the stem cells are releasing exosomes and that the exosomes are actually what does it so now they just go straight to exosomes and then they inject exosomes into these particular areas now they have another product called Wharton's jelly that's even more potent that I just got shot into me yeah anytime I get an injured man I just fucking head on down yeah what's the purpose of having money if I'm not fucking shooting myself up but okay you go juicy stem cells you go it works I hope I got stem cell cash I probably do you do it's not that yeah no I do medium listen Amazon special no I do I listen I do all right tell people I do or I don't make as much as they think but I do all right you know what I mean it's just like when people see you on something oh well you got ten million dollars like no I don't I'd like to but I don't but but yeah so okay what we'll talk about that we'll talk about special my pusher right job I hope so you know it I mean you know me I've been in the biz forever I love the biz I loved it I loved it I appreciate the love you give me on the podcast people always tell me when you or some guests oh yeah man they were talking about you you know and and I appreciate that right Kay rs1 said a long time ago respect will outlast cache yeah you know so I appreciate that I appreciate you too man but yeah it'd be nice to have something blow up like that right I think you can so many times it it happens in careers so uh well they're doing a lot of specials now the guy Gaffigan is doing yeah Amazon Russell Peters doing Amazon you who else someone uh Jimmy o Yang's got one yes coming up team have Amazon Fahim Anwar does he have an Amazon but there's a lot of like really funny people that are doing it and as long as they put the money into promotion and let people know I mean they're they're doing great right now with marvelous mrs. Mazal yeah they have a lot of new Amazon Prime series like that fleabags supposed to be hilarious they have a lot of good series that they're promoting that people are really getting into and if you have Amazon Prime like you order shit with Amazon you get free you get friends on TV TV yeah people don't even know that I know I know and it's good yeah Amazon is is legit good show you know yeah so I'm rooting for them 100% yeah and there's you know look Netflix as almost I mean they've got the market kind of cornered until Amazon came along because nobody wanted to do in Montcalm me central anymore Comedy Central's great it's better than no special but it airs once that's the problem Comedy Central there's once and then it's not in this day and age man I think I think HBO is still the big one you know as far as television yeah yeah as far as the TV one hour like a channel is good but Showtime was good to me Showtime put on a couple of specials well Showtime ladies a bastion Oh Big John made Sebastian because he just clicked with yeah with the wit and it's it's funny how that happens cuz you really can't say why yeah you know that certain ones doing and that's no disrespect to Sebastian it's just yes certain things take off and others don't and it's like well I mean it was really good like I say no disrespect to him no Sebastian he's a great comic he's been around he's worked you know I mean it's not like he has fell out of the sky got a special and didn't have anything behind it now the guy's a comic he's brief for him who well you know who blew off my show Tom Gallagher the last guy that blew up on Showtime before Sebastian right think about it yeah when who the fuck else it's like Sebastian and Gallagher there's the guys who blew up on Showtime can you think who else yeah that's uh comedy-wise Dana Gould had a special on Showtime who alts what should they did Showtime did a few like Billy Gardell had the new comics thing he did he tried to break some new comics or now like a Rodney Dangerfield mm-hm and but yeah you're right yeah it's but again it that's where that's where our business like this business is fickle right because they're always trying to figure out you know why is this a viral video you know I mean like man that squirrel got more view we spent eight million dollars producing this series and that squirrel got more views than we you know and it's like why yeah if you're just trying to concentrate on making things viral you will go fucking crazy yeah you can't figure out you know why people are connect to this one thing even though others have done it or stun something similar or whatever yeah yeah it's a tricky fucking business and then how about YouTube like Russell Peters blew up because of YouTube absolutely worldwide boom unbelief and and you know people and it's funny cuz people here they don't realize how famous Russell is what's okay he's not that famous he's not as famous here no he can hang out over here yeah go places and he lives here right he's I've got the best of both worlds some of the fucker sold out the o2 arena two nights in a row I know thanks like 20,000 plus people you know who's like that Jimmy Carr you know John oh sure yeah he's hilarious yeah Jimmy's hilarious and like internationally Jimmy is the most unbelievable but here like they check his ID yeah you know like he'd pull out the black card maybe like you see your ID yeah I mean he does roast those roast shows over here yeah and stuff along those lines but yeah he doesn't have Neil but he's working here moron yeah he's developing heat I saw him in Montreal and he said yeah he's developing his audience in the state so now he's doing like small theatres here he says obviously if he goes anywhere where people from the UK are like so when he's in a big city and there's a lot of Brits then he can bail out like New York Abbas yeah he's a great writer oh man that guy's funny sharp just yeah and so so British like so dry and completely inappropriate yes yeah you know that's what I love about him we we do in in Montreal we do this benefit show for hope and cope and it's like a read have medical facility you know there's some cancer patients in there and people at other and and Jimmy just opens like yeah I gotta hurry up and or how much well I have time they just they fell out you know and he's like any of you here last year now probably not anyway at this point most comics go to Montreal to hang out with all the calm oh absolutely we call it summer camp man yeah you see yeah you know yeah you see friends and and like I see him there every summer right and then you see people who you just don't see or don't bump into you know regularly in your regular whatever and you get to hang out yeah and then there's always new people you meet like this year I met Nick Kroll who was cool he's grand you know cuz I like big mouth is his cartoon and Pete Holmes and Pete Holmes was hilarious cuz he was doing this thing at the roast called mean Pete so he was doing like a completely different cuz you know Pete Holmes a nice guy does it and he was at the roast just destroying people and he just kept yelling mean Pete you know so but but yeah so that kind of stuff yeah it's fun man just to uh meeting yeah well that was the first time I don't know if you remember I definitely was the first time you and me hung out when was this what year like these yeah it was it was damn we're old yeah and so it was 99 it was my second time in Montreal right I'm doing comedy I don't know about six years so I'm still like new like I but but I knew you from the from Laugh Factory and from around town and you were hanging out with Kevin James and I think he had just got his show or I just finished his first year of his show whatever and you were like come on and I jump in a cab and we went around doing spots and I'm like and you would bet you'd already been on Newsradio and I and I'm like fuck I'm hanging out with Joe and get like we're doing spots like you need I mean like it's a new comic you're like holy shit just the coolest shit ever cuz cuz I I could get in because I got out the cab with you too so they're like yeah yeah you do five so that I remember I still remember that that was fun but that's what Montreal is so now I'm that guy Yeah right now I I've been to Montreal so much I got people calling me in LA asking me about Montreal lesson they told us to call you I had Chris Spencer calling me to get spots on shows and I was like Chris I don't book it he's like yeah but you know you know and then I was able to get him a spot so I guess I dunno I guess it worked yeah but the problem is you get it - if it works once you know then you're the guy they call yeah that's listen if you're listening to this podcast no I can't help you do they still have a bunch of different venues we can you drive around and get some arts not no not about everything's booked now you know you know the big difference now there's a lot more TV like remember back then there were like two or three people had hours yeah no not men now there's like a whole series of one hours that they're taping and then you know like Kevin Hart did the whole lol thing there for a couple of years so he was taping all of that so there's a lot more TV is more involved this year there wasn't a whole lot of Netflix the last two years there was a ton of Netflix and Netflix was doing a bunch of half hours and no filming them in yet or filming them at the festival so it's weird to me it seems like the festival's supposed to be fun it's not supposed to like film us I think it's still fun in that like you said you see all the comics and you get to hang out but there's there's not the the development business that there used to be right that's not there but the content business is there and they figure like we got all these comics in one place we'll set up cameras and we'll shoot mmm bang bang bang bang I think that so there's less of the there's still some shows where you could just you know jump on and it's friends of whoever in the midnight shows they still do that to have like a whole midnight when they come midnight surprise or whatever you don't even know who's on the show that day they call people like hey you want to do a spot and they still have the nasty show they still demasters show is still huge they do they do the ethnic show now remember there used to be that's what they call it well there used to be like the the wiseguys was the Italian show all right and then they had the Jewish show and then they had the up town was a black show and it's enough well now they've combined all of that and they call it the ethnic show and they have built so they'll be just different comics on there from different ethnic groups I've hosted it a couple of times it's a lot of fun did they expect you to do ethnic material no some you do some some people do some some don't I think my favorite one one year I was hosting it natter Man was on it Dan at Herman who you know Natalie hilarious guy he was like yeah ethnic yeah I'm a Jewish comic from New York that's such a rare find yeah but but it's there you know it's the right title for catch all and also the other big thing is Canada it's not as they're not as hung up on it right so you're not as worried about being politically correct or or hurting someone's feel like they understand yeah this is a comedy festival and people are gonna say shit that is inappropriate and and do and and being friends you know can't we make fun of each other right and it's so yes so your ethnic group may come into it but not from a point of racism or hatred or judgment just it's fucking funny that we're the same or different in our ethnicity or in our background and we can we joke about it does uh Comedy Works exist anymore up there went under it unfortunately the works went under um Jimbo take off yeah vanish somewhere I don't know what happened to Jimbo I don't know I'm not sure what happened to him but Chamber was great that Club was that was the epitome of comedy right yeah you go upstairs there's a hundred fifty people in a hundred twenty seat room is it even that many it was a hundred twenty seats and and the fire marshal would have shut it down every night right because if there was a fire in Comedy Works it would have been a horrible tragedy you know but but it would the energy was like you get on that stage and just kill and you know it's like yeah we got the gala over here we got 3,000 seats in the most beautiful theater you can imagine but you really want to see that you really want to have fun go upstairs the comedy works in sweat you're literally sweating for 15 minutes because there's no air conditioning was terribly it worked heat rises so we should put this place upstairs well when they wanted to stay warm in the winter yeah and they have like a little comedy scene like a local scene yeah and they still have they still have some places like there was one I was working I can't remember the name of it but it was the same kind of vibe it was like an upstairs bar that they converted for the for the festival they put in a hundred chairs and you you know and it was great and that's where they were doing midnight surprise so that with that venue is still really cool and then they have the theater Saint Catherine which is like this small stage and a long room yeah I did that one man that that one still has you know so sit are still some places that have that funky comedy vibe I mean you know but that comedy works room is it still there could somebody like turn I don't know I have no idea if it's if it's there if it's been redeveloped but yeah works was that was the shit that was the great that was the fun room that was where you ran your set before you do your you know gala or TV taping or whatever and it would just just crackling those the first time I ever saw blini Schultz you ever see crazy Lenny do you know crazy Lenny no he was a hilarious guy that was right when I was coming up he was just at the end of his run at the end of his career he's this wild crazy old man who'd bring props on stage like it's attitude was so fun just was just a maniac like he would he would pull up a you know a Smokey the Bear doll and he was like only you can prevent forest fires and he just yells fuck and on paper sounds so stupid but I know what you mean you're fucking holding your body you couldn't even stop laughing my favorite random funny thing like that there's a guy still touring as far as I know in Canada called Mel silverback ever hear of Mel silverback male silverback half Jew half silverback mountain gorilla hmm and he would wear it a tuxedo with the big ruffled shirt like the Catskills comics and he wore gorilla hands and a gorilla head I'm failure and he would do these old Catskills Thai style jokes gorilla mask oh man Joe wishin for last comic when I was a judge we were falling out of you Jane Goodall she's a whore you should have seen it with those chimps it was disgusting like he was and apparently he's a thing in Canada like he's a late-night dirty comic too towards Canada but but it was the dumbest thing but to see it I mean we were pounding on the table we could not breathe because he's it was all old cheap one-liners like the Catskills and and he had the suit and and he was a gorilla and he would put it all in so it was all from a silverback mountain gorillas point of view like what's your point of view silverback mountain gorilla it's how I see the world but that act too is like he could die and somebody could just take his yeah somebody could take over you know and and the thing was we picked him for last comic right but then this is where TV kills comedy so now he's on prime-time NBC and he can't do that like you can't say she's a whore and you can't do everything that made him funny was like no the censors won't allow it so now people are like why is he wearing gorilla hands yeah just let me see what makes you funny okay let's not do that do you remember Gallagher - yeah remember his that brother you couldn't afford Gallagher was doing giant theaters and Gallagher - his brother was doing like a little commie Club yeah like he I would see it like in places that I was working yeah like when I was coming up it would be like oh and then next weekend it's Gallagher - lets go did they get into a fight like a legal fight over ownership of cuz Gallagher wanted to come back yeah see Gallagher apparently like temporarily retired and he sold his act to his brother Gallagher - and his brother looked his brother looked a lot like him and he had you know he just basically it picked up like a job it's like I having an affiliate or like a you know like a like syndication yeah you syndicated the act yeah you just you know what point for you if you want to buy of 7-eleven yeah well it's like the Blue Man Group like this different blue man around the country yeah yeah that's true but there's no like what if it was a blue man right it was just one blue man maybe but so gaolers Gallagher's brother took all the jokes and the props and started buying watermelons and sledgehammers and just toured the country I would love to be in court when they had that fight like your honor here's how I smash a watermelon it is my brother this I special water but like how do you decide I think it was just a matter of whether or not he could continue to do the act but I mean is it his last name calendar is it a real name so it is Leo was the original and Ron is the brother behind Gallagher it's like if a girl breaks up with you and you fucker slightly less good-looking sister right white yeah so that's I think here's the original original this picture here would be the brother is it Wow he's sure yeah that's picked up this Wow that is yeah I wouldn't want to be that judge cuz that the Ballad of Ron Gallagher blog foot must someone must write the story about it Wow so yeah the it was close enough yeah the kind of little brothers yes Gallagher how weird and so then after a while I think Gallagher got tired of being retired and he said I'm coming back and his brothers like well I'm fuckin gonna continue doing this act he's like no you're not bitch you don't have to find a new way to make a living but I ought it from you right so I own it now like you been in your probably 40s and your brother who's like of a similar age just picks up comedy and just starts doing your routine like a hundred percent you know oh yeah and calls himself alonso - yeah that's crazy well on Charlie Murphy could have done that right he sounded enough like Eddie that he he could I mean not no no he wouldn't but what I'm saying is he could have done it Pig him back piggy back to Eddie that's such a different way of talking yeah I mean his way of talking was so much more aggressive yeah SP yeah I missed that dude yeah I had a good fucking time with him man we did a whole tour of the country for 30 days oh no him and Heffron oh yeah yeah maksim Bud Light tour when remember what those are the real men of Bud Light they were getting guy who sang was the lead singer of survivor the eye of the tiger guy oh yeah yeah so we were on tour with those guys so those guys would sing songs and they had like little punch lines they would do with the songs and they would have a local guy which is actually how I met Tom Segura I met Tom Segura because we were doing the Hollywood Theater or celebrity theater whatever it is in Phoenix and Segura was the opening act the local opening act okay I could flown him in and I get I think he did like five or ten minutes and he was hilarious and that's how I became buddies with him and started taking him on the road with me but then you know there would be the real American hero guys and then it would be Heffron and then Charlie and me and yeah we we did 22 dates over a month we had a great fucking time I only met him once but he was real cool I met him in Vegas and just you know one of those we were it was the dirty at 12:30 I'm doing the dirty and he came by and we just you know just hung out backstage met him for him it but yeah he seemed cool couldn't be cool that was maybe a year a year maybe two years at most before he passed away he did my podcast in the early early early days we always talked about doing it again but he never did it again but he had some great fucking stories about Mike Tyson by visiting Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson was outside with the tiger and nobody wanted to get out of limo well you know that the the tragic thing about comics right is when a comic dies his act dies with him yeah you know where as singers somebody else will sing the songs that isn't but when a comic goes so when you have some like Patrice you know like that's all gone like that you know and and so many comics like yeah when they're gone that act is gone and you you remember it and it was hilarious but nobody could you can't nobody can do their act after that I think there was a guy that was doing a Bill Hicks tribute show and he was doing Bill Hicks with all Bill Hicks material and he dressed like I'm an alphabetical it died that day yeah I don't exactly see if you can find that there's a I think they were trying to do that almost like someone trying to be like Mark Twain like you could do a Samuel Clemens one-man show and read the works of Mark Twain with a goofy mustache on right well it's like in Vegas the Rat Pack you know they can do that but it doesn't work with comedy you can you could do the Rat Pack you can't do Don Rickles right are you it just you can't do it no you can't yeah the Vegas is a weird place for fucking impersonators right that impersonator life I can't imagine it cuz some of them are so deep into it like I we worked you know I do these jazz cruises and they do other cruise so they had an 80s cruise and we had a Michael Jackson impersonator and this guy stayed in character for the whole cruise to where you want say like yo man you know you're not Michael Jackson he was like getting off the ship in port you know what I mean like you when you go to the shops or have lunch with Michael Jackson the whole outfit outfit glove the idea the hair the makeup that yeah it was it was weird like and and you know it's kind of a strange talent right to be like yeah I'm this person so so what what if that person didn't exist who are you what's your what's your thing you know and and I heard the Prince guy is like that I don't know but I've heard that there's a prince guy who had surgery to look more like Prince there's a few Michael Jackson guys and it's ER like Michael Jackson we got Jamie first Google Images just changed and I might just fucked up so the stuff looks weird now but I found something a show that was done about ten years ago where a guy did a show called Bill Hicks light return where he didn't show as if Bill Hicks was still here ten years after his death Oh with like new material yes even worse that's I'm gonna I'm gonna project what Bill Hicks would have thought of today's how dare you world yeah fucking London settle down London stop trying that's what I need to get Alex Jones to be Bill Hicks just give him a little more hair but I think that's the closest thing I could find it oh okay and maybe I read it wrong cuz I could have swore there was a guy who was doing Bill Hicks material he was doing it again what does that Bill Hicks dark poet lower right is that actually Hicks and lower right-hand side the blue one keep going bang what's that yeah that's it that's not yeah that's not Hicks that's the guy that pretended to be Hicks yes that's the guy that's this yeah barf this show has a ride but this show is a bumpy journey that shows death oh you know this is a different guy even a show called dark poets stop look the way they dress everything stop you know from Texas shut your mouth go home you fuck write your own Act go to Edinburgh and pretend to be Bill Hicks and hope nobody here has ever actually seen them get some surgery the Michael Jackson people like you gotta get fucked up surgery yeah not regular search you got to get like the fucked up chin thing it's a it's the weirdest like again like you say to be an impersonator and now I guess Queen is good you know be like as they make these movies right so now people are gonna want to be don't wanna overheads yeah it's a freaking you if you mess up these teeth yeah they probably have to wear fake teeth yeah krazee-eyez teeth what a talent act lady said it yeah it helped his voice damn yeah that's what he said you know in the movie that he said he could sing at that range because of his shape of his mouth which may be true I don't know I don't know how it how does he know he didn't never see he's never had a different shaped mouth that's true yeah well whatever it was it worked he's making lemonade that's what it is but you're right like that talent you know that Artur is who's like that now at erä bands like that now did you know because they just cuz Queen kept like every song was different like you knew it was Queen but it was completely different than the last hit that they did yeah that's what was crazy about it I think those bands that grew up with no internet they will forever be unique because it was a different world and that the the kind of creativity that it took to become those bands like the kind of creativity that it takes to become the who you know like try today the world is like a different place like they they develop touring and like the Beatles they develop touring and in performing constantly and writing and and you know I mean sure they were influenced by other bands but not nearly to the extent that people are today yeah and also there's kind of a conformity today to the marketing like we want you to be this so we can sell it you know I was playing Earth Wind & Fire for somebody and it was one of their instrumentals and I told him I said well you know Earth Wind & Fire would also play jazz with Ramsey Lewis like they would the same musicians and him like oh it's because I saw him once and they were doing this whole jazz thing and I wondered what it was and it was like yet they were actual musician and a band like her can you imagine showing up now at a band like yeah that's 27 of us we got a horn section and addition to that they'd be like what no like we're not paying for actual musicians like those bands had horn sections and and rhythm section it was a lot of people how do they make money in well they charge a lot for tickets they have to well you know what else seven people on the stage records write records were real records you so record sales like when you sold a million records you made a lot of money from selling a million records yeah and you heads you know those bands like like I did one of these eighty sings with war and the number blew my mind but then I realized that war sold over 50 million records right in it but then when you think about it yeah they had a hit every summer for like six seven years right like why can't we be friends a low rider on it they had a whole list to hit like every one of the songs would start playing like oh yeah I know this I know this song you know 50 million records so how much do you think each record cost 10 bucks yeah yeah what more records 999 or whatever it's something like that yeah and they probably got they got they had to get what at least a buck or two bucks off of each one after everybody else took their cut ah yeah and then all the touring money yeah I was talking to someone who's a band ends in a band now and they were explaining to me that these record companies they don't just take your record sales anymore like iTunes sales and they now take merchandise they take Turing money when you sign you signed to an all exclusive deal because the record companies can't really justify their existence anymore because they can't really sell write your cancer yeah cuz all the musicians I know say the only time they sell CDs or records or whatever is at the live show like that they have to go out and sell they like us now right I got to go out and do merch like they didn't have to do that before it's like yeah buying a CD now who's buying a CD again look at it you know what am i do with this thing oh yeah a lot for it well yeah that's what people say when they buy him after shows they're like you know and I joke about like cuz I have CDs and download cards you set yourself CDs though it's a generational it is literally the line as right at about the age 40 if they're older they want a CD right and I just you know so so if you try to sell them a download card like what well I'm not paying you for a business card what is this right but then if you get a younger person and you try to solve a CD Allah where am I gonna play this my grandfather's house like with my computers don't even come with a drive anymore like a disco records though people like red people wanna buy vinyl want to sell vinyl because that's a small percentage that one of my buy vinyl I think your crowd like you're in the Jazz and you know what jazz fans still have CD players like they made the switch from records to CDs and they're like that's it I'm not going back I'm not swear I'm not getting the records out of the garage so there's not a record industry some but it's for the it's funny yeah yeah there's some but it's not big blue notes doing Blue Note jazz label is doing records again and for their artists but they're selling to the younger people not to older people older people aren't buying turntable new turntables to play it that makes sense you know where is a good jazz place in LA like if I wanted to go see Jeff you know the crazy thing about LA is all the jazz musicians live here and they all say well we don't play here there's no money to be made so did theirs on because it's LA they record here you know and they - I'm trying remember name it on Sunset Catalina Bar and Grille on Sunset is good and vibrato on Beverly Glen is good vibrato is owned by Herb Alpert oh yeah so is this something like you you'll go out like on a Wednesday night or something like that you go see some nos I I do more I love going to festivals yeah I love going to jazz festivals I'm guilty that I'll go to a jazz club in New York more so than I would in LA really yeah why because it's more the vibe the vibe in New York that it just fits that's where they come from and that's what a jam but but I've been to I've been to a few time I'll go definitely if I know somebody who's playing there I'll go see him at Catalina I need I've never experienced good jazz I'm sure it's real I know you're not dumb know this guy I got a man is what is this Jamie this is Catalina but de Van Dyke performs they're kind of frequently right he performed the only place I've even that's the only reason I know of it because it's on Sunset in Hollywood Oh up there is he doing stand-up no he does jazz he sings what see this but this is the thing and this is the thing about jazz so you see that now call up a guy look up well I want to hear some of this that's old yes but that that's a jazz that keeps people from listening to jazz yeah you know that's a jazzy lay oh never mind look you look up a guy like Robert Glasper who's just this brilliant young keyboard player and he has two bands he has the Robert Glasper trio which is just a jazz trio piano bass and drums which it brilliant then he's got the Robert Glasper experience which is his electronic electric band and he'll have everyone singing on that from like Lalah Hathaway Donny Hathaway's daughter who's a brilliant vocalist - Lupe Fiasco you know - most def they all perform together he hangs out with the root the roots have a jam session in New York that that all these jazz artists come to so that's what's going on that I love it it's really I mean jazz has always been the most creative music you know it's just and and that's why I love it these guys are there they're masters of their instruments and it's all about creativity and they you know even when they do covers it's great because they do it in such a different way like Robert Glasper experienced the first time I heard him they did smells like teen spirit and I was like hey thank you he was he could can he look at her he can look up anything so that's the kind of thing in jazz you know my buddy Marcus Miller who's this brilliant bass player who was he was Luther Vandross his musical director and he did all the music for Luther right now was all great but he also produced music for Miles Davis you know and he's done stuff again with with anybody from like you know Bill Withers to to classic old-school jazz artists oh yeah jazz covers a wide range and that's what I love about it but there's a lot of young jazz artists now who are bringing in hip-hop and and different genres into jazz that are making it really cool international stuff a lot of African sound coming in Brazilian sound coming in and these are the guy Terrace Martin who's in a group called R & R equals now with Glasper somebody Terrace Martin does all of Kendrick Lamar's music really seeds so it's so fast so it's like yeah it's like yeah I'll go with Kendrick Lamar and I you know I just I need to make five million dollars so i'ma do this music but when I can just create and play and have fun and just be a musician then I go to my jazz roots and I jam with these guys in a whole different different vibes so here's right here yeah smells like teen spirit jazz version that's hilarious what is going on with his head what is up there not here yes and a hat I can't help you with that that red straight I got nothing like what's happening now that as a hat yeah that can't be it's hairy interesting so he's using a vocoder so as he sings it comes through the instrument wow these guys got to be high you know yeah no way around well that part of jazz never changed yeah Miles Davis has always been fascinating to me look at all the people in the musical history like he's always been like with this one dude but I was like how I loved him met that guy he's who's so fucking intense Marcus you know played in his band and knew him I would have loved to have seen him just to see him live because you know he he did a record call kind of blue which is the biggest selling jazz record ever he did it in 59 it still sells thousands of copies a week like it's still a big you know kind of blue is the standard but he also played covers of like human nature and time after time like in the 80s he was doing covers of that Wow you know so so again that was the thing about about a jazz art like he was like yeah well it's good music so I'm gonna play it like I don't I don't care if it is written by Cyndi Lauper or you know Duke Ellington that's good music I'm gonna play it and that that's what's so cool about but yeah so those are places but when you go to the jazz festivals you know whether it be the Playboy Jazz Fest a little Newport Jazz Festival my just like our Comedy Festival is where you get a bunch of musicians who are like here we're all here together let's let this Jam let's play something and sometimes the best music will be random not not not part of the set but like oh man remember we played together in you know 97 in Montreux yeah let's come onstage and we'll play mm-hmm and then you hear something that you again just like in comedy when some comics just improv in or you know they're they're doing the same thing they're they're improbably to meet a big compliment I get from jazz musicians when they compliment me on my improv you know because it's like yeah you guys are the experts you need like improv is you guys created it so if I'm doing something and you think it's cool Craig Robinson you know Craig sure he's a about both sides like he's got the comedy and music thing and he's respected on both yeah he's like it the musicians love him and comics love him and he's yeah Craig and Montreal Craig did a big outdoor show like it was like a block party like via the giant outdoor stage yeah Craig played it and it was hilarious cuz he's doing his act right so it's a big outdoor thing and families with their kids and and he's singing take your panties off and I'm like yeah so this I guess is the uncensored Craig but it was hilarious you know very cool I saw Dizzy Gillespie once when I was a kid when I was in I was kind of had like second and third grade I was living in San Francisco we had a field trip I want to see Dizzy Gillespie live and I'll never forget it like you know his cheeks blow up like a bullfrog right and it was like but that's not even the way you're supposed to play the trumpet right and that's what's so great about it like nobody cuz nobody taught him the right way to play it so he just played it most people don't even know who Dizzy Gillespie is but if you see him live you never forget like that right like what in the fuck like you see his face blow up you're like how how how are you doing that how is that real but so you're supposed to keep your cheeks tight like the way they would teach you they would never teach you to do that and you probably couldn't I know I couldn't you know just he just had a way of doing it I wonder what year he died don't know but I was a little kid when I saw his it died in 93 93 in New Jersey damn I am i met arturo Thunderball and they did a movie about am andy garcia did a movie bottom so Arturo's really yeah he's this Cuban trumpet player and I want to say it what he was telling the story and I want to say it was Dizzy Gillespie who was in Cuba and Arturo was like driving him around right this is like in I guess it would be in the late 50s maybe early 60s and he asked Arturo what he does and it's like I turned like I played a trumpet but the Cubans were like oh yeah that's her too like all the Cubans knew who he was so he played and Dizzy Gillespie in the head I want to say was dead he might I might be wrong name but but they went to the US State Department the head of CBS Records and it and said we have to get him in the United States like we he has to be here and they did it they the State Department got an art Earl now imagine this genom they went to the State Department it was an artist thing they said we want this guy to come to hell they sneak him out of Cuba I have no idea but no they didn't sneak him out he it was a state-sponsored thing like they come over here to perform and then went back no he came over and stayed but this was a crazy part this is the part I can't imagine so he flies from Cuba into LaGuardia Airport and they take him straight to Carnegie Hall for soundcheck and he plays Carnegie Hall that night I mean can you imagine like imagine your first gig right like somebody somebody saw you you know I don't know Rodney Dangerfield saw you at a club in Boston pretty like regarding okay Joe oh my god it was it's a crazy story and but to this day but Arturo is like when he plays a trumpet you know it's him like he hits notes on the trumpet like only dogs can hear like he's famous for this super high notes and stuff like that but yeah that that's that's what I love about it so I love the creativity and then you know Marcus was telling me cuz he's from New York from Queens 70s 80s guy he said well you know what happened with hip hop he said one of the things was they took music out of the schools right they didn't you know they don't teach you can't take an instrument anymore they were like it's out of the budget Bobby he said well you can't stop people from creating so these guys they didn't have musical instruments but they had records so they just started making music with their records they just started mixing the records and coming up with noose and it was like yeah that that kind of makes sense if you're musical and nobody teaches you to play an instrument but you have these records you're like all right well what if I played this and this at the same time right and then the next thing you know they made that hip hop which that hip hop caught on existed before right the idea of mixing two different records together until hip hop came around no one ever did that with rock and roll didn't oh no and then hip hop mixed in rock and roll right when when you know Run DMC Smith that's way that blew people's mind as you know that was like wait a minute that's black and a what happen can't another play together yeah yeah adidas was like yes they can't and they wearing adidas well they do did you ever listen to any of the brand New Heavies yeah they did hip hop with the brand New Heavies yeah there's a heavy what it's a heavy rhyme experience is that what it's called it's to this day one of my one of my favorite old schools like 1990 style rap / yeah the brand New Heavies were great yeah they were great and then you had Living Color who I still love oh man living collar person now yeah that was a great and you talk about you talk about being ahead of their time like think about that song cult of personality that day right right yeah yeah and and and CM Punk walk out music yeah yeah and that was another band where they were like okay let me get this straight this is a heavy like a heavy metal rock and roll band of black guys who are sampling Public Enemy right what the fuck [Music] some weird some areas he had the crazy hair where he would wear two wet suits all the time yeah like scuba suits yeah he used to jam and nose yeah that is what he's wearing I probably want to show his dick off hey yeah rockstar why not back in the day like you ever see like those Robert Plant he'd these tight pants on yes he's hog and he's wearing a suit he's wearing a wet suit goddamn a spandex wet suit so weird that was his thing oh wow they fucking vanished what happened to them they would they came back out they did the 25th anniversary I saw it and at Hard Rock they did the 25th anniversary of their record a vivid called the personnel yeah and they toured it look at silly swimsuit Wow yeah that was a great fucking song but you know that's always freaking me out to like imagine being a band you have one song that just are out of the park right yeah just in the parking lot you know just one fucking grand slam home run goddamn we did it this is huge number one song in the nation several weeks in a row and nothing well yeah but but imagine well what they say you got your whole life to write that song yeah and then we got two years to write the night write it do it again but this also is like some bands they just catch fire with what like do you remember warrant cherry pie yeah she's fuckin huge song that was it that dude died near here he died in Woodland Hills and a fucking shitty hotel somewhere imma give you the one-hit wonder you want it okay the twist the twist what did Chubby Checker ever sing oh my god imagine that you had the song that was like yeah that was the shit chubby Checker's number two hit I don't know that's a great point because but that somehow or another was good enough for him to stay famous for his whole life your whole life people hire you to play one song he was the greatest one-hit wonder ever then he was the yeah yeah I can't even imagine anyone who's come close to that cuz no one's paying them to sing sing call to personality no one's all excited no you you might have one fan who's like worth millions who pays you to come yeah birthday party entry telling shit yeah you actually might like opinion do you remember and then live and cover the TV show reliving color came out yeah and then it was like wait what are you doing that hey there's already a band that's not us and I bet the show far eclipse the bar clips the band and then they were like were you named after the show like how many tight like what's the name Darius Rucker how many times has he said my name is not Hootie Hootie is back because Darius Rucker went off and did country music and did that for a long time but now he's back hoodies back on tour party yeah man yeah that was another band that BAM was that fucking that verse record the second record fell off that first record was David Ellis I think it was like serious or something but like they played it and then I went back and played it again it was like wow I forgot how good this was like that album is but the second one was not as good I don't think that was one of those albums though there's something about Hootie where some people despised them and it didn't make any sense to me people just heard those songs too many times it was too big of a hit and they were all fucking Hootie that does happen though like we've Matthews when yeah when something's too much of a hit and you hear it every day you get tired of saw and they dangerous don't play that you know a buddy of mine actually mal Hall he's gonna love this shout out so mal Hall opens for me really funny guy and he tours with Angela Johnson he hates happy that song I'm happy yeah bye-bye Pharrell I insist on it being his walk on music whenever we work he physically he has a physical reaction because how much did we hear that song when it came out it was like drilled so yeah so now he's known people it's good for them to get angry for Joey Diaz whenever I'd worked with him he would just decide he would pick a thing and it wasn't like like we would talk about this but I recognize what he was doing after a while I'd he'd be backstage and he would pick a thing and just start getting fucking mad at it these fucking pussies this is what they think America is this will they take the fucking world is and he would start getting crazy in there ladies and gentlemen Joey did he would go on stage with that momentum yes mark the place I've had that happen a couple of times with something just got I remember any arrows one of those you know when you do to set you wish you had recorded it yes so I was going to the Laugh Factory it's Saturday night I was on my bike and this guy like it stop and go right and I'm just any hit my bike but it was only at like five miles an hour like he just tapped me and knocked the bike over but I'm like I was bright like how did you not see me right and I just went on stage and I just ranted about you know drivers and traffic in this and it was hilarious and it was like gone no I never recorded I do sometimes but I didn't record that I wish I because it was just unit you know sometimes you just get something gets to you right before you go on stage and you it's not written you just go into a race but it's right there that's why it's so important to record everything yeah I record all of them yeah I have them all on my phone it's so easy now yeah now this was before phones this is before we carried a studio in our pocket this is when this is when you had the micro cassette I still have a bunch of those tapes those I used to have my through mouth anyone here I um I used to have a little tiny mini cassette recorder a mini disc yeah I remember a mini disc yeah that was when Sony kept trying formats like maybe they'll buy this right nearby so yeah we mini disc once they fucked him with Betamax you sons of bitches did anyone but comics by minidiscs like I set up a mini disc recorder at the Comedy Store I actually installed one I installed a mini disc recorder at the comic store so I could record my sets yeah yeah comics we used I don't know if anyone else did oh I mean it just didn't work they really never sold music on it so as a format it never really took off but then it was like CD arse right yeah you can record on this in Renoir Phoebe ours yeah we thought that was the shit that's what I'd about could make my own CDs write on it with a sharpie that's technology man it happens so fast especially in this era yeah I mean think about how long records existed for yeah decade after decade after decade it was just records and then all sudden compact discs like what right cuz yeah cuz that started what around 1990 like laser discs yeah oh my asked my brother my brother's a techie and like an early adopter so he has all that shit in his garage so yeah he's got some movies on 12-inch still collect those anything that was out there somebody somebody's buying eight tracks somewhere somebody's in their home right now watching Top Gun on laserdisc all excited yeah and they'd they invite you over like a check this out and you're like I can just hit the remote and instantly the place that's the most incredible thing is like you could ask Siri to play a song yeah like like you know like play a whole lot of love bitch listen to me hey Siri play a whole lot of love by Led Zeppelin well what kind of a world we live in yeah well that's like those commercials and and again getting back to the special I talked about like the arguments between Syria and Alexa like that's gonna be the next thing yeah I think Alexa is more of a spy that bitch is sneaky she's listening more Alexa's listening let's listen in all the time Yuri you have to talk to her yeah but you hear this yeah we think we think but you don't you know the privacy's in illusion now like when people I'm off the grid like no you're not it's none of our none of us are off the grid so you know they say like you're your social security number you everyone anyone can find it or your credit card numbers like anything you do it's out there well there was a new there's a new technology that the government is unleashing that is a weather balloon or a balloon that from 65,000 feet it can watch multiple cars at the same time and tracked them 65,000 feet in the air like you even see what the fuck's I mean no you wouldn't even be able to see it up there but that's you know that's not that new I mean you know this is apparently like super high-tech no I mean the gist the idea of watching from that high mean they've had spy planes and stuff like that they could you know was in a movie I in the sky yes they Hackman or something yes myth well with the satellites yeah that was a yet I was a movie where Gene Hackman would like like Will Smith made a phone call and Gene Hackman had to blow up his lab but yeah back when I was in the aerospace you know they had airplanes that would like they're flying at 80,000 feet keeping an eye on things yeah you know and they had cameras and now it's just so much more prevalent and yeah well you know you've got listen man you your car right all the new cars have a black box in them that people don't realize like so if you have an accident they can find out how fast you were going oh yeah when you cry or if you have a warranty thing and they're like yeah but you were racing it at 150 miles an hour blah blah blah you know I got some cars have a box in them where the police can shut your car down yeah I say if you're in a high-speed chase in a Corvette or something I don't know if it's a car that but it's some kind of car like that that's electronically controlled right they literally can get your VIN number plug it into a machine and say shut it down yeah they can do that with OnStar right if the car solon launch star just shuts the car off yeah have you seen those new plates those electronic plates yeah I know that's weird well when you call it in like say someone stole your car then the plate changes to stolen oh really yeah I didn't know that yeah now it's like a little more down don't ya your eyes lit up well it's it's good no cuz I was thinking how many how come how people can mess with you like that like now that's you're just open for a practical joke yeah man let's report his car stolen yeah that's true because who do they note like on the phone they don't know if it's you right and all you need is the VIN or something minute all right what do you need you need some sort of second party verification do they send you a text message reply to this if your car's really stolen you know I doubt it yeah good point your ex-wife calling your car stolen yes you would have all your info like yeah yeah there's some bitch every Saturday night or she knows you're doing something yeah do it yes stolen car you bastard this is our privacy so deteriorated from the time we were kids to today like it makes you really wonder how far it can keep slipping the only but the other side of the coin is they don't like know most people don't care you know I mean in other words you're not that important like the government spying on me like well no they're not because you're nobody like you're not doing anything that they would be interested in yeah don't flatter yourself yeah exactly if the what it what did you do but then there's the other side like hey if you're not doing anything wrong you shouldn't worry about the government hey they can go look in my email I'm not doing anything wrong that's not the point the point is the government is people right and people shouldn't have access to your email and who knows what kind of weird shit they're doing like theirs that was one of the things that Edward Snowden said that the government is like sneaking in on people's emails and looking at people's dick pics and looking at dads look at all of all those things and that's a sliding scale right between security and privacy and all of that that you have to figure out what you're comfortable with and you know shameless plug number two mypod yes no I'm part of this new podcast it's called fear not who's on it with you a guy named Barry Glasner and Barry glass and I wrote this book called the culture of fear and it was all about how fear is used as business right they keep you scared so that they could sell you things whether it be security systems or we eat there's so much involved in it and and it it's about what we're scared of versus what the real threats are and you know what I mean like he's like yeah we they keep you scared of you know your kid getting kidnapped in the park like you're kidding gonna get kidnapped in the park but what you should be scared of is the number of drunk drivers on the road that's real yeah and they did the odds of you getting hit by a drunk driver between like midnight and 2:00 a.m. and a bar like that's a real fear and and we talk about it in the context of different things we did the the whole anti vaccine and you know so what's what's you yeah you're worried about your kid yet in getting something from the vaccinations but the greater good is society is protecting itself against measles or whatever disease you know so we talk about things like that and and yeah there's there's always that sliding scale of personal security or whatever versus the government you know and and it again the government if the government did its job right you could trust them a lot more sure you know what I mean like the government in other words this is just my opinion is okay a lot of people I hate paying taxes I don't mind paying taxes because I understand the greater good we need to fix roads and we want to have good public schools and qapla blah ya Iron Man but the problem is that the government gets the money and then they fuck up yeah so so that's why you don't want to pay because you know that this politician is paying his brother who's a contractor to do some bullshit work and stealing all you know so that and and you know what's the solution i I don't know I mean we're all wondering what's the solution there is a solution on the horizon did you see what happened with Neil deGrasse Tyson that Neil deGrasse Tyson got in trouble for tweeting something the other day after the mass shootings right people are pissed at him because it pulled up pull the the tweet up because it's pretty interesting because it's it's just accurate and people were angry and they're saying he's using his platform irresponsibly and no he was trying to let people know that although shootings are a tragedy they are a small number of deaths and there's so many other deaths that happened here goes the past 48 hours the u.s. a horrific Lee lost 34 people to mass shootings on average across 48 hours we also lose 502 medical errors 302 the flu 252 suicide 202 car accidents forty two homicides via handgun often our emotions respond more to spectacle than to data now that is not a bad tweet but I saw a scientist who was writing I am unfollowing him he is using his platform irresponsibly a lot of fuckin virtue signaling really because what what he's saying is not that there's anything wrong with you know feeling horrified by these tragedies I mean he's saying we horrific horrific Lee lost 34 people to mass shootings police saying it's interesting that there's people dying left and right all throughout this country all day long just not at the hands of one person so we look at it differently and he's just saying he's just giving you data as a scientist that's exactly what it is he's a science yes and so a scientist can separate the emotion yeah but people don't - apology is even more interesting people will consider a mass shooting much worse than you know heart attacks yeah so listen to this so this is the other thing yesterday I posted in reaction to the horrific mass shootings in America over the previous 48 hours killing 34 people spawned mixed and highly critical responses if you missed it I offered a short list of largely preventable causes of death along with their average two-day death toll in the United States they significantly exceeded the death toll from the two days of mass shootings including the number of people forty who on average died from handgun homicides every two days I then noted that we tend to react emotionally to spectacular incidences of death with the implication that more common causes of death trigger milder responses within us my intent was to offer objectively true information that might help shape conversations and reactions to preventable ways we died where I miscalculated was that I genuinely believe that the tweet would be helpful to anyone trying to save lives in America what I learned from the range of reactions that is that for many people some information my tweet in particular can be true but unhelpful especially at a time when many people are either still in shock or trying to heal or both so if you are one of those people I apologize for not knowing in advance what effect might we could have had on you I'm therefore thankful for the candor and depth of critical reactions shared in my Twitter feed as an educator I personally value knowing with precision and accuracy what reaction anything that I say or write will instill in my audience and I got this one wrong respectfully submitted and then it says Neil deGrasse Tyson now even that people are saying not enough not good enough a response it's almost like today there's certain people today - they don't give a fuck whether or not you're saying something with sincerity whether you are sorry they don't sorry's not enough like they don't they just want they want to be mad at you and even if you're sorry if you admit you made a mistake there's no forgiveness there's no road to redemption there's no there's no I get what you were doing I think that it depends on you know as far as is the sorry enough for whatever it depends on the pattern of the person now with Neil deGrasse Tyson this is what I think happened in here is my opinion he's a scientist so he gives information so he saw this and said oh wait a minute this many people died from medical mistakes this may be and and people didn't react what he doesn't where he messed up with the timing yes you don't say that the day after the mass shooter you say it maybe a week later or something like hey you know people die in a lot of way blah blah blah now what he's saying is I didn't know that I'm a scientist I I wasn't aware of the emotional impact thank you for telling me the emotional impact and I'm sorry that I hurt people's feelings to me is totally legitimate especially coming from who he is and what what I would think the scientific mindset is now there are some people like yeah exactly what you said they decided you're a terrible person for saying it so that apology isn't enough there's nothing he could do right but see that there's certain people right there's nothing you can do that's gonna change their mind you know you you look at look at the Obama birth certificate right so even when the birth Civic came out there's a certain percentage of the people that are still like what now that's fake like there was no way he was ever gonna be American to these people or what he did there's a certain you know you you travel you know like I drew you know there are certain groups like you ain't gonna get them right there their mind's made up and they're in their bubble they're in there whatever it is and they're surrounded by like-minded people like you said like this is the disadvantage of the Internet right the advantage of the Internet is all of this information the disadvantage is you find people who only think like you and you only talk to them and you build this bubble well he well yes so there's a group of people a percentage I know however you want to describe it that decided the moment he said that this is an unfeeling horrible person I mean I said you know my thing with it with the mass shootings I'm like listen we don't care we say we care individually like it's very sad for that family it's very to me the worst part of a mass shooting is somebody went to Walmart that day they didn't know what's gonna be the last day their life they're never gonna see their family again somebody went out to a club in in Ohio they didn't know they never come that's the the tragic part and that is sad but in the grand scheme of things we don't do anything we don't you know we we say it doesn't work before we even try it like there's nothing we do that changes even after Vegas when they said they were gonna ban what was it called the bump stop or whatever it was that thing that helped shoot faster and then ultimately they didn't even ban that you know so so as a society we say we care but we don't because we don't change anything you got to change something nothing changes if nothing changes right well they were getting way off track here but yeah with Neil deGrasse Tyson the the outrage thing did not reach me no no I didn't outrage you either right no because he's a side that what he said his truth yeah and data is true and data is delivered without emotion and why people were upset is because he delivered truth with no emotion right and so did he said horrific aliy I mean he was talking about the tragedy yeah the things that just people are looking to be upset oh absolutely yeah absolutely people look for for something to be mad about yeah or something to be outraged about and that you know what that takes away from it takes away from real outrage yes right yeah it diminishes it if you're outraged everyday then you know then ok so what's really outrageous I think I'm gonna be upset if I'm gonna be upset at a scientist for giving me scientific data what do I want yet I guess the timing was the issue the timing was like it wasn't an issue with me I mean I get what he's doing I'm not a moron yeah it's just it's simple he was just giving you all sorts of different horrific deaths that occur all throughout the country and I think on that same weekend there was some unprecedent number of people that were shot and killed in Chicago yeah Chicago fuck Chicago's and so Wars yeah and and the thing is you know people say well what about the gun laws and it's like yeah but they did all you got to do is go to Indiana like you go two hours away and you can get whatever you want just you know that's the that's the thing so so having a car so as a city Chicago is like look we're trying but we can't you know what are we gonna set up borders and check every car coming into Illinois have to go in every house so you can't you can't do that yeah it's but yeah his thing I think it was a time and I'm like you that didn't offend me I get what he was saying and then this it's can't offend you he's you're a rational human a can offend you you know you know what bothers me when people pretend be ignorant of something and they're not how so well when people like like for example with this like there's something like oh we can use this to to create some dislike against Neil deGrasse Tyson or what it's generally it's generally politicians do it right when they say something and they're like oh I didn't know that was offensive or right it's like yes you did but you know your followers didn't you see what I mean like you can give me an example I'm trying trying to think of an example okay well well with the mass shootings right so that sort of whole thing of saying that Trump's tweets had nothing to do with it yes they did yes now they date it indirectly but yeah it did normalize and this guy used the same language of the you know invasion etc so you can't say that it's completely unrelated you know I mean you can't you can't don't pretend and again it's not saying directly but but you can't pretend there's no connection right right and they're actually bulls it's quotes there are people who are intelligent enough to know that but they'll say no no there's no gay and it's like yes there is and you know there is don't feign ignorance that's what I mean right well you know the guy in Dayton who really fucked up one was that guy's an Elizabeth Warren supporter who actually wrote about gun control I mean he was just a horrific super homicidal fucking yeah psychopath and they listen that you have to have some there has to be something wrong with you to do that you're like even you know it's regardless of your political beliefs there has to be something wrong with you but you can be sparked or you can be egged on sure yeah by the words of leaders or political people or powerful people and people of influence perfect way to put it yet people of influence and that's why I think people of influence have to be responsible in what they say yeah you know but but this but neil degrasse tyson this is a different thing i think this is just a case of a scientist pointing out information without you know like like you know you were talking about earlier dorks nerds whatever you want to say that where it's like yeah well this is just information I'm not trying to be emotional and people like well you have to be real happy to connect you even know you're from a lab environment you have to understand not everyone is but that's not that's a one of the more uncomfortable things about today with social media is there's a bunch of people that are really just they're just authoritarian they're they're they demand certain types of behavior and they do so under the guise of compassion they do so under like they're trying to enforce the way people communicate like the Neil deGrasse Tyson thing this you used there's no indication whatsoever that he was minimizing the deaths but pretending that he's doing so yeah there are some people who believe he did but there are a lot of people pretending to be right to be upset they're finding a nice talk right yeah I you know as too many voices Alonso too many words too many people out there spewing again that's the dense we spew of the positive and the negative IDIA of the a.m. yeah that's a positive and a negative the positive is everyone has a voice the negative is everyone has a voice yeah there's no and and everyone's light and and the thing is the the middle the comest voice is the the reasonable voices are the least heard of course yeah well that's Facebook right Facebook's algorithm favors outrage yo if you are on Facebook and you get upset about abortion that's the kind of shit you're gonna get in your feed right if you get mad about climate change there you go you're gonna get a lot of climate change talk yeah it's gonna show up and goddamn that makes people nuts oh again and this is living in a bubble you don't get to hear the other side yeah you know and and and and it's not even it's the reasonable part of the other side you know what I mean like politically yeah I'm left I have friends who I call reasonable Republicans and I could talk to a reasonable Republican can talk to a crazy Republican right you know Kay if you if you say to the mass shootings are based on transgender marriage then we can't talk we got nothing like I'm sorry I can't work with you but if you say that taxes should be lower to stimulate the economy and blah blah blah yeah we could talk about that you know I mean that's that's that's the difference and you know and just just like on the left look I I believe in the environment this and that but now if you're asking me to give up gasoline we may have a problem I may not be ready to go that far just yet here's my thought if there's too much co2 in the air can't we make something to suck co2 other air why we way sir I mean wouldn't that be better to me there are certain air filters just giant air filters there are certain forms of technology or areas I don't understand this is the one that bugs made it on can't we come up with a better way to build a road but what's the better way I don't know but but that's my point it's there's some really smart people out there Oh mouths words it takes forever to build road construction you think about what you got to do well that's what I'm saying those somebodies somebody's got to come up with a with a better way like when I you know they only want more roads well fixing them we gotta fix them just fucking later or in concrete or whatever the fuck it is like the high-speed train thing right like I don't how long you been in LA 94 I moved here okay I moved here in 80 right out of right out of high school I came Wow so ever since I've been here and ever since you've been here they've been talking about a high-speed rail yes from San Francisco to LA to Las Vegas right isn't he I must gonna do that now though the Hyperloop this is my point companies like Lockheed Rockwell Northrop these air space companies have come up with you know stealth aircraft hypersonic you can't tell me that if you went to Lockheed and said listen here's 10 billion dollars we need a train that'll go 200 miles an hour from San Francisco to LA - faith that they couldn't do it they absolutely you know what I mean they have the scientists and the technology like we spend so much money on the wrong shit like I get we need defense in this and epically yeah let's cut 20 billion to the side to figure out how to move people around more efficiently because that's what these companies do these are engineering and design companies they come up with shit like this they you know so so I've always said why not just do that why not why not take some of this brainpower and it's engineering and development and use science for the masses so now if you had because if you had that think about if you could just go to the train station and get to Vegas in two hours or hour and a half how many people wouldn't drive if it was that easy you know fly-in the Vegas is a pain in the ass right you got to go to the airport and then you got to go you know you you're doing all you spend in an hour getting ready for a 40-minute flight crap but a train is so much easier if if it existed yeah if it exists why is it easier than a plan because you just get on and you go and you can do things on the train you ever you ever like back east from going from DC to New York I found it's easier to do it on a train it's the same amount of time it's going to the airport keep flying getting to your coz cutters do they travel to and from security right at time you just sit in the train there's a train without Wi-Fi you got every you know it's easy and you go from downtown to downtown that's the other thing about trains they don't go to airports which are way out there downtown to downtown where do you travel do I train from life say from downtown DC to Penn Station your old timey person no I've no there's an express train I found no you know I found this I found this out from people who do it yeah that's right three three and a half hours that's not bad yeah yeah view definitely it's better than driving mm-hmm yeah it probably goes just as fast as a car probably not any faster than a car no no fast but if we had a high-speed train that could travel that you know 200 miles an hour whatever 180 whatever those bullet trains travel I was just in Italy we took the train over the countryside it was beautiful it was fun mm-hmm not not bad you know you're just sitting down relaxing they come by you know get a Diet Coke it's a different yeah it's a different format again not the most efficient but comfortable why did they disturb me so much though in the crash when those motherfuckers derail there that's about mics yeah well cuz that's a lot of a lot of energy and there's no seat belts no so everybody just goes flying yeah you just don't you put fucking seatbelts on trains who's gonna wear them I would wear something I guess is that funny there's not really an abrupt stop that's the problem is when someone fucks up yeah there's a very abrupt stop right well that's true you know that's true your car yeah but you were a seat belt in your car yeah hopefully there's still people who don't which is blows my mind well how about you you're on a motorcycle yeah no they talk about how crazy we are I've got an explosive fluid between my legs above a hot engine and my only airbag of my knees it's insane Joe but going in between cars to but it's easy to park yes but well you know when I Drive like yesterday I was driving around what kind of car you got some stuff right now I got a truck I got a raptor whoo yeah big-ass fucking killer and rosewall's yeah it's fun I'm almost over it really yeah about a year and it's like okay I'm almost done with this truck thing it's fun to have this big-ass truck like this girl was in the truck with me and his car was pulling on and I was like oh he ain't gonna hit me and if he does I'm not even gonna stop I'm gonna win like he's gonna hit my tire and I'm gonna run over his hood but uh yeah but you know that's just me I get bored with stuff right so I Drive something for a year year and a half and I'm like alright I'm over it let's try something else so at Lisa's no no because Lisa's are hard to get out of oh that's true oh so you just know how you are I've learned I've I have wasted enough money over the years I bought my way out of shit you know who my brother used to love it cuz I would least something this is what I found out so if you leave something for three years and you want to get rid of it - they're like yeah fine but you still gotta pay us for the third year so I would call my brother like hey man you want to drive this thing I got to pay for it anyway and he's like ship it back you know he would pay to ship it I like like I can't pay the ship but yeah and you would just keep paying the bill and pay it anyway you have to get it back to the you could return it there you could return it to any dealership so if you lease like I had a what was it the Infinity f45 and something and me yet so he just returned it to an infinity place there and so you realized after a few of these fuck-ups this is yeah just just buy it and then sell it you know and I hope like month what I found is I'm not the only one with this disease like there's a bunch of us out there so I try to buy it from the guy who's just like me like I bought my Raptor it was like five months old it had like three thousand miles so like because that guy had the sickness you know what I mean so he was like man I got to get rid of this Raptor I was like yeah okay I got it yeah if you're a single guy and you don't and you have a good job like you and you don't have real financial obligations yeah yeah it's a sickness so you you just want to try something different thing so it's like I don't know I don't know you know I was I've been looking around and a buddy of mine just went for the new Corvette he just put his money down on that and I was talking and then then I started looking us like wow this might be like I always had a problem with Corvettes because I've driven them they're good they're a little small inside and also there's the baggage of having a Corvette right yeah right oh look a middle-aged single guy in a Corvette yeah but this new one I don't think it carries that and I think it carries it for our I don't think it carries the creeper factor you know the creep factor fire it'll fire up eventually I feel like it's it's definitely the next step in terms of like design and evolution it just looks better and all the classic badass car yeah I think it I think they got a big hit you know it has a GPS that recognizes where you are and raises the news yes you don't hit bumps and shit speed bumps since that it knows we're like low dry ways are yeah it's crazy yeah who had that like Rolls Royce had that waiter like there's a camera that sees bumps and adjust the suspension oh the bumps yeah coming up in frontier that's in milliseconds yeah yeah the new Corvette is the fastest ever zero to sixty two which is amazing because it's 200 plus horsepower less than the zo six or the Z zr1 rather and it's still way faster which is crazy yeah what a design is yeah I mean you know it's gonna be a phenomenal phenomenal car so I don't want to be an early adopter though I don't know if I'd be that I don't think whoo goddamn that looks good in black yeah Wow look at that fucking thing that's gonna be you know and they're gonna be all they're gonna be all over a Langley shit that thing was gonna be a badass car that is as good-looking as an American car has ever been yeah literally and you know something that's like like the Ford GT cos what like a half million dollars and that 60 grand this is 60 with the dealer markup they'll get seventy four and I bet it's just as fast yeah I bet it's pretty close and it still has a trunk yeah there's a trunk in the front and the back right that is nasty yes so that might be next why not there might be next fuck look at that goddamn thing that is awesome fucking bad a hell of a good-looking car that's gonna be a badass monster car and the top comes off whoo that's a beast man and that's the entry model and wait till they start pumping when is that gonna happen I think in 2021 or Twitter oh it's I can't wait yeah I was gonna ask he's gonna get one now that I'm looking at this that's that's why I was yeah it's probably hard to get him yeah there's a waiting list and it you know the dealers are gonna get a markup yeah for sure that thing's nasty 20-inch clear fast one not this one here's last year's one it's fucking amazing so they're great cars yeah great cars well you know who's gonna get one like Leno is gonna get it so does he get the first one or like which yeah yeah he put him in his garage yeah fuck yeah it's I should say garages yeah it's kind of the conference warehouses yeah it's it's it's but you know what it's what any any car nut would do would unlimited cash yes yes right if you had unlimited funds in Europe you're a gearhead and he's truly a gearhead like he knows his stuff like he doesn't just buy it like he actually knows all about it he has fabrication machinery in his studio he's had it build fenders he's had it for so long that's the thing it's not like 3d printing isn't new to him no I remember he has this jet-powered car and the wheels he was telling me about the wheels and he said that he showed me they the brake dust won't stick to him like you know how did you get that black duster and he and he said yeah Alcoa sent me the hunk of a loom like what they sent him the metal and he made the wheels like are you kidding me like that's that's the extent of machining you have that you could just make the wheels where as ridiculous brilliant he's making wheels that is so preposterous yeah his place is a trip man I mean you could wander around it for hours and he loves explaining everything too huh my favorite was you know he ill he'll let you take in a group right now he's really cool about this it's like you donate money to a charity and then he's like okay you can bring in as many people so it's almost like it's not selling tickets it's helping charity you know he does it cool now yeah it was really cool so he had this guy it was and the guy passed away I can't remember his name on say it was Jimmy something but but this was a guy who would give tours so he's walking around he's like this is this this what is it when did we get this one he's probably always picking shit up right yeah it was a guy's like wait where did this come from what is Jay Leno dies the only thing I can think is they make it a museum yes that's the only thing it's all paid off that's a good move charged tickets I would think I'd pay I would think he probably has something set up to maintain it I hope so because how are you gonna sell those things what do you get you know what I mean like what the fuck's gonna buy that steam car right one of the steam cars like it's like a few steam cars well he has ones with metal wheels that he actually had rubber installed on the outside of the metal so he could drive around town yeah and then he has those giant cars that are like 25 feet long but they only see two people that look like two v12 engines and a front units yeah but it's fantastic though you know and and you know that I love that that and there's a few people like that but I don't know if anyone who does it on the scale no no he does I mean Jay Jerry Seinfeld this he's got his horse Porsche he's all Porsche and which is weird Corolla adam has Paul Newman's old race cars you've been in his spot yes yeah he's got Paul Newman's old Nissan and dot's and race cars and he racism in vintage races oh yeah I've seen that I've seen videos of it yeah yeah so that that's pretty cool yeah that is pretty cool you have what years here gt3 it's a 2007 okay that is maybe the greatest car like the gt3 in the argument for the greatest car mate it's a very exciting car to drive it's a thrilling fun car to drive it's super lightweight and mine's a shark works car so it's got 518 horsepower there's a place called speed Vegas it's a track outside of Vegas you go there and you pay you can drive whatever you know they have like Ferraris and landlords and stuff so I've been there a few times and the last time I went they had the new gt3 with the rear wheel steer oh yeah and I was like what if this is God's own sports car it's like the handling you think it and it does it and now in the whole time you're driving it the cars laughing at you like I'm so much better than you are doesn't have all that electronic nanny shit new ones have but the new ones are quite a bit faster and the new one is the the gt3 Touring is the shit because it doesn't have all the crazy fins it's cuz you most of time you're not driving an on track right it is driving it around town so you get all the feel of a real gt3 but you don't have it's more stealth right it looks almost like a regular 911 yeah they look man they have barely deviated from their style since like the nineteen fucking sea I am such a fan of the 911 it's it's my favorite car I've had a few 911s of all the cars I've had needing the one I regret was the 88 turbo I regret getting rid of that I'll always regret having gotten rid of that that car was it was a beast it was a hard ass car but but it when it was going it was like perfect you know yeah and those cars they're so tail-happy yeah oh yeah yeah it was it was trying to kill you all the time if the car was literally like if you get scared and let off the gas I'm gonna kill you in that boost you know what I liked about it was motorcycle fast yeah it was this crazy motorcycle kind of like just high rpm and then the booth would kick in and the rear end would snap and you just be flying like you better be pointed in the right direction you know have you driven a Tesla yet yes you driven the the fast one the P 100 no I haven't driven that one I've driven B I guess it's the regular p1 I drove one with ludicrous mode though so I did maybe that is a period to experience that so fastest thing I've ever driven in my life yeah that's a zero to 60 in like 2.0 or 2.4 yeah and then the Roadster is gonna come out that's 1.9 yeah you know that that was like when motorcycles went crazy would horsemen I mean now they're bikes with over 200 horsepower but when they first came out with insane like the Hayabusas and stuff like - had a friend who was a dealer and he said you know you're gonna be able to buy two rear half of these because he said like people just gonna over to throttle and crash in a shit it's like like yeah you can get the clean back half of a hayabusa or in our water when you sell a kid a hayabusa what percentage those kids wound up crippled or dead I'm not a high percentage honestly not at 100 not maybe maybe a lot but I don't even know if it's that high because have you told jokes and 1 out of 100 people in the crowds heads exploded yeah well you haven't been in my show I really think that you like it I get so deep in cerebral then I throw in a dick joke oh no you know the thing about yeah motorcycling is dangerous but I don't you more people die on Harley's and cruisers or sound like Neil deGrasse Tyson right now no I'm gonna tell you the reason why is because they're the ones who they only ride once in a while mmm and they go to a bar right and they they hang out in the afternoon drinking and then they get on their Harley and go home they don't wear a helmet mmm and they crash and they die but that happens more often than a kid racing around because you know he's a kid he's got quicker reflexes and in a real sport my guys are wearing that the right protective equipment because it's part of the culture but but unfortunately it happens I was just at a motorcycle event last week I was doing a show and they do these rides and one of the guys died on you know during the event it was really sad but unfortunately that that's part of it but whenever people hit me with that I'm like here people die in cars too like that's the Neil deGrasse Tyson side of it yes yeah people die in cars too and this is this is what I choose to do and I've managed the risk we've talked about this right so you know my thing with bikes is look if you live through your 20s you'll be fine your 20s is when you're stupid when involved yeah but but it would be the same thing imagine if you had a gt3 and you were 22 years old I had see obviously fast cars when I was in my 20s I always spent all my money on fast cars yeah and you know the odds are against you or NAT - you know cuz cuz you do you do stupid shit and you also don't know how to handle them correctly don't know the limitations you don't know how to turn or stop mm well you don't know when to turn yeah yeah any yeah like oh that was too late yeah you know when you feel the tires break and you're still going straight like oops yeah or you don't know the road you're on like you never been on this road before and suddenly you suddenly learned what decreasing radius means yes it's just amazing how fast bikes are now they're making electric bikes yeah don't have any shifting which is very interesting to me Harley has a new bike yeah Harley's got an electric bike to live no I haven't I've ridden an electric bike but I haven't ridden Harley's it's supposed to be stupid fast um they all are it's it's all just numbers you know it's it's just like cars right like how many cars now have a top speed of 150 hundred eighty and most of whatever but it's just a number because you're you're not gonna get there right so it just becomes that even even a zero to 60 you know yet well with the Tesla you could do it because you just step on the gas would step on the accelerator yeah and do it but most cars yet it can go that quick but you can't because you're not that good a driver right you know so you you and it's the same thing with bikes so bikes can be super quick but you're not skilled enough to do it like we laugh about it all the time that's it right there yeah that's the hard whoa look at that thing peanut crate what is that crazy shit between your legs up the batteries yeah Wow yes batteries cuz I'm small what a fucking beautiful bike yeah what kind of range you think these things have the one I rode had like a 80 mile I have no idea what the gnarly miles that's it well it can't carry big batteries like right I have no idea what the range of 110 mile range yeah interesting city-dwelling consult consumer travels and traffic frequently a hundred and ten mile ranges we realistic okay so so cutting that down because and make it seventy yeah cuz you're gonna be opening it up every change my plows batteries will recharge from zero to 80% in 40 minutes that's pretty good that's using a stage 3 supercharger connection that's another thing with electric cars and electric bikes they're gonna have to standardize this charging mm-hmm yeah you know cuz it's like okay so Tesla uses one charger then like Audi uses a different one now Harley's gonna like you get you're gonna have to come up with some one size fits all so d1 just plug your car in and charge it you can't have each company having their own well you have Universal ones at the airport and the airport I plugged my car in at the airport this past weekend yeah and that's first time I've ever done it I was like I found a spot Electric have just a little adapter you put on there Universal one okay then it plugs into the Tesla okay what a charged easy so charged while I was gone I got there full charge that'll work then yeah yeah cuz that's what I was thinking cuz you know cuz I heard like Porsches developing a network of charges which I imagine Porsche and Audi you're gonna use the same one yeah right if you have a Tesla supercharger can you plug a Porsche into it I don't think so that's stupid yeah they could they're gonna have to figure that out yeah that's weird were they gonna be like Apple you know it's a lightning cable you can't use use USB see I'm an apple guy the Dhamma tell you where Apple this this is where I drew the line so I I got the iPad right and then I got an iPad Mini and then I wanted to get the pencil do you know there's a separate pencil for the mini iPad in a regular but I was like no I was like no is it really yeah why exactly I was like are you kidding so you want me to spend ninety nine bucks for each one of these pencils and then figure out which one is which right then I can't what if I accidentally had to it was it was ridiculous it's like they do way worse than that there's a website that I follow there's a YouTube channel rather than I follow was a guy who repairs computers and he was talking about how Apple goes out of their way to make things so that they can't be repaired from developing proprietary screws that other people don't have a screwdriver for to literally having motherboards where you cannot replace a piece yeah it's not not possible so this piece goes back they have to replace the entire motherboard and he's like that is so irresponsible yeah and it's like the only reason why this exists is because people allow Apple to do it things like any other company whether it's IBM or over Lenovo or fucking Dell when you buy a laptop from them you there's all these parts you could bring it into a place they can replace this replace that and here's the chip and here's the VAT and it's easy but with Apple they make it so well made so these only Apple yeah like third-party people right they don't want anyone messing with a fucking gross man yeah it's gross you know and then the Lightning see the C cable the lightning bolt thing versus USB see lightning bolt is not as good it's not as read the ban was not as fast doesn't transfer data or power as quickly that's another thing the cable thing it's something like every time you get a new gadget you got another cable yeah if they just went with USB see USB USB see your Android phone every fucking one of them uses USB so yeah because you the fact that you have to carry a different K and then you're like does this fit that and then you know then yeah it's painting it the only thing that Apple has going for it is privacy in terms of phones they are way better with the privacy but because of that privacy and protecting your privacy that's also why Apple maps suck like Apple maps it's not nearly as good as Google Maps because Google Maps has following you to the bathroom yeah and they're sending all that shit to Cupertino or whatever the hell they are they they they get all the data all of it everything from ways from this from that that's also why it works so well you know but there are text messages and all the different things is not as secure as iMessage iMessage is all scrambled and encrypted could well and any other thing with Apple is that you know for someone who's not a techie or whatever it's the integration the seamless integration between the Apple products oh including your if you have I what is it I TV was an Apple TV yeah if you have Apple TV you can like type shit up in your phone your phone syncs to your TV and your Ramona's a keyboard that's your remote yeah every and and you don't have to know how to do it like it right it says oh I'm talking to blob like like you put the password in on your phone then you open up your your iPad and it gets the password from the phone and it's already connected to yeah you know whatever network and stuff like that so things are getting better at that though they're getting closer and closer to filling the gap I mean the new Samsung phones are as good if not better than anything Apple's ever put out yeah the thing is are you in the Apple ecosystem it's all it is yeah which would which one is your normal yes which one is you are you used to it as a hilarious bit about it here's a hilarious bit about being both vegan and Android discriminated against it's fucking hilarious it's really funny the other things to that little the little dots like if someone's like if I send you a text message replying you start replying I see the dot dot dot and then it stops yeah so what's going on what happened you just you just go stood me you just told me oh you're gonna reply but like with a green message if it's an Android you don't know when that's coming part of me likes that better like I don't necessarily want you to know I read your message and he used to these ups when they know you read it yeah cuz now they know you're intentionally not answering yes those little dot dot dots have ratting you out yeah that's what Ian says oh and I don't need everyone to know that I read your message man i dude is so funny he's hilarious and enzyme so happy he finally has a Comedy Central special yeah fine yeah you talk about overdue he's so good yeah who's next Owen Smith yeah he's a mother man Owen man Owen we're talking name we were talking about the business side cuz he was talking about the whole writers thing about writers giving up their agents and this and that and and he was he's so smart on it but yeah Owens hilarious one of the best comics on the planet Earth yeah people don't know great writer yeah and just scrape a form or - yeah he's so funny man I've been working with him a lot late oh yeah yeah man we did a lot of gigs together yes they like arrived in the store he's as good as anybody yeah absolutely and people don't know if hey listen the last thing I need is people publicizing another tall black Colin Smith who finally she ate that show no it's it's great but that is funny that there's a kid named Andre Leclerc out of New York funny guy he did new faces last year and my manager signed him and I was like you know you know it's over when your manager signs a younger better-looking version of you like that's the last thing I needed yes but he's a funny kid but then there's not a good benefit to being good-looking in comedy know is if you want to do sitcoms but they don't know exists if you want to do if you want to get into the movies and do like a rom-com thing sitcoms like that was what Montreal was all about yeah not sure how about you got a development deal and you did sitcoms yeah now you well now it's streaming services and movies on it's still movies are still like a different animal that's a different breed I've zero desire but streaming services and no you know it's really funny too because people talk about acting like I get I'm not an actor and I'm okay with not being an actor I like hosting stuff like at the end and I like unscripted TV and stuff like that but but do you know it wouldn't be like what you want to show well yeah of course I'd want to show I mean it's you know ton of money and this and that but the actual doing it and creating it like my mind has never worked like that you know I mean like like some people they love playing characters and stuff like that and all due respect to that but it's not what I did but people are almost like well why don't you and it's like because it's not my thing Hepburn just have a joke about that yeah yeah comedy is the only thing where they ask you to do something else once you do it right yeah yeah if you're a cook they never ask you do you farm yeah yeah but it was always the way that everybody got famous right man and Seinfeld and Tim Allen and all the guys they got sitcoms based off a stand-up and then they basically became actors yeah but you look at the numbers you know there's a hell of a lot of comics for every one of them that made it to that you know what I mean like like overwhelming there's you know and but for some guys that was like the thing that drove him crazy is that they never got that call like Richard Jeni he was yet you know I remember I saw Jenny in Montreal and at the Comedy Works murdering God he was funny what I mean he was a beast on stage she was a beast people I mean you can see his specials and you kind of get it yeah but if you saw him in real life you'd be like fuck yeah he's the one of the most forgotten GM substantive community was a brilliant stand-up so good I saw him fuck speaking of which he was talking about a Corvette salesman trying to sell him on options on a Corvette and he was talking about that in in Montreal at the Comedy Works and I remember sitting in the back of the room and I remember knowing that he was bummed out because he couldn't get a sitcom he had that one platypus man that's man yeah and he was in the mass and platypus man like HBO special which wanted a great one hours you'll ever see have like if you can find it it wanted a great one hours of comedy he was a monster but he was one of those guys that really wanted a special or excuse me really wanted a television show really wanted to show wanted to be validated you know who I never understood never got a show I mean he's had shows but they never sitcom dahm dahm aurora yeah cuz he's such a natural character well he was honest had come with Damon for a while yeah I think for like half a season mm-hmm and he had the sports show on Comedy Central I write that was funny the football show but it but it just seems like he's such a natural character just being Dom like you know nobody gives a fuck less than da maré era God he knows I wish I was gay just so I can come out of the closet that's how little like saying I wish I was gay they're gonna tell you I'm gay you know fucking hilarious I loved watching him I loved watching George Wallace always those guys are just masters of the art yes yes yep just go on stage and just kill it effortlessly cuz it seems like George Wallace is back in Vegas yeah he went backlash should I do the road for a bit and he's like I know he I think it was one of those I think they made an offer made him an offer he couldn't refuse I think it was one of those deals he's got that great following in vein yeah I mean he always was things that people would go and they were on vacation in Vegas they would go to see George absolutely it was like Rita Rudner had that carrot top at that there's not a whole lot of residents in Vegas these days not anymore not like not on that level where you're aware of it like carrot top always be there but it's a tricky one because if you commit to that you give up all that the road momentum well you got to be able to market it I mean that's where George was brilliant George figured out just what you said for people to go home and tell their friends say when you go to Vegas you got to see George right right like he figured that out and I don't think those translates on the road no no you got a uh I mean again you have to figure out how to build that and yet it takes time to build it doesn't build right away right so you got to be working with a place or working with a producer or somebody who's like yeah we're gonna spend a year building you as a destination show and you have to be well 11 Vegas yeah without that it's like you're you're you're almost you just in some weird purgatory if you can handle it it's okay but it but if you got a vice if you have any vice Vegas is gonna find it and destroy you with it yeah I just worked with mal mal had this great joke with her Vegas he said Vegas the only city you can watch someone become homeless at the table you just watch them yeah like you your whole life is falling apart right now yeah I know but this next role they will let you mortgage your fucking house absolutely yeah what do you want to do it on the roll the dice or hand of cards what do you want to do Vegas is the only gig where they will pay you in advance yes pay you the first night yeah here's some money yeah yeah you go tomorrow Thanks we don't know if you win too much they stopped you from coming back mmm like Dana White from the UFC yeah he gets banned because he's really good at blackjack mm-hmm so he'll win like a million dollars in a night and they banned him from casino because they know who he is but their ban him cuz he's winning yeah like what is this fucking what you only play if you win you piece of shit it's there again but that's your house but that's a ridiculous rule I know they should dish it have to go under they should they all you know it's it's like their rules and they they're all in it together but that seems like rejecting service you know I mean it just seems like they shouldn't be able to do that and then what's a sign you oh I see we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone Yeah right so where do you work when you do Vegas I do Brad Garrett's at the MGM that's a nice pot Club that room and I just did Kimmel's new club I heard that's great beautiful is that the Rio no it's at the link it's that where that big ferris wheel is they open like that Midway strip it's on there so someone have someon something the Rio 2 is not a new one yeah the seller oh that's yet a sellers at the real that's great I heard that's great too yeah Vegas has like they have the Laugh Factory now it's it's comedies made it like part of wide when George left he said wanted things was like for a long time there weren't that many comedy shows he said then suddenly every place had a comedy show so that cuts into ticket sale that makes sense the Mirage is the shit that's my favorites yeah I fucking love that room I just do bigger rooms and I even if I would sell out the bigger room I'd be like fuck yeah it's so good so now I just do the Mirage I'm there all the time from where I'm standing it's quality situation just it's the best man it's like you and I was watching one time Joey Diaz was on stage and I was in the back of the room and in the back of the room with the Mirage it was cool crystal-clear sound that that works for comedy rooms it's right you got to be able to hyrum and see him yeah you know somebody I forget who it was but this it was a musician he said the best room is when you can see everyone's eyes hmm because he had done like big rock concerts and all that and he was like yeah if you can see everyone's eyes you got a good room that's the ice house I saw or like you said comedy works places like that where you can you can actually connect with everybody in there the ice house is tough to fuck with that might be the best the I saw her created room we used to say if you bomb you should be allowed to go to the ice house the next day just to get your confidence back right just like oh man I don't know if act you could do it make OD ice house you could do it and you walk out like yeah I can do you know there's agents that won't accept yes from the ice house because it's just to easier you know it's because it's you do great yeah definitely comedy magic is yeah comedy magic is light and you know Mike and Richard they're so nice to you too nice it's just like confusing you slip because now because now you've ruined people for anywhere else in the food Oh food they'll serve you a steak that you could get in a fucking steak house I when I had broken my wrist right and now I was living in Studio City and this is in Hermosa Beach so to your listeners that's 30 miles apart in LA traffic hour and a half hour at least right Mike was like you know if you if you want we can send a server to bring food to your house like if you can't like Mike I live in seas like yeah I know and he would have done it you know it's like are you kidding me like when I got rice in the Comi store in 2007 he reached out to my agent and said we would love if Joe could work at the comedy magic club we support him we would never hire joke thieves and you know when we know that this is going down with him we would love for him to come here like he's that nice of a guy yeah he's he's uh he's a super nice guy and and Richard the manager Richard still goes places to see comics to see if they you know good for the club yeah that's like no but does that anymore like you you you got video the trickles down from the top you know that love and respect of the comedians and there's to be treating performers well yeah and that's why all the old pros still work there you know that's why you know Ray Romano it like they still go there Leno's still there every Sunday cuz it's like yeah he still goes every Sunday every Sunday that is crazy cuz I know he kind of stopped for a while when he was not doing the Tonight Show yeah he took a break but yeah he's still pretty regular thereafter see I was not seeing him on stage do stand-up ever I have I've only seen him on television as a matter of fact we did a benefit together last year and it was fun watching him work like as the comic you know cuz he was doing he was doing bits and all but he'll still tell a joke but like he's a really good joke teller so he'll tell just a regular joke but it's hilarious because it's so good and then in in Montreal just did a gala and Howie Mandel hosted and it was so much fun watching how he'd be a comic again like how he was doing he was cracking on the crowd like during the commercials like what it you know during the breaks he was just being asked like man it's you could see that he was having fun being a comic not being a TV guy not being a GT guy just yeah I'm just being a stand-up comic and that a GT gig is a great gig I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money but if you go back and listen to how a man down the 80s and the 90s when he was just doing stand-up he was fuckin brilliant yeah he was brilliant a lot of those guys you know and and women with those comics people don't realize how great a comic they had to be to get that job right like he just does this I can't you Arsenio is like that like I've seen people who see Arsenio do stand-up and it's like well yeah there was a reason he got the show yeah they didn't just say hey man that's a funny name like Arsenio is a beast when he does stand-up Jay Leno was one of the weirdest cases right because he doesn't have a body of work well because he never recorded it he said he would never record it because then you sell it then you can't do it anymore yeah and they said so he would but yet he wrote jokes every week for the scenario like right hey Jay put your shit out there buddy I mean people don't know but then you know what did he lose you know I mean it's like he certainly didn't need the money around AJ's ever like man I should have sold merch you know people have knowing how good he is I would think yeah people I guess he's comfortable where he's at you know and and people do well and also you know if you do go see him live that is great that you get to see him and you get to enjoy it nobody wears a jean shirt unless they're comfortable you gotta be you have to be wear it every day there's no goddamn you got a uniform yeah listen Alonzo I gotta wrap this up all right you got a Amazon
