yes and we're live hello Danica Patrick hi welcome to the show thank you thanks for doing this I appreciate it I'm excited to be here you're intense lady intensity when I met you like right away I'm like woah okay take this one in well you know it's the handshake and then it's the you know when someone actually looks you in the eye well you have to be intense I mean what you do for a living is probably one of the craziest things a human being can do do you think so it's up there for a job how fast you go 200 yes I mean like you know NASCAR's top speed is probably 215 Indy cars maybe more like 240 yeah I'm gonna do the Daytona 500 next month and then the Indy 500 in May so those are gonna be my last few races so the last ones ever yeah really yeah it's uh this is my Danica double goodbye to her why are you doing that how come you're doing a Danica double goodbye cookie is it enough is enough I'm ready I mean I love racing but I love other things too so you know I'm okay with transitioning out and there was a lot of things that were kind of just pointing me in this direction yeah in 2017 stuff that has never happened to me before - kind of yeah head towards the exit a little bit but I'm good with it I'm a very decisive person so this is probably one of them that I thought about a little bit as far as like how to be done or or if to be done I guess but the how was the hardest part my agent kept calling and saying what about this and what if you did that and I'm like no no no you all need to get ready for me to be done please Wow and so then he came up with the he's like what if you finish up at the at Daytona for the 500 and I was like what about the Indy 500 and he goes and I was really only referring to the Indy 500 and he was like well I'd I'd love you to do both I was like oh well that's a good idea so there's this thing in racing called the double which is doing the Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend on Sunday and then flying straight to Charlotte to do the coke 600 afterwards and that's kind of known as the double but this is what we're calling the day double and it has to do with just having spent you know a chunk of my career in IndyCar and a chunk of my career in NASCAR and it just kind of feels like the right way to go out I don't know it didn't it wasn't clear it was a bit of a murky end as far as like what's gonna happen am I gonna race next year full-time or not and it just kind of went suit too long for me to have like a proper I'm done sort of moment in my head so this was just a great way to do it so when you say that things happen in 2017 that didn't happen before like what do you mean I got a sponsor leave me my primary sponsor left at the beginning of the year I mean I I signed a contract when Mercury's in retrograde so you know I screwed myself there but I don't know I don't know it was true so I guess maybe the universe is a little bit more straightforward than we think I think a lot of good things probably happen during that time in 2017 or during Mercury retrograde I think people look for some sort of like hidden meaning to things when it comes to like astrology yeah yeah I do try and understand it it's quite I'm trying to understand how it really matters but I don't know there's definitely some things at least with the moon that goes on I mean the water changes with the moon so doesn't that mean that other things should too whether it be energetically or something like that I think the the water and the moon thing kind of makes sense a little bit a little bit mm-hmm but I think it's probably just like barely one way or the other maybe it's a whisper on the wind kind of yeah I think it's more in your head so stop putting my crystals outside to charge under the full moon maybe not so important I would say it's not that important there's something something someone sent me about the army using crystals and I was like this has got to be like an onion article that the art of the army was using crystals for like medics II think if you could see find that way to find it wounded people yeah look at this stupid shit I don't know I don't know I'm sure if it's real US Army's new holistic medics treating gunshot wounds with crystals and essential oils is satire thank you thank you essential oils don't you think there's a plant that cures everything out there there probably is something like that in the Amazon that maybe not cures everything but there's probably a lot of stuff that we can throw essential oils come from right yeah so pair that up with some high vibrational stones high vibrational stones tents so your sponsor leaving you you were like that's it it's just a never happened to me before I've always been someone that's been really well funded and I always had a sponsor always had a sponsor and never a problem and so yeah it was just things like that were happening I got in a few big wrecks in a row like probably three and six weeks that were mmm you know like I was bawling in the medical center after the third one going I mean I was running like top ten and a car blew a rotor and clipped me and put me in the wall I was on fire another driver broke his back I mean it was a huge accident and I'm like what is what is the message why does someone trying to tell me right now and so you know after I collected my shit and got my face looking like halfway decent to go talk to the media out there I finally got out but yeah just stuff like that was happening and I was I was in a very go with the flow mood in 2017 I wasn't pushing for anything because I wasn't really sure what I wanted so I just let the universe take care of it you've got a very interesting way of looking at things you when things go wrong you're like what is the universe trying to tell me you're not like well I Drive really fucking fast for a living and sometimes shit goes wrong that happens too I mean it seems like car racing is just inherently crazy I mean it's what I was saying what I was saying you do one of the craziest things you can for a living going 240 miles an hour is no joke yeah metal and rubber and things just yeah trust in something when you're out there because you're doing like you said 200 plus miles an hour with you know people that aren't your friends around you with walls don't you as well so you know you kind of gotta put your trust in something else yeah that's why I was getting at that because I think the way you think is a lot it's very similar to the way fighter pilots think fighter pilots have a lot of weird superstitions and a lot of a lot of pilots do a lot of people that are involved in things it's almost like in order to get through the the task at hand you almost have to delegate certain aspects of reality to fate or to chance or to write yeah I believe that yeah I mean they have a tattoo on my back one of us in America it's an American flag I got that when I was 19 it's like an American flag that fades to a checkered flag and then there's and then I got that when I was 19 then when I was about 27 I went and got the rest which was angel wings and some stars and you know it's not the most beautiful piece art but it means something to me won't be really beautiful in 30 years I'm sure 40 but it's but yeah my point is is that I would definitely pray that you know I was taken care of and you got a hand that off and just go do your damn job and not be afraid and just trust in the fate of everything and yeah so that's kind of where the angel wings came well I think that people that do inherently risky things oftentimes look for signs or look for some sort of you know some direction some some message from the universe and that's why I was well I mean I feel like as a racecar driver I've thought about this a lot lately and I wonder how much of our job is a little less even just feeling what's happening and how much is actually maybe more intuitive like maybe we're maybe we're having more intuitive understanding of what's going on and what's coming then we realize we just are so everything's happening so fast and that you you just think oh I have really good feel you know I mean I'm sure there's some of that too but so I think that maybe maybe you're maybe maybe athletes or people at an elite level or more in touch with that intuitive side that finite like last thread of feel maybe it's beyond feel yeah knowing that makes sense I mean if you think about the amount of time that you've spent involved in that intense activity in this you know they say that people get road rage for one of the reasons why people get road rage is because when you're driving you are reacting to things that happen instantaneously very quickly so your body is at a very heightened state and people you know someone cuts you off you they'd start freaking out like instantly they go from 1 to 10 right away and the reason is because they're always at 7 and they don't even realize they're at 7 when you're in the car you're probably at like 13 this one goes to 11 yeah you mean you're cranked up right and so you're probably seeing things and feeling things that the average person yeah they don't experience in their life 1 percent yeah you're just working at that top little top level of feeling of of focus that were you calling in the zone yeah where it kind of almost becomes slightly out-of-body you know how it's happening it's just happening well I would imagine like you kind of melt away and you're just completely involved when I think when I think about what I have to do like let's say as an example coming in for a pit stop and you got your throttle brake clutch gears all the different things that you have to do to think about it logically what you have to do is so much more confusing than just going on instinct of like just do it because you have to you know used you only have two feet but you have three pedals and you have to use all three pedals at some point in time but you want to be ready for everything and you're coming in like with the clutch in on the brake but then you have to get back to the get to the get to the throttle just in time but you have to have the clutch in and you have to hold the brake so you make sure you don't roll there's all kinds of things you have to do using all three pedals which you have to feet and so when you kind of when you have to think about what you have to do it's a little more overwhelming than just doing it do you drive a manual in real life I would I love it easy yeah I do too yeah yeah but I mean a lot of people it seems like it's kind of a dying thing yeah it is I mean even Indy cars went to paddle shifting before I was done it was h-pattern and then it was sequential gearbox and then it was paddle shifting and then but NASCAR NASCAR still still got the ol H pattern that left leg is important for the whole feel of the thing right well especially in an Indy car in an Indy car you actually have a full-on dead pedal so you have all three pedals and then you have a dead pedal which is is important because you spend a lot of time with your foot there but it is part of the feel it is absolutely part of the feel of the car especially with all the g-loads how did you get involved in racing I race go-karts when I was a kid my sister and my sister wanted to race go-karts and I just didn't want to get left out so turns out I was alright it and I kept going but it's it's a very unusual path yeah well I mean I did everything though I was I played like coach pitch then tee ball I was in the band the choir I took voice lessons I was a played basketball volleyball cheerleading I played in every sport I took tumbling classes and then I also tried racing so you've always been intense yeah yeah for sure did you know at a certain age that you wanted to be a racecar driver well when I was 10 I decided that I wanted to go to college for engineering so I could learn how to work on my race car and I realized wow I learned to be an engineer so that you could work on your race car do you understand how crazy that is thirty ten years to be thinking that well I don't know do you think you're born that way or mine olds like what do you think about that like to be thinking that way when I'm 10 years old like you you know some people are just so much different or more mature further along is it why do you think that is it's a very good question I don't I I think it's entirely possible that memory gets transferred through DNA and that there are certain people that have a long line of adventurous people in their family and that gets transferred to the DNA of the children I think it's entirely possible I have is not a spiritual reincarnation no maybe I mean look it's that's an that's entirely possible to I would never I would never say no to that because if you're living this life I mean nobody asked to live this life you just hear right mm-hmm who knows if you get to do it again I mean we're assuming that you don't get to do it again because we're assuming that time goes on sort of linear way but maybe it just does for you in this life it's entirely possible that there's infinite number of lives being lived out in infinite timelines all simultaneously we just this one we don't even know what happens when we sleep you go to sleep you close your eyes if some crazy dream about Godzilla chasing you when you're on a skateboard you wake up in the morning and you just assume that you're on the same timeline that you were on before mm-hmm you know because you have known the astral who knows I don't you know I have children and in one of the things that's really fascinating about watching a child develop from a baby to you know a kid and see their personality it's like you realize like there's a lot of stuff that's just that's what they come with yeah that's what I'm saying so it's just different why you know why why was I thinking about being an engineer when I was 10 years old why was I brave enough to go live in England by myself when I was 16 and all good with it and you know why why why why my intent why did why was I intense when you met me yeah well I think part of your intensity is probably if I had a guess if I could be presumptuous you are a woman involved in a very manly activity and I'm sure men probably test you in some sort of a weird way and so I bet along the way you've developed this sort of like way of addressing them right away like a listen motherfucker sometimes just like that yeah I mean I think you probably have to you know I would imagine happen to be strong you have to I remember when I was younger and going to meetings with companies or team bosses people like that and was the advice given was don't say oh I think this and maybe like you'd be sure about what you want and I remember that so yeah a nature versus nurture some of its learned but some of its just there yeah you can't turn a timid person to you may be good but I mean it's not not likely you would you you seem to be like this person this is just who you are yeah if you're telling me that at 10 years old you were thinking about being an engineer so you could work on race cars that's not normal yeah I mean what's normal what you want to do when you were 10 years old I had no idea I probably wanted to be an artist I think I wanted to be an artist that follows this vein sort of yeah but I used to want to draw comic books I did a lot of that yeah so that was probably what I wanted but I was never like what I need to do is like I need to figure out a way to make my hand stronger so they draw faster let's keep in mind I did not go to college in fact I didn't even finish high school you didn't at all nope I left when I was 16 and I got my GED Wow I failed the first time Wow I don't know why yeah okay good because that's like a horrible like I failed my GED oh geez I the Constitution test is something at least in Illinois I don't know if you have to pass it in every state but in Illinois you do and so in eighth grade to go to high school you have to get a 70% or above to go to high school I got a 70 so I went to high school now I'm like a 3.5 and above student like I was a zandi's not a problem for some reason the Constitution and government and all of those sectors and names and holy moley it's so confusing to me so so then when it came time to do my take my GED I didn't study at all I just took the test and I failed the Constitution test yeah I mean I've never studied in my life so anything no really yeah the only thing I study up and well study if I'm doing a speech or if I'm doing it something for a for a company for a sponsor and I need to make sure that I have my talking points ready I mean I spend 15 minutes or thirty minutes or five minutes making sure that I'm organized in my head about what it is that I need to get out there so that I can do my job and deliver but other than that I I never studied in school keep in mind I didn't have to go to school that long I never it's true I mean I only went to school until I was 16 so it's been a really really really long time since I went to school but you're very smart oh I don't know see I I know you're smart thank you well but do you read um I actually I want to start reading more I've got a lot of books that I want to read I started reading a book called the holographic universe okay Michael Talbot right yeah yeah it's good book is that it's weird yeah there's a lot of stuff in that you're like wait a minute it's kind of drugs exactly there's a lot of whoo I think a little whoa so it's good I am in simple books like The Alchemist and stuff I just really want to read these books I mean and yeah that's more woo woo yeah woo woo shit yeah I am why do you think that that is the racecar thing do you think that's like there's nothing to do or anything this is who you are that's just who I am I remember getting a psychic reading when I was 18 years old living in England yeah mm-hmm yeah I I bought like Lynda Goodman's love signs like astrology book when I was a kid so when you were 16 and you got a psychic reading man I totally had a mood ring Oh mood rings are great sorry good do what did what did they tell you they tell you you remember I can't remember but when I was talking about signing my contract and when Mercury's in retrograde that was I talked to an astrologer and she said just don't sign any contracts and I was like well what if I saw I mean I was kind of learning about some of this stuff because it was quite a few years ago now but I I remember the next was a year and a half later so and you know shit hit the fan and I was like that damn astrologer was right now okay mercury in retrograde it's pretty standard information if you're in the strategy at all but but yeah she said I saw a psychic in Sedona a few years ago and she said that professionally over the next four years your life's gonna go boom boom boom boom boom and I thought hey I'm gonna win a bunch of races is gonna be awesome and instead I have a clothing line now I have a book that just came out the beginning of the year my wines finally been for sale for a year now and there's other projects I'm working on - but and you know finishing off my career in a pretty big way so I guess she was right I think that lady's full of shit she took a guess I think she looked at you and like this chicks gonna kick ass I'll just make some do you think she recognized me then she's like okay so when I sat down she was like alright the way it works here is like I just see words or symbols or things around you so if I just look around like don't think I'm not paying attention you I'm just just how I see things and so I'm like alright I'm sitting there she's telling me all this stuff and she says whatever my job is I travel a lot and things that and then she all the sudden kind was looking at me she look over she goes celebrity are you a celebrity and I was like I only am if you think I am just usually how I answer people so I don't know did she know who I was growing up in Sedona they don't watch a lot of TV I don't think you don't think so they do their lunch break areas you know they arrest their crystals on the TV sending positive vibes almost all bullshit I think almost all psychic stuff is bullshit I think you don't believe in the end being intuitive I think into intuition is a different thing I think when people sit down and they go I see you in a past life and you are a handmaid and you you you work by the river fuck out of here I think that's all bullshit I think those people are just nuts and there's a lot of people that want to think they're special and they want to think they're special gifts and everybody does people get really good at reading people I know people who are professional magicians and they are expert cold readers they could sit down with you and breed and tell you remarkable amounts of things with you about your life just with your answers to questions they'll tell you right away they're not psychic like there's a guy named Banacek who's excellent at it he's fantastic he does a show in Vegas and he freaks people out they'll tell you right away I am NOT a psychic he's like this is a there's techniques to this and it's something I've been doing my whole life and you just get really good at it and he knows how to do it and these people are con artists they're they're con artists they trick you into thinking that they have spent but they might even believe it themselves that's part of the problem a lot of those people con themselves but I think there is something like when you're thinking about someone and they call you know where you haven't talked about synchronicities that pop up in your life you're like oh my god I was thinking about that movie and there it is on TV yeah it's entirely possible that there's some bizarre connection that we don't totally understand events into people and into things well like attracts like or where attention goes energy flows yeah there's probably a lot to that certain magnetism to those things that bring it together yes maybe but I think it's very very poorly understood and there's a lot of woo that's clouding it up and that woo gets in the way of rational logical educated people even considering it they dismiss it instantaneously because it's connected to so many assholes with neon signs it's a card reader palm reader and these people that just they're just ripping you off that's all they're doing they don't have a real job they sit down they talk to people for a job and you know you could say it's entertainment you could say that what they're doing is they're they're providing you with a service and that serves they sit down with you and and maybe by telling you that everything's gonna be amazing you'll walk out of there with a lot of enthusiasm and then life will be amazing no do you believe that if you think your life's gonna be amazing it will be no no you get a meteor you can follow to a crack on the ground from an earthquake I mean those people that died in the tsunami in Thailand didn't were they bad people no they just do this is there any level of woo that's worth following through on I think it's all things I think some some of the connections and the intuition and some superstitions and ideas that we have are probably based in there's a limited understanding that we have in the connection that we have to events and humans and life but I think there's also bullshit involved too and all these things get very cloudy I don't think there's an absolute but I think it's it's entirely possible that intuition is a developing sense that we don't totally have yet I think if you think about all the things that people can do hearing and seeing and touching and smelling and all the different senses that we have we assume that that covers the full gamut of possibilities but I don't think that's true no I think you're right I mean even visually visually you know we don't see the full spectrum of we see a very very small amount of things that are out there yeah an audio as well you know we can't hear all the sounds yeah I mean it's entirely possible that there's more going like there's certain people that have a weird feel to them you meet him you like I just gotta get away from this guy yeah there's there's definitely people that they're giving off weird feelings and it could be that you're reading their intent in some sort of a way that you don't see visually but you reckon by their body language or there could be a bunch of things that put you didn't run when you met me so no I appreciate that were probably scheduled to do this interview so you couldn't I was looking forward to this why would I run I mean I was I was impressed by your intensity but I expected that you know what I mean I just don't see how you could be a racecar driver and not being too especially be a woman in a race car driver and not that intense well that's nothing I even thought about until I was like 14 for the first race way late in life I think about being a girl out there it wasn't until I had cameras following me around my schools and stuff that I was like alright maybe this is and then they start asking you about their like what's it like to be a girl you like how many other girls do it I mean there are various girls here and there but you know like in all of NASCAR how many women are right or racing Oh at my level knows 0 yeah that's crazy well that's pretty crazy I don't know yeah that's easy to it well take it from me I mean what's it like to be a girl in racing I'm like well I don't really know what it's like to be a guy so you know I only have my perspective that's true you know I mean I don't know like being a girl versus a guy what's the difference I don't know what's it like to be a guy yeah probably different but I think that like what's it like to be a woman that's the only woman who's in NASCAR at your level that's that's a valid question I mean that's crazy how does everybody else treat you yeah that that really is the main question I can't answer because I'm not them and I I know that from from enough experience now because I used to not really look into it much and in the IndyCar days you couldn't hit each other you know you really I mean it was you know you could block and things like that so there was some guys out there that were assholes and I didn't like them but you know sometimes every driver has some dress some other drivers that they don't really get along with and so but in NASCAR you can hit each other and it's you have bumpers and which is really cool but it also isn't cool because if somebody wants to do it they can so what would I say I would say that they don't want to get passed by a girl and you know what I don't either is that weird no I really don't I mean I've driven I've raced with girls and I don't I don't like it so do you do you feel differently when a guy passes you than when a girl passes you probably yeah yes and what why well you don't you just go internally that bitch I'm like I can't believe my car isn't faster right sucks but if it's a guy that passes that are not good that I'm like you know come on the radio and I'll be like yeah I just want you to see that what car passed me and how bad my car is out now right now so it happens with guys too but you know I don't know it's just a cultural norm that girls aren't good in a lot you know aren't very good and that they they somewhat don't belong and I get like a little bit of animosity at first but I would have thought that people would have got got used to it a little bit more than they did so but you have that cultural and mas that you were saying a little bit yeah yeah I don't know where it comes from but when you say that it's a it's a cultural norm that girls aren't good you don't think about that about yourself no yeah see I knew that there's you don't have any doubts I get everyone out there I'm like you suck because of this and I'm gonna beat you cuz of that and right god I hate you I don't think because I'm a girl I'm not as good as though no not at all so why would you think that about the other I don't know I just cuz I'm not used to it right you just something you're not used to yeah that makes sense yeah well also it's like you're unique I mean what if you were out there in the gym and some girl comes and picks up more weight than you and you're like that's weird I bet that bitch is on roids she probably would be Amazon freak some genetic freak I try to sign her punch yeah yeah I don't know I think I think we all have cultural prejudices to a certain extent whether we admit it or not and you know maybe you're not a bigot maybe you're just maybe just have reservations and you're pleasantly surprised when people surpass those expectations yeah you know but I would think that you would experience probably more discrimination as a woman than I mean if you think about a woman doing almost any other job like if you're telling me you're the only woman that does that and you're at this intense macho job this is a fucking intense job I mean you're going 200 miles an hour everybody's it's nuts that's a crazy job and you're out there at the top of the food chain with all these men yeah I would I would imagine there's two things that happen there's a bunch of guys that treat you with respect mm-hmm they're they're like wow they look impressed yeah yeah they're cool with you they'll and she's one of us that's right and then there's a few that are just dicks mm-hmm and that those dicks are just encouraging and the amount of times I wish I was good at taking people out I wish people knew how hard it was to actually take someone out on track it's not that easy because you can risk yourself exactly yeah and if your car doesn't handle very well you can't get close enough to him if you could you would just move the air which is almost like hitting them and get them out of the way but sometimes the car doesn't handle well enough so like you'd have to just bomb in there and God willing you hit him to get you to slow down and then days go sailing and you keep going but it's risk that's a rare moment right yeah have you done before I've tried to take people I suck at it I absolutely suck at it I've taken myself out like three times trying to do it I mean look I'll be the lamb I don't mind to make a point yeah I got to make a point if someone's driving like a dick yeah yeah there was uh what was the one that was the most sad was um it was a couple years ago it was at Martinsville and this is when something was going down with it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano and it was during the chase which is the last ten races of the season and they were in the chase Matt and Joey and Joey had made it so that Matt couldn't get in because he took him out a week earlier a week or two earlier and then they got to Martinsville and it's a very very small short track it's just a half a mile and so it's easy to kind of be able to attack if you want to and so he just straight took him out and there's a whole big hoopla about it people up in arms thought it was totally unfair and anyway during the same race some asshole hits me takes pins me out and so I come back and I'm a lap down or something cuz he spins me out and I go to take him out and I just sail off into the corner he manages to kind of keep going I spin again because I'm horrible at it and turns out that you know I get a fifty thousand dollar fine because I am I'm not racing for position because I was a lap down and they applied that because that was also the same race that Matt and Joey had their big thing and I think maybe Joey was leading or something like I think he was leading and it was on a restart so they weren't racing for position either so that was kind of like their rule that they put forth to make for I mean Joe Matt probably got a hundred or two hundred thousand dollar fine but there I am you know not the I'm definitely screwed in this scenario so I got fined 50 grand for it and I'm the one that's out so if you're another guy if you're racing for position then it's okay to bump into each other apparently yeah so really you're the one that's screwed because if you're racing if someone takes you out and then you're still racing for position now you're gonna have to be potentially you know putting yourself in another position to get taken out when they started it there's no win for the person that's being aggressed was it always legal to bump into each other it's gone kind of through waves of different rules but yeah I mean it is legal but whenever a big accident happens and there's a tragedy I would assume that that's when they tighten down the rules sometimes sometimes not sometimes they just accept that it just happens sometimes it's just usually if there's something like that that happens it's not from one person's action that it's maybe a chain of events that leads to something like that it's one of the rare jobs that you do that's a sport one of the rare sports where the potential for death is always there yeah it's true it is true is that one of the reasons why you decided like I am NOT a daredevil like I am NOT a daredevil I went bungee jumping and that is the bravest thing I've ever done otherwise and I only did it because I'm afraid of heights so I just needed to know that if I had to conquer a fear I could well what's your definition of a daredevil your to do things or you could potentially get hurt I'm not though that's true yeah but you're a race card right now but I'm a methodical driver I'm methodical I don't go out there and just you know hold it wide open until the car does something and then I don't better lift now I'm like a methodical driver so I build up well I think what you're saying is you're not stupid that's like a really really nice way to say that yeah you're not dumb but you're definitely a daredevil thank you well I have to be I'm not there's no way you could not be I'm just not I'm serious watch what anybody that really knows me knows that I'm not brave oh wow that's so crazy I know it's a I think I think you're talking crazy crazy talk over here well it's true I I just have been grooming this talent since I was ten and 26 years later I'm I'm okay with it I think it's both of those things but I think there's no doubt that you're a brave person there's knit actually my first time in a go-kart was horrible well you three ten ten and my sister was eight my dad built the go-karts there's a big parking lot out back so we got like spray cans wd4 what up pop cans I don't know whatever yeah I grew up in the Midwest so pop and set him up in a big circle for my sister and I to go out and drive around and drive our go-karts for the first time and my dad made there was a little mistake with the brake pedal and so it stopped working and since I'm 10 and I'm really young and dumb and I don't know what I'm doing young dumb and broke I guess I was yeah like the song goes but I I went to hit the brake it wasn't there so instead of just spinning out or continuing to turn I just went straight and I was headed for a trailer like kind of a higher elevated trailer which would have resulted in decapitation roll and I swerved at the last second and hit a concrete wall and I like go flying in my arm lays back on the on the muffler and my cool puffy jacket burns and like I bruises all up my legs and on my arms and that was my first time in a go-kart within you know five or ten minutes of being out there and so my dad just got a new one and built it and we Racing so maybe I am really brave I don't know you're right maybe it's I always felt like an IndyCar to some degree I wasn't brave because people were willing to do things that were perceivably more brave but I also I did describe them as dumb you're right now so you're probably a little right and I'm maybe a little right too but you're right I think you definitely brave but I think there's definitely a line where bravery becomes stupid because the risk outweighs the reward 100% yeah that's a masculine thing in a lot of ways because it's testosterone makes you do really stupid shit well they're all competing against each other and they're trying to out macho each other I mean you could go there's a bunch of Twitter accounts you can go and see what's that one hold this beer yeah is a Twitter account called hold my beer well exactly why I do everything it's like roofs and stupid shit it's almost all men there's occasionally a drunk girl doing something stupid but it's almost entirely men so I think that men trying to out macho each other somewhat inferior then because they do a lot of dumb stuff maybe their hormones are not in balance like ours they definitely when competing against each other will do dumb shit drone yeah toss drones to blame well they try to out macho each other yeah yeah I mean some don't some are smart and they don't but you know there's it's just a part of being a man it's like trying to prove that you're not scared what else is part of being a man tell me about men what do you wanna know know what else is what else is uh very manly that women don't understand what what does what what what don't women understand about men that's a good question I have no idea what you understand about us hmm maybe just speak from experience mm-hmm yeah but I don't know what like if we ask a guy like what's wrong Oh see that's just nonsense talk see that's like honey what's wrong what's wrong and you're like nothing sometimes really is it really nothing yeah sometimes you just wanted to like decompress okay you know sometimes just wild is that annoying when a girl does that depends on the girl you know I mean depends on the girl she's annoying yeah it's annoying but if you're in love with her and she's awesome the right 100% that's a hundred percent yeah if someone's asking you questions and you're getting really fucking annoyed it's probably not the question it's probably more the person if you yeah I think someone's amazing and they ask you something stupid you'll just laugh you won't get annoyed and you guys could both joke around about how stupid it was how the question was dumb that's good you get angry it's most likely you're just like annoyed anyway so you're just like ready - ready - ready to sort of fall over that annoying and - get out get out of my space kind of attitude because you're already annoyed with them anyway you already don't really like them yeah there's probably something that's already rubbing you the wrong way and you're tolerating each other instead of enjoying each other hmm yeah I mean I would imagine a person like you a very intense person you probably have a difficult time finding you know like if you get a square peg in a square hole and everything slides in together perfect and everything's amazing personality wise you know behavior wise mm-hmm I would imagine what something like you look it's very particular you have to find someone who appreciates your intensity right yeah like a lot of times guys are they want a demure you know sort of like docile little creature you know a home well suppers on the table and here when you get back right I mean while you're out there with a fucking go-cart going 150 miles an hour in the driveway running five businesses yeah yeah you're going 200 yeah so if you're saying what's wrong the guys I fucking nothing it's probably a bunch other shape that's really wrong it's very insightful hmm all right so what what don't men understand about women um she's tapping her fingers through it everything I mean I just think that we'd like to be you know we like to be told what you're hmmm I do I'd like to know what someone's thinking you know the whole like we're just you know just keeping to myself like tell me about it now I want to know what yourself is thinking about I want to know about you what's going through your head like communication now is this universal amongst all your girlfriend's when you get together and talk about I would think so yeah yeah so the problem is like you look at a guy and say you know you really like this guy you're like this fucking dude some crazy mystery like what's going on your headband yeah that's not good spit it out everyone wants to know where they stand and what someone's thinking oh where they stand well because and it's where they stand on what they're thinking because you know what if the thinking about someone else oh so you need to know yeah you just need to know if you're all in yeah 100% yeah I'm just an all in person so for me it's not a mystery like you wanna know what's going on my head I'll tell you right now that's intense yeah yeah so yeah for guys like off drifting you automatically assumed this motherfuckers thinking wrong somebody else now what are you up to exactly that's what you're thinking yeah yeah exactly you wanna be able to ask I guess guys probably do that too and girls like to hear nice things to girls like to hear you know girls like to be you know girls like of course you know to be appreciated just like a guy does I mean I think that's my advice most of the time in relationships I'm like sympathy goes a really long way because I know it goes a long way with me no matter what facet of my life it is but you know sympathy goes a long way so you know if your husband's in a bad mood then why don't you just actually start off with instead of feeling like you're underappreciated going hey baby look like you've had a really long day and I'm sure you've been working your butt off like what can I can I make you dinner like what do you want what's your favorite you know and they'll probably go oh you know what is not that not that big of a deal you know what they won't find hey let me take you out to dinner I get to eat the sympathy gets sympathy back and you don't it's not it's not good to do it to get it necessarily but you should really feel like you are sympathetic like if they're in a bad place try and help them that sound advice yeah be nice to each other just sympathy just be nice because most people go under appreciate especially in a relationship I think the longer it goes there's a lot of under appreciation and assumptions that get made about who does what and checks that box off and you and people kids right amount through with kids it gets way worse it's just there's a lot of time that's involved with taking care of those little suckers you got to pay attention to them and talk to them and they and if you have more than one like once you start talking to one the other one wants to just both chime in you know and show you what they're doing and they wait I was busy just trying to make sure you don't die and now I got a deal with this yeah yeah I think people get used to things you know and that's that's part of the problem they get used to each other for granted yeah they do and then and then you know it's like I always tell people aspire to be the person you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid if you could be that person all the time you would have a much better life if you just like I also love the expression for every hot chick there's a dude sickest crooner yeah I don't say it that way but yes I use more flavorful language but yeah is that was that too much or too little too little oh yeah how would you say it for every hot chick there's a guy somewhere that's tired of fucking her okay but yeah I mean I guess but that's not entirely true either no I mean it's for the most part a lot of the times it's true but a lot of the times people don't appreciate him for saying exactly and then it's with various aspects of your life like I always feel like that like I just got over the flu week and a half ago I had the flu and I was sick for like two days and then when I was sick I was thinking man I don't appreciate how good I feel when I'm healthy hmm because Here I am lying here I'll take in watching Netflix feeling like shit going Wow well I'm healthy and I'm working out and I'm running and doing jujitsu and all the activities and I got all this energy and I feel great like I just can't do anything right now I just take it for granted you do yeah get like you know feel the joy of just being healthy it just escapes us we just so think it's normal for granted yep yep now do you think that you are stepping away from racecar driving when you deciding it just like enough is enough do you think that in some ways that this is you appreciating other aspects of life too that you're you're you're looking at your racing thing and you're like you know what I did a lot I did enough and then why don't I just appreciate all the other stuff well I think that's a good question and leading me into a good thought like I think it's actually more me being honest like I think everyone would expect since I do what I do at the level that I do it at that racing is my only thing I care about I love it so much I'll do anything I Drive every day and the truth is no I like racing but I don't there's a lot of things I don't really like about it too and I'm grateful for everything it's given me but if you were to ask me what I do outside of racing in my personal life I don't go to the racetrack I don't really watch races I don't I don't do that so those aren't my hobbies like your hobbies are your real loves what do you not like about it well I would say that in the last year so the just the as far as an energetic space it's just so sad and negative at time a lot of the time and even in just racing in general most of the time it's miserable like you have some days that are good but most of the time it's not happy and you wish there was you're you you're your own you're not satisfied you wish somebody would have treated you better out there you there's so many things to be negative about and just the grind of it it's the people like everybody's worn out and you know you have to be really careful about the people that are around you because they've got to be in a good mood because it's easy to spiral out of control because you see each other for three four days a week every week for 40 weeks a year so you know you gotta be in a good space with people but it still doesn't alienate you completely even if they're you're in a good space with people the ones next to you because you got a car next to you on both sides in the garage and haulers next to each other and buses right next to each other and you see a bunch of other people so you know just I don't know there's a lot of negativity to some degree a lot of grind it just kind of feels like the grind a little bit and so I just kind of felt like it wasn't a space that I wanted to be in as much anymore like I I want to be in a happy space where I'm just doing things that have bring me joy and yeah it just it wasn't doing that as much or I was noticing it I was noticing I was missing that or wanting it more I think that's really what it comes from is growing as a person and realizing I think everybody's afraid to take chances and do something new in their life because they're identified a certain way or they'll be judged if they don't do it or judged if they do something different and who are they now and are they crazy and what are they thinking and you know it's just life just do things that make you happy it's interesting because you're talking about this and the negative aspects of it is all interpersonal relationships talking to people you're not talking about that the grind of racing itself like the heat of being in the car and the strain and the intensity and the nerves you're not talking about that yeah I didn't I didn't that's not the first thing I mean that is a that exists on some level but I mean that's that's fine I workout them I workout twice a day a lot a lot of times so I'm okay with the whole workout physical grind of things yeah yeah what do you do CrossFit and like interval running training sprinting stuff like that circuits twice a day volt stuff yeah couple days a week I do twice a day maybe more intensity yeah very intense for sure yeah that's that's that's that's the name of the game and get it get in get out so so yeah so I I mean that that is part of it the physical part of racing exists and it is exhausting but I mean you recover from that every weekend but yeah it's yeah let's just and I just love so many other things like what are you what are you gonna do now well the longest project I have is my wine I bought the property in 2009 planted a vineyard and it's finally for sale so so it started in 2009 so nine years yeah doing this bought the property planted it up started from working so it came from in 2006 I went to Napa Valley on a trip and was on this beautiful property I'm just like looking at the fog in the valley and it was wonderful quiches and fruits for breakfast and this amazing white wine and I was like man it would be so cool if I could have something like this someday but I don't have fifty million dollars at least not right now anyway and because I never abandoned the thought that I would be able to afford that someday I just didn't I couldn't then so anyway I just started the process a different way I didn't buy a wine that was built and established for the vineyard I bought dirt planted the vineyard how do you go about doing that do you hire someone well I that that day I met a winemaker who ended up going into consulting instead of just being at one winery and so he actually helped me pick the property he's still my winemaker today so you you buy this piece of land and then like who does the day-to-day stuff you're so busy yeah I have a GM handles all of it and does the promotion and gets it in restaurants and you know you know help sell it what's it called somnium which is a latin world latin word means dream Wow yeah I was looking at some language translations trying to come up with I was probably trying to come up with some sort of an LLC or something like that to cover the property up and I was like oh no this is way too cool this is what the wine should be called so somnium it's a latin word and are you doing red and white or just why so red start only the vineyard is Cabernet Cab Franc Petit Verdot and so from the cap Franck and Petit Verdot bleed off we're gonna make a rose a this year and then we also then source some grapes from Knights Valley to make a 7ul Blanc so we we just decided it was going to come out in the spring along with the with the cab early release and the and the and the rose a but it needed some time and barrel so we're gonna wait a little longer and put it in barrel that's fascinating so that much take a shitload of your time and thinking as well honestly that's probably the least amount of my time that company but I would imagine if you have this giant investment you got the scholars I invest mint I would imagine yeah you have someone working for you they're growing grapes you have two employees and farmers at farming not full I mean they firm many other properties but but yeah were you affected it all by the crazy fires no actually I was really lucky the the Napa Valley fires were I'm on Silverado trail side up it's actually very very close to how Mountain Appalachian but it's some like like 60 feet off of being home out in the Appalachians so anyway way down south on Silverado trail there's fire and then straight across the valley not too far laterally across but it was all the way across the valley was the fires on the other side so I was about as far away from it all as I could get and so I just talked to my winemaker a few days ago and he said that there's really nothing no residual from any of the fires or anything that's amazing like with my wine anyway so that was such a bummer that fire was the same oh my gosh they said it was going I forget the exact number but it was something in insane like it was going a football fields distance in three seconds at its peak I know that the big root I think the big reason was the wind came in like 40 plus mile an hour winds came through that night very very very devastating for some but that's one company the clothing line was called warrior so that came out a year ago January of last year of 17y Warrior when is it like affliction like skulls and swords and shit no this is a warrior jacket I have on it's very nice lovely no it's more athleisure so really sure have you ever leisure no oh yeah it's a hole there you go thanks umm I just like a 17 year old it's yeah it's like leggings and sports bras and t-shirts and jackets shirts and yeah athleisure uh-huh so I want to go back to this wine thing okay so you have this thought about something yeah well I'll go buy some tell me where I can get it can you get it anywhere somnium wine calm it's no it's not sold in very many places and mostly online it's not there's not very much made so okay so you can order it online and you guys will ship it mm-hmm okay so now you you get this piece of property and you start talking to this guy it was a consultant and you start talking about making wine like what is the process like how does it you you have to you buy the property and then how do you get the seeds how do you get the right grapes how do you know well you have to go through a bunch of permitting so permitting for plans for it there's a certain grades that are not so if it's over 20 degrees grade then you have to have special approvals but under you can plant so I literally planted six acres ish of max it's the max that I could plant on my 24 acres that I have that was below 20 degree grade and so so you have to go through erosion control permitting because it's you know the slopes and if you're gonna dig up the ground you don't want it to slide down the mountain if it rains so we had to kind of get creative with some of the infrastructure to dissipate the water and so it didn't create just rivers and rushing of you know new dirt sliding down the hill so because it's at that elevation a little bit so and then you hire farmers and then the winemaker helps pick out the root stock and the clones and then they plant it you wait a couple of years for it to be ready and then they start making wine so it starts with clones which is you know it's not first a root stock what is he graft on the clone that they want what's a root stock the actual root yeah that would be I I wish I knew every single thing that you're asking to the enth degree but I mean that would be like Cabernet Thibodaux white wine right whatever I'm sure were you there when they did all this oh no I don't want to see what that is that sounds fascinating tiny little tiny little roots yeah but just and they put the trellising up and then you know then you get into you know depending on your winemaker they decide then how much fruit to drop so sort of the vine comes up and splits off and makes like a tea and so they decide how many clusters they keep on each side to determine you know what kind of wine you're making so you know we drop a lot of fruit to make really good wines what does that mean by drop fruit like you literally cut the cut the cluster off of the vine oh so you yeah that's why I like if you're buying bulk wine it's they're not dropping a damn thing right alright if you're buying grapes they're also not dropping a damn thing or well not as much probably because they're because they're there they're there but you're paying by the ton so this is a long process oh it's a really long process like to go nine years from your time you start to making your first bottles and that's probably why most people you know I mean if you have enough money to build a winery you're probably a bit older and like you run out of time yeah yeah I mean especially if you're gonna get any return on your investment you know I'm a lot of millions in the hole but you know whatever it's a passion project are you doing it as an investment are you doing it because just because I love it um and yeah I can cuz you can yeah why not do what you can yeah yeah yeah and I love the lifestyle so I want to share that with people the lifestyle of Napa wine you know the connection that you create you know sitting down together and sharing it the stories of the vineyard the story of how it came along I mean I have the good thing is is people were like well you gotta stir I'm like well have a story but that's what people connect to so that's you know so then it's a matter of getting that story to the Psalms and different restaurants so that they can tell you the story of somnium and then you know you're like oh that sounds amazing no that's hers that's so cool like I would love it if my wine was a good story that someone told and then they were like oh and this is actually Danica Patrick swine and you're like oh no way yeah I gotta try that you know what I mean I'd rather have that be the back story than the front story do you know Maynard Keenan from tool do you know what oh yeah yeah I've drank his wine before yeah could he see us could you yes I just yes yes I have some in my fridge right now got it a long time ago got it up in Jerome Jerome Arizona he has a little cellar door in jam that's awesome yeah yeah I've never met him I tried to meet him I suppose I was like but it didn't work he's actually in town I think oh really yeah I think he's still here he was just he was here yesterday for sure yeah he sources some of his grapes from California I think Chris Lamas wine yeah he did a similar thing but he did it in Arizona he just this land and development some in Arizona but the red I think the better red came from California is that what mmm he's a freak he's a real crazy person oh yeah yeah in what way super intelligent - super super smart like too smart too smart to talk to most people is just so out there and and intense as well and maybe it's had something to do with the choices so he mean he's a lead singer three fucking bands and then says you know what yeah and then let me just start making my own wine yeah opened up a restaurant like he's just he can't do enough shit he doesn't jujitsu all the time can't do enough for you guys no yeah and he was over here for jujitsu Tom seminars John Danaher he was at one of his seminars yes sir yeah no he's a maniac weirdos make wine then I think so well I think I'd rather be weird than normal I think that's a good way of looking at things there's nothing wrong with being weird normal and conventional or the opposite of weird I looked it up I don't want to be either of those yeah well it depends you know conventional wisdoms not bad it said conventional yeah there's there's some normal that's not bad you know I like normal cheeseburgers you know well I don't see I want caramelized onions I want a fried egg I want maple bacon I love food like I love food I eat more than most everyone do you yes yeah but you're tiny well you put it away well you work out twice a day yeah some days I didn't work out today it didn't work out it didn't work out to work out but yeah I uh I do eat a lot my sister and I both do we're both like a hundred tennis pounds and we are both like five foot and we both eat a ton but we work where you do we do work out little hummingbirds like all that energy you're burning off Pro burning calories can we look at each other we're like I would die without fat I need a lot of fat in my diet you know Maynard opened up a restaurant to in LA ya know in in Arizona hmm so so I could sort of feature his wines and we're we're in Arizona I know Georgia Rome is pretty far from like I mean I my place is in Scottsdale so yeah he's out in the middle of nowhere he's uh his van it's probably Jerome yeah I think it's in that era rooms on the top of a mountain I mean this is a this is a cool place to go if you're ever visiting Arizona Jerome is really interesting you kind of wind up this mountain you get up the top it's like supposedly all haunted and it's very bizarre but there's you know he I mean last I knew it was a very long time ago that I was there but it it he has a cool cellar door and there's some restaurants and whatnot and it's on top of a mountain yeah that's that's Maynard that's the kind of thing he's into and he's very wise to about balancing out the rock star life versus like that's one of the things that I think was attractive to him about creating a wine and I'd say that's really important I mean I've I think I feel like I figured out in my life how much grounding I need to balance me out and it's not like it's not just like everybody needs 50/50 you know 50% of the time walking around in the woods and 50% of the time doing your shit it's you know everybody's different so for me it's like you know maybe 20% of the time I need to take a walk in nature do a yoga class or meditate or something like that yeah do you feel like do you need decompression time just from the whole celebrity thing just being interviewed and media and people paying attention to you want to take pictures with you this is the constant assault I don't feei it's exhausting because I'm listening and I'm paying attention I'm answering your questions honestly where I think most people can just go into sort of like autopilot mode and it's probably not as mentally exhausting for them I need for me it's just being on you know I mean right like you just have to be on all the time you know so the the being on part is nice to get away from yeah I was with them so it's kind of answering the questions but it's really just a matter of having like you know navigating life and people staring at you or wanting something from you or thinking they want something from you just because you're trained because too many people have won at something from you to you know just the demands of the things that you're doing and running around I mean I I'm on an airplane twice a week doing stuff so it's you just get exhausted from that yeah that's not healthy either right hmm no do you feel like you're gonna step away from public life when you stop racing you're gonna fade into the problem I see no I don't think so no I'd love to have a cooking show so a cooking show I guess I love cooking yeah like what kind of stuff anything I'm not much of a baker though that's because I'm a free spirit and baking is all down to a science you're like measure everything it's got to be certain temperature and I'm one of those just dump it in a bowl taste it does it need more sugar doesn't need more acid doesn't even want rich fat does it need spice doesn't need what does it need now are you going off of books do you take classes like how'd you how'd you learn how to cook well when I moved to England when I was 16 I lived by myself eventually why did you do that why'd you move to England to race you were racing in England yeah I left high school when I was 16 and moved to England and then I lived there for three years how do you parents handle that I think my mom cried a lot that couldn't imagine but they couldn't you know they also couldn't imagine me not having the opportunity so they let me go when I left high school what kind of racing were you doing there the lowest level open-wheel racing so what's our main open whale just means that the wheels are exposed okay versus stock cars which are NASCAR so open wheel wheels open so there was no wings on the cars that I was driving over there at that point in time so it was just you know no wing open wheel cars so I was just you know starting my starting my career really because from go-karts I would I didn't want to be a professional go-kart driver so I I was like I'll just get into cars as soon as I can I had this come up well I was 14 and I was at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and I went into a suite and there was some British dude in there and so I started asking about cars and again we're at the racetrack and this this family that he works for has a team has a race team and so I guess I asked all the right questions and two years later when I was 16 they asked me and my dad to come back to Indy and meet with them and talk about going over to England to race and they said I could learn more in one year in England than five years in America and it was not true at all but I didn't really English crazy pompous no I'm I might making people from England mad but there's not many that I've liked whoa yeah I love English people I'm the opposite yeah yeah I maybe it was just my environment like they that no one no one kept in touch after I left I lived there for three years and no one kept in touch with me at all hmm maybe you were too intense for English people well they also have like like this is where you are in this where you stay you have like a very like writers there oh well I mean yeah they yeah I have friends that moved to California from England and they're like the people over here are so much more optimistic about the future and open-minded right like I mean just like bring you in and prove me wrong instead of like prove to me why I gotta be your friend yeah the European mentality a little bit more guarded but also being a 16 year old girl living there by yourself not knowing anybody dad that had to be really weird I grew a lot so I learned more there in one year than five years in America from a personal standpoint see I went over there and I was very open and unguarded and would tell anyone anything and you know how'd that work out for you didn't work out very well I got hurt a lot hated men after that and eight English accents know like when you from men I kind of ate a little bit a little bit yeah I'm a little scarred but anyway I came home and my parents describing is very cold when I came home very guarded very cold did you guys visit back and forth between I would come home like twice a year and they would come over once or twice a year no so wasn't alienation you know but but they said you were cold when you got back yeah you became hard yeah yep yeah fuck that I know yeah one of the hardest things in life is figuring out who you really are like what you really enjoy who you are as a person what you stand for instead of what cultures told you what advice to give someone that's trying to do that like I have a nephew he's a great kid but he doesn't know what the fuck he wants to do he's trying to figure it out now I mean the first quick couple of things that you can do to identify what it is that you're interested in and you know something that's true to you is you know just what do you do for your hobbies that's very insightful what do you enjoy about yourselves there's a job for you I mean isn't it legal here in California nada well sorta so anyway sort of legal it's like some guru farmer and then also this is like an odd one but look at the phone look at the pictures on your phone or look at the pictures that you post on social media maybe or something like that but whatever you take pictures is also kind of pretty insightful for what you're interested in okay you're not taking pictures and stuff you don't care about that's true it's your phone what if you're all selfies pictures like well then I think your ego is very loud do you have any selfies on your phone so the only the only reason why I selfies for me are so annoying my selfie stick no no no no but I the only way I do them as if I am kind of promoting right so for me it's a matter of promoting a healthy lifestyle so maybe it's me in the gym working out maybe it's something like that where I can be like post a like whatever workout I did and mm-hmm perhaps what you could look like if you did these workouts sort of sort of maybe better really I mean so you know those are why I would take a selfie or if it's with someone you really like you know you can take a picture with someone that's it and I don't think that does that count as a selfie if it's just you with you in someone else no no that's just being creative with how you're getting a picture of you yeah so yeah selfies the only time I do it really is pretty much just to promote either like clothes I'm wearing for my clothing line or like workout style stuff for my book but for me I'm not like damn my hair looks good today and you know I I'm like look at me and I say nothing you know same that's just I don't know driven I know as a woman who is very ambitious and successful and powerful what do you make of these social media stars now that that just do that they just stick the butt out and take pictures and there's a lot a lot of that it's a weird back cells yeah and always will yeah you probably deal with it more emotionally yourself because it's a vicious circle where you want more so you have to keep doing more Brian you know what I mean you end up that you end up in a place where you don't know yourself anymore because you're doing it to fulfill someone else's wants and desires more than yours Yeah right keep going to the next level right you have to keep your like oh I wore this like super cute like leggings in a sports bra now I gotta wear a body suit and now I'm wearing thong and holy crap you know like look at me now I'm you know what do you do what yeah who are you and after like but some of its it's oddly successful it's done to some of them their pages have like 17 million followers whoa yeah yeah whoa I mean well what it said of course then it begs the question like what is your definition of success then yeah because if you don't make money off 17 million followers then what's the point I think they do though they do like sponsored posts and stuff like that okay I mean I agree that's why again you have to go to the next level all the time to get more people yeah kind of feeds the ego is getting fed but as a woman who's an attractive woman who's also very ambitious like you could have just been one of those things right like you like when you see someone I mean man I don't think men look at it this way because I don't think there's a lot of guys that like look at guys who just do like work out instagrams or something like that and they get look at this fucking cock how about use your brain for protein powder i but as a woman who you mean you're not falling back on your looks is what I'm trying to say it's like you have them but you that's just a part of you you're obviously hyper ambitious on when you see someone who's just do you feel like they're like wasting time or do you feel like that's just them I just feel like it's immaturity I mean if that's your driving forces just your looks and you know but there are some that have some content but you know and they can use it to drive a message I mean there's some that I've noticed like that that really do have really positive messages spreading positivity spreading good things but promoting good things but for those who aren't then I just think it's a level of immaturity and it's gonna come - I think it will come to bite them eventually because it's where does the road lead - yeah it's a short-lived success yeah yeah somebody said this once it's a really great quote that beauty is a short-lived tyranny yeah you know like panel leads me to a little bit of a one similar like the I'm not going to get it right exactly but it's the the ego is impatient because it knows it's time is limited where the soul is patient because it know it has knows it has forever hmm we should like to have memes on like a strippers Instagram page be perfect ego needs to be fed immediately you know that ego wants something now and it's not thinking about the long term where it's true you know soul decisions are you know perhaps unrealized for a sort for an amount of time but you know the truth will always come through and so if you're not living it you're gonna have a transition now when you make like if you put like an Instagram post up of workouts and stuff like that do you do that specifically because you're trying to motivate people yeah yeah cuz it does for me I mean when I see somebody hot working out and see a picture of them I'm like yeah they're yet working out oh maybe put that put that chocolate down yeah I agree I mean people especially people in my line of work comedians love to mock things along those lines but I take inspiration off of a lot of people online and I you know my over well like overall what I hope for people too is that with what the book I wrote I I just I really want people to find confidence in the selves and develop a healthier relationship with food and exercise and I think most people think of food as a punishment right they're like oh my god I'll just eat this terrible vegetable or they're like I have to work out this sucks we're working out can be fun working out can make you feel good food can also make you feel good food is medicine food will make you not only feel good but be good and look better so so you know I hope that in all of my motivation it drives people into a direction where they feel good about it all and there's a there's more positivity around it don't you feel like there's so much negativity around eating healthy and working out there's so many people that just hate it there's quite a bit of that but I think there's a lot of positivity around it too I think that people are recognizing more and more today the benefits of eating healthy in terms of like psychological benefits like your mind works better physical benefits you feel better about your choices you feel better about your momentum and life like hey I'm on the right path I'm I'm eating healthy taking supplements I'm working out on a regular basis my body feels I've got more energy oh yeah it's tuned in better I mean I remember when I cut out dairy and gluten years ago and my energy level finally was up and consistent where before I'd be like the random day were you like man why am I so exhausted today I'm just so tired yeah I didn't have any of those days anymore yeah when people eat a lot of refined carbohydrates and then shift to a diet that has none of that stuff in it it's stunning yeah the the effect that it has on your midday I always tell people like if you need a nap in the middle of the day if you're one of those people just try cut out your sugar cut out your refined carbohydrates and then watch what happens yeah you will you will have so much more energy during the not a Napper that's for sure yeah I mean maybe I like coffee but you want those four hours of sleep at night people actually I can I don't need a lot I wake up with the sunlight too so I'm one of those people and I wake up in the morning and like I see the light go and I'm like it's morning is it morning I'm so excited if it's morning I'm ready I loved morning and I'm very chatty and I'm very like up and ready to go and like you awake um yes are you out are you awake I'm a coffee come on let's go that's me I'm really annoyingly up and ready to go and happy in the morning I love the morning how are you at night though it's sleepy okay okay but once I get horizontal at night it's over like I'm falling asleep you have no insomnia no no yeah I don't think so no I have before it's awful yeah that sucks that's not good but I don't I don't have it no no no I I'm but once I lay down at night I'm I'm tired now what kind of diet do you follow do you have specific you said no gluten and no dairy and then a couple years ago I so I I did an IVF treatment to freeze my eggs because I'm getting older and I drive race cars and I can't you know do any of that stuff so I was like look I'm going for the insurance policy here so how do they get those out of there okay do you really want to know yeah it's a weird method right alright so you have two shots for like a month a ton of shot a ton of shots every day you stick them in your stomach and you have a ton of shots and so they drop your estrogen down to nothing and then they ramp it up and then it multiplies the follicles like the follicles are what grows the egg so you go in after a while and you start getting ultrasounds to see how many follicles are growing on each side so anyway it was good for me but that many grows and they want them each to get to like one bite basically almost an inch by an inch each of them and I mean I had like I mean this is a lot of information but you know 20 to 30 on each side that's a shitload of real estate in my body it got very uncomfortable which one thirty inches on each side of each one well yeah like what did people think you were pregnant yeah you do you look like three ma I'm een it was huge I was so uncomfortable you feeling all the Meg's in there yeah it's horrible you name it I'm this Bobby your number seven this is Mike I come from a long line of girls so I'm pretty sure they're all girls but it's so I did that and then they you do this trigger drug thing and then you know 36 hours on a minute you go in and you retrieve it and what they do is they you get wheeled in the room is super like humid and warm they jungle like a jungle and so animal wild things in there so they put you in like they put you in like ski boots like toes get you get you up and ready whoa and then some chick was like alright I'm gonna give you a little ol something relaxing my girl you don't have to tell me just do it like that was Moses who I told her and that I was asleep and they go in and every they go in with a needle and retrieve every one of them one by one with a needle I think yeah I go in and hung her in through the through it and retrieve so many eggs did you get sucked out of there 24 Wow 1919 where mature oh okay so nineteen potential people yeah how many think you're gonna make have you thought about it no they say you need 20 to guarantee one so pretty much guaranteed one Wow but this is an insurance policy it doesn't mean I can try away if I wanted to yeah but anyway so okay back to the back to the point like we just got way off track here but this is part of the story as to why I decided to change my diet and my my workout and why I ended up writing a book was because I I gained like four pounds okay I'm just people I know there's people were like oh who cares four pounds and my frame five foot who I'm small little and you know for any girl out there you know your jeans only fit when you're exactly the size that you are and then you gain a couple of pounds and though they don't anymore I was just uncomfortable it just wasn't I just gained some weight and no bouncing ability to well it was it was it was legit like I just gained some weight because of the hormones so it instantly also gave me some sympathy for people out there with whether it's dudes in testosterone or women with pregnancy or you know menopause or whatever it is that changes their hormones and so I'm going to just gain weight I'm like oh my god this is this is real this isn't just some excuse for getting older and being waxed about your diet or your exercise it really happens and so anyway so I decided to eat paleo for like a week really I was gonna do it for a week and I did it and I never stopped so that was two years ago and then I also started doing two a day workouts because I wanted to change it up and sort of kick things up a notch but I also realized that I was out taking my dogs for walks and I was like well if I'm walking them I might as well run and do a workout too so you know instead of mile and a half of walking around the property I would go for three so when you you say you do two a day is like how do you break it up they're usually a little shorter like I would say somewhere between 20 to 40 minutes each and one of them will be I do upper body lower body and an AB day and I just rotate through those really I just I keep rotating through those because look if you do if I do it right I'm so sore I can't do upper body again for a few days so I just rotate through those in and I supplement in if I have time I do interval I'm running we're all like sprint for 30 seconds walk for 30 seconds burn for 30 and I'll do that for 20 minutes and do you have someone train you or do you do everything yourself no I do everything myself I write I write I love writing workouts I think it's the artistic side of me I like the balance and the flow of like creating something that has fluidity and makes sense and there's good transitions through movements so I mean I see your big rogue gym going in so I have program for you if you want me to do CrossFit style workout so I do a lot like I said I don't do CrossFit but most of the stuff I do is kettlebells deadlifts a lot of chin-ups yeah too many I got a waffle scarf golfer's elbow tell me about it my right elbow is feeling so sore for like three days is it right on it's like right on the side it's like right here it just it's like even got to give a shout-out to Kelly Starrett he hooked me up with this crazy protocol for healing up my tendonitis and what is it is it they just started yeah yeah yeah it's mostly do you know he is he's the guy wrote that book becoming a supple leopard he's a real wizard when it comes to like exercise physiology and understanding the body and his books amazing all about new and improved modalities yeah he's he gave me a bunch of different thing but also a tool to scrape the area which is gonna be papaya is it like a blade like a metal okay I've had done before yeah and I think topical CBD oil which is really good that legal yes yes CBD is illegal across the board on non psychoactive but the FDA is trying to stop that of course follow the minutes yeah those creeps follow money it's a good explanation for just about everything yeah they're trying to put it the same classification as heroin yes yeah so stupid it's just super sad pharmaceutical man-made institutions of decision making yep well it's just creepy people with money that don't want to lose money to CBD oil because it's so much better for you and healthy and natural and does the exact same imagine how much the drug companies would lose yeah for gain if they start selling it you fucks just they want to monopolize it that's the problem while it happens they want to be able to patent things you know that's but that's like we were talking about before about the things that are in the Amazon I mean that's there's there's so many different plants that can deal with so many different ailments that people have but ayahuasca yeah that's one of them sure have you done it I haven't but it's interesting yeah have you done any psychedelics no I've never done drugs ever no drugs no pot ever never no no you scared no I my dad scared the living daylights out of me when I was a kid and he told me that if I ever he's like you get tested for drugs and you fail you you won't ever be a race car driver you told me that about drinking and driving too if you get if you lose your license you won't be able to race and then you know what are you gonna be when you grow up then you know he threatened me with Oh dad remedial remedial jobs and yeah so he scared the living daylights out of me truth be told you can lose your license still race also truth be told I didn't get drug tested until way later but we do get drug taste you're running a drug farm Oh you want a drug farm well kind of it that's a drug farm lady it's legal but it's a hundred percent drug farm it's wonderful delicious tasting drugs it's fucked up on wine yeah what is that that's drunk and addicted to drinking alcoholism all right I mean there's a lot of other things that you can do that know altering that aren't addictive right you're running a plant-based drug farm 100% cash crops yeah so what you're doing you're a drug dealer well let's just go all the way well if I was gonna do something what would be the first thing I would do pot for sure okay nice and light real slow don't take much what does that mean don't take much it just take a little bit you don't wanna freak out like that one of the major problems that people have when they first start smoking pot they'll take like two or three heads you can take one when one likes that's it put it down right Jamie yeah Jamie I'll tell you okay walk away yeah don't fuck with edibles leave those alone those those you need to build up to those things those there's those very slightly different experienced experienced users well it's not just that even experienced users they don't recognize the fact it's a completely different psychoactive ingredient yeah when THC not THC no when it's processed by your liver produces eleven hydroxy metabolites which is four to five times more psychoactive than THC it's way more potent well yeah which is why people freak out when they eat edibles and they just don't don't eat the whole brownie no just a couple crumbs and then don't even think about having any more for at least two hours let it settle in let it give yourself time don't freak out after 15-20 minutes and be like it's not working right don't do that sometimes when I'm drinking I'm like I'm sure man this is my third drink it just doesn't seem to be working and then I hit it harder and then I'm I don't remember anything the night wall brown out or black out yeah drugs drugs yeah actually one of the one of the first times I heard one of your podcasts I think it was it was about DMT you know that's the mother lode DMT is the psychoactive ingredient that's in ayahuasca right the most potent psychedelic like a cleaner cleaner way to do it as opposed to ayahuasca were you yeah throw up and cheers yeah yeah yeah it's definitely probably it's also quicker you know like the worst the long as it's going to take it's like 15 or 20 minutes but there are some places that are doing it now where they're doing it intravenously so those trips are apparently that was how they did it in there's a book called DMT the spirit monocle molecule by this guy dr. Rick Strassman who did all these studies out of the University of New Mexico and they were the first fda-approved clinical studies did it with a group of people yeah it's a mate it was amazing but the hospital yeah and they were gone so for like 40 minutes like pull them off into the often to the other dimension I was gonna say so other dimension right this dream state what do you think it's like a dream state it's very similar because they believe that your brain during heavy REM sleep also produces DMT they think that's because we all have it everybody has it yeah yeah everybody's naturally-occurring and everyone yes it's produced by your liver your lungs and now they know it's also produced at least in rats by your pineal gland which is literally your third eye it's actually in certain reptiles it actually has a retina and a lens it's yeah it is an eye I'm always trying to decalcify my opinion glands is that real get that from them crystal people in Sedona yeah they say it's like fluoride flora it's calcifying your pineal gland man like okay there's such a cool subject getting in there yeah yeah how's it getting through my mouth and through it you sure everything you are what you eat yeah sort of but are you what you drink mint any wine yes yes I get better with aged uh yeah I don't know if you're really your pineal gland actually gets calcified by the fluoride in drinking water I think that sounds like some hippy horseshit it does sound hippy horseshit I'd like to see some scientific proof but hey man with all the hippie shit there's not a lot of scientific proof with it no no there's not it's a sense of knowing that's what it comes down to is a sense of knowing like do you really feel like this making sense to use it register you're like I don't know why I believe this but I just do I don't even know where it came from yeah I don't know about that I'd rather trust scientists I like science too my sister and I went and saw Neil deGrasse Tyson in Indianapolis over the winter it was called the an astrophysicist reads the newspaper oh yeah so he I called create you know articles and you know just laughed about them a show that's cool Pluto came up because he was part of the people part of the group that sort of said that Pluto wasn't a planet yes yeah people got very upset with him yeah he also loved to point out how there'd be something crazy and he'd be like let me point out this is in the science section of the newspaper like as if like how did this make it to the science section right he's gonna come on here sometime February and they're going to he's gonna talk to a guy who believes the earth is flat made fun of that guy - yeah he's like let me show you a reflection of what it looks like if the earth was flat and you know of course it's you know a shadow of a flat line it's like of course that's not true well of course it's not true but there's a lot of young people out there today that believe the earth is flat do you believe the earth is flat don't worry it's most certainly do not but I think it's why do I mean do they because they not think we actually go into outer space and all right no they think that's that's fake too but I think it's just a matter I think we landed on the moon if there is anything that I think is one of the more attractive conspiracy theories it's the moon landing one because the only time they did it was between 1969 and 1972 they did seven missions six were successful and that's the only time in human history that people have been more than I think four hundred miles above the Earth's surface everything else all the Space Shuttle missions all of the Space Station missions all that stuff is inside of 400 miles the moon is like two hundred sixty thousand miles there and back and they've never even sent a chicken into space and had it come back alive they never send anything into space other than people like into deep space past the Van Allen radiation belt packs the Magneto's fear I think most likely we went but if there's ever a conspiracy theory that's attractive to me it's that one because I just think it would be fascinating if during the Nixon administration they really did fake it and there's there's a lot of weirdness why would they fake it well first of all to show military superiority to the Russians and again I'm not saying and I used to believe they did fake it I was I was heavily on the side that they faked it but then I realized I don't know jack-shit about astrophysics I don't know jack-shit rocket travel I mean I'm just talking on my ass so like me saying that they didn't go was literally an ignorant perspective just suggests a guess well it's just being attracted to conspiracy theories yeah which is fun that's the problem is that conspiracy theories are really fun like it's really fun UFOs are really fun all that stuff a lot of stuff to get to the get to the core because there's there's there's arguments on both sides there is but it's also you have to recognize in yourself that you do not want the official story to be true and I do not an almost every single thing that happens like you know moon landing or UFO landing any crazy shit I always want the crazy shit to be real I always want the UFO thing to be a real thing they do have it you believe in aliens yes I think it's more than likely that there's something out there I mean like to feel like that we're the only thing in the universe is a little ridiculous it seems stupid seems pretty ignorant and arrogant yeah but I don't think that it's what we think it is I think it's most likely far beyond the the places that we can currently travel to and I think that by the time they get to a high level of sophistication they're most likely not even organic anymore and I think that that's the future of the human race of consciousness well I think maybe that but I also think there's a real problem with the possibility of artificial intelligence I think human beings are about to create life whether we recognize it as for not what artificial life is going to be is life artificial intelligence is going to have the ability to change itself multiply what human beings have been able to do in terms of technological innovation by a rate of something insane like in two years they'll be able to do 10,000 years of innovation in terms of like what we're capable of doing so I think that what we're looking at now is the the last days of biological life I think a hundred years from now five hundred years from now whatever it is there won't be biological humans anymore I think they'll this will be an archaic outdated will change as we know it yeah I can I mean you know I don't believe in everything the Bible says but you know okay well so the apocalypse global changes as we know it I think the apocalypse little world will end as we know it right I think the apocalypse like the stuff in the Bible that's all local like if you if you lived where Hurricane Katrina hit you think the apocalypse was there right if you were in you know anywhere where something really fucking crazy happened and you didn't have any contact with the outside world no cellphones no radio no TV didn't exist sure true you were isolated yeah I think that's what all of our our notions of the Apocalypse are they're periodic natural disasters that are unbelievably devastating like they've proven that the entire human race was was down to a few thousand people because of a supervolcano around 70,000 years ago so I think there's been a series of those events throughout history where the human race is brought down to an almost unmanageable level and then we repopulated and I think that that's probably the origins of the apocalypse or asteroid impacts which are very common they've have been all throughout history do you think that AI is gonna just eliminate biological humans I think it's entirely possible that we're going to give into it too that we're gonna take it we're gonna first of all become symbiotic we're gonna take something and put it inside of us it's going to enhance us whether it's our ability to communicate whether it's our ability to see we're gonna start implanting chips into selves and then they're gonna have improved body parts like say if you break your arm and you're like look Danica we can fix your arm but it's going to take a year you have you know seventeen broken bones or we can replace it with an arm that works better and it'll feel just like a regular arm and I'm gonna bring in Mike and Mike has a fake arm he's gonna show you how it works and Mike's gonna come in I'm so much happier with my arm than I wasn't my fake off with my real arm new drug pushers look how it works and I'll it's a free vacation too if you do this I watched some I heard some YouTube video of like it was someone who channels other I think I was channeling the Palladian oh yeah probably totally legit yeah and she talked about I was talking about how as a as a human race we have to be careful we don't alter ourselves too much because then we won't exist as a human race because we won't be able to procreate and that is what keeps our race alive that's probably true I mean if you think about where we're gonna go but also it doesn't it have to keep evolving I mean if we got back look do you think like monkeys when they were living in trees throwing shit at each other different than that now we got to be chill otherwise we're gonna stop being monkeys won't be able throw shit at each other bananas all day yeah I think people are afraid of change I think the human race is afraid of change - but we're by no means that's why most people don't do things right they are everyone's afraid of change right taking a chance having it be different maybe it's worse well dick maybe it's better you know well that's like the hallmark of your whole life look at 100% I'm not afraid of change I'm not okay so I have a moment I'll take the arm I have a moment of you know fear of like oh shit and then there's the next moment as well maybe it's better than I could ever expect what if there imagine they'll give you two options they give you one robot arm that you never have to work out it'll always be strong you need that one or you can get one that you constantly have to work out oh I would probably take the robot arm which which robot arm would you take the one that you constantly have to work out now or would you take the one that's just perfect yeah I probably think the perfect one never have to exercise just BAM just jacked on yep if I wanted I mean working out if I still needed to do that for like though you know feel good endorphin hormone sort of you know state right here by your brain well and I would go do a lot more stuff like walking around in nature mmm that's good answer because that's I mean I really find enjoyment out of that I mean I find enjoyment out of the intensity level of things and the confidence that I get or the you know being able to shift my mindset to this sort of like all go all in not no pain no gain that's so cheesy but like I can endure and the confidence that comes from enduring and pushing through I enjoy that I enjoy that development of my mind and my discipline and my confidence I do but I'm probably just shifting more into enjoying you know things that are a little more peaceful too so shifting more into enjoying nature yeah yeah but that would be the most fucked up thing it's like you didn't enjoy nature anymore they started replacing body parts and they're like you didn't give a shit about the forest that would be sad yeah I would be sad I wouldn't take that body part then until they replace probably gonna be dead before all this is real so that's what I think those aliens are when people see aliens those grey aliens great hey guys I think that's just what we're gonna become that's what I think I've been thinking that a lot I think it's natural if you look at what what a monkey is and then if we were at some point in time like some ancient hominid like Australia Pittacus or whatever cro-magnon man and then we moved on to become Homo Sapien that if we keep going in that direction this is what we're gonna look like we're gonna look very little skinny things with big heads lollipops yeah that's what I look like when I have my helmet on when I'm in my race suit that's a good point right because helmet that's right yeah your helmet is like that would be like a big guy wearing an enormous helmet yeah crazy yeah do you have a strong nasty myself a wicked now can I do do you do exercises with it I don't need to you know just carrying the helmet around all the time it's probably that and just looking up looking up to my nine-foot target for wall balls I'm like God my neck hurts yeah yeah no I just you know you're not at the car out of the car that long it might hurt a little bit when I get back in an IndyCar again because the g-forces are higher but you also lean your head against the headrest usually the only thing that would make me hurt might make my neck hurt a little bit as Road courses at the beginning of the road of IndyCar season what is it going to test because acceleration and deceleration there's nothing to hold you from like your neck going your head going forward I mean there is but not to the level that you would drive that way there's just a device that is in case you're in an accident but it still moves so you know holding holding your neck forward and backwards is a lot more sore than side to side just because you have a headrest so we can use that get out of a long race use your whole body tired yeah I mean in stock cars it's so it's really a lot about dehydration dehydration yeah I mean the car is like 130 hundred 40 degrees in there no do you have a tube I do Camelback that goes through the front of my helmet a couple blowers the back blower a helmet blower things that are cooler air but I'm here to tell you it's still hot as hell in there I could imagine I mean there's a fire in a gigantic iron block in front of you yeah when the water and oil temperature is 300 degrees yeah it sort of it's like a greenhouse in the car it's right it runs right underneath you - do you think you're gonna miss it that's a great question I was talking about this just the other day like am I gonna miss the intensity am I gonna miss certain I mean I don't know if I'll I think I will miss some of it a little bit every now and again I'm driving down the road and I'm like I don't probably miss it a little bit but but uh again I'm a decisive person so I'm good I'm sure you're good I'm just wondering more if I'm gonna miss the the intensity level of the job and highs being so high but the lows being low I mean that's the that's how you get the highest right and the duality of the of the environment I'm wondering if I'll miss some of and if whatever I do on the side will be enough what is the age that most people retire from racing I'm 35 I'm a slightly young I would say early 40s after a while they just their body just takes too much and you're just exhausted I mean honestly like especially if it's NASCAR you're just exhausted I mean it's I mean that's my feeling anyway you know you're gone for 40 weeks a year on the road and these you know really luxurious places of the world on the barbecue world tour like grilling out of your bus and living out of a bus for most of your life and you know on the road in and out of airplanes hours of nothing to do on the weekends while you're you know sitting there so just kind of the grind so I think you kind of just get a little worn out yeah I could only imagine oh you know I mean even like you were talking about interviews and stuff like yeah I enjoyed doing interviews that aren't based around how's your car this weekend you know I mean there's just so boring there really so it's fun for me to talk about working out or cooking or wine food you know all that stuff it's just interesting or aliens yeah I can only imagine I can only imagine the boring grind of the media tour that you must have to go through when you're racing all the time yeah I'll tell you what Danica you were moving quite fast out there today you have lefur performance I was watching the the old South Park episode they had a bunch of NASCAR drivers on South Park and you know it was that it was when Cartman was trying to be poor and stupid so he could race a NASCAR it was sponsored by a bad yourself a ton of vagisil de minimis stupid as he could and he realizes the more stupid he got the more money he spent some more and Eddie Gunn that's how you got poor oh I just bought like jet skis I think he says at one point time Danika you're not having what happened stupid as I am oh that's right you were in it yeah I wasn't it what did you use your own voice no no just their own stuff I was on The Simpsons that year too and I I did my voiceover for that but for for South Park no did you love it I was awesome I mean I don't care what they say if you're on a show it's flattering right they to make to make TV in a different capacity means you're being noticed well especially South Park yes I think that's the funniest show that's ever existed yeah especially like all-time if you look at all the episodes they've done I mean it doesn't even make sense how creative they are that's what I was thinking is how they're just insightful ahead of things a lot and definitely clever like with their the delivery of it yeah they're wizards yeah yeah it's completely bizarre what kind of truck cardi driving regular life please don't say like a Prius no that would be like if you like oh I just travel the other day I was throwing some things into the recycling bin and I'm like I'm just trying to do my part because let's face it I burn fuel for a living yeah right how much fossil fuel I wonder if you have a chart how much fossil fuel the average person burns no I would not be doing well on that that would not be I would not do well with the tree huggers or vegans of the world and all the people loving animals like me I mom all those people I love the forest I try and eat vegetables most of the time things like that but yeah I also don't do my part when it comes to my job what kind of car do you drive so I've had cars for years through through the manufacturer so this past year we were sponsored by Ford so I have I had a Ford Expedition EL I didn't know what ehlmann it means extra long oh four space in the back yeah it was yeah why hook you up with a Mustang Shelby well that's not very practical we weren't even allowed to customize customize the wheels on that thing so you know it's Barris bare bones because that was part of the contract you get a garbage you can't get anything dressed up let me hook you over the Raptor so I could have had a raptor I guess what did you get it I mean like trucks aren't really me whatever better than the al not bad yeah so and then I had a Tahoe when I drove for Chevy before that I would think that you would want something fast so that I I bought my first car and that's the last car I bought oh yeah a long time ago I bought a Mercedes ml63 AMG it was like a SUV souped-up SUV that was a long time ago I was like 10 years ago I bought a Range Rover so since then you've just been using manufacturer cars from the sponsors because they're free dollars yeah and they're not you know whatever is freeze free is that like a part of the contract like that's the only car you're allowed to drive probably not but that's drive to the racetrack probably won't drive in here yeah company car yeah probably good move yeah yeah but other drivers have other cars too but do you think that once you retire you will start like going God knows I'm gonna need to get home I'm not a car girl what nope not a car girl sorry to disappoint you mean how you how'd you even say those words I know I do you know who you are yes and I'm not a car trick I know I'm a racecar driver woman I don't even know how many cylinders are in things I'm just I just drive them I'm just good at that you don't know how many cylinders no no I think well we have eight that's so crazy I just lost so many fans yeah how could he be such a good driver and not know anything about cars I don't need to that's good way of looking at it I don't build it I don't I didn't have to go to school for engineering remember the beginning of our top 10 years old 10 years I remember so yeah I just I I can drive them you need to get yourself one of those new Shelby gt500 700 horsepower yeah I just announced it Oh Oh a Shelby new one oh ok not the GT not the gt500 or those oh you mean the 42 but Shelby just put out a new month but it's a problem of those 4 GTS they're awesome but the paddle shifts you want a manual yeah you want to stick yeah Alex yeah it's more fun it yeah it's just some more racy it's just more fun you know I have a Bronco a 1971 Bronco not driving that is you know it's a stick it's like it's not that fast but it's just easier testosterone mechanical it's mechanical feel it's analog you know I just like my car to be good off the line I bought a Lamborghini a long while back and it didn't have a cup holder so I was like oh this is stupid he's not practical so yes and then I bought the Mercedes and that had a cup holder I had a couple cup holders yep so it was good but then it you know technology evolved and it didn't have bluetooth to play my music so I was like well I'm gonna have to get rid of this and that was when I started driving for Chevy and then I got a Tahoe and I liked that and then I got a Ford Chevy they didn't give you a Corvette I didn't ask for one how could you not want you driving force in a practical car if I wanted those Corvette I could buy one okay I know you could but I would say be like come on hook it up I'm not yeah come on check I'm I'm not a car girl we went over there understand this though I keep keep want to catch you in that lie no I I don't care I just I have cars or like purses for me I just need one nice one and when it wears out I'll get a new one you don't like purses not really really cared girl just needed one that looks good and just once that's it yeah what about shoes no I like shoes oh I have a lot of shoes there you go your girl I'm definitely a girl but not purses it's my own a curl my own hair today well that's crazy I do makeup yeah okay my shoulder hurts a little bit but hairspray what is this definitely I'm very much a girl I believe you that's what if people ask me what it what is it about you that people would be surprised and I'm telling them like much more girly away from the track than you'd think because I'm really aggressive at the track and I don't look very happy and away from the track I'm I try and be funny and I smile more and I'm much more relaxed are you surprised that with all your success and all the attention that you've gotten from your success as the only woman on your level in in professional racing are you surprised that more women aren't entering in that you haven't like sort of opened door or do you think that it's such a specialized and unique thing to do that it's just not something that a lot of women gravitate towards I used to say that for a hundred men that came through if you found a good you takes a hundred to find a good one that comes pretty quickly but to go through a hundred women takes a lot longer because there are some few of them there are more coming through but I just think that you know over time it just takes a lot longer to find good ones but I don't know I don't know I I think back to this is my ego talking I think back to a long time ago when Paul Newman was still alive and we were on a late-night show together probably Letterman and he was asked before I went on he was the first guest if there was going to be another driver another girl that comes through that compares to me and he said he didn't think so maybe there won't be maybe who knows shit yeah he knew his shit maybe I I mean you're unique I'm sure there will be someday I meet a lot of women like you because of MMA oh there's those savages that enter into MMA the women that wind up fighting in MMA there's a lot of them and I'm kind of stunned at how many of them there are but when I say they're like you I mean they're bold powerful unique people that are they just take wild chances I mean the type of person that is like a Holly Holm or someone like that so I think the big difference lies and there are a lot of people that are strong aggressive confident you know assertive bold but to then be able to keep it together and up up above their shoulders that's another that's the difference keep it together in the pressure of a race yeah and the pressure of whatever moment is have it you're having whatever pressures are being put on you around an event or for one I mean those are that's really hard the right people around you being able to filter the shit and let in like keep the good keep your own confidence up that's that's hard that's the hardest part and then being able to flip that switch when you're performing - of course then - have doubts but more confidence I think everything that you said would be mirrored by what a woman who competes at the very highest levels of MMA would say hmm I think they would they would find all those things to be factors you know it's just I'm really stunned that you literally are the only one I mean there's that's that's an incredibly rare position do you ever stop and think about like what if you weren't there it's not like it's forbidden for women huh I never thought about it like that I've mostly only thought about it from the perspective of like have I thought about what I've done in the sport because stuff that people haven't done before and usually my answer is is that someday I'll look back and you know be able to have a little bit more perspective on it but right now I'm just kind of in the middle of it but yeah I've never thought about it like that like what if I was never there yeah I mean you're the only one so if you were never there what it would just be constantly a boys club forever I mean I'm just I'm really fascinated by complete outliers you're a complete outlier in that regard I mean there's not like 30 girls oh there's 500 men but there's 30 girls no how many men are NASCAR drivers oh well the field is 40 yes it's 40 men one check that's crazy and then there's a bunch of people that are trying to do it mm-hmm like how many there are there any women that are trying to get no lower formulas I there's some that do some part-time stuff and I'm trying to think if someone has done like a full season I don't know back in IndyCar there was some girls who did more they were like I want one Indy 500 there was like five of us but most of the time there's none or one comes in waves do you stop I mean do you think that when you stop and you look back in your career you'll take into account and maybe have a more objective sense of what an impact you've had sure for women yeah of course but I need this it's from it I need to gain perspective that way that makes sense it does yeah I'm sure in your career to like I mean to be able to identify the the things that you've done the influence you've had over people with the conversations you've had with the with the things in business you've done I mean it's hard to see when you're in the middle of it yeah I don't look at that you don't want to look at that no no because I get distracted where you go that's why people don't in the moment cuz it doesn't matter yeah but I'm what I'm doing a lot of people are doing what you're doing is very it's just said to be a woman that does the thing that many men think is probably one of the most manly things you could do other than fighting and maybe football yeah it's like racecar driver like you ask a little boy what do you wanna be when you grow up Billy that's just lightning McQueen I mean it's like a natural thing for a man to gravitate towards it dad always said he was just like gosh I had cursed with three girls in the house cuz my mom and then me and my sister and I'm like dad what more did you want like what more did you want with you had a boy as a son like what was he gonna do that's right cooler than what I'm doing he'd be out there banging chicks that's what he's missing you think my dad would think that was cool instead he's scared shitless for me yeah that's gotta be I think still in my adult life it's like wealthy they had the courage to let you go to England by yourself when you were 16 I mean that and race over there on another content yeah all the way across an ocean yeah sort of you did get hurt to get to you would take forever yeah bold what is the worst crash you've ever been in my first crash in IndyCar so my very first race kind of paralleled getting in a go-kart for the first time having a big crash but yeah it was um homestead-miami and there's a big accident and I was running low and someone was sliding down the track that had damage and they clipped my right rear and shot me up and into the wall headfirst and slid down the track and I don't remember that part I don't remember getting out I don't remember walking to the ambulance but there's footage of all of it and I walked the wrong way away from the ambulance I was walking the opposite direction and then I was kind of like stumbling around and then I got back to them back to the medical truck and then I got in and apparently I was very repetitive on the way to the hospital and I kept asking them did it look bad and they're like you asked us that a few times I'm not a concussion oh I'll just stop oh yeah yeah that's a severe concussion that's one of the things that happens they people ask the same questions over and over again mmm well then I've had one let's hope I don't know CTE I'm sure you probably do I probably do well but yeah touch matter makes you more risky this one might get crazy that's what I think one of the things does it makes people more impulsive do UFC people get yeah did you see that video is there are they doing studies in UFC like they did in the NFL with doing tests after they've passed away to know if like they had CTE isn't that what and I felt had they I got there was a study that came out last year it was like almost all but one out of 100 and some had CTE yeah it was I forget the numbers but yeah there was only like one or two people that didn't have it right no hasn't done that the UFC hasn't been around as long as the NFL obviously so we we're not dealing with the same right data pool but I'm sure when people do pass away we're going to find it it's just varying levels I've heard I heard they actually have a test now for CTE I was talking to a trauma surgeon that yeah what would you do if you had it make excuses go extra crazy yeah well that's why I'm naked so insightful this question did you see the videos that just came out from a couple of days ago from the guy that hit the off-ramp and went flying through the air and landed housed in the second floor of a house as cars poking out the side no but I couldn't he couldn't do it again if he had to I'm sure no no it's just total random crazy luck yeah but it is hilarious I mean really yeah and see if you once you find it go then go to crystally as Instagram cuz D'Elia had a hilarious meme that he created but this car hit this hit like a barrier hit one of those cement barriers and literally got launched into the air and stuck into the second floor of a building everybody make it oh what country was this in is AMERICA AMERICA AMERICA AMERICA do people escape the injuries are serious injuries how the fuck did I mean I wonder how they got out of the car I mean it's it's the way it's hanging out of the oh yeah like just hopefully it's front-wheel drive and they could keep accelerating to get a little further in so they could get out of the car that's spoken like a true race car here's the video footage so you can see it and there's the car watch this it hits a see this is that it's hard to tell there but they literally went across traffic there's my gang you can see it again the guy goes flies in there let's see go to Chris Delia's page his Instagram page and find the meme cuz then you can see that and what he so let's get this guy so that's Chris Delia's but there he says come her come over me I can't tonight her my parents are on the first floor of the second floor I mean that fucking car is stuck inside that building I mean you wouldn't believe that that was real if you didn't see it there you might need that dentist office that he just parked itself himself at after that yeah here's the question what do you do if you're in the car like it gets stuck there you even climb you're probably drunk you got to be drunk right I mean there's nobody or something so you just you open the door and you wait you you take on the sprained ankle and you jump and Jesus when then it lands on your fucking head the thing falls out of the bill no no no she say the right here you call the cops you are honest - bitcoins and then you go oh my god that's funny who put up the video what is there where's the video from some dudes name what is his name Kenny Holmes it's K Holmes live he's the guy from oh he's from NBC LA I guess minor injuries that's crazy oh Santa Anna Santa Anna people are out of their fuckin Mon that's where Eddie Bravo's from Santa Anna people boom look at that car flying through the air it's just the fact that it's stuck into the building that's just so ridiculous it's probably for a movie now when you drive in regular life are you a Leadfoot I'm a very aggressive driver I knew it yes I am I'm I have a large comfort zone I say people pissed me off a lot they are horrible drivers and I I'm very the only way I can make sure that I don't get a speeding ticket is to not drive oh I've been pulled over at least 20 times I got pulled over three times in three days when I had my Mustang Cobra in my first ever car oh Jesus see that's why I'm surprised you don't have a fast car I always make sure it's a good car like that fast car but I I mean like today like right now like it I think you're driving around pulling up no no no I mean your everyday life yeah well I'm driving rentals because I don't live here I mean not I mean here no in real life in real life oh yeah like where's my sports car yeah Wow oh you know 40 weeks a year I do that so you just I need I got two dogs right so you get enough of all my bags I feel like I'm trying to sell you a car what car should I buy mm I would say something American something don't you do you like american-made cars yeah I tend to die I don't care if they aren't really well I have a Porsche I like like German cars - they're more reliable what I like about American cars is I like the sound I like the way they just is a rumble throat eNOS there's a song to it you like to like so you like to make noise on the road I'm a loud person yeah I have a 65 Corvette with straight pipes that's those side pipes yeah super kind of know what that is yeah I can picture it kind of but it's a stage now that's what's important mm-hmm okay but I would feel like we're someone like you once you transition away from racing then it's gonna be more important to you because you're gonna like miss the capabilities of those things that might be true yeah that might be true I might have to oh there's my car oh that is a good-looking car sweet Jay Leno of course of course he loves cars yeah I'm not and I also don't really like old cars so that looks pretty good it's pretty fancy looking but um yeah I'm a new car person I like new modern sports cars I do as well but that car is a 65 on the outside but all the underpinnings are completely modern it has a ls1 supercharged engine so does a modern Corvette engines got modern brakes modern suspension you don't know what any of that stuff means do you know that's crazy I know that my very first car my Mustang Cobra I drove it so hard that I needed in 8,000 miles I was on my third set of brakes we put stiffer sway bars in it so that it would handle better it was a yeah I went through three set yeah I was on my third set of brakes in 8,000 miles and now you say Mustang Cobra like what year was this oh this is when I first this is my first ever car so I was 16 so I think it was a 97 it was yeah it was I'm not saying they're not cool but it was back when they were more cool when you know they were a lot less common yeah they were okay back on the back end of the Cobra cool days ya know the 97's were okay there are like around the 80s is when they came out with the 5.0 and then like mustangs had a little bit more power again so what's your dream car then that Corvette that's whatever car oh now what then no try that around do you drive it much all the time okay well it doesn't really rain in California so I guess you can well it has the top put you driving brands I have good for you yeah good for you it's just a car yeah Oh me I'm not free getting wet the only problem is it's slippery you know there's no central or any of that it's just all engine power and yeah or canned but it's fun yeah I remember driving a Camaro around in the rain and it was handled like crap you should get one the new ones Camaro zl1 they have a new one 650 horsepower it's fucking ridiculous I mean nobody even barely uses the full speed here no oh so I was actually gonna tell you about this this is I did a rodent track cover article where I test drove it was a Porsche Corvette it I think it was a Viper of some sort viper and then there was a Lamborghini Murcielago and I'll I mean my experience was the the Porsche was loose which is this one the Corvette was tight which meant it was the most comfortable and stable to drive the I think it was a Viper the Viper was just light on its feet kinda it just didn't really wasn't very stuck and it was just kind of clunky it looks like it's about seven or eight years old is that right Oh at least yeah the Lamborghini was was also light I mean it just went so fast but it's pretty well balanced but probably a little on the loose side so you know they stopped making Vipers but I know the car for you there's a car that's for sale right now that I know jabo link had a rare one of the this one dealership in 2017 the country bought up like 90% of the Vipers and they ordered them and a bunch of crazy paint schemes and they ordered this hot pink Viper shut up you want me to see it I Drive it it's so fucking bad-ass I'd drive it I think it's cooler if a dude who drive a pink car and I would drive like some like stainless steel silver you know I would drive it and then I get a rainbow license plate so people will just assume I'm gay there's no way around it got a rainbow plate you got a pink car just let it all down it isn't it it's shit it was uh on my Google newsfeed this morning I looked at that I was like if I was a charity I'd be my fucking car but it's a crazy metallic hot pink Viper it's not like the Mary Kay car no that's not it that's old that shit's old that's red yeah that's red like red it's 2017 it might not even be choppa like I might uh that was think that was what I was reading well I'm not gonna drive it okay no I have to pull it up that's good thought but rather have black let me guess black black I knew it yeah tinted windows black black black black wheels black whoa darkness yeah like a Darth Vader type thing whoa so badass more more masculine feminine yeah yeah trying to figure out what kind of oh there it is that's not it oh gee that's an old one too that's but it's alright no worries that sounds gross that one looks gross okay the other one didn't look so gross it's more of a darker pink you don't have to find it Jeff she's gonna hate it no matter what she wants Darth Vader pink Corvettes that uh Angelina I saw her the other day I started driving that you know who angelina is no Angeline is a woman who when I moved to California in the 90s she used to have these billboards all around California of what it's her now her like in her bikini like just say her he would just say her name and her phone number and that's those those billboards oh well yeah that's her and so these and I'd be like who the fuck is Angelina everybody ah she's like this local celebrity and so she apparently is just a wealthy lady who all of her time here has done that just got these big billboards yeah she's doing a split on top of a Corvette a good thing is it working she kept doing it so she still does it right did you still have a billboard not a billboard but I just she has at least three different pink or well I've seen I figured really recently in the pink Corvette yeah okay not me not you definitely not you know I'm more like I'm more of your subjects when I got the Lamborghini and I had to go pick my sister up from the airport okay there's nowhere to put your put your bags it's a like a briefcase for for a you know trunk and it's in the front so that was kind of silly and then I realized that people normally get these cars so they can just like kind of take it out to dinner I don't want to be looked at so I'm not gonna I'm more likely to take it to go get groceries than I am to go to dinner so I realized that was pretty pointless for me yeah that's not the car for you and if I want performance I go do my job for now for now but when it's over but I'm trying to look I'm trying to keep saying you're looking forward yeah yeah yeah I'm looking forward after these next two races we'll have to visit again in a year a year from now and and have to figure this figure it all out you I'll tell you you're right probably well in a year from now then the new Corvette zr1 will be available 750 horsepower stupid 62 seconds I mean ever gonna use it so you might use 50 speeding tickets so you talking to you never nobody get nobody got a speeding ticket for getting the speed limit too quickly though that's true yeah well they're probably would pull you over and actually I got a funny story about when I got pulled over when I was 16 with my Mustang Cobra I was picking my girlfriend up and pulling out of her her off of her Street onto the Main Street and it was wet out and so I kind of got it going and kicked it sideways a little bit and looked in my rearview mirror at the stoplight and there's a cop sitting there well he comes for me so I turn on the first road I can find so I make a left drive down the road it's a freakin dead end so I pull into a driveway and we slouched down real low and the cop kind of drives around and all of a sudden somebody comes out from the house now like can I help you and I'm like oh what road is this out here I mean mind you it's the road I live off of I'm like oh what road is this out here so anyway so we're like okay okay thank you sure and so we get back in the car and the it's gone so we back out and head back down the road again trying to get further away from the stoplight make a left I look over in the parking lot across the street the grade school parking lot cops sitting there so I make the first right I can then so I turn right into a neighborhood and I'm driving along and he finally catches me and I think I cried help my said he turn his lights on so we you were running from him mm-hmm kinda mm-hmm this guy sounds like a shitty driver like a shitty cop but I think I got in trouble for being sideways not for beating yeah you should say it's so boyfriend's car I don't even know how to drive this thing it would have been actually a clever approach yeah yeah yeah just say I don't know what happened I hit the gas and it was where am I getting pulled over three times in three days episodes oh that was number three I think I cried maybe it was number two so is that why you were running from the cops look I just can't I can't keep doing this I just trying to see if I well Danika I think I've kept you long enough it was really wonderful to talk to you I really appreciate it it was really fun yeah I wish you all the best of luck with your wine and your clothes and your last two races and it was a pleasure thank you so nice to talk to you let's just talk about the whole car situation yes sir next year you're gonna want to get something crazy I guarantee once you're done when I tell you I'm I'm I'm missing the action I'll let you just call the car I should buy it sounds like a plan Danica Patrick
