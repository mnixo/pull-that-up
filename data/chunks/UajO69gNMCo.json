hello freak bitches and and I don't you're talking to a guy I don't like Hillary at all I think she's I think she's more the same yes but I think she's a corrupt human being there are a lot of examples of that however I'm not as uncharitable to say that I think she's I don't think she's evil I think she has a vision for the world I think swishy in her mind she believes she knows what's best for the country but there's a difference because I think she's willing to take big shortcuts to gain influence and always has in her career and I think shortcuts like what like what kind of big using influence using political influence to get what she wants when when I mean if you look at the people that Clinton pardoned I mean that pardon scandal was the craziest thing in the world he pardoned Frank rich take a look at the list Frank Rich the the he Hillary wanted to run for Senate in New York and he needed certain counties and he needed a large I believe Hasidic Jewish vote vote and he pardons some guy in a rabbi or somebody in there that was such a bling it's a little I remember the Democratic somewhat I think maybe one of the Democratic pundits who said I don't know how you defend this it's just so obvious that he's trying to buy his wife votes that he's trying to buy influence and that was that's well documented I don't think a lot of Democrats would disagree with that you know look it up look up the uranium guns deal through Bill Clinton's influence this Canadian businessman bought the Kazakh oil uranium fields well let's go one scandal at a time yeah the first one did you find the first one yes before I think he was gonna go down as active at the time largest tax evasion oh that's right at the time when he was prosecuting fled the US during his prosecution was riding in Switzerland he had 48 million dollars in taxes and was charged with 51 cases a counts of tax payer was pardoned for tax evasion well he was required to pay a 1 million dollar fine and waive any use of the pardon as a defense against any future civil charges that were filed against him insane the same case whoa critics complain that Denise Eisenberg rich his former wife had made substantial donations to the Clinton Library and mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign what a surprise that mark rich who lives in Switzerland and you're gonna give him a pardon do you think they're connected it was so blatant it was ridiculous but you can keep going with the pardons there are a lot of examples of that so the call Hillary Clinton not corrupt the uranium one deal God didn't look that up what's that what's uranium well well the Canadian businessman bought the Kazakh in Kazakh Stan used to be a part of the Soviet Union uranium fields some of them some huge uranium fields I think some of the biggest in the world uranium what do you use to make weapons oh shit and Bill Clinton helped his it with his influence a well-documented influence helped this Canadian businessman by those uranium fields but here's the problem that Canadian businessman gave thirty 1 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation with a pledge for a hundred million more and he gave Clinton a five hundred thousand dollar check for speaking for a speech then five hundred thirty hours then when it came time for the Clinton dinosaur bones sell for a lot of money at auctions it is a profitable business there is pressure for academics to publish papers museums are in the business of producing displays that are popular and appealing what the nonprofit business via need to produce material to sell to stay in business the mainstream media loves to hype alleged dinosaur finds much is to be gained by converting a bland non dinosaur discovery of a bone of modern origin into an impressive dinosaur find and letting artists interpretations and imaginations take the spotlight ok the basic boring real find if that's true then why do dinosaurs become passé why does somebody like me who has been on I don't know thirteen fourteen different television shows talking about paleontology geology and all that I have pitched dinosaur like live dig stuff to BBC and all of that I'm consulting on a couple projects right now unfortunately can't name them but dinosaurs become passé very very quickly because people are like oh cool new dinosaur was found yeah big deal or oh whoa brontosaurus is back yeah whatever but the mainstream media as he said is just like they love a dinosaur story but that's bullshit that's absolute bullshit when when was the last like dinosaur document yeah there was um what was it called autopsy of a t-rex with my friend Tori and that that okay that was a speculative science show it's like what happens if we found a t-rex and cut it open and do an autopsy that was a hit and then paleontology TV died again two years ago I had an a to our National Geographic documentary about digging up woolly mammoths in that it aired a night there was a little bit of press fuckin done the production company that did the the thing with Nat Geo is out of business now just done it's like really we're pressured and to get this money then why aren't we making fuckin more why Eric am i a bartender in addition to a paleontologist in addition to somebody that's on TV if I'm making all this Big Pharma are sorry big paleo fucking money if I'm such a shill okay yeah is that why I'm a month behind on my car payment right now is that why I'm trying to scrape together rent fuck you get aggressive I remember when you were like when I realized cuz I don't know at the time I didn't know anything about fighting but then you were explaining how like they're they have these insanely deep combos if this person does this they have all these moves like 19 moves deep than like there's incredible so I think she's like that like she has like if he does this you do this and if he does that then this this this and then that and then that and then that and they've done it all with like a government team of psychologists who fully analyzed him and know out of fucking set him off and she did it last night she did it in every single fucking debate and it's not like she's the one who's coming up with that she got a team of the smartest most manipulative people on planet earth who baited him in to the fucking elections in the first place you saw that email right where they picked the three candidates that they wanted to empower you know or to like build up which was Trump what's his name that Cruz Ted fucking Cruz this is also fool because he's a fool and the other the sweet guy the doctor Bo na Toby and Carson Carson you know so like they picked the three biggest fools days they're like all right let's pump them up they pump them up the king of the fools made his way into the fucking president somehow they're like are you fucking kidding we got Trump we got fucking Trump we got Trump Trump hold on let me go to the Trump file oh my god listen to this audio I'm talking about graphing fucking girls she's like okay great let's use that hold on to that for a while yeah let's do that in the day before the second debate you know what I mean I think they gave it two days yeah two days Zimmer two days to build and then of course they were probably working on like you know months leading up to it they're like let's find every single person that claims Donald Trump groped them or that were groped by Donald or anyone who's willing to claim Donald Trump robe yeah anybody wants to get on TV yeah yeah how you guys feeling and I but I have a feeling I mean I don't I don't know for sure but my guess would be that if you wanted to find people who said yeah Trump grab my pussy it wouldn't be that fucking hard it's not like you're looking for Bigfoot right yeah but so so it wasn't like a hard thing to do it's a breadcrumb trail yeah very simple very easy and so it's like when you realize like that then you start feeling this weird compassion for him you're like my god even with her always like maliciousness and like weird perviness and stuff ultimately he he's like a fucking bowl that got put into a goddamn ring with a matador who's been doing this kind of bull fighting for like thirty fucking years for better for worse and he's we're watching what we saw last night [Music]
