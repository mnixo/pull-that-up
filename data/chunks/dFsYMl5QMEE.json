the Joe Rogan experience what is it about war movie that drive you the most crazy the fact that almost everything in them isn't accurate almost everything biggest thing that drives me fucking crazy is when grenades create a fireball really well yeah cuz it happens in like every movie they throw a grenade and a 55-gallon drum of gasoline explodes right and people go flying backwards and cars flip over if you throw a grenade it goes pop and it put some dust up in the air and if you're waiting for the fireball you're gonna be there for the rest of your natural life it's just not going and they're not that effective they're fun don't get me wrong but they're not that effective I did not know that they don't like create a fireball no I've never seen a grenade go off obviously I'm sure Jamie can pull one up but just because it's dust it's all I've seen one in the video I'm sure for a moment like the momentary explosion there is a flash but other than that it's literally just dust flying up in the air what what is the best military movie that's the most accurate or the least offensive Navy SEALs starring Charlie Sheen really no not at all oh that fucking guy probably thought more people in to come into the SEAL Teams than anybody else really oh my god really yeah I mean he's falling through skylights with mp5s and handlebar mustaches you know there's snipers calling himself god I can't see anything I'm switching to starlight blasting people through a concrete wall they're doing freefall jumps are in submarines like that's an entire 30-year career to do all that shit in 60 minutes you take that expectation you come to the team's like I'm kind of bored right now so was that the war areas bang bang I'm gonna run boys yep I'm gonna make it and he's got the the the requisite scarf around the neck and first I'll have one of those so what kind of asshole wears a red scarf in an environment where there's no red yes got green utility is on from Vietnam we're gonna read the Shamal yeah this is so hilarious so another one especially when you know charlie now like such a fucking psychotic partier and so apparently apparently so they came to the buds compound into little bit of training with the guys and I guess there was some bathroom breaks and they just like alright you guys ready for some more PT oh really that makes sense I've obviously hearing that eighteenth hand but I want to believe it's true in with reversing aging and age-related diseases I mean we're we're entering or entering into an incredibly strange time for the the influence of technology and innovation on human beings on our bodies and our brains oh and we're gonna have to decide you know how how far you want to go on this ride next stop Far Rockaway like when you get now I live there yeah as I've done the beach there I'm going but you know I'm saying it's like one of those things like wet where do you get off like when where do you go that okay that's enough you know like with you you're deleting Facebook you lead to delete Instagram and you go just gonna be on mines and that's enough I'll go in other places I mean that these there are out alternatives that are getting very big yes what so and and together like what like signal has tens of millions of users I don't know what that is you've never heard of it that's like the encrypted messaging app fit do you know what I don't it's open source what is this Snowden is on there but visor aboard or whatnot what is signal it's just a messaging app so a message on but like a whatsapp or like a Twitter ok whatsapp so it's you have to know the person and then contact them through it yeah but we're talking we're considering using the signal protocol for our messaging system because our messaging system needs an upgrade but all of us together are going to be able to create sort of like a a group of apps that are like sort of a more open freedom supporting privacy alternative and like so it's we're not gonna solve it by ourselves and it would be way easier if one of these big companies would just switch gears and start doing things the right way I mean we've spent eight years building this if one of the big companies Google Facebook had just been free and open source we would have spent the last seven years building on top of them right because you know they already did something cool that they're sharing with everybody so it's it's actually closed source project stifle innovation because if you think we had to reinvent the wheel we literally we went and built an alternative with much of the similar functionality think about how much further the world would be if everyone was building on top of more common in terms of like groundbreaking sketch comedy shows though like that that that KKK pit where he had the the rough line let me tell you something do you understand in the history of sketch nobody has premiered a sketch show and came off so hardcore the first night this was as hard as it comes when they ended that shit when when we asked why why after all these years we just saw so I was like because she's a nigger lover I was like that was one of them that was one of the joints I'm like wake up everybody homo sleep it in here I know from that moment that this show was gonna be on the next level yeah well was he was free it was so many when we did funny things a lot of things I used to do I was a warm-up comedian for Chappelle's Show so whenever you saw a Chappelle's Show episode and if you noticed that whenever I came on screen and I'm not being cocky people would go nuts they play oh shit and the reason was because I was a guy did one of the audience before Dave came out so I knew if I go gut the room out at the beginning people don't eat people don't even dated nobody knew I was anything if I ripped that at the beginning and then when they see me on the screen it's gonna be like it's gonna be big you know worse yeah and and and that show man it was just like it was just a lot of things to happen and show people like the Rick James sketch the day we played that during the wrap arounds man that should hit so hard I was like this shit is crazy crazy funny thing people know is that Comedy Central did not like that sketch komm is central here's this funny kind of yes it can be said you didn't think Charlie Murphy was funny in it and I watched we ran as shit just to let you know the directional people think I wasn't shit six times and every time man every time you heard Dave say I'm Rick James bitch it was guts son it was guts side yo what did the five figures say to the face where's Lance I had a sketch was getting kids suspended in school right he was school tape teachers what the five figures I say Rick James bitch all right Tom you're suspended for a week you and Dave Chappelle go to the fucking timeout room it's one of the most iconic sketches of all time how wrong was Comedy Central I mean not just a little wrong along all the way wrong all the way around it like almost like suicidal it looks like hmm but then it goes shows like it goes showed you know how you have a vision with something you see it yeah everybody may not see it right one of the most important things I learned for both my books for chasing scream and lost connection is that these forms of despair depression anxiety addiction they are meaningful signals right they are telling us something the fact that they had been rising year after year after year that we're now at the point where average white male life expectancy has fallen in this country for the first time in the entire peacetime history of the United States that is a signal that is telling us something and that's because of drug addiction and and overwhelming because of drug addiction and suicide is risen to that point that other factors going on like obesity but that the main drivers are overdose and suicide and that is telling us something and what we've been doing up to now is we've been insulting that signal we've either been saying depress people addictive people are just weak all we've been saying oh it's just a problem in their brain that there are real things going on in their brains of course all we've been saying you know it's just craziness and but in fact it is largely a response to the way we're living of course there are other things going on as well and we can talk about them and once you understand that you realize there's got to be a deeper response and I went to places that I'd done that not just whistling there's a few of those people that really don't have any talent but they made the right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets real uncomfortable well that was the thing I think the first time we spoke is I written I think about Louie and after Luiz and the whole news but Louie have you had all that love that piece but thank you it was so sunny and honest yeah it was on Facebook which where I did a lot of my best work playing what you were saying - I know that didn't read it after Louie a lot of people were rightly you know criticizing conduct and you know how many to thing that that's all valid intro a hundred percent needs to happen but then there were people that were like you know Louie was never funny or Louie was just you know of course he got all these things he was a white guy or and I'm like wait what and there were like police said this word I don't like well look at this joke and I'm like guys a week ago he was a comic genius we all agreed on that that was a widely held belief now out of nowhere he's not that funny and and these people are tweeting this from parking lots where they're performing some of these shows in LA or in like someone's driveway you know yeah and which is fine I do them I've no problem with that you know but they're getting on Twitter and knocking Louie from the back of a parking lot where they're doing a show but what you the reason you gave for why well because these there's in any industry people are gonna get ahead by being agreeable by having the right opinions by crowdsourcing their opinions by taking the temperature of the room and going how does everyone feel and those people are you know they're careerist they're very good at office politics they're very good at having the right friends but their contributions are never really important or long-lasting because they never get great because they don't take any risk because I think greatness is something you have to risk constantly to get to that level yeah so a lot of these people do very well they make money they're they're successful but they are careerist and they're looking for comfort and so when it was comfortable and safe to attack Louie and to bring Louie down and to elevate themselves they did it but they didn't do it when it could have hurt their career a week earlier you know yeah so to me it was very disingenuous and the fact that more people weren't calling it out and and I and I made up or I said the same thing on the other side of people who styled themselves like I'm a free-speech warrior I'm this anti PC and their whole entire persona is is that the need to say the n-word right they're like I can't do a joke if the punch line isn't fact like they're like we have to yeah so those to me are kind of the same people and they're they're the people that are just trying to arrange the world in a way that allows them to succeed [Applause]
