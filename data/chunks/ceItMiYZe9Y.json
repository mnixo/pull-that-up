hold this all the good stuff happens before long it always does 3 2 1 Dan Carlin ladies gentlemen and we're live hey dude first of all thank you so much for this coin this coin from Constantine you brought me a what how many years old 1700 that's fucking crazy man it's funded I always say I like giving something that is the oldest man-made object in most people's homes maybe not yours you'll have some Aboriginal instrument or something that's like from the Stone Age but most people that'll be the oldest man-made thing in their home my friend dr. mark Gordon actually gave me a Roman coin as well but I don't know whose coin is all yours looks older I don't know that's depressing though because normally I'm the coin guy so I hate that I've been beaten to the punch by anybody on that well he's he's kind of a historical aficionado or a history aficionado as well not the extent that you are though but so this is from Constantine yeah my wife would spend that buy action and just so you know where's that coin oh I got a coffee I got a pair of shoes that's right and there were no one buy shoes no how much was that worth back then do you know what thing I think that's like they're paying probably is it is did they have what kind of units today they had like they probably had like some dead metal type thing and then some kind of bronze and then you get into the silver and gold and how much is mixed into the rest and and they have those like you can go and it's actually really cool because they wear better like like they'll they'll clean the silver off and it looks like yesterday mmm so you always know it's the cheap stuff when they're all dirty and everything like that oh right because then it's like a panty well our pennies get the same way what do you think this is made out of Oh some alloy I don't know they had alloys back then oh sure electrum was the cool one will you mix gold and silver oh yeah I've never heard of that yeah electrum they still have it rum yeah they use it if I'm right about that that's gonna be one of these on Twitter can't currently does no one's talking about electro it's not that well the beautiful thing about your podcast is you can research things in advance so you know what the fuck you're talking about by the time you speak theoretically yes supposedly I have a lot of a lot of wiggle room words defensive journalism yeah but dude I don't have to tell you any again but I will your your podcast is for me has been the most educational historical thing in my entire life like I've never had anything in my life that's taught more about history than hardcore history I don't even know how to react when people say it is the kindest thing that you hear and I always say the same thing I always hope everybody gets a chance in their lives to have people that they admire turning around and telling them something like that because it is the neatest feeling and when when you realize all the crap you put up with for decades and other jobs and other businesses to say okay I'm 51 or whatever and and they really like what you do you just everybody should feel this way so my pleasure and I appreciate you you you've found your niche man you like to think about all the other stuff you did all the broadcast work you did before it really prepared you for this this podcast because obviously this medium is so incredibly new and this ability for you to just put something out I mean I see when you put out new podcasts they're regularly at the top of the heap of all the podcasts in the world that's incredible when you think about that that all you it's just you and you have a guy who helps you with editing theoretically yeah yeah and that's fucking it I mean that is amazing well what I mean how is that any different from this Empire you but this person just talked yeah but that's all I'm doing do but you walk into this place you go this this is the book Joe Rogan's talking has built you know something something along those I'm talking about people like you but you're right I mean I keep trying to remind myself cuz you know you and I both been doing this a long time got into it pretty pretty early on and so for us it doesn't feel new but you keep trying to think about okay what's this gonna be like in 30 years right 40 years I keep telling everybody that what you're seeing now and Mike my children know no other world I mean in their minds I tell my oldest all the time at the time you were born we weren't even texting yet that is all since you've come around so I keep thinking we're still at the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg in this era that we're in now what's podcasting going to be like when whole generations grow up and it's just a part of their world and podcasts are a part and it won't even be podcasting I mean they'll be broadcasting into the matrix cord in the back of your neck or something but but I mean we're still at the it it seems hard for long-term podcasters to understand that this is still the beginning it's almost impossible for us to predict because when you really think about what we're doing now in terms of like like you could put a YouTube video right now you could make a video and you could it could go viral for whatever reason and a million people all over the world to watching your video like almost instantly this was not not only unheard of ten years ago just go back twenty thirty forty it's insanity you're talking insanity like people would be like what the fuck are you saying you have a phone in your pocket that would be insane you have a phone in your pocket that has a camera what you have a phone in your pocket that's a video camera that takes high definition video with stereo sound and you can wait a minute you're uploading it through the sky just through the air what in real time like instantaneously that's insane so now think what could we be looking at in terms of augmented reality in terms of virtual reality and working on something along those lines right now it's it's it's crazy yes what are you doing I can't tell you what I do the point is is that this you're absolutely right about this stuff and and you you know I spent before I got into podcasting I was in in the era where you know like Mark Cuban made it big and everybody was just gonna start a high-tech company and sell it for billions of dollars what did Cuban make it big with broadcast comm I think which which I recall it was basically like a website with a bunch of links and and you know everybody was like dang if he can do so I was in one of these companies with a bunch of buddies and we were we were pushing what we called amateur content back then so we're talking 95 96 and one of my Jobs was to go with the staff to all these venture capitalists and try to sell them on the idea of what amateur content was gonna become Joe we went from like place to place to place with all these people who are supposedly the ones who can see the future and every one of them and I mean every single one said nobody's gonna view amateur content because if anybody could make anything anybody wanted to see they'd be paid for it right and I kept talking about the the quantity has a quality all its own idea right where you say listen if only 1% of this stuff is worth watching you're still gonna have millions of pieces of content uploaded all the time there's gonna be good stuff in there they were like you so you thought this was coming it's in some ways well yeah and it wasn't just because um you know I was in with a bunch of tech people who understood this too but one of them had taken me off the radio and and said we're gonna put you on the Internet this was in 94 what and I said put me on the Internet I said we're just learning how to I said what are we gonna do and just well I'm gonna invent the the way to do this and you're gonna be the test person right that shows everybody hey you so that fell through but once that happened I was you know it was in the back of my head going okay someday we might be able to do this on the internet that kind of things but but the point was is that these people do venture capital meetings all these you know hardcore guys who are inventing our future and funding it none of them saw this amateur content then coming there was one thing that they were doing quite a long time ago there was like some internet radio channel yes they had tried to put together and you know they had funded it and spent a bunch of money on they hired a bunch of people to do it and Bobby Slayton was actually one of the the online broadcasters and I did his show and you know and he was talking about how they were having a hard time keeping it up and wasn't catching on the way they wanted to they were just a little bit of hell yeah yeah all right I read somewhere too because I was actually sort of researching the history of what we do and what the precursors were and I guess there were audio blogs and stuff that some really high tech types were were pursuing in the 90s also maybe even the late 80s where you know they're like send in full files to each other or something but you know it's funny because somebody's gonna write a book someday about the history of this and how it got started and all that kind of stuff and it's crazy to think about that we're actually due to sort of a a serendipity good good timing sense that here we are like I said in the first 10 years 15 years of of what's not just gonna be a phenomenon but it's gonna be a huge part I think of the future world that people grow up in not our show specifically but but but this world we're creating I mean everyone's a broadcaster now yeah and look anyone could have been I mean there's been a lot of barriers to keep people that are really talented interesting funny people from getting their stuff out there and that thing was like always like they didn't know how to start how do I like how do I become a stand-up comedian uh I've talked to so many funny guys and they just go well how do I get started like when you got to go sign up at an open mic night like ah it just seems too much and the idea of it is too daunting but if you just sit in front of a camera okay that's all you have to do turn yourself on on and start talking here's what I think about Donald Trump this is what I think about Harvey Weinstein all you have to do is have a unique take be funny be interesting somehow engaging and it doesn't even have to be I mean god there's a hundred maybe more really funny what I would call Twitter comedians that just say funny shit they write funny shit on Twitter and they have huge followings because of it I always say you know you try to look at what the brick and mortar analog version of this was before this came around remember MC Hammer was selling you know cassette tapes of his music out of them kind of his hatchback at the Oakland A's games or or I think of like Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor these people who are just they're so funny that you could put them on a crapoly recorded cassette tape and it wouldn't make any difference and and I remember Eddie Murphy saying something about if he hadn't gotten on Saturday Night Live he doesn't know how he would have how he would have exposed himself to the public well these days if you're that funny and you put that on audio and you put it out there you will you know no you no longer need the facilitator the gatekeeper to open the doors for you you have a wide open mic you know you called it open mic night so this is open mic night for the world right yeah every country it's fucking crazy there's some kid who's 20 years old that bought a house in my neighborhood for nine million dollars or seven million dollars seven million dollars some fucking YouTube kid I was reading about it today I went what he's 20 he bought a 7 million dollar fucking house I was like this is insane don't even pull it up enough of him no I was I was at YouTube about a month ago I did a speaking engagement at Google and across the street in New York above the Camden market they they owned the whole building so they take me up there I get the six hour tour and at one point they have on a wall with all these youtube stars on it and you know I'm old so there's one or two so I go okay that's Lady gaga I guess and and there's a bunch of like 20 year olds and it figure on oh this guy has a bazillion followers and I'm looking at him going really I mean at his age I don't know what the hell I was doing when I was taking a year off college or something but it's all these kids with multiple piercings and tattoos and face stuff and they're all the Google people were telling me how these people are all huge giant yeah come in with their entourages and that's crazy yeah some kid just died he's 21 to pay for these tattoos and who the fuck is this kid he's a giant youtube star some youtube rap star no did you know who he was I've heard the name I didn't know it so you're young Jamie but you're actually all two of these young far hey hey calm down hold you 34 that's old - these aren't trust anybody over 30 wasn't that the line yeah that was back in the day right but then 30s 40s the new 30 HFE so what the fuck am i dirt old like dirt still at the top of the of the iceberg though doing the ahead of the game and everybody this whole thing what we're experiencing now I think is the top of the iceberg because I think there's some shit that's coming down the pipe that is gonna blow all this out of the water and the idea of just listening the things it's going to be ridiculous it's gonna be so surface I really believe like what you were saying about some sort of a matrix plug-in you're my friend my friend Duncan has one of those HTC vibes have you ever seen those really yeah you put the helmet on I have one you have one of those yeah well part of the part of the gig I'm working on yeah oh you want to talk about it they sent it to me they sent it to me and they I'll tell you what's cool I didn't mean to rip your shirt you go ahead but what Google Earth is on the the virtual reality thing right and they just and they just started it they just put out a new I think it's a new update don't go I'm old so don't quote me on this but but the update allows you now to zoom in at the ground level yeah now it's not virtual reality the ground level it's more like you're in the photograph but it's really cool I it was just a week ago I went to all the homes I grew up in as a kid Jamie's poem yeah okay so this is how it always looked even like a year ago but now you can zoom into the ground and there's people around you at all these it's truly awesome I have this is insane and it's only gonna be better they'll actually at some point have real virtual reality on the ground anywhere you want to go this is insane well that's what I think is gonna come up next I think we're gonna have it set up where like this podcast you'll be able to put on some goggles like this lady is wearing here you're gonna be able to put up some goggles you're gonna be in this room with us you'll be behind me you'll be staring at my butt you'll do whatever the fuck you want you'll be in the room you know I'm saying you will you will like a sim game in it that's common man this is this whole thing is gonna feel so 2d and flat and archaic in just a decade or so everybody's waiting though for the Big C it's funny how you you wait for you know if you know how technology is adopted right you don't buy the computer just to have the computer some new game or some new new ability comes you all I got to do that well I guess I need a computer for that everybody's waiting for that in the virtual reality room - what's what's the must-have thing but then next Christmas everybody's got to have the virtual reality set up under the tree for you know well I think one of the things that's setting Android ahead of the curve in terms of like Android versus Apple as these Android phones they slide into these headsets now and they act as virtual reality screwing a low-level one yeah yeah yeah not that bad man no not that I haven't seen it but they did but you know they told me again they that that the overlords yes the overlords um I understand their mushroom overlords that's what I heard earlier but but uh but no that they were telling me that that the iPhones from Apple also are built for that capability they just haven't introduced the add-ons that you would need but in terms of the power that they put in there they built it for that so it can scale up eventually yeah he just pulling he'll be talking out of my rear right there Apple reportedly readying standalone a arm which is augmented reality headset for 2019 well I hate fuckface that's a year and a half away from now you fucking assholes what is this gonna get see that's what no one knows and everybody's afraid to put money forward and not and and be too early like you were just talking about look at hold on look at this the device would run our OS Apple's reality operating system see that's the fucking matrix man this is what everybody was worried about with Google that Google was Skynet Google has your email Google it like some people are using Google Voice because people use Google Maps yeah I mean there's there's so much now that you're connected to with this one company if they come out with some crazy augmented reality thing and then you like tap into that as well but everybody wants you in their environment I don't want you in the closed environment so that I mean it's funny how the old AOL model is is similar now to what they still Facebook never want you to have to leave Facebook Google wants you to be googled all the time I mean I bolt they keep iMessage I tried switching over to a Google pixel about a year ago for two days it was so bad like trying to get people to message me like I would text people did you get it no did you get it no send me a text I didn't get it fuck and I'd be calling them back did you send it yeah I didn't get it it says it sent it okay hold on a second you want Tony to get it you didn't get it did you get it no fuck so what do you got to do so then I go online you have to go to the Apple iMessage servers and have your email removed okay I'll go and do that nothing I was like fuck this and then I talked to people online like what's the best way to do this they go you got to change your number I what so if you want to try to use an Android phone you have to change your phone number my guard fuck it I went right back to Apple I was like I have time for this this is like this is too much noodling around I know one problem with the password these days can occupy your whole day trying to figure out the problem so I mean I had it with the email I see I didn't know yahoo mail was down so I'm thinking it's my problem so I'm spending the whole day working on it I'm changing passwords look I never together do they know yahoo was just down all those passwords you'd have to do any of that and it screwed up everything the ad before and I'm 51 that's what happens when you get old well I got a MacBook and I got a phone call on my book yeah I mean what is this bullshit I updated something and all sudden my laptop started ringing I'm like no no no no no we're not doing this no I'm not doing this my children I'm at the point now where I'm literally asking my teenage children for help and that to me is a sign right there it's the first sign that eventually leads you into that home that they put you in you know I mean this is the first step towards my children going oh my god my father you know what's bizarre man my kids they've just figure shit out like if you give a kid it's it's amazing how intuitive some of these app creators are absolutely because my nine-year-old she started making these little movies she's got this little editing thing on our iPad my 12 year old does it - so she's filming little scenes she splices them all together and then she adds music and text to it and then she goes daddy want to see the movie I mean I want what what he fuck it's good it's good you know what you know what though I mean from a creative standpoint it's so easy um and I tend to have a personality that does this anyway - look at the negative dystopian you know things that can happen the Big Brother things which is totally the way I see the world but um but my kids when I look at the creativity so in my family I come from a family of people who worked in film and so when I was a kid I had a super 8 camera had old editing setup fly sit by I used to make little space videos and I figured out you scratched the film with a needle frame after frame and you can make laser beams and so when I was a kid I did that so like you said my daughter comes up here was only two weeks ago and she's taken all of her school plays that she's done she's taken scenes out of them she's backed it with music and she's turned it into like a movie promo that you see at the beginning of the theatre oh and I'm looking at this and I'm going this is so dang creative and it's made you know how hard it would have been for her to get a super8 camera and the editing device we I mean this this makes it available to all these people and so theoretically if it doesn't go the Dan Carlin dystopian Blade Runner way it could easily be like this and this is how I used to sell the the amateur content to the venture capitals in the 90s by saying it's gonna be a creativity revolution and Joe Rogan's nine-year-old is already taking part in it and you're not even sure how she did it that's how we know well I have no idea I watched her do them like how are you doing this who taught you to do this I figured it out like what you figured it out you just figured it out yeah you just put this and you do that she's like you want to do one let's do one like you doing fast and slow mo and all those different little effects you could put on it do you remember the old days when you have two VHS tapes yeah to do this and you'd press one on record and the other one on play and you would record from each other yes and it worked about 50% of the sort of it was like The cuts were so obvious like the cuts had scenes it was never seamless there was always like this big fucking digital fuzz in between this gets back to something that you and I were talking about when we first started here so it's it's what the technology can do so like I'm straight if you're out there you're gonna hear me talk about this now this may be a personal one-to-one conversation with someone in your audience but somebody did something that is both flattering and absolutely terrifying to me recently they went and they said it took hundreds of hours and they culled a ton of my shows and they made little clips of all the things I said and then rearrange them and created an absolutely new show about politics unfortunately with me and you cannot tell that they've cut this thing 9,000 different times but it's my voice saying a whole show of political stuff that I never said made up huh he said the guy said it took him hundreds of hours but he's crazy yeah but you turn around you go okay somebody's gonna take a little tight and she did at the beginning this is not Dan Carlin really saying this but some guys gonna take like some obscure weird segment put it on the internet I'm gonna be chasing you know that group going no it's not me that guy did well you don't even have to do that anymore if it's just audio what they're doing now is you could take 40 hours of audio which obviously you and I both have way more than that they take that 40 hours of audio and they can essentially have you say anything anything ever so is that going to get us out this is the conversation we have so can you say to somebody when they say I heard Dan Carlin say he's all for child molesting can you say hey hey that's not me and look there there's all this stuff out there I mean is it gonna is that gonna get you out of trouble or a CNN gonna run that story and you'll never be able to back them all your way out once they understand that technology is available they're gonna have to be at least questioning the source of it but if they don't you just see the shit out of them but I don't think they're gonna jump on it's sort of like photoshopping it is like mom shopping do you everyone oscar de la hoya got caught wearing fishnets and high-heeled shoes with boxing gloves on he was coked up and he was hanging around with some crazy russian strippers and he was having a good old time and he just thought it was fun to dress up like a girl and you know I thought it's funny but he was very deeply embarrassed by it obviously he's Mexican so Latino boxing fans were not taking very kindly to that so he just said look that shit's fake it's been Photoshop perfect yeah look at it there he is look how do we know that's Oscar Dylan he's having a good time he's wearing a wig in one of them and a hat all right all I ever think about is the is the left hook to the liver that Bernard Hopkins hit him with and put him down on the deck and I I think about him beating up Julio Cesar Chavez where all the Mexicans were mad at him how come I'm is that the girl that he was with go above that the two pictures with him in the girl yeah is that the girl that turned him in keep an eye on that bitch if you're gonna get a lap dance she's gonna tell people so I guess I guess they she'd debts her right there I guess that looks photoshopped does it look sort of photoshopping ugly because it's his body means obvious an athlete's body but he's wearing a skirt and look he's they were partying he's having a good fucking time he thought it was silly to play dress-up the fuck you mean look at the one in the upper right though and he's bending over look at that one that one's rough so wait a minute so could you see it almost seems to me not it's the perfect cover because now you could do anything you wanted to I mean if it's the if it's the Clinton years in office and Bill Clinton I could do anything you wanted to just it's Photoshop that's not me you kind of can but they can tell they can sort of tell if you have an expert look at it they can bring it down so - yeah but there's a lot of the problem is all you have to do is have a few people say it's real and then a few people say it's fake and the people that want it to be real that's exactly right yeah how do you but and how do you chase it down I mean you would constantly be one step behind yeah I mean it's even this way like I was talking about piracy earlier and trying you know I have I have these old line advisers who will say things like you need to be charging for your new shows and more money and and I sit there and go our competition is piracy man I mean you got to make everything so cheap and guilt them out so that they don't want to go pirate your stuff they feel but but but the the the idea of I'm forgetting work I told me I told you this was gonna happen didn't I have these senior moments now yeah I mean well we had it with Obama's birth certificate yeah or something like that the Obama birth certificate was a real issue because there was people that were examining it and they say they were going putting it through Photoshop they go and look this is clearly fake look here's the filters you can see how it's been added and edited but then you had a bunch of people that were actually Photoshop extras no no no dipshit this is how Photoshop breaks down images it breaks them down into layers this isn't fake like this is the actual image and this is how Photoshop processes images and so but it didn't matter all it took was enough people to show you the original Photoshop image and say look here's why when we put it in Photoshop you see all these layers clearly it's fake and then they just fucking run with it they just run with it on their online forums and on their they got the little Twitter group of right-wing people that want to think that Obama is a Kenyan Muslim who's a some sort of Manchurian Candidate and then there was a lot of that going on but when I talked to people like red BAM who actually understands Photoshop he's like oh this is what happens when you put an image in Photoshop it breaks it down into layers like it shows you how this is how you would edit something in Photoshop I think the point you made earlier when you started talking about that though is the key one which is if you want to believe this here's your evidence and you're going to ignore and if you don't want to the opposite I wrote a piece that never got published in the late eighties called the death of objective truth and I thought at the time that this was because you couldn't have arguments anymore because no one would accept your source if you said okay the New York Times said this when I was a kid that was a starting point right okay if the New York Times says this okay we both believe it now we can have a conversation about what the New York Times says nowadays I I can't have political discussions with people anymore because it never gets past ground zero right we start I make a premise you challenge the premise I bring in a piece of evidence you say I don't believe that evidence at all here's the other evident and boom Jonah Goldberg who's a like a standard conservative columnist wrote a piece of a couple months ago where he said I can't even have fun political discussions anymore because you never get past the beginning of the talk yeah we disagree over over the fact that isn't even what we're talking about right here's here's here's reality now let's talk about wait a minute that's your reality that's not my RIA and so you can't even have the kind of fun political discussions we had as kids or teenagers because there's a basic disagreement on what reality looks like to different people yeah well there's these tribal or green tribals the perfect yeah we have a tribal agreement to support the left and you saw that with Hillary Clinton there were so many people that were defending Hillary Clinton and people were calling me right-wing people that I know we're like what are you a right-wing or now I'm like no Hillary Clinton is a fucking liar like it's really simple look I'm not saying that I like Donald Trump I don't but I'm saying you can't just because you don't like Donald Trump ignore the fact that the Clinton Foundation is super fuckin shady that Hillary Clinton is clearly a liar that they definitely did something with the DNC to rig the primaries to keep Bernie Sanders out and now you have Donna what's her name Donna Brazile Donna Brazile coming out about all this stuff too and she's showing how it was all done and how Clinton's sort of hijacked the entire DNC during the campaign made everybody dependent upon her campaign the whole thing tribal because people didn't they wanted so badly to get Donald Trump and make sure he wasn't in office that they were supporting someone who didn't even support gay marriage until 2013 I mean she was a creepy person in so many different ways and still is but she represents their team so they would have this blind allegiance in this tribal loyalty towards the left I think that's a real problem it's a real problem we have in this country where people just I'm a fucking Dolphins fan it's dolphins to the death and they get that way with the Cubs and they get that way with Democrats and they get that way with Republicans and you're seeing it right now you're seeing it right now with people that have an inability to in any way say anything negative about Donald Trump because he's the president because he's a Republican well you're not living in reality there's some there's certain things there's certain there's certain things that we really need to be concerned about forget about politics what about the Environmental Protection Agency standards what about what they're doing in Alaska where they're trying to drill for minerals and and they have this a very important salmon river that they're gonna drill right next to and they're passing this without any advice with scientists they're just going straight to it to try to make money and people are freaking the fuck out about this kind of stuff and Republicans there's so many of them don't want to say a peep they don't want to say a word about it because he's their guy he's on their team and people are super tribal about it you know this is part of the problem I've been having with my political show is I feel and everybody thinks it's a trump related thing but I think it's what you said I'm having an issue trying to figure out if my basic if my basic understanding of how a system like ours is supposed to work is fundamentally flawed you know I always I always like to say that wisdom requires a flexible mind but I got it I gotta live that too right so if I'm seeing stuff that doesn't back up my theory on how things are supposed to work I feel like I have to sit back a little bit and go okay what are we seeing here and you mentioned a bunch of fundamental societal changes we're going through and we started talking whether we're talking about amateur content or everybody being able to broadcast and all that we didn't even mention the fact that our broadcasts are international now so you're not just talking to Americans anymore and it makes me start to wonder about the basic idea of are we smart enough and this this goes against all my principles so it's hard for me but are we smart enough and does our modern society require us all to be more intelligent or in touch or understanding of the facts than for example American voters seventy-five years ago had to be I'm starting to again this isn't about Trump it's about what you were talking about the fact that we're having discussions over stuff that either isn't real or you don't understand the issue but you have a very strong opinion one way or the other about it or some talk-show host you trust told you this is the way it is so you're gonna believe it well let's put it this way let's let's see we've always have had uninformed or tribal voters because we always have is there a tipping point where if you have you know if it's changing 10% every decade that you say okay we used to have twenty percent of people who really didn't know what was going on now we have seventy percent of people I mean I'm starting to look back and go if you can't have basic discussions about reality mmm-hmm can you do your job as an as a voter in this society um and I don't know I'm backing up going because I'm a Jeffersonian guy so I believe you know in the in the old agricultural old republic and you know there's a bunch of ideas that go to that but part of it is a real trust in the people okay right I and I can't decide if the trust I've always had in the people was misplaced from the bit from the get-go or if the challenges of this modern society that we have and an entire generation and generations behind them let's be honest growing up in a world of 140 character conversations and all these different things if that doesn't fundamentally change us in a way that you might say listen in the 50s we could handle our voting responsibilities better than now because the challenges to human beings now are greater I don't know and I don't have an answer which is why I'm sort of backing off and kind of observing instead of yakking about it frigid well I mean it's simple I think it's important to talk about it just because we're all trying to figure it out together I think so and I think that's that's really what's going on here is that collectively we've never really had a voice the way we have now it's never been 320 whatever-it-is million people that can just chime and it's not even that I mean yeah we have foreigners in Russian but this is this has never happened you know in the old days do you remember they used to it used to be considered like what your CIA would do or something to broadcast Radio Free Europe over the Iron Curtain Radio Free Europe is a joke now we all talk to each other all the time in its and then you say to yourself okay if the Russians are doing this to us aren't we doing this to the Russians in other words the fake news that's going on there maybe a bunch of governments and corporations and everything you know they used to say the best way to cover up your lie is to just flood the system with more lies because then everything is up in the air right I mean yeah that makes sense yeah and just it flooded and I feel like we're flooded now and so if you say to yourself are we more flooded than we were 75 years ago and if we are does that require more from the average voter than we required 75 years ago and let's be honest the dirty little secret of the American system is everyone who studies it knows is that once upon a time this voting franchise was actually in relatively few hands yes and you had to I mean the old idea behind running a farm I used to read this a left-wing writer who said it was all part of they hated poor people so they didn't want to I don't know I think it was more of a voting requirement that said hey if you can run a farm you can't be too much of an idiot so that'll be our requirement you have to have this much land right I don't know but but you do feel like as democracy's taken over because we're really a republic but we've been moving more towards a democracy for 200 some years if that happens and you turn right now we have no qualifications because how would you implement them somebody would say this is racist or classist or whatever but without any requirements are we doing a half I mean how many people who are voting really understand what's going on well what are those requirements like think about it from telling you that the 20 year old kid in my neighborhood just bought a seven million dollar house from YouTube this kid is obviously very wealthy and but does he know what's going on yeah do you have to be smart or do you have to be wealthy like do you have to be a landowner do you have to be a farmer you have to be a business owner he's essentially a business if you're gonna take the test sort of raids the test who decides what their questions of an informed voter you know would know would be I mean another right in the left can agree in the parameter be like gerrymandering gerrymander the test and you know these people these 320 million people this newfound responsibility of being able to chime in and communicate there used to just being able to talk shit at the gas station they used to be they're not used to this being permanent they're not used to this being the crazy crazy all the time they're crazy they're fascinating though because I think this is one step I think this is step one to this augmented reality situation that we're talking about I think what this represents is a deeper and deeper connection that we're gonna have with each other and I think we're going to get past language and we're going to get past culture and some sort of a weird way and it might take a hundred years to do this but I really believe there's going to be some sort of a universal operating system that allows us to exchange thoughts you know you know in a way that everyone understands some sort of a rosetta stone for the human mind oh I love that I love that idea I really think it's rosetta stone for the human mind i think it's possible because i think look the the new google pixel has earbuds and these earbuds translate languages in real time oh yeah so if you're in another country fascinating fascinating and someone's talking in Spanish you will hear the translation in English in real-time and you'll be able to understand what they're saying so that's what Esperanto was supposed to be once upon a time right there's gonna be the common language we would all learn it and because we would speak it there would be no more Wars and no more awful things they thought and this is this is the digital Esperanto that I forgot about that well that's that that was a well Esperanto has been around for longer than this but I mean the big push came after the first world war was over and the League of Nations was formed and they were trying to figure out how do we never have a world war again we have to understand each other first of all and you know what if you could understand all the speeches and all the demagogues in all these other countries right that's a giant issue mean the Tower of Babel is but yeah yeah totally and that is a real issue I can't read Korean you know I don't know what they're saying I look at Russian language I'm like guys these guys are really crazy yeah it's all it's all problem because the lack of communication is one of the things that makes it easier for us to look at people as the other yes yeah and listen that's that's the common problem because when people look at these regimes listen we'll take the standard one you talk about the Nazis but there's a bazillion regimes like that the first thing you do is you have to dehumanize the people you want to go after because obviously we have human feeling towards each other but if you can say something and I think this is what's been most depressing for me is that we seem to be backsliding on how we see people but I mean this idea that well for example one of the things I see all the time all the time and I don't know where it comes from on Twitter and everywhere else is this idea that the different races are inferior to white folks because white folks built all this and therefore we must and you try to go okay one how is that helpful to is that even true three so what so I mean there's so what part is we just go okay are you doing anybody any good with this I mean what are we at and truthfully I don't think most human beings think like this we're trying to make a living we're trying to get by we're try to get a date we're trying it you don't mean there's bazillion things you have to do in this life the idea that you have to be responsible for pushing back racism in America seems a heck of a lot of responsibility to put on an average Joe or Jane well I think that these conversations are very very important and I think we're having them more so than ever before and these conversations show how ridiculous it is to have blind allegiance towards people that have the same amount of melanin as you do it's so fucking stupid all human beings essentially either came from actually some speculation that some of them might have come from Europe thousands of years ago as well but we're talking about hundreds of thousands years ago the very first Homo sapiens they believed came from Africa everybody migrated out of there and moved wrong we essentially came from the same source so all this idea of race is just based on a particular amount of time in a particular climate that forced people to adapt to that climate in the colder darker climates you see paler skin in the sunnier hotter climates you see more melanin and the idea that these people that live with have more pale skin are superior than the people that have more melanin it's just patently stupid it's just it's a dumb idea if you take into account all the socio-economic factors that cause people to live certain ways people that are isolated that live in certain tribal traditions the these things are all easily explained and if you want to chalk it off to intelligence or the superiority of the white race in 2017 you're a fucking moron and this is a it's a good thing that we can have these conversations so you can expose these all these Charlottesville people that you see walking around with fucking swastika tattoos like Jesus Christ you fucking dummies those people that were involved in that those riots and all that racial bullshit that just went on these people they need to see the reaction that the rest of the world has them they are isolated and insulated in their weird little worlds and when they go global with that shit and they march of those tiki torches down the street and people mock them and talk shit about them openly online they get to understand how the rest of the world sees this ridiculous ideology that they subscribe to this is the power of free expression and communication that we're experiencing in 2017 and this is the power to nip a lot of this shit in the bud if we can get past this tribal nonsense that we're all taking part of this truck we're doing there's tribal nonsense that's male versus female there's tribal nonsense it's white versus black there's a tribal nonsense that's left versus right there's nationalism there's all this tribal stupidity and all of this stuff is is being debated and exposed and it's happening in real time and into you and I can't happen quick enough it still still too goddamn slow it's still too frustrating the idea that it's still around is still mind-boggling this kind of racism this open blatant racism still exists in 2017 but it's way less prevalent than it was a thousand years ago it's way less accepted than it was 2,000 years ago and I think that's a blip in time as you know but probably better than anybody that I know yeah but I you know it's funny because I there's a part of me that thinks that there must be something deeply embedded in the DNA or our code or whatever that that because it's either that or people run into this stuff and it appeals to them so let's say you know the first time you ever hear a speaker and look let me let me draw a distinction because when we - I'm one of those people that actually buys into the idea of you know I'd love to get to a place where we judge people by the content of their character not the color of their skin but let's not pretend that it's only the white supremacist types that do that know we are so hung up on race that if you could say something like in 15 years we are going to be a society that doesn't even notice race well in 1968 folks like Martin Luther King might have thought that that was a great thing today a lot of people would be like no wait wait wait wait we should still be noticing race for all the you know these people need help or the I guess what I'm saying is is that there's a pendulum and and I'm looking at this I feel like we're right in the middle of this right now so it's so hard to analyze it yeah so everybody take this with a grain of salt but but I wonder if there's not a pendulum involved so for example I tend to buy into most of the theories for example about racism that have always been put out there but I think some are less helpful than others and I think they what here is you know maybe an example and I think they come from academia because I think this is sort of what academics do it and the think that's their job but a lot of times they'll come up with theories so one of the ones that drives me crazy is white privilege okay-y privilege is true in the sense that like like one african-american guy said to me he said I would love to forget about race but white people won't let me write which isn't it he says every morning I wake up and we're reminded and you don't have to deal with that I get that and I and I approve and I understand it i but here's my problem you have to be able to see how telling somebody that you were born with something that you didn't earn is going to be received on the other side right there are some people that have become these white supremacist types or anti racial group because they're so upset about their perceived position right like somehow you're blaming me for something that happened to now true or not it doesn't matter I always tell people is it doesn't matter what's true or not it matters how that person reacts and if if you're explaining to them that listen you're born with all these unearned privileges and their reaction is I'm starving here I don't have a job I'm living in a crappy how can you tell me that then it might prompt and again I'm analyzing from within the Maelstrom that we're in now but that might be a reaction counter reaction thing to say that we could have a society where you judge people on the content of their character not the color of their skin that might be is upsetting for an african-american activist as a white supremacist because this society right now pays really close attention to your race for all kinds of reasons I mean I'm one of those people that believes we're all gonna be a nice tan color someday you know um and so it's a moot point but there are people out there who literally think it's life or death if we do become a tan people at one point right we have to preserve this race or this piano I don't get any of that that seems foolish but it's it's very it's consistent with the way human beings evolved yeah tribal is the perfect short lived in these small groups of people right we looked like each other and when we saw these blond-haired dudes pull up in boats with battle axes you're like oh shit they don't even look like us fuck we got to get out of here that's literally what you had to worry about I mean you had to worry about someone who was the other well and again we forget in this time and place that the other didn't happen to be a skin color thing I mean you could be the shark the Carolingian Empire that's being attacked by the Vikings and to an outside observer you all look like a bunch of blond-haired blue-eyed guys but to them the Vikings are the other and in a tribal sense there is inferior and awful and barbaric as anything you can think of so we make the distinction now based on this or that visual thing yes but throughout history like you said I mean you could go to China and they have all sorts of different peoples in China that they recognize as the other but if you look at him they all look Chinese to you well here's a perfect example where we have a blind spot of this was in Iraq when we took over and killed Saddam Hussein and overthrew him and then the Sunnis and the Shia's went into a full-scale yeah everybody's like whoa whoa what the fuck is going on I thought you guys were all Muslim so many people had no idea there was to competing sects of Muslims that lived in that area they have no idea there was no what the struggle we may be talking about the population as a whole but but come on the people and the government understood this I mean this is why the first George Bush didn't want to go in and and topple Saddam Hussein directly the way the Second Gulf War did because he didn't want to own that mass uh and we knew that those groups were there because we were encouraging them and funding them to overthrow I mean we there was a big Sunni Shiite rebellion against Saddam at one point after the first Gulf War which we were funding and hoping for the Kurds have been for a long time our friends and we've been pushing for something there less than a state but more than what they had under Saddam because the Turks don't love them and not well whenever you overthrow a dictator you leave a power vacuum and that power vacuum is never filled in a nice and calm and democratic way I mean look what's going on in Libya Libya is now a failed state faster yeah and it is like a breeding ground for Isis and it's the the reason why is because you had this tyrannical dictator and we had him killed we had Qaddafi killed which is another great piece of evidence I used to point to with people with Hillary Clinton like watch the interview where she is about to be interviewed she's still on camera but they they're not it's not if any of you hasn't officially started and she's talking about the death of Qaddafi and she's laughing she's like we Came we saw he died yeah that's right that's right and she's laughing this is not the kind of Cavalier mindset you ever want to see in someone that possesses the power to overthrow a government and someone who possesses the power to wield nuclear weapons this is a person who's a Chicken Hawk you're completely shielded from the idea of actually engaging in actual visceral combat yourself your your outside in in flying around in jets having catered food you're in war rooms making decisions while you're in air-conditioned buildings it's all bullshit and these these decisions that you make have massive repercussions for decades if not centuries I mean what here's the thing that you talked about that I think is incredibly important in the wrath of the cons when Genghis Khan took over Baghdad Baghdad essentially was knocked into the fuckin Stone Age and might not have ever recovered that's true anyways they and and he just the Mongols destroyed the irrigation system that had been a from time immemorial and would and how complicated and and advance their civilization was at the time when the Mongols showed up and did all this how few people knew this I I think the question of asking about dictators is really important because I think sometimes you have to ask how much of the fact that the country is held together is only because there's a dictator so we'll use the Yugoslavia example because it's pretty classic for those who don't know Yugoslavia is it was a country made up of a bunch of different independent countries now and they didn't necessarily get along as a matter of fact it's some of the oldest ethnic hatreds in Europe when you talk about Serbs and Croats and Kosovars and Bosnian Muslims and Albanians and all the people in that area they're historically at odds but under certain governments Tito after the Second World War formed a government where he essentially ruled with an iron fist but that's how you kept all these people from killing each other so when you say Iraq is not even a real country because if you didn't have an iron-fisted dictator holding it together it wouldn't be together right so then when you take the one linchpin as awful and Saddam Hussein was awful awful I'll give you a book to read that will just you have to it's the only book I've ever read that I had to read another book afterwards before I went to bed at night because it was so horrible Wow so he's it's it's called the great war for civilization by Robert Fisk but he he's a reporter on the scene he would tell you what what has scrawled on the walls and the prisons at Saddam Hussein's prisons that the the prisoners would write in their own blood it's horrible stuff but the point is is that if there hadn't been a regime like that would you have even had an Iraq so if you say to yourself okay this guy is the only reason this country's held together what if you pull out that linchpin right and if you say he's horrible yes but if you could look into the crystal ball and find out yes but we're gonna lose a million people in warfare between all these people if you pull the Saddam Hussein character out of there too quickly it's like a giant Jenga game and if you put the wrong piece you know and that's what happened right oh and it's still happening it's it's tough listen Iran is the next I mean they're they're really gunning for lack of a better word for Iran and you can see it if you know how to read the news and you connect this dot with that dot it doesn't provide a clear picture what do you say they do you mean the United States military Unites States government and our friends and why are they gonna after Iran well Iran has been our our net naughty boy list since 1979 they used to be our best friend in the region even even better than Israel early on because the Israeli relationship really got tight after like 73 74 but Iran we overthrew a government there with the British Kermit Roosevelt was one of the people involved in that and overthrew a democratically elected regime under dr. Mohammad Mossadegh put the Shah back in power his son and that became our little you know we had if you look at geopolitics it's all sort of like playing a risk game you know and you want to have a little territory on this side of the of the of the continent and another one on this side and have places so if you have Turkey as a friend and you have Israel as a friend then on the other side you have Iran as a friend I mean we had this whole area sussed for a while and the 1979 revolution screwed everything up and you could make a decent case that it's since 1979 that all this crap that we're dealing with today including modern terrorism directed at us stems from all that I mean that's the domino that begins tumbling that explains a lot of things including the 8283 Lebanon involvement and all that stuff yeah it just seems like such a global mess when you look at all the potential pieces that are in place that could cause chaos its money though dude its money I mean there's so much you know I went to it I've said this before and it's like a violation probably at Mya of what I've said I would do but I mean I went to as percent calm meeting I was invited to this weird US Central Command I thought it's I'll tell you the story one time because it was guy I thought they were gonna kill me if there was an assassination attempt and you know I'm not a real spirit seanut but the whole story was really funny but long story short I end up at this Central Command planning meeting with 11 guys it's me and 11 other guys and Generals I mean it was chaired by the guy who's the defense secretary now mattis so we sat there and they started talking about half of it was well what do you think we ought to do about this that or the other thing and the second half blew my mind because the whole second half of the meeting was about procurement now procurement sounds boring what it basically means is buying stuff military stuff and the meeting was kind of about how important it was that that countries don't start shifting over from say our tanks to another country's tanks and it wasn't because we wanted to sell them tanks it was because we wanted to sell them spare parts for the tanks it's the old printer model right we'll give you the foreign age sure we'll give you a lot we're gonna defend you'll send all this stuff free yeah but then who do you have to call for the spare parts right right if you're using US jets well who's making the parts for those that who's selling them so when you sit there and realize how much money's involved you're doubling down in the place like the Middle East right you're doubling down because one you want to get the oil or you want to have you want to you want to negate what's called um used to be called petrol extortion petrol blackmail because in the 70s and you and I are old enough to remember this when you had the long gas lines and all this when OPEC punished countries like the United States for supporting Israel the first thing you realize when somebody can do that to you is oh my god job number one has to be make sure no one can ever do that again you can't you can't control our foreign policy by saying you'll cut off the oil because if you do that we'll just come and take the oil right we'll make sure you can't shut down the Western world because you don't like our policies ok I understand that a bit but then you you say ok not only are we in there for the oil but these countries that are our friends in the region who help who help keep open access to the oil these are places that should be using us equipment and if they're using us equipment we can sell them us spare parts so you're you're not only keeping the oil access which is important to us but you're also keeping the one industry in this country we still made make a ton of money in which is we still sell great military equipment and great military parts and we send our advisers and our maintenance crews in every place all over the world to to keep that stuff in running operation that's doubling down so you get the oil and you get the spare parts that you give away to them to protect the oil so you're in this meeting with these people how how'd you do ok well I'll tell the story because it's a fun story but it goes so so we get you know how it is we get email we get an email one day and we get a letter to our mailbox the letter looks like some what were you doing at the time get the podcast just you know what we do so they just said hey come on down we want to kill you no no tell you about some shit you should know about well okay it even goes deeper I used to have a discussion board online and some dude came on the discussion board and was saying he was this giant hacker this famous hacker you would all know me if I told you and you know the discussion board said you're an idiot you know you don't know you and the guy left the discussion board saying I'm gonna show you what I could do you won't believe you just keep your eyes open for a couple of days you'll see what I can do so three days letter this letter three days later this letter arrives in our mailbox the same day I get an email saying we'd love to have you come over to central command and blah blah blah it looked like my daughter did it on her printer there was no like you know government seals it didn't look official at all and it was in Florida I'm going okay this is this hacker dude this is what he was gonna do right so so it says it's got a phone number to call so I called the phone number and it doesn't even ring once and a machine picks it up and just this leave a message at the beep no I'm going tell my wife what the hell is this so I leave a message at the beep I hardly put the receiver down boom rings and somebody's on the other line and it's a guy with a German accent I'm going what it's like some weird bad movie right and he goes no no this is all legit don't worry you just show up at the airport there'll be a ticket waiting for you you take it to Washington DC there'll be a car waiting for you and I looked at my wife and I said but this hackers just gonna take a photo of me at the airport standing there like an idiot and then put it on the website she says just go to the airport when there's no ticket we'll know it's a scam so I go to the airport that's so crazy dude I wish I was talking okay so there's a ticket right through the ticket so now I got my back I guess I'm going to DC from Eugene Oregon so I get on the plane I get off the plane there's no car so I called my wife I said there's no car this is all a scam I don't know what this is a heck of a lot of trouble to go through to scam me right right okay so she gets a call from the German dude in Florida he's at the wrong gate go to this other gate so I go to this other gate a town car pulls up with a middle-eastern driver yes get in the car so I get in the car and he starts driving through like side streets in the backwoods of Virginia or something so I'm on the phone with my wife going if you never hear from him again I see a couple of landmarks here or whatever he drops me off at this hotel in DC I still haven't I don't know what I'm doing I don't know why I walk up to the front desk and I go do you have a reservation oh yes mr. Carlin hold on and they come back with this packet this is they handed me this is your homework for tomorrow morning and night I go what I go up to the room I open up this pan it's all legit long story short it's all and there's people that this meeting you're not allowed to say but there's people that if they sat next to you would know exactly who they are and so I get to the meeting and it's it's all like pentagonal everything's confiscated at the door and you get this military guy who walks with you everywhere so if you have to go to the bathroom this dude has to walk to the bathroom with you and so it's a table in this room and mattis is at the head of the table and then a bunch of soldiers standing in there like a circle around the table just sort of standing there so you've got like a cordon of soldiers and I'm sitting down there with all these other people and I have no idea why I'm there so I open up the packet and it's everybody at the meeting and everybody's got like three pages on their bio this the Honorable did order and did I open it up and then there's this little teeny piece of paper this is Dan Carlin podcaster they went to like Wikipedia which is all wrong anyway and printed it and I thought oh yeah these August people of this meeting are so excited to be at this meeting with Dan Carlin podcaster right so the meeting goes on for a while and then it breaks up and all these people know each other so they go off in their little corners to start talking during the lunch break I don't know anyone I'm sitting at this table by myself and this officer comes up and goes I bet you wonder why you're here I said yeah I really would love to know why I'm here because that's my fault he goes I'm the one he goes we listen to the show he goes we're looking for out this was all about getting outside our opinions on what you should do in the Middle East and he goes it was my okay but here's the here's the other thing I was outsider opinions on what you should do in the Middle East let's contact that guy does a history partner right but it's a little but it's little I am about to DC yeah but here's your tax dollars at work okay but it's it's it's it's it's a little bit more sneaky than that because I was there with a guy who knows how this all runs another guest and we took the taxi cab to this place together and he's a real cynical and he goes let me tell you why you're here this is all a cover I go what do you mean it's a cover he goes it's a cover because these guys are required by law to solicit outside opinions for some of this stuff so that's what we're here we're gonna give you and what they're gonna say is they're gonna do exactly what they were gonna do anyway but they'll be able to say we should listen to the outside opinion from all these different people so I think that's what it was what law is it they're ours and I don't know but apparently they were supposed to think outside the box and they invited and I was like I was like David I don't know but I was the real outlier all these other people made sense I was the guy that was like okay they're really getting crazy you wearing a suit or were you dressing like that with a bit awareness shoot you were there's a last time I wore one it's funny because they take this like commemorative photo of you at the end and then they say you can't show this photo to anybody why are you taking it so I could show my wife can you put it on the wall in your house oh no it's on the wall in my house now so when you're standing there do you have like a badge on yeah hi my name is Dan Carlin or it just says Dan Carlin and then there's the dude who stands behind you the whole time then what does it say Dan Carlin hardcore history what does it say I don't know I'll show you it's on my phone I'll show you later Wow but but it was one of those get-togethers where you just I really wasn't as prepared as I should have been because I was pretty darn sure the whole thing was a hoax right you know I mean first of all if you're gonna send me a letter can it look like a letter that the US does it have to look like something were you printed the label on your you know brother label maker printers they always want to leave maybe they have multiple filters to leave in the possibility of plausible deniability and the German guy by the way what turned out to be like a West German general that was was cooperating with the US government as part of an exchange program but I mean the whole thing seemed like I just thought it was this hacker dude figuring out he's gonna really embarrass me in front of the whole forum you know oh wow this is Dan Carlin at the airport thinking he's going to Washington DC some Operation Paperclip type shit that zangoose knock him over there and dumped him into a Virginia swamp wow that's fascinating man so did they solicit your opinions did they talk to you about things today all I can say is that both both mattis and his um his aide which was Vice Admiral Harwood they are generals these days are so good at PR cuz do you you get this wonderful thank-you note where they go oh so great to have you here's here's my please contact us if you and you're thinking - I mean that's it's like a PR thing yeah and I mean I do think there's a little bit of the PR involved and I think it has to be having the podcaster there might have been good for PR well for sure maybe they thought it shut me up with my criticism right bring you on in the inside your one hour buddies you have to be quiet remember when Dennis Miller became buddies with George Bush yeah jokes about George Bush he's my friend I give him a pass like what yeah exactly a fucking comic pal what are you doing yeah it's um that's a fascinating thing that they would bring you over there so you got to meet mattes mm-hmm not only was he cool um but he knows his history which you know I have a soft heart but he was talking about you know we're talking about the Middle East and he's talking about the history of this in history of that and and I'm sitting here going and you know I know that history pretty well in that and I was sitting there going don't they call him the warrior monk I mean he said he was I found him fascinating and I thought he really understood what I always hoped these people understand which is the limits of power so you would say mattis was very good about saying listen we can't keep doing this and we can't keep doing that and I thought to myself that's right I don't know how much the presidents listen but I mean I remember thinking Madison's right about that well I think he is listen and there was my friends that are in the military almost all of them universally were very pleased that madness was taking over yeah he's popular especially yeah he's popular extremely popular because they feel like they finally have support now they felt like they were handcuffed during the Obama administration and that there was this you know you had to go almost through a PR firm before any decisions were made they had to like consult the ramifications boom was like that - yeah they said Lyndon Johnson was picking the specific bombing targets but but here's the problem you have if you realize and if you don't you're an idiot that you will actually hurt your long-term goals if for example you hit a school and kill 200 little children you realize listen the whole policy is really held hostage by the potential for a disastrous mistake because if the goal is to win hearts and minds and listen you're not gonna that's the only way to win this kind of thing then you do damage to the goal with a mistake and mistakes in war are inevitable so everybody I think is just trying to be really careful but it's hard to fight a war really carefully and this war is particularly weird when it comes to that because of the use of drones the use of drones has changed but the entire idea of what war is because if you look at what happened during the Obama administration this is one of the things that people don't like to talk about that are supporters of Obama I believe the number is higher than 80% of innocent civilians that were killed by drones it's I think it's more than 80-percent imagine any sort of technique in war or anything else how about policing let's just go for policing imagine if there were some criminals that were holed up in a building and you had a hundred people in the building and 20 of them were criminals and you killed everybody so you killed 80 people that were just secretaries and plumbers and just folks doing their job living their life children their families you killed all those people to get to those 20 people everyone would freak the fuck out if you did it physically yourself you ran in with a machine gun and gun to everybody down you just I had to kill everybody there's the only way to get to the bad guys nobody would nobody would forgive you and it would be front-page news and it would be a horrific crime but it happens constantly when it comes to drone warfare in Yemen in parts of the world that we're not even supposed to be a war with we're sending these flying robots they shoot something called Hellfire missiles like Jesus Christ they're shooting Hellfire missiles at these these targets that they're looking at a screen and they're often in like the Midwest I mean that's where some of these things you know what it is though it's all part of it listen there's a there's a term and you military guys listening you all know what it's called are em a real revolution in military affairs and our MA periods in time happens so you imagined that the period between no gunpowder and the mass use of gunpowder weapons that's an RM a period in history right but normally what appears to be fast like the transition from no gunpowder to gunpowder is really relatively slow by modern standards so you have several generations to get used to the changes but the speed of the pace of change now is so quickly that by the time you begin to say okay we've been using the current weapons systems and set up for five years now we think we're starting to understand it it's obsolete right what I said and this is so long ago that we've been podcasting a long time Joe but I remember years and years ago when we first started using these drones I said we're gonna screw this up because we're using them the same way the United States used atomic weapons which is as though no one else will ever get them right we are establishing the rule and when other people get this stuff those are going to be the rules they operate under - but our attitude and I've never understood this but we have a very maybe it's the maybe it's how Democratic Republic's work in the sense that we can only really think short-term because the politicians are only rewarded short-term but I mean if you say listen these are the goals of our drone program for the next five years you're not incorporating what's gonna happen when China gets drones yeah and if and what I said at the time is you know how mad we're gonna be if another major country uses drones the way we're using them now exactly and it's the same thing with nuclear weapons once other countries got nuclear weapons we backed off and what oh well we have to have some rules governing this now we well but when we were the only ones with them we would threaten and use them all the time yeah no you better not do that we'll nuke you easy to say when you're the only ones with it so when you talk about the drone warfare I would suggest that the problem of of collateral damage for lack of a better word is when we've been dealing with for a long time now I mean once you talk about the strategic bombing of cities first world war it started second world war it was massive then you then anything is a walk back so if you say something like yes joe rogan sure we killed those two hundred kids at that school and it's regrettable but that's an unusual thing it's not like World War two where we carpet bombed whole cities right and they're right but is that the standard we can operate with well I would suggest that the question is is does it hurt or help what you're really after if if Joe Rogan's god forbid sorry for even going here but if Joe Rogan's children were killed in a bombing raid that another country launched there is nothing that they could do to stop Joe Rogan from hating them for the rest of his life and if Joe Rogan hating them means Joe Rogan is gonna find a way to make you feel his pain you just created another enemy while you were trying to eliminate enemies this is what's so scary about terribly you just changed not just the people that were directly affected but the people that saw those ripples of pain giant yes and again all I tell people and people get offended Joe I've never interested people get offended where I say just put yourself in the other guy's moccasins for a minute right if you say because what people say to me is I had some guy get screaming mad at me saying basically he followed the Domino's saying are you saying we deserved 9/11 and I said if that's really where you took that if that's where your argument goes I said then you totally misunderstood me I'm saying no one's saying deserved but saying bill this is probably what caused it I listen why are we a target it's not it's not wrong as a matter of fact I would suggest is they only got freedom what does that even mean no it's just this while there are some people who say listen look at the way you have women on Billboard's scantily clad yes there are people that hate that and that they don't want that either at the same time in a lot of these countries you were talking about Iran earlier let's talk about Iran Iran's got two separate things going they've got the countryside and they've got the cities and they've got a ton of the population that's under 30 and in the cities they'd love to dance and they'd love to you know the Iranians are not like the you know you said they all seem like Muslims to us but they're all very different from each other and the Arabians for example are known to be kind of Spartan and stoic whereas the the Persians as they used to be called are a fun-loving food-loving dance loving I mean in their very capitalistic so in a funny way there's an and that's why we were so close to them for so long there's a natural affinity between us and I always say it would be pretty darn easy if we treated them right the same way my stepdad said you know you can destroy the the Soviet Union by dumping Elvis records porn and blue jeans on them which kind of is what happened there's a way I think to approach this Muslim world thing and let's not pretend it won't be totally destabilizing because if you drop porn blue jeans and Elvis on those countries now you're gonna have a counter-reaction with all these clearings and whatever that are freaking out but at the end of the game you won't end up looking like the bad guy if you're bombing them it's it is so hard to look like the good guy when you're bombing people you know and so if you could say to me listen Dan these are killers who want to hurt us and we've got to take them out I totally get that but then I would say to you you have to take them out in a way that doesn't screw up you know the main mission which is let's stop people from wanting to kill us right like the way they took out Osama bin Laden yeah that's a bit you know and listen what are some with that showed us too is that a lot of these people that are supposedly our friends in this war on terror aren't and we knew this the Pakistanis especially but I mean they're not really that close they're being our friends because they want the the spare parts for the tanks we gave them and all these kinds of things so I mean yeah this global warfare thing is just you got a wonder at what point in time is this ever gonna level is ever gonna normalize is it ever gonna calm down or is it what is it get us what does it get us what doesn't get us that's a song I'm war well look I nobody gets some people and this is the problem our whole country has doesn't it that that some people are able to get government to respond to them because they give government money or what-have-you and then they can get what they want but does that correspond to what we need right do we need these wars I don't know I mean when they say we need to protect the oil well you know the whole oil climate has really changed just to protect the oil the idea is to keep these people at bay so that none of them can ever consolidate and become some gigantic huge war machine that could threaten us globally you know what's again this is a military history major talking so I think differently about this but in a sense that would be so much easier for us to beat I mean the funny thing is we know how to beat big countries I'll be doing on it but if we're engaging in thermonuclear warfare nobody wins if we can stop them from ever getting to that point that's the success the success is keeping them fragmented keeping them beaten down and that if we could do that we can keep them but they are showing that they can destroy you know it's funny there's two kinds of destroy your country there's destroy your country and leave it in rubble which they can't do but there's destroy your country you know the old line is if they hate our freedoms well they did a pretty good job limiting them didn't they I mean because because we're you know fleas on a dog I mean they're like fleas on a dog and yet the dog can tear himself to pieces trying to get rid of those fleas and still not get rid of the fleas right but it's it you really I mean terrorism is so effective because it requires people to act against human nature which we can do as individuals but it's very tough to get us all collectively to not act like human beings it requires us to act against our nature which is you punched me I'm punching you know right and in a funny way it requires us to be punched and to not punch back I think but how does that work right is it there's a book by mark Kerr Lansky who's a who's a leftist for sure so just know going into what you're dealing with but it's a book on non-violence and he's trying to point out something which I've always tried to point out to non-violence is a tactic and against certain things it's extremely effective right it's not effective against everything but sometimes it's it's a mean mark if you could do to Martin Luther King what we could do to people now his his sitting for example one of the things you young people may not know is one of the his effective protest was to go to these all-white counters in the south where they wouldn't serve black folks and just sit at the counter and wait to be arrested and then when he was arrested Time magazine would be there to get and there's a great photograph of him you know being handcuffed just for the audacity of sitting at a soda counter right and it was very powerful but it was powerful because you saw violence initiated against somebody who was totally peaceful right if today you could go up to him and just tase him or do something that that that was not physically violent then he wouldn't get what he needed out of that which is he needed that photograph of him being physically manhandled for the simple or like thought to change subjects it's the same subject but like the pictures that were coming out when I was a kid you could open up those giant Life magazine books were the great photos of Lightman and one of them was famous it was a black protester in the South of Alabama or Mississippi and he's standing there with his arms at his side not resisting at all and the police officer has sicked a German Shepherd on him who was biting him right and you look at yourself right thing you go okay that photograph right there motivated so much public opinion in a different direction but what if they didn't need to use a dog or a water cannon what if they could have just injected you from behind the guy falls limp and you just carry him off silently well you just diminished his power to make a dinner oh yeah that's it that's it right there and you know look how powerful that is but it's powerful because some guy is being violently attacked who appears to be knew nothing more than asking you know for his rights now if you didn't have that violence does that somehow change the message and make it less powerful they could have just injected him quietly taken him off to jail this doesn't happen and this made a big difference yeah that's a very powerful photograph well it's people who aren't there get a chance to understand the barbaric nature of this we'll see you're literally getting attacked by an animal that's on a leash and why well I was gonna say you would say well what did that guy do if he just murdered somebody we're all going okay well that's what you get pal but if all he's doing is saying do I really have to sit at the back of the bus in 1965 or something it this this kind of thing motivated a lot of people but if you you know it's like 60 minutes did a great piece I want to say 1990 to 1993 where they were showing all of the new anti protester weapons that were in development and what's funny is several of them have arrived one of them is the sonic cannon which they deployed against anti New World Order protester types to you isn't that what they used against people that were in Cuba wasn't that something I know there's a there's a rumor that there was something used in people that hasn't been figured out yet but this was the sonic cannon thing where you can target right but something got you yeah and some people well some people said the Matt's in Cuba right yeah they will they said they lost their hearing or something and they assumed it was the government that did yeah they were fucked up like what the they couldn't physically hear it is that what it was something like that's not working jamming ayran but your see if you could pull that up and figure imagine instead of that powerful that made a difference imagine if you could have just aimed the sonic cannon and and people leave because it's painful well does that reduce the value then of that nonviolent protest that was so powerful well this is what they're doing this right here this is this is really weird so a group of American diplomats in Havana Cuba have suffered severe and unexplained hearing loss over the past year which US officials believe was caused by a covert and advanced sonic device so this is something that we're not even aware of yeah but we have those devices that's why they might know well but do they just not want to comment on that we possess these things well we know we've deployed them rip into this one they don't know what this one is right so they should know anyway the device admitted a sound that was not audible to human ears they added it would indicate that it was most likely an infrasonic or ultrasonic weapon infrasonic weapons can cause physical pain without detection though they usually target the entire body then rather just the eardrums Wow how fucking bizarre that's like it's a different hydrogen bomb the different kind of crowd control though you know and if you know for example the famous Gandhi salt march which which is considered one of the big moments in non violent history where he had all of his supporters walk into the clubs of the authorities and he told them don't resist at all you just go down and then let the next row get hit - and then the next because that was a powerful sign of you know who's right and who's wrong in this whole thing but if you could just deploy that sonic cannon and all those people had so much pain in their ears they just had to leave and nobody got beaten there was no blood there was no dogs there were no water cannons does that undercut the power of non-violent protest to make change it's fascinating that that might have been in the minds of the people who designed this thing right well it's so abstract the idea of this sonic weapon that you don't hear but that affects your hearing and it causes injury to your body but you don't hear it like the that's not gonna affect us because it doesn't it's not bad right a bat that hits a person I understand it that where you get a picture afterwards that you can circulate look what they did to me well remember the Chicago Convention in 68 that everybody you know where the protesters were beaten so badly on television and all that stuff um if you didn't have to beat them does it lose a lot of its power if you just deploy the sonic cannon and everybody goes away cause it hurts it seems to me like you would have just diffused one of the most important movement I would call that one of the big political things that happen in the United States in the past 50 years and if you didn't if there was no actual violence right it's not a thing he isn't it fascinating that we have to see something where we go oh I know what that is that's bad yeah and then everybody gets outraged and then then change happens isn't that how the Arab Spring stay right that's the thing about drones right it's that we're not there right right the reasons why you can justify this is it's not actually done by a human who's on the premises there was talk during the big bombing campaigns of the Second World War when they were talking about the morality this and Churchill famously saw the movies showing some of these German cities just leveled and he said are we beasts now this is the guy who ordered it right when he actually saw what happened well the guy I grew up next door to was it was almost an astronaut but he was a fighter pilot and he but they conducted bombing runs and in Korea and Vietnam and stuffin and he said to me if you actually had to see the people we killed he goes we wouldn't have done this but you didn't have to see them there was there was a distance in him and there's a book called on killing by a US Army psychologist David Grossman his name where he talks about killing in terms of distance everything is distance so there's intimacy range that's when you're killing somebody with a knife close up and then the farther away you get the easier it is to do the deed he says and the less you and the less damage you have later technologic isn't there an analogy to social media here about people that yes maybe evil cruel shit to people it's actually a good connection and they can't do it in person or what are you doing in person wouldn't it wouldn't even be in your character do a person that's not even in york in other words you almost have like a a dual character that comes out when you know you don't you don't have to see this person and truthfully all I really want from Joe Rogan is to answer to answer me and the best way he can answer me as if I call him something you know well anybody who does anything negative where the public is aware of it like say this Luisi case thing or something like that where you can immediately find and target that now I have a reason to go after this person there's a it's it's a it's an acceptable target it's an agreed-upon target and then people from all over the world could just pour their vitriol and anger and bitterness and whatever it is because they have some sort of a righteous anger that thinkable there's a reason I can be angry at this person or I saw what Kathy Griffin did when she held up that head of Donald Trump I have a reason now I mean I'm not standing up for Kathy Griffin because I think what she did was stupid but she was just devastated by that I mean they went after her like death threats and hate and anger Joe you've taught me a lot about the whole social media thing though because I would come in here the audience doesn't know this but I would have questions about that stuff and you've thought more about this than I have and you were able on several of coltd you were you know I mean cuz I try to make sense of this stuff and like I said you're farther along I think the road of thinking about some of this stuff and it gave me some shortcuts but I mean I do because I think it's a fascinating phenomenon because it's never been available and when did people ever have this kind of power right your average guy locked in his basement you never goes out but he can still talk to the world that's the problem we have the stereotype of this loser in their basement which is not good no it could be a guy with a family who's at work yeah and he's just his wife yeah or is why his kids anybody just saying horrible shit I mean this just there's so many options for people to be nasty to each other and this absence of social cues absence of like being in the physical presence of someone it's this is an alien way of communicating it's not normal it's one of the reasons why I always hated letters because people could write some like I'd get letters from an ex-girlfriend I'm like what are you talking about this is not you this is a bullshit depiction of our relationship you've made this romanticized idea of what this is all about like I don't like letters because someone can't be there to go wait what that didn't happen yeah did no don't you remember you said this oh yeah you know there's a physical proximity question too like you're not gonna go up to this guy and say this stuff to his face cuz you might knock you in the head if you don't think about a letter is maybe if someone is an honest person they can express themselves in a letter in a way that they would have a difficult time do some people to feel embarrassed or they have when you're writing something you have the opportunity to really think about your work and edit and go over it and then decide this actually represents my real thoughts and you don't as imperfect as it is send it but when you can do that any moment of any day with your phone in the middle like someone's talking yeah hold on a second hold on a second fuck you fucking as well just these athletes or celebrities getting with with what was obviously I'm just about to board the planes all just and boom they get off your plane and there's a huge firestorm cuz yeah because something was taken wrong or not the way you meant it sure yeah yeah I mean it's a weird time and I think this is I think we're at an adolescent stage of communication that's what I think I think we went through all these rudimentary steps right we went through grunts and then we had verbal language and then we had written language and then we had the printing press and then we had the ability to broadcast and then we had a social media the ability for anybody to broadcast and I think as we move into augmented reality and what I've been thinking about more and more is this rosetta stone idea this idea that we're going to come up with some sort of a way of communicating ideas that's not limited and restricted to language as a military history fanatic do you know what I instantly think of I instantly think of the fact that could you start a war if one country's average Joes and Janes on social media or whatever passes start really disagreeing in their thousands and tens of thousands and 50 thousands with people in another country because could the Russian people via social media anger the American people via social media to such a degree that countries get pulled into conflict I don't it's never been possible so you can't no but but but you turn around and go that would be an interesting that you you point out quite correctly that we're essentially guinea pigs here right now yes which is what I tried to explain to my daughters that we are we are in an era where we are seeing what happens when you hand humanity these tools that they've never had before and there's two ways of looking at the optimistic one with this is gonna free up open up all or the pessimistic ones would say maybe something like Ken our representative democracy handle this and not because we can't handle communication but maybe like you would say the kind of communication that we have where these are little teeny we're not have a deep you know philosophical coffeehouse Ben Franklin kind of Commerce we're having a hundred and forty character discussions what can you say in 140 characters other than you're an idiot you're wrong it's baby news you know and then swearing to 280 now I'm sure that will make all the difference clear my I can't clear my throat 140 characters love me I think it's gonna cause a shift I really do I believe that the shift from 140 to 280 will make people it'll give people the opportunity to be more clear with their ideas I will say that it's disheartening for a person like myself who enjoys depth because you know the history shows are so long because I enjoy the depth to see people confronted with like a page of text going off too long to read but you do go okay can you really be a useful citizen as a voting member this informed citizenry and do your job if you see a page of Texaco I mean the Constitution today would have to be 140 characters you know for for most of the people today to go okay I'll sit down and read that well one of the things that your podcast has done that's amazing is giving people information in a very entertaining form that they would never sit down and read a book about there's a ton of people probably me included that have never read as much about Genghis Khan as I got from your podcast but you would see and this is what I hope for because we always say III don't I like the idea of being an appetizer from evil on history if I introduced somebody to the Mongols and then they went you can go to our website we put all of the materials we use and we link directly to a place where you can get them so if you actually went out and bought some books on the Mongols after that or or that created an intellectual relationship between you and the Mongols where for the rest of your life ooh this is a Mongols they found jingis Khan's tomb or something you're into it because you know but well I mean that's awesome yeah in terms of I mean I heard I got a great letter this is the highlight of my career was this letter from the wife of a historian that we used in the World War one series and she wrote me this letter saying you have no this is like very self-serving but you have no idea what you're doing because history is something that not a lot of people were getting interested in and now we have people showing up in the classrooms becoming history majors because they got interested in what you read so if we're poking people with the stick and getting them interested in the subject you know how cool it would be to have that you know when you're when you're all dead and gone and somebody says what did you do he said we got a lot of people really interested in history I think that's the coolest thing in the world what we were talking about this whole new media will it be good meeting me bad and it's probably gonna be both right but the idea that people could get interested in history again because some idiot and his garage was talking about it I think it's not gonna be everybody but it's gonna be a lot of people and for those people it is gonna have a profound effect and me included and I think that this new media this thing where nobody is telling you hey Dan it's time to do a podcast on blank it's time to you know cut back this edit that you're doing it based on your interests you're not it wouldn't have been this show if we'd had yet there was anybody else in this show that's why I ever been able to pull this off never not in a hundred years it's what we have is this unique opportunity to express ourselves in like with a with a personal viewpoint like this is your personal interest it's in Jersey there's a pure you it's the difference between blended whisky and like a single malt where where if like when I get these TV offers and you've had zillions of them where you go when you talk to these people and you realize instantly if I go do this with them they're gonna homogenize it dumb it down but they're gonna check and you sit there and go they're gonna make something far inferior to what I'm able to do myself because they really don't understand why it works in - in other words like you said you couldn't have been able to do this show it's funny to me that the industry for example doesn't realize what it is that people like about what you do and figure out a way to you know they're not open-minded enough to say listen show coming to this TV show which is a lot like what you do I don't get it I don't understand how people like you and people like me and all the people to do what we do haven't created more of an understanding in the old media I think they're getting it do you think well eventually there's no way to avoid it they're getting it now because I see like when I get offers for things I understand things like oh they're trying they're seeing what I'm doing and they're going hey we want a piece of this yeah how do we and then but if you do can they pull it off I mean it would be the same thing this is the problem if they did this it's like save say hey we want to put your podcasts on blah blah blah Network okay well now I have a bunch of people that I'm talking to that I have to run things by now I am Zack yeah of a bunch of people to say I just think that if you dress nicer yep and then oh Jesus okay now now it's not me I'll tell you story so finally the TV people they're always promising things right you can do it any way you want you so of course so finally one of these companies did it so many times I said okay I'll go forward with you and we'll start with this project great so I'm in a particular US city in the south and we're cutting this sizzle reel and I said now this is going to be hardcore right you got me you want hardcore history yes we all History Channel well everybody wants it okay so I said so here's what we're gonna do so the the the sizzle reel was on the bombings in the late 60s early 70s of like the the new left so The Weather Underground and all those people right so I'm gonna do this and I said I said the hardcore history way to do this though is to imagine that era with today's anti-terror laws and the way we treat terrorists today so we were filming like recreations of like Abbie Hoffman in his American t-shirt being waterboarded by CIA agents because if we applied to the modern anti-terror tool to the way that the Americans and they flipped out they said listen mom there's a lot of red southern states that would not go for that and all these guys you wanted hardcore that's that's no they didn't really want hardcore they wanted to get me through the doors and then we're gonna make some groupthink thing you know of the group yeah no everything groupthink creativity well groupthink would be fine if you respected all the think in the groupthink they're all as good as you they don't have the sensibility that not most of these people are kids from my standpoint is an old man counters there being counters that are trying to protect their own jobs what they're worried about is the numbers we got the dailies in you're not though we got the numbers in your trending really well in 18 to 34 Dan Carlin and it's not about building an audience over the long haul like I said it's literally about the next rating you've got to jump in out of the gate big-time and you have to have billboards and a big push like if you notice anytime a show launches you'll see bill billboard like there's this new show called white famous and it's on Showtime and everywhere you go this is giant billboards for white famous they're not letting this thing build slowly they want to push it out of the gate with gun powder boom and they're hoping that with that momentum the quality of the show will add to the momentum and then you're gonna build up and a bunch of people catch on and eventually to get rolling but in order to do that they want to take away all the jagged edges smooth everything down to make it aerodynamic make everything like super homogenized mean that's what they do with every single city what they'll do to your career like the last physical fight I almost had with another adult male was a radio program director and the radio program director came into my town new and you know if you've ever been in radio when they come into town new the first thing they're gonna do is change everything is they got to put their own stamp on it or why are they there so this guy comes in and he goes we're gonna rebrand you he goes I want everyone to think of your name and think of the brand and I'm already you know brown yeah okay so here's what he said so I hate to say this because this will become a meme online that I have to live with the rest of my but it's an absolutely true story so the guy says to me he goes listen I'll imagine a billboard that says Dan Carlin he fucks chickens and I said excuse me he goes yeah I mean so that any time anybody thought of you they would think okay he's the chicken fucker and I'm going what really he really said that yes and I said I've said to him I said I said two things dude I said the first thing is I gotta live in this town right so really you want that to be the first thing people think okay the second thing is I gotta have a career after this stupid idea of yours fails right no you don't understand we're building a mental image you you'll be a household name I said yes I'll be the household name the guy who fucks chickens I said and I said fine you know he was after that I said dude do you want to step outside right now I don't mean my wife laughed at me because I'm already an old man when I'm saying that would have been great I said no this this guy was as old as I was but I mean I was so incensed and so angry that this guy would would be so cavalier with your future family I mean my fucker how are they gonna spell fucker on billboards you know what that's a really good but they might have had a super missus yes but I mean you think about that you think okay as you said this guy's career depends on him making a difference I'm just a tool in his career Yeah right so you start to realize that when you did the podcast and it's your podcast the person that you're worried about here is you and not just that the ideas that are coming from you are not just yours alone but you own them right so so when I say something that's stupid I own that it's not like some station said listen push you know I got a no fight over the OJ Simpson thing when the OJ Simpson trial is going on and everybody it's all you hear anywhere so I didn't talk about it and so they got on me about not talking about it I had a big fight and I walked into the studio and I said fine I'll talk about it I said you know what the whole topic was isn't there just too much damn OJ Simpson everywhere you go oh they were they were they were at the you know there was a window we were like zoo creatures and they had this window they could bring all the sales clients to watch us perform and I'm doing there and there's like five executives in the window just waiting til the next commercial break because we're gonna we're gonna go but I mean that's why radio was so awful for me and I didn't get fired I must have done a good enough job to stay employed but it was go home and pull your hair attention constant imagine this is a good example for people imagine if you were painting a picture you had an idea to paint the Mona Lisa right and you had a bunch of people standing over your shoulder like I make her no small exactly right you know you got her eyebrows are too bushy she looks too Italian you know like there's a bunch of fucking people if you're dealing with these things that are just essentially trying to justify their jobs I mean you're always having that whenever you're you're dealing with any sort of an executive position and one of the things that you realize is how many people are unnecessary I did Bill Simmons show you know Bill Simmons had a successful podcast and that podcast led to an HBO show and I had a great time on the show no no I like him he's very nice guy very smart guy but when I did a show I'm like there's a hundred people working here it's fucking people everywhere I get that you need cameramen I get that you need sound men but then who are all these other fuckers you got all these executive type people and office people and all these people running around I'm like you've made this way too complicated like the reason why his podcast is so successful is because it's him it's his singular vision his idea you're getting it from this person and when you know that you're getting something from a person and you like how that guy thinks then it becomes interesting but when you're not really getting it from that person you got a bunch of people holding cue cards and standing behind them and you're creating this bullshit thing well my wife said today we're in the hotel room and she turns on the TV and Ryan Seacrest is on and he like does 10,000 things a day you know multiple shows and she says I don't know how he does that that's amazing that he can do all these kinds of things I said good but how much of it's really Ryan Seacrest I mean how you you basically have to have everything ready to go when you walk in a room and who did that you know what I like listening to Ryan Seacrest like I like listening to him on the radio because it's almost like listening to an alien that tries to be like a woman who's a secretary because he does these contests like Carla call in right now and like you know have someone who calling I like then I get it work and then I can the bathroom and look at my phone hey everybody likes that all right let's neck hey you want two tickets to this all right congratulations all right Monica nice talking to you it's like he's not even a fucking human on those things it's like he's figured out a way to hit this this droning sound that resonates with the people that live in that existence with the people that are stuck in traffic and that are checking their phone every 15 minutes those are the people that are on Instagram 35 times a day you know that's the average amount of time a person looks at Instagram 35 times a day whoa whoa Ryan Seacrest fucks chickens dude chickens he would be like outrageous like that would be like that the guy who said you're gonna be the chicken fucker he'd probably listen to Howard Stern he's like this guy's outrageous we need to get Dan Cohen to be outrageous well if that is the other thing with the homogenous Asian chocolate it's always about imitating somebody who's found a good formula yeah see yeah sure and I will say this about limbo limbo is right when he says that there will be a wing in the talk radio museum devoted to him one day but but what he always says like which I find interesting is he tried to do what he does now multiple times and got fired because their attitude was what is there and we're not taking any chances with this and then he says the minute I'm successful every consultant out there is telling everybody to be just like him yeah in other words if you really and if you're a podcaster out there or thinking about doing something in the new media understand that there is something so valuable about what you specifically are bringing to the table and the minute you ask these other people what to do they're going to they don't know what's specific about they're gonna go and say well we can pull a little piece of what this person does and eventually it's not even you one of the great things I always thought about hardcore history is that over time you self-select your audience I think you do that with every podcast so you say something like okay I'm only going to talk about the stuff I'm interested in well what you know then a year later is whatever fans are listening to you it's a pretty good gauge because they're there because they like what you're so I don't have to sit there and go gosh this would be a popular topic I just do what I want to do and over time you developed an audience that likes that I also think that there's something happening when you do have this thing when you have a singular vision like one person who's who's driving this thing right and overtime I feel like people get a sense of you in a way deeper sense and just listening to your words they're chunking data yeah they're adding up all of the communication that you've had they're seeing how you ant they're analyzing how you see different scenarios they're analyzing how you how you navigate certain and they're seeing you when you're tired they're seeing when you're feeling in a great mood and then maybe they're seeing you when something bad happened you don't feel so good yeah you know there's there's and all this is like date so they get to know you and there's very they're they there there's an intimate understanding of you that it's almost impossible to get when you're hosting the Tonight Show or you're acting in a television show or doing a five-minute piece of content opposed to a three-hour piece of content yeah there's a weird thing and I think that's one of things like if people know me if you listen this podcast long enough you know me and you might not agree with me and you might think I'm wrong or I'm a blowhard but you know I'm honest right I'm this I might be wrong but I'll tell you if I think I'm wrong if I think I'm wrong I'm the first person go I think I'm wrong I'm not I'm never gonna cover that oh and you shouldn't believe people that don't think they're wrong you can't it's not good for you either the person who pulls it off it's not good for you because you know you're wrong you know you're carrying that shit around your head all the time no I always say if you think if people and this is again why why one of my current events podcast is not really happening right now because I I feel like when you're in absolutely unchartered water you can't know what's going on so that's how you feel right now yeah I think we're in unchartered I think I think it's a combination everyone everyone always thinks it's a Trump thing but to me Trump is a vector to me what you were talking about with the social media is as much a part of what makes this an absolutely unprecedented time and a bunch of other things yeah the globalization of the earth like you're saying I'm we're doing shows and hearing from people from other countries I mean all this stuff interacting together has created an absolutely unprecedented situation so maybe I just organized my thinking differently but I organized it historically and there's no way to put this into any box that's ever existed before so when I watch these talk shows or or whatever with people who have no choice at 6:00 p.m. I have to be on the air and I have to have something to say to rile the audience I'm you know they have no options they have to their gig is I know what's going on and let me tell you whereas if they were honest with themselves they either would have to say I don't know what's going on and I'm watching - or or if they really do believe they know what's going on well then you really shouldn't be listening to them at all yeah right then they're crazy no way they could there's no way they could know yeah I think we're dealing with the ramifications of a bunch of different pieces that are in play yes and I think one of those pieces that's in play and one of the reasons why you see so much bitterness and anger in social media and you know we talked about this mechanism that social media allows people to communicate in this really cruel way without experiencing that person right in front of you right but I think one of the reasons why these people have this deep-seated anger and resentment is there's a bunch of people out there that have these lives that are deeply unsatisfying because I think somehow or another through momentum and just through just things falling into place the way they are and people trying to fit their lives around the way these pieces have fallen into place there are so many people that are working all day long doing something that is deeply unsatisfying and an almost painful yeah yeah it's soul-killing soul-killing they're stuck in traffic all day and then they're stuck in a cubicle after that they they relish the time to take a shit in the bathroom and look at their phone I mean they literally do though that's a highlight of someone's day they get in traffic on the way home they get home after that they're watching television and they're fucked they have deep debt this is not like there's this soul-killing thing is not dealing in the mini food that's huge and you know what you sit there and going and you look at what people making you sit there and go you can make quite a lot of money by average joe's standards and still not be in good shape so I know people turn around make good living really good living and turn around go I'm just holding my head above water yeah and so you go okay if you're holding your head just barely what's a person making 1/3 or 1/4 of what you're making doing I mean this is really when you talk about revolutions happening and and and things going down in weird unpredictable negative ways you and we've talked about this before you let enough of your society fall into the loo class for lack of a better word winners and losers in society if you every society can suck up a certain amount of people not able to make it but if that number gets large enough revolutions happen I think so too but I think the revolution doesn't necessarily have to be violent I think the revolution can be a revolution of action and ideas and I think that there's a ton of people out there that are probably listening to this that would like to be able to do something else make furniture oh they don't want a revolution they want to do something that's not sold if you know if you make furniture you make furniture for a living and you you feel a great satisfaction out of that you sell that furniture look man for making furniture feels good if you can do that you could you could cut those corners perfectly and sand everything down nice and stain it and then it's done you get dissatisfied and you sell it to someone and that pays your bills that is infinitely more satisfying than being stuck in some fucking cubicle working for someone that you don't want to work for having to have these stupid fucking office meetings talking to people and human resources sitting down with your supervisor where they evaluate your job performance and you know you're not really you know you really need to be enthusiastic about this company this company is your future this kind of like do you like fuck kill me now you know there's a lot of people out there that would way rather do something else and I hope they understand that they can that's talking about that because we were in yeah because we've been talking about us and podcasting a new medium river but but really and I tell I give I really like to give advice cuz you know you don't want to you don't to be responsible for people acting on it and having it not turn out well but what I tell people is two things right now the United States of America the way it's built is built to help industry and corporations and companies but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be Microsoft it can be you right you got your own band and the let's talk about the furniture builder once upon a time there are huge things in your way including needing to get loans and all these other things to just start a business so you're behind the eight ball right away and the pressures on because if it doesn't work you're in debt whereas I mean we started these podcasts there's no brick or mortar I mean now you've got just the the Rogan tower it's a little bit different but once upon a time it's like in the back of your bedroom and you've got a company and it's got a show and people are listening if you make your furniture and you don't have to have a brick and mortar store but you can put a website up make it with Squarespace or one of other things and all of a sudden you have a business out of your house the freedom the satisfaction the ability to set your own hours and here's the best part the fact that if you start making a lot of money somehow you're not going to have your boss cut your Commission's I mean I knew sales guys who made so much money that their bosses cut their Commission's because you can't make more than your bosses well listen when you have your own small business the sky's the limit if you make ten million dollars you make ten million dollars yeah so I always tell people that if you can and it's not always something they can do maybe you do it on the side when you've got your regular job starting a small business now in this climate that we have right now is not only possible it's not that much of a gamble because if worse comes to worse you didn't invest a hundred thousand dollars you didn't have starting it all the time right yeah I mean that website didn't cost you that much you know the the investment for the tools you may have had already podcasting is a perfect example we make business like my buddy says we sell zeros and ones yeah that's what we do well it's been never been easier to have a website either no sir with companies like Squarespace you could develop a website you could literally build amazing website and sell your furniture and you have a free online store with it and you put to eat they have these drag-and-drop user interfaces you use photos you drag them on their size and in place boom next thing you know you've got a website so your furniture so whatever the fuck you make whether you make clothes or you're designing backpacks or there's there's a lot of people out there that have interests and they've never pursued those interests because they're fucking tired from doing some tired you're wearing sole suck it's hard to go to work and put your effort into that and then come home and then work for yourself it's very hard but I'll tell you what there's there's a part like you said there's a part of it that once you start making stuff for yourself that's self motivating right it like I told somebody to start a podcast I said the first time you get some feedback email that will kick you in the rear end to keep doing the pie if it becomes it becomes um you know life is a verb I always say and you have to actually act but by acting you change everything in your future another guy said to me it's a great line he said with podcast it's not always how many people are listening sometimes it's who they are right so my grandmother's philosophy was always that you should keep walking and talking but in her era walking and talking meant going and shaking people's hands and now you can network like through the internet and you never really shaking people's hands but you may have a podcast with only a hundred listeners but if one of those listeners is some guy somewhere else who says oh my god this guy's furniture is great or whatever I'm gonna I'm gonna maybe you can come and start giving a Pottery Barn you know what okay I mean things open up in ways that you can't predict because you started doing something and because you have legitimate passion for what you yeah and that resonates does he feel likes perience that yeah if they seat fine I mean I can't tell you how many artists that I've discovered online just through Instagram or through Twitter like saying it's a creative revolution yes you know in an amazing way and I hope and I think there's way more creative people out there than we realize oh yes absolutely and I think they would love to have some sort of an opportunity to do something like that especially like an artist someone who is an artist man there's never been a better time to be an artist because you could showcase your work and look if you send me something cool and you know you send it to me on Twitter or totally we tweet things all the time and all that takes is someone else has to see that and say wow that's amazing and then - did you do too - it just propagates to all these different peoples Instagram feeds and all these people Twitter feeds and next thing you know you've got a business and you're up and running and it's not gonna be easy and it's not gonna be quick but the job you're doing now eight easier tricky the soul-killing 180s your quickie that people think like oh how long is that gonna take oh but you know when you start out doing a podcast when we got turned down loads well that's how it works we all were there once I was there once dude when we first did it when we when Brian and I were first doing this podcast and we were doing it on like Ustream we would have 200 viewers and I wasn't doing it for money I was I was literally doing it because my my wife had gotten pregnant we had to move from Colorado back to LA and I was bummed out I was like fuck I thought I escaped I thought I got out of LA I was living in the mountains I was like this is what I want I want to be in nature I was like I don't wanna be back in this fucking hellhole like alright let's do something and so we started doing podcast just for a goof because I was doing stand-up that was all well and good how it tied into your stand-up some yeah well but it's dark my point is it didn't start out I didn't start out thinking this is gonna my income this is going to be I just did it as a passion project and I think if people have a regular day job if you could just find some one thing that you do as a passion project and just keep building on it just keep at keep watering it keep adding fertilizer keep giving it attention keep giving it focus and you can escape you can escape and you can be self-serving you could be okay you're gonna be okay I always ask people when they want to start it I like a podcast I'll say something like how many listeners would you have to have for you to care right what's and that's a magic number that's different for everybody right but but what what's great about what we do that's different from broadcasting is that there is a giant pie of people let's pretend it's a billion and if you're gonna do a podcast on science fiction comic books from the 1950s or something that has such a narrow audience they never put it on television because it's it's too narrow you will be able if you even get point oh oh oh oh one percent of that billion pie it's not only going to be a decent number of people in terms of what you would think is successful but they're going to be so enthusiastic because this is an outlet that they don't know it's like I always tell somebody if you're into Harry Potter one of the TV networks given you but there's multiple Harry Potter podcasts listen to this you wanna hear something crazy Time magazine just had some top 50 podcast thing and a buddy of mine who is angry that he wasn't on sent me some stuff about it and one of the things he said dude there's a fucking podcast on there called the Gilmore boys that's guys two guys sitting around talking about the Gilmore Girls television show there's another one called something about Richard Simmons where there's finding Richard Simmons where they're trying to figure out why Richard Simmons went into hiding what's so great about that idea though and again and you at home can learn this too what's so great about that idea is that they instantly tied their podcast to somebody who already had tons of fans yeah right so you sit there and oh I don't know who these guys are or what this but I'm a huge Richard Simmons fan so I'll listen and that's like instant audience isn't it's another podcast called guys we fucked these girls cramp came up with this podcast this is one that I always use in his example because these who are the girls from guys we fucked you see it find their names these comedians from New York they came and actually gonna be on the podcast Monday oh that was a clever tie-in I didn't mean to but I use them as an example because because we just did book this earlier today Cristina Hutchinson and current current Fisher and they came up with this clever idea for the title and it became huge I mean it's always top ten it's like one of the top ten comedy podcasts and people say Oh we'll create it no it's not stupid just just do something that's good stop saying it's saturated if you're good it'll stand out this idea that we lose a few to food everybody's got these stupid barriers they put in their own head you got to resist those goddamn things because they don't do you any good and they certainly define the potential for your future in a negative way that's not self-serving and it's not even real you know you put this artificial ceiling on the potential for what you're doing if you hit a wall okay that just means you need to regroup and rethink it doesn't mean that walls there especially when it comes to something like social media or like a podcast something were you just you're putting out a piece of art you're putting out something that you've created there's no wall as far as like how many people gonna enjoy it or how far it's gonna go it's just it is what it is and if people don't like it make it better if they like it less fix that figure out a way to do it you can do that and this this idea that there's no way to get past the starting block today is just ludicrous it's crazy and it's just this this poor thinking and people that are trapped in bad situations one of the problems is you feel like this is your future you feel like you're fucked and you can't get out of that there's no hope there's no light at the end of the tunnel there's no rainbow and if you feel like that that alone can be incredibly defining and limiting but if you can look at if you look at yourself objectively and say okay I kind of am fucked here I mean credit card debt I'm working in a shitty job I I don't like what I'm doing but I have some ideas I need to feed those fucking ideas and I need to feed them and water them and I need to set aside a certain amount of time every day to just try to make those things happen you can do that I have a V I like visual images use that in the hardcore history a lot these what's it like to fight an elephant with a spear things like that I like this but the image to die the image I have though for what you're talking about I've always thought it's a little like a running back in football who takes the ball and who goes forward and there's no hole right all you run into is the back of your offensive lineman but if you keep hitting if a hole is going to open up boom you'll squirt through now there's no guarantee in life the hole will be there but there is a guarantee that if you're not continually smacking at it then when it opens up you won't be ready yes right right and so I don't know about you Joe you've had a charmed life I think it how well you've done but I mean some of us have failed many times I failed I guess sometimes I remember being a TV reporter in a small station and and I would get out of work at like midnight and the story that I just spent all day on aired and it was awful and I would get out and I would literally this is when I still had quite a bit of hair I would sit there and like you like pull your hair out you go what am i doing right this is horrible and I look back on those now and I think you know what if you had just given up then right or the podcast I mean do you know how my wife did a great thing for me we'd had that company that I just told you about we were trying to do the new media thing and it just fell apart like everybody's companies were starting to do and I wasted a lot of time and a lot of money in my life doing that and she would have been totally justified and saying that's it you know you're going to Indianapolis gonna talk radio show job wherever they're hired but she didn't she said you know what you try to try this next thing you could do it you could and here we are and I think you know if you hadn't tried it's that weird thing and folks I tried being a TV reporter I try be you try all those things and either they're not successful or they're moderately successful or they're successful but not enough for you you got life as a verb you have to you know the thing the people that makes people the most sad in life and I already have a couple of friends my own age who are there is the regrets right they don't they don't they're not sorry they've failed they're sorry they didn't try and the funny thing is they're some of them are only 50 and they think okay my window to try is already gone and which is wrong too but folks you will be so happy there's so many things that have happened in my life because I I mean I got my first talk radio show job I was a reporter I covered this story there was some big guy showing up at the local radio station and as I was leaving I wrote a letter to the program directors thanks for having us too and how do I mail this joy not mail it do I mainly do it and just you know I closed my eyes on mail he called me two days later so you want a job what if you didn't send that letter it's stupid the little things that your life can hinge on but if you don't do them you don't give fate an opportunity to intervene I think here's an important thing too failure is important it is important I think failure teaches you things you don't learn from success I think failure gives you an opportunity for self-examination and also gives you a feeling that is very uncomfortable and that very uncomfortable feeling helps you grow that when you feel like shit you screw something up like when I've had bad podcasts my podcast has always gotten better afterwards when I've that bad stand upsets I've always gotten better after that because those bad sets motivate you they get they give you a perspective like hey here's some clear examples of where you fucked up yeah what not to do yeah don't and don't look at these failures as like proof that you suck look at them as opportunities for growth look at them as opportunities to be motivated to do better and Winston Churchill had to learn about reading quotes about how inspirational reading famous quotes were and he says they motivate you from a number of different ways including the idea that you know you think it's just you or you think that these people who did so well we're so incredibly gifted or privileged from the get-go and when you realize no no they're more like me than I think that becomes inspirational right you telling your audience this is inspirational you don't want to hear go back to school go do this work but if you hate your job that is like nature telling you to try something different and it's motivating because the motivation is you might not have to do that soul killing job anymore well if you look at someone is doing really well like say if you focus on like Kevin Hart or someone like that some very famous and successful comedian all you see is him now flying around private jets wearing a new pair of sneakers every day driving around in Bentley's you just see that you don't see him being a young kid in Philadelphia going to open mic nights scratching and clawing MC Hammer selling the the tapes out of the hatchback all that stuff man there's a path and you think of people like you see an old person walking down the street you go all that person's always been an old person no that was a baby that was a baby that became a 90 year old man there's a there's a progression that you're not witness to you don't see it and that that takes place in everything it takes place in author as it takes place in comedians and musicians there is a starting point and then with time and focus and as long as you re-evaluate and reassess and constantly objectively look at what you're doing and then pursue it with passion and focus you get better things and you know what doing all those things ends up you know it's funny but your life experiences create who you are and all those things actually make you a more for me I know I'm speaking to the choir here but but all those things make you a more formidable person so that eventually that next endeavor is is you're more prepared for and you're more formidable and and so you know you turn around you say what was I like as a 23 year old intern compared to what I'm like now and I'm basically a different person and you're a different person because of all these life experiences I mean you go to a CENTCOM meeting with the big brat well you're more formidable afterwards right for sure but if you don't put yourself in the position you know it's life is like coming up to the to the plate and taking a swing there are no guarantees you're gonna get a hit no guarantee and you might even look foolish swinging but there's no chance of it if you don't get in the battery box right a hundred percent and one of the things that I've found over the last few years in particular I've done in the past but I did it because they were just goals that I was pursuing on the side as well as doing stand-up and all the other things that I do in my life but I found that things that are completely unrelated to my career that are difficult enhance what I do whether it's you're like that yoga or running Hills or archery or all these things like you've managed to incorporate them into what you do yes sort of but that's just because I'm one of the things that I do is just talk about things that I'm interested in but they make my my focus better because they're hard and because I'm not good at them so like when I do yoga I'm not good at Yoga so when I do it it's hard it's a fucking struggle and forcing myself to get through that 90-minute class and try a hundred percent with every pose enhances my stamina for thinking and approaching other things let's macro it out a little bit because I'm very interested in what you're saying so so here you and are talking to the listeners many of whom were already accomplished and well into their goals but if they're not they're listening to this I'm thinking to myself okay if you're trying to design a society you know we had talked about revolution if if too many people are the losers in the society if you said to yourself what really matters in this society is making more Americans who are happier with their lives more successful doing what they want to do in other words empowering them to create how different is that in terms of a set up from what our school system is designed to do now which is a holdover to essentially make good factory workers right right I mean if you said to somebody listen this entire country is built for you to become a businessman with your own business you start your own come if you taught that in the schools from the get-go and you had workshops all and and everybody's gonna say Jan we already do that in the schools I already know but I mean if that was the entire goal of your education to turn every student in that class into a small businessperson doing their own dream someday how would you do it differently than what you do now because to me the biggest crime isn't that we have the kind of system we have is that we're not training people on how to utilize it and mean we have all these opportunities there and it sounds like a cliche but we're doing it and as you go through it you say to yourself well why can't more people do this well who told them they could and who said you know I mean this is a little bit of a hand-holding but I'm teaching this to my kids right now right I'm telling them listen don't go do the soul-killing job work on this thing that you seem to be good at and that you love and let's work on it now yeah I mean I guess what I'm saying is could we be doing a better job here and if so you know would you have to fight teachers unions to do it what do you have to do to break apart a system that's a hundred and forty years old and not work at all that well right now two more correspond to the reality the people are growing up in now well I had a conversation with my daughter yesterday about this my nine-year-old and she said do it she was saying she was saying school is so boring I don't want to go to school tomorrow we she was laughing about I was picking her up from his class that she goes to and I said well what's the most boring she goes it's all boring she's being funny right right and I go well you like reading and you'reyou're really into reading she was yeah I do I like it but they make it boring she goes they make reading boring and she goes they may cry go but you like writing write you like writing she was I like writing what I want to write about they make a writing bar she's creative yeah but she was being silly but the wisdom from a nine-year-old we were just laughing and having fun talking about it but the wisdom from a nine-year-old expressing how they make things that she likes boring it's like I think there's a certain amount that you have to do that's boring right there's a certain amount of the hard work in your business that you must sure learning learning grammar or learning language certain amount of that stuff is fucking boring once you get past that boring shit and you have a base understanding of how to communicate how to add how to count how to multiply how government works all these different things that you should have sort of a base understanding of then it's like everyone has a different personality they have different different interests different different things that they would be really satisfied pursuing that's not encouraged the what's encourages go find a job what's encouraged is don't find someplace that you can shove yourself into go find a square hole so you can stick your round peg and just fucking jam it in there and shave down the top and the bottom so you slide in with all this extra space on the sides and feel like shit for the rest of your life because you need a job because you're in debt because you have credit cards because you have student loans because that's what everybody does and so you do it too that's what's wrong what's wrong is that we don't like we don't give it's like we met let them figure it out on their own and it fucking takes forever it takes four it took forever for me my the only thing that I had going for me that was that I was crazy and that I had been spending most of my high school years fighting so that I was already so far outside of anybody that I was so weird I didn't fit in anywhere I was weird too isn't that funny I didn't feel like I had a pot I knew one thing I couldn't work like a regular job I got how to figure out something else because I'll be there's the idea of it was literally the idea of being in an office was like torture okay can I just tell you so that's the hinge point the difference between you and this so so here's if I was if I was creating a fantasy educational system the hinge point between what you just said is that you said I couldn't stand this I couldn't work the real job I couldn't fit into this so I did something had to find another way a lot of people get stuck with this so I had to find another way part yeah you know it's funny because you know your kids are young enough to say you went through this but I mean when my kids were really young before they were in the school there and now we put them in one of those Montessori schools you know the ones everybody goes together no it's it's it's different school to school but but the basic concept is that you don't force the children to learn anything specific you have all these things around and the children go to where they want to do so the upsides obviously that from the get-go they're only reading what they're into or the downside of course is that there's all this other stuff you're supposed to to learn it's the it-it's the dichotomy between how do you know you talked about needing to have these skills little math skills you need some basic foundational stuff but something is also happening at that level which is you're finding out which students are into math and would like to have a career in math other people are being touched by a foreign language in a way that they think I'd like to learn more than I'd like to speak it fluently I'd like to teach it so in a way you're already beginning to select what kids are into by exposing them to this stuff most of us find it boring but there might be something that's where I first found history as a as a discipline right if most kids oh god the last thing I want to hear some history but I get turned on by it okay well well then it's worth exposing you to all those things I think the problem is though is that it would be great for example to have half your schooling maybe at that young age be sort of a Montessori model where you say okay we spent our time on reading writing and arithmetic now we want you to go around and it has to be you can't be playing video games unless playing video games is what you want to do for a living and you're going to be able to to do some educational work on it but I mean I would love to see more of a fostering for the fact that listen we're trying to create entrepreneurs here rather than trying to create drone workers on the Amazon assembly line now if you end up on the Amazon assembly line anyway great good for you I'm glad you can bring some food home but the goal ought to be to let you start a business and maybe employ a bunch of other people you know yeah and the goal would be to have less unhappy dissatisfied ppm or stable society but also happier yeah it creates more more satisfaction the people that I know that get to do what they want to do for a living it's not like their their lives are completely hi everybody's gonna that's right problems no matter who you are absolutely you know what it was a Kanye West who said do rich people have problems are just different problems I mean it's it's everybody's got these challenges but like you said there's there's not a lot more stressful than having a ton of credit card debt wondering you know if you're gonna lose your house wondering how you're gonna pay for your kids education I mean all those things are soul-crushing not only that because you're in debt you get nervous so it suppresses your ability to take yourself and take risks because you're a cycle you don't want to lose your gig you don't want to you know it's like man then you're tired to live you're tired I mean the one thing is as you get older I mean it's funny because getting older is one of those things that you can only understand when you get there so I all through your life you're going through these god isn't it isn't this the interesting part of being in your 30s or being in your foot so as I go into my 50s now I'm sitting here going energy is so under talked about yeah you know the ability to like my buddy who wrote me and said you know I feel like I've screwed up my life I didn't take enough chances I I played it safe and I'm so unhappy he says and I just can't motivate myself at 50 years old anymore energy wise to start over energy is underrepresented tell our guys gotta fix his health I knew you were gonna say that see what it is your health is your engine you know health is literally the the chassis the tires that brakes the engine of your vehicle that you move through this life with and too many people don't pay attention to it at the end of the lack of energy is killer and as you get older especially not just that it it changes your ability to do things if you don't have energy not only will you not have the energy to pursue things but you won't you won't be able to do them the same way if you have energy and enthusiasm and say like you're healthy and you want to write a book you're gonna have thoughts that will come into your mind that won't come into your mind if you're exhausted agreed and that's fucking huge that's huge for anything you're trying to pursue whether we're talking about furniture making we're talking about being an author whatever it is let's talk about ideas for a minute because I think that's another one we about small businesses or starting as an entrepreneur you know I'm one of those people that is not sure that we don't have a finite number of ideas to each of us and all of them are valuable enough even if they don't appear to be on the surface to write down yeah you know I I keep I went to a business meeting a couple years ago with one of these TV guys I was just talking about and we go to this business meeting and you know we're all on our phones and whatever he pulls out an old-fashioned journal that you write in and he just starts writing and I looked at that and I thought in one sense he looks like a dinosaur but I went out and bought one and now it's crazy how often you know all I do is write ideas in it and a lot of them might I look back on now and I go okay that's still stupid but other ones I look back on and go god I didn't know what this idea meant at the time but five years later this idea is really you know I guess what I'm saying is that if you wanted to take almost like a religious view of it god only gives you somebody write down and cherish the ideas but there is something to that folks what really is gonna make you unique sometimes is the way your brain works differently than anyone's brain who's ever existed on the planet that's valuable right there write down what comes out of the brain because you capture those yes because if you don't capture them they will slip all right and sometimes sometimes the idea isn't good until you until the second half arrives later right so idea number ones in your book from five years ago idea number two that finally completes that idea arrives later I mean I had a friend who was so creative and he said he gets the best ideas at night so he just turns on the Lutton the light at the side of the table writes it down in the book and by morning there's another idea down there yeah and quantity has two quality all its own and sometimes a book filled with interesting ideas out of your individual unique head will help you later on so write them down yeah yeah there's no downside I have an app on my phone where I can just you know the Notes app yes let's talk into that I do too and it dictates it really almost perfectly so I'll have an idea and I'll just be driving down the road I just pressed that button I start talking into it and then I put it down I got it like I got that one who captured it think about people who had one fantastic idea in their life and built their whole life on it yeah and you never know idea that's gonna be and you know what I was an improv again you know more about this than I do but I was a theater major for my first two years of college and we did improv comedy and the guy who taught us improv in high school really he had a great line he said that part of your brain like every part of your brain is a muscle and he said the more you're thinking okay I got a show this Friday that I have to come up with something funny for the better you get at it yeah penny and you start looking your brain starts looking at things and finding things so you're almost like training it to help you now in this new endeavor it's a very plastic sort of an approach but but it's the same thing with the ideas one idea in your little book that you wrote down could make your life your child I mean if you're Henry Ford I mean how many people did you employ for decades afterwards because of a good idea I mean our world is built on those things and also like the idea of having these ideas and the enthusiasm that comes from it like it starts to escalate and you start to calculate like Colin I need more and I need this and maybe that and and then the the motivation and the momentum of these ideas can lead to enthusiasm I mean we attract other people who come who can add and I mean that this is what we said about like you start your website and you just do it because things once you push the the verb of living manages to create ripples intimate metaphysical here but ripples in time in front of you that open up possibilities and because someone may if you only have one podcast listener but that podcast listener is like wow that's great I've got it and gets ahold of you and your life goes off in another different direction but you have to try you have to try yeah well you don't have to you could just drone on but no I would recommend not doing that I would also suggest that you and I and everyone has an interest in in not allowing people to drone on too much because because for the same reason I talked about instant we did a common-sense show once called The Revenge of the gangrenous finger and that the idea was that you know if you ignore people in your society that aren't doing well long enough it's a little like saying yes my finger has gangrene but it's the little ones of who the hell cares but eventually if you ignore it long enough it'll poison your bloodstream and destroy the body itself if you have enough people in soul-crushing situations who okay you know a guy called me once on the radio when I was preaching revolution in the middle 1990s and said you're an idiot he said you're an idiot because no one's gonna face the bayonets as long as they have enough food in their bellies and they're doing halfway okay but of course the implication there is if they don't have food in their bellies and they're not doing okay then all bets are off we all have a vested interest in seeing that more of our countrymen do better because it's better for the society as a whole creates a better world for your kids happier I mean there's there's so many and the one thing about our system you know people talk about patriotism all the time but to me the real patriotism is saying we created a system here it works this way it encourages people to go do these things so if the system is designed and set up for that you ought to give it a try you ought to just see yeah you know the suggestion that I always give to people is write down things that you want to try to accomplish just write them down Oh guy said to me said said write the way you want your obituary to appear now sit down write your obituary he says because that'll show you how far off your goals you are well here's here's a better one pretend there's a documentary crew filming your success story and they're following you around right now what would you do what would you do if you knew that there was a crew following you around with cameras documenting your future incredible success and they want to catch you in the act of it all you would do all the right things you'd have to do think about that organize it but where we are saddled down by so many doubts and so so much just mental horseshit that keeps people from from action but look at the thing that's to me maybe the number one thing that's the impediment and the make society unequal it's it's the the luck of who your parents are that's a big one I mean if if if you say listen this guy grew up and started his own business because his folks taught in those kinds of things and encouraged him when his or she with her creativity okay that's a person that's got a huge advantage in life we talked about white privilege giving you an advantage well good parent privilege gives you an advantage ient but then the question that as if you're looking at at macro in a society sense that comes up is okay what what can society do if you say this is a real problem for the rest of us not enough good parents because those people never learned it how do you compensate for that and that almost gets a little socialistic where you talk about the state teaching you creativity and it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense but there's got to be if we decide that this is a national security interest you know having more Americans living the dream have less losers but what if your parents are losers yeah well you can get past that I know so we increase the number of people you know if you say okay 500 out of a thousand overcome that how do you get to 600 how do you get to 700 out of a thousand and if you say it's a national security concern that we do I mean I think ambition is a gene I really do and I think that that some of us you could be born into any circumstance but you've got this genes you're gonna be ambitious and you're gonna overcome it then I think there's people who have no ambition gene and there's nothing you can do to help them and then I think there's a huge number of people in the middle that could go either way and then question I have is you don't have to help the ones with the gene you can't do anything for the ones without the gene how do you increase the odds for the people who could go either way I think you give them a template you give them some some markers that they can follow whose we though I mean that they're you me yes it's yes okay anybody who's really gone anybody who's ahead you go hey come on come this way I mean that's there's a responsibility that we have for each other what about incubating businesses I mean you look at some of these um in the little town were a little town Eugene Oregon where I live now they have a love eugene by the way you know it's great it's if you're from los angeles on is green it's I like Boulder where you live I went to college there um but if you are living in a place like that they have a venture capitalist angel investor thing for people who are starting small businesses and it's not a government deal although the counties and I think of a little bit but but it's one of those things where you go okay this is a good idea could we be doing more of this where you say Joe Blow wants to start a business he needs $100,000 to do it if you go to a bank they're never going to approve it cuz you have too much credit card debt could we as a society say hey we have an interest in Joe Blow doing well with that furniture company what can we do to help I think maybe the better thing would be to not have a loan to try to figure out how to do without a little things about Kickstarter and GoFundMe is it you know you can you could raise money now we don't need a storefront you don't need anything you know I just I just feel like people need inspiration and they need guidelines and if as long as you could just start moving just get action like you're just getting just movement get such a curb you got yeah yeah and folks listen that's the one thing to really take out of this is that just try and see what happens and my stepfather had a great line he said what's the worst that can happen yeah and you know sometimes you have to think about that to realize if you're scared about failure don't be scared about the greatest in the world have failed if you're worried about going into debt I understand that don't be scared of failure I think failure is awesome for you and that's one of the reasons why like I said I like doing things that I suck at you know there's you could get real complacent if you're really good at something and you only do that thing all the time agree with that and you're not growing anymore so yeah you're just not challenged you're not like you're not at the bottom of the heap you know if you start jujitsu right now and you're a white belt you're like oh Lee God what the fuck how how could I ever get good at this and it's it's humbling but in that humbling thing you learn about yourself you learn about discipline and you build up that engine that muscle that is trying to work things out and figure things out creating a more formidable you yeah it's a good way to look at it now as a historian you know and not a history oh you like to say that you are motherfucker most important historians ever how about that fuckface don't know what speechless but as someone who is a fan of history how about this okay you got a more palatable way for you how do you look at what do you do you look at like what's going on with this administration and with this country and this the IMP I mean our president is he he tweeted at the at Kim jong-un saying that Kim Jong Un's said that I'm old I don't know why I said that because I never say that he's short and fat and like maybe we could be friends I'm just like he's like Don Rickles as president fucking hilarious but do you look at it in terms of like one day someone is going to do a hardcore history series about the Trump administration do you ever look at it that way do you look at it in terms of like like establishing a narrative or like trying to describe it to the people some day I think we're too in the Maelstrom like we said earlier for me to figure that out I will say that I see certain side benefits so for example you know one of the things that I've talked about for many many years and we did a whole six-hour podcast on it too is the is the president's power to launch a nuclear war all by himself yeah or herself well and it's here's the thing is that that's an obvious flaw I mean that's and everybody understands it but nobody's done anything about it so now because everyone's so scared of Trump they're talking about fixing a problem that has should have been fixed decades and decades ago not because he's a great president and they're looking for but because they're so freakin scared of him and he's so outside you know I mean it's funny because why these politicians and they'll trust people from the other parties it doesn't matter you didn't hear the Democrats saying we can't have george w bush with his finger on the nuclear button you didn't hear george w burrs ami they're all fine with it as long as you're one of those insiders the first time you get an outsider in there now they're scared to death but they should have been scared to death decades and decades ago so if you said that we have a trump presidency and the only big thing that comes out of it is they finally fixed that one person can't launch a nuclear war holocaust by themselves that's a pretty big deal right they almost had to break a little aspect of the system for people to freak out enough to fix it but when you think look worst-case scenarios you think worst case look at world war 1 is a worst case scenario if you have a person with the power to launch a nuclear war by themselves if anybody can't see that that's an untenable horrible situation you look at human history and go ok it's a ticking time bomb literally um then you're not you don't know very much history and and the fact that we've escaped decades and decades without anybody fixing this problem crazy well so if the trump presidency alone caused us to fix that problem you'd have to say that for no I mean this wasn't Trump's idea even want to fix that problem but as a byproduct of him getting into office if we could fix that problem depending on how history went in the future you could be saving 100 million lives yeah if you could fix that problem me but what if we get through the Trump administration and we move ourselves into 2020 and someone really accepted to the Kardashian administration I think it's well you do think I mean if a queue rating the queue rating is the is how well your name is known right so if if what Trump proved is that you do not need a ton of money if you walk in the door with a Q rating cuz that's what the other politicians wanted for right he's uniquely good at ignoring his faults and projecting his strengths and being confident all those things mean he might be a sociopath but all those things that allow him to do that and completely ignore his fault and keep constantly droning on about his successes and how good he is at things that resonates with people in a very weird way we we respect and admire the strong man and people give in to him there's a lot of half-ass beta that that to me that's so anti-american though a strong man but it is what happened that is what happened that's why I find it just distasteful but I will say this uh there are certain things that he did that are part of his personality that worked really well because it there are so many Americans so upset with the system yes I mean I remember one line from trumpet one of these debates that I thought was one of the great lines of all time and when he turned to Rand Paul after Rand Paul slammed him and said you're not having a very good night are you and I remember thinking okay there are a lot of Americans who just love anybody sticking it to these politicians because everybody's so upset with all the policy so here's a guy who's sticking it to them but there's a there's a cutting off your nose to spite your face side of this cuz I've always wanted an outsider but not this outsider yeah so so you say to yourself okay we could have had a normal human being because look if you want to say what Trump has I don't know the guy so I can't diagram what he but he's he's an extreme narcissist you know all these people have narcissistic complexes or you don't think I'm a good enough guy to be president right right there it's almost like you don't get through the door without too much narcissism I've never seen this much from anybody I mean this is this is but um you know if if for a while that was working for him because he was so outside the norms there are certain like unspoken rules of things you do and behave and he violated all those and it was refreshing to have him violate yes um now we have I well when he told Hillary because you'd be in jail and everybody went nuts it's like yeah there's a lot of people saying that people and people and people you know the real thing I think a lot of people said which is tragic but I understand it is if we have to live with one of these people for four years and listen to them talk I'd rather have somebody who's making funny jokes that make me laugh rather you know somebody who's obviously reading another prepared speech that they didn't exist or so anyway you really don't get a sense of who they really are like a Hillary Clinton who's a career politician she's a chameleon she's just saying what she thinks the polls are going to favor so then if if you know the part that drives me the craziest is 321 million people you said and the two people that we're voting on at the end of this thing are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hilarious that's the problem well nobody wants that fucking magnifying glass turned on their life my stepdad said if you if you're a really August person and you're gonna sit there is that word August it just means you're really powerful formidable human being like August yeah and so you sit down there if you're if he said those kind of people divided a piece of paper in half and they write prose on one side and cons on the other and they running for president and they go down the pros and cons he goes he goes the cons outnumber the pros five to one it might be a hundred yeah I'm not gonna have as much power as I have now I blah blah blah blah everyone's gonna hate you and he's and so people who are really intelligent if they do that calculation the calculation says don't run for president you'd be an idiot now he says people though who run anyway it's because something on the pro side outweighs everything on the con side like I want to be on TV all the time or I want to be the most powerful person in the world or it's the natural extension I've been a senator you know whatever it is in other words there's some ego question that's out that that's that's drowning all the columns yes and and he said that's why you have to be careful because that's so you either have somebody who's not intelligent enough to weigh the pros and cons or somebody who's so smart that the cons outweigh the pros and they choose to do it anyway what a crazy system when you think that that is the way we develop a person who is going to be in control of nuclear weapons we have a popularity contest where to win the popularity contest which is totally you know elective you don't have to join but to get into this contest and to win you're gonna you get it your life's gonna be torn apart they're gonna go over there people gonna lie about you and look at your favorite person and say so you know you go look at some of these candidates from the past that we like to lionize would they have even made it through the process today imagine what Kennedy would have had to jog matter with John Kennedy would the kind of things that would he'd have all these women coming forward can you imagine it who had never made it well the dr. feelgood's would show up oh my god you know they used to give him like amphetamines right well yeah he had like some serious disease in the Addison's disease is that a glandular a problem with the glands where it's not providing adrenaline I think don't quote me on that Wow so they had him on some sort of amphetamines well he was apparently on a lot of medication I think he had the last rites given to him once before because he came so close to dying and he's well and and truthfully I read that that it impacted the way he kind of saw his life because he didn't expect it to be a long life and so it impacted on how but if you if somebody told you Joe you're not gonna have well you're not gonna have a long life how much does that change the way you live the rest of your life you'd probably live crazy you'd probably go nanny skiing every day this guy died well maybe you try to try to get the things on your bucket list in terms of accomplishments done quitting more quickly or yeah but but you look at someone like that and said could a guy like that had made it through the process could Lyndon Johnson who made it through the process could Richard I mean all those people lived in a time period that was a lot less of a fishbowl than today and if you say that these great leaders can't make it through the process and the only people that make it through the process are the ones who've been so careful never taken a risk lied like crazy I mean if you say those are the only people that can make it to the process then maybe that explains why we 321 million people this is the choice we end up with at the end of the day well we also have this problem where we look at someone's entire life and we look at all the different things that they do and we decide whether or not we accept certain things like we're not talking about whether or not someone's honest with business whether you we want you to be honest with everything yeah you got to be you got to get C average on everything you can't have an A in here and it but it be the truly great people as we know for our very flawed yes yeah very flawed and also like what percentage of people who want to be leaders I think about that thing right you want to be the one on the podium telling everybody what's up what percentage of those guys want to fuck other women is it a hundred right I mean just I can't answer but if you think about like nature like the natural leader types like throughout human history what percentage of those have been monogamous those ones who want to control the army the ones who want to run the thing the ones who want to be at the top getting everybody to do their bidding the ones who want to have all the money and all the power and live in the castle those guys are almost all adulterers you know it does it does argue for the idea that it might be better to appoint somebody who doesn't want the job as like somebody had talked about once it's talks like that with police officers and they had said listen there are all kinds of police officers but if you're the one who wants the job because you're going to chase bad guys and you want that adrenaline rushing the whole thing you're not the guy who should get the job I once respect yes but well like and you can see the funny thing is this and somebody sent this to me a long time ago they showed there's all these different like recruitment videos that the different police agencies have right and some of them are more like you can get cats out of trees you can help and some of them are like you can drive a great car and the funny thing is I would imagine that that influences the sort of people that answer your ad no for sure I mean they have billboards in LA for to truck where they used to at least to try to hire new cops and they did it based on the money like this is how much money you can get LAPD biz paying this mount and they'd showing you like drive by I go I can make that amount okay what have you appointed cops see a billboard what I'm saying is like when you're advertising it's the same problem you have when you're advertising for drug companies you get people thinking like oh maybe I need that abilify in my life Oh Hugh Merida oh I need that that that seems like I like the music they're playing I like how everybody's dancing oh I like how that cop looks up there he looks he looks formidable he looks like a man who gets respect look he's got his hands on his hips and he's got a nice car behind him and look as a female squad leader with him I wonder if he fucks her you know people start you look at an ad and you start imagining yourself in the position of that person in that ad and then next thing you know you know you're the one who's go get the bad guys and you're the one who's gonna go but if you talk to a real cop like a good cop is someone who respects community someone who wants to help someone who wants to establish some sort of a bond with the people that are in the community the patrols like that like that's why they're trying to do in some neighborhoods they're trying to have more people on foot then actually walk through the streets and become a part of the community like don't you're not an outsider that's patrolling it you're actually one of the people that's there it go it goes to what we were saying about the politicians or the tie it all in why are you doing this Yeah right are you doing this because you want to be the person at the podium that everybody's admiring the you you want to be the person that everyone's talking about or are you sincerely interested in public service and helping things I mean what if you I can think of 20 people that you would say got it'd be interesting to see what that person would do in the presidency right but like you said I can't imagine any of them wanting to do it another we're gonna want to do it Mark Cuban is one to be the president Elon Musk's not gonna want to be the president I think we really need a council I think the idea of one single joke what it's supposed to do remember that we're supposed to be if everybody remembers their founding father Federalist Papers everything the presidency was a much much much less powerful job right this was a country that was run by the legislative branch basically we're not that way anymore because of a whole bunch of things including the nuclear weapons thing we talked about earlier the the the the Atomic Age changed the presidency because of the need to have one person you couldn't declare war anymore because what if the missiles are on their way to you now right can you really go to Congress and debate it and have them know you needed a person who within 10 minutes could launch a counter strike okay well how much power does that take out of you know the hands of the legislature who was supposed to be running things for example why do we not declare war anymore we haven't declared war since the Second World War we have a country that the Constitution says you can't go to war or without a declaration certainly not you can get some Barbary pirates cleared out of North Africa but you can't like that's why Congress by the way with the the Trump thing is they want to say that you can't launch nuclear weapons unless Congress has declared war first which creates this wonderful thing about trying to figure out if we can sort of retro actively replace a power that's been gone since 1942 you know when we declared war on like Romania and something else you did the the subsidiary powers in the Second World War and that's the last time it's been done but according to the Constitution we shouldn't have been able to fight a war since without that it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens in 2020 it's gonna be really interesting and I did to remove some of the power that the president has is gonna be a really big uphill battle unless someone actually drops a nuke on somebody unless Trump decides to bomb North Korea like Kim Jong Un's says something about his wife like he do piece of shit you fucking launches a bomb at him unless it's something so egregious and ridiculous like that it's gonna be really hard to dial back the power without any real specific need because people are gonna concentrate on all the other issues that the country faces economically militarily the need for healthcare the need for two you know environmental standards what are we gonna do about global warming there's so many issues that take the front stage the idea of someone actually launching a nuclear attack seems so distant and ridiculous but that's not going to be on the forefront of everybody's like list of priorities of things to handle makes me think of Eisenhower ordering the local German population at the end of the Second World War to go tour the death camps themselves and actually have to walk past piles and piles and piles of human bodies because he wanted them to not forget we're gonna look at this and I you know I didn't know he did oh yeah when you look at the end of the world wars for example in both of them people were so shocked by what happened you get this idea that we're never again right we're never gonna let this happen again but you get a generation later two generations later how long does it take for those lessons to fade away so when I hear or read on Twitter it's probably some thirteen-year-old boy in his basement so you never know but the racial stuff I always think to myself if you only you know maybe we need some dead bodies out there so you can go see this is what it looks like right we're not fooling around here this kind of stuff leads to this stop fooling around with a hundred and forty characters and look at what real death taste smells like and what the long-term ramifications are pushing these sorts of attitude can lead to and has over and over and over again well I think there's a real problem with the human condition when it comes to complacency and comfort and I think that we get real comfortable and real complacent and we have a very distorted idea of what life is without struggle and there's a great book by Sebastian Junger who was on last week yeah and it's called tribe and he did a perfect storm - is wonderful yeah he's amazing but talking to him about what happens when people overcome significant tragedies whether it's war or whether it's natural disasters or you know I was in I was in New York right after 9/11 and it was palpable the sense of community and how friendly people were and it was because people had had their world shaken up by an attack and it literally did good it really did good for the people that survived in a fucked-up way but it makes me think of that project for a new American documents that before 9/11 had said that there's you know without some kind of Pearl Harbor style attack the American system is designed right now in a way where people are gonna pull apart more and more and in other words just saying you know you could almost wish for something like that to happen to pull us together I remember when I was horrible thought though right yeah I thought what maybe maybe it's the only way we learn and you need the refresher but that's what I think people need war in their own life and I think they need struggle I need strong need something to do in their own life that's incredibly difficult to keep them from being Yabba there's too many of us not lace it's mundane when I was when I was um trying to localize the story from the the Yugoslavian civil war that we were just talking about earlier I interviewed a Croatian man in Eugene and we were talking about it and I was bringing up these age-old hatreds and basically saying you know they've always hated each other he stopped he said now stop stop stop he goes we didn't he goes up until recently we were intermarrying with each other we got along it was all working out he goes do you know what changed I said what he goes the economy tanked he goes in all of a sudden he goes the first thing that started to resurface when everybody was just hating everything their lives and everything he was all of a sudden all these old things that had been buried just came right back and so that tribalism you're talking about we younger I think there are times and you would mentioned it right post post war air is these times when they go away disaster yes but but then certain kinds of conditions for example terrible economic conditions for too many people it's funny how quickly the scapegoats come back and and things that I mean I truthfully I mean the biggest thing that I've missed politically in terms of just I just didn't see it was the resurgence of the racism bigotry prejudice thing I mean I thought you know we grew up in the era where our country was trying to figure out through things like broadcasting how we transition so you remember all in the family when it started yeah it's a show that doesn't even run very much anymore because simply trying to address those issues as to hot-button for most advertisers now you could never have an art you know to carry no and but that whole show was part of society's attempt to transition from an era where it wasn't that long beforehand where you couldn't stay in a hotel that wasn't a black or a white person's hotel in the south to one where we got now and I always thought okay the message of Archie Bunker was they would try to you know teach him the young people try to teach him about how to be a more open human being and but it didn't matter because the Archie Bunker's of the world we're gonna die off they were the dinosaurs from another era and eventually that would be a way of looking at things that was in the past and I didn't I thought that that was what it was gonna be and I never I never saw the resurgence but like my Croatian friend had said just maybe things had to get bad enough economically and whatever for all the tribal things to just come back because that's there's something deep in us that that's all embedded in I think there's far less of those people that I think yeah that allowed for yeah that's that stunned me too and it's so homogenized we seen with their fucking Home Depot torches walking on the street asking dorks that the whole thing was so what did you hear Richard Spencer he did the white supremacist but he did it he did an interview about two weeks ago where he was basically saying slavery was good and all these kind of things with that British mask yes and something like you're an idiot or whatever but I mean it wasn't it was a ridiculous thing to say and yet normally and you know do you remember 60 minutes used to have the KKK white supremacist guys in the old days on like once a year they'd interview like the Grand Dragon or whatever and they'd give him a lot of airtime and Mike Wallace would question him and at the end of it you just always thought the same thing these people are idiots right it was the give them enough rope and they'll hang themselves type judges I thought that that journalists like everybody was talking about the guy did the perfect interview with him but I I honestly think that's not the way to do the perfect interview of them I think that guy's standing up there standing up facing each other I think they'd be far better off if they sat down and if they talked for a long period of time and I think there's plenty more rope and that car could've hung them way back yeah there's a there's a book by a black gentleman who's a musician a boogie woogie piano player I don't remember his name was that it was a book it was a book long yeah but it was a style it was a book on the Klan and and he was a guy a black man who I'm going from memory here but he like set up an interview with one of the heads of the state Klan or whatever didn't tell the guy who was coming that he was a black man and they had so they had this interview and it's this interesting thing he says but long story short he started to make friends with these KKK members it wasn't like rank-and-file people it was like the Grand Dragon whatever that's the guy right look how one man convinced 200 Klu Klux Klan members to give up their Road but long story short is I mean these were told Davis they didn't have any black people they knew right they had stereotypes and thing so he said once you're like you had said when you're face to face with somebody and you have to interact with them on an eye to eye level it's it's very intriguing what he did because you say to yourself okay you can never reach these Archie Bunker guys but people haven't do and and I do want to say listen for all of the white supremacist out there that think I'm being unfair this racial tribal thing is all over the place because they're you know like you will meet black folks who are racist to us now what I always say to people though is the one thing you have to understand is a white person that's different is we're the dominant culture okay it does make things different if you are a minority in any country there's a tendency I mean you go to the place and they'll have neighborhoods right remember the Italian neighborhoods in our country the Jewish neighborhoods the Irish neighborhoods why did they do that were they racist no there's there's some strength in gathering with your own kind reading your own newspapers and keeping your cultural on language that's right but but it's also a self-defense mechanism right so it's a very different thing to say well listen they're being racist too okay but we're the dominant culture and it means that there's something a little different when we say what's wrong with saying you know white people should be proud of their heritage - theoretically nothing but historically speaking there are some issues yeah and you need to recognize that now can we ever get to a time when we can judge people by the content of the character I don't know but I think if I think even if white people said we're gonna do that right now there'd be people of other colors going oh wait a minute we don't want to give up you know some extra admissions into universities and we don't here it becomes a very difficult thing to give up this racial identity in the 60s that was the goal now people on all sides would be what are you talking about it's very you know the cultural appropriation thing drives me crazy like if you're gonna have dreadlocks you can't because that's a black hair style what I always want to say is don't black people want to try different hair styles - creativity is putting things together that never went together before this is not only that it's not even historically correct you know as well as I do that dreadlocks have been around for a long fuckin time with white people think about how it just polarizes us even more it's not real though is people looking for things to be polarized yes and again I do think and I love academia and I could have I could have got swept up I enjoyed school at the college level so much I could still be there today I mean I've never gotten a job I would just be one of those guys I'm a graduate student at 51 helping the professors but at the same time look we all understand that those people are incentivized to come up with new theories new ideas groundbreaking cutting-edge you know this is what they're rewarded for with the carrots and sticks oh I get it it's different when it spreads to the general culture a little bit though because now we're not in the ivory tower having a theoretical debate we're sitting there going should that person be shamed on Twitter because he's a Asian person with dreadlocks right okay folks if you don't see that that might backfire on you down the road I mean yeah we've all got to cut each other some slack on all sides if we're gonna make this work well its cultural appropriation is one of the things that makes America so fast and totally the melting pot of humans all together exploring each other's food and and all the various aspects of their communities and the funny part is the cultural appropriators out there are sometimes the most sympathetic to that side I mean if you're willing to get a Rastafarians hairstyle you're probably not an anti black racist right so when you that they shouldn't be doing that aren't you going after the people most likely to see your side of things and help you and push you I'm saying it's almost like we're eating our own almost exactly like that and on the left it is particularly about eating your own because you can't be progressive enough yeah there's always gonna be someone who's more progressive but just how we I think you know when I was a punk back in the old days and I remember saying that we were killing the movement because the biggest thing was was this idea of a poser right and the first thing everybody said dude we didn't welcome you into the group he said when did you start wearing these clothes where did you get that hairstyle you posed or in other words the entire thing was exclusive right so you try to build this you have to be an OG it was ridiculous and nobody hears you have to be a punk for before you're a lot of it that's right and going slowly I mean I remember them they were going after like John Lydon Johnny Rotten you're a poser okay then what are we doing here but I mean in the same way the one thing you have to do is cut people some slack and the one thing we human beings seem to have such a problem with is cutting people slack and it seems to be if you say the social medium seems to be worse because you cut somebody slack face to face more easily than you will you know when you can just throw 140 characters and you go to bed but that comedian on the other side of your hundred and forty characters I mean let me just you've seen this and I've seen this but if you've never been on the receiving end of these things where Pete and I've been very lucky and people have been very nice and kind to me but even I when you read these things you go who is this person right why do they think that this is did they did their lives get better cuz they texted me this I mean do you see what I'm saying I I don't get the motivation they don't even know it you don't even know anything about it they're just acting it's a human instinct they hurt and they want to hurt others they that's what you told me years ago you told me that's okay you've helped me a lot when I look at those things I think Joe's right Joe this is people that are angry with their situation and their what what did they say it's like the crabs in a pot and one crab being about you crabs in a bucket and you pull the crab down and it's too bad because you know what a lot of those people are the very people who could be doing much better if we if we could figure out a way to help empower them to only get better have been haters that aren't haters anymore and unfortunately a lot of people have already blocked up or just just dissatisfied people that are so upset with the way things are I mean I really I would love to see more effort made in that regard because I think the subsidiary down the road Domino effects would help us all so much but listen we're a country that can't even get the most basic things passed how are we gonna get something like that done I think change is happening I think it's happening incredibly rapidly but I think we're stuck in the mix of it and we don't realize it it's sort of like when you come over someone's house and you haven't been over the house in like five years and also in their kid is ten you're like holy shit you're ten now to them it just happened gradually and slowly and they barely have noticed yep but to you when you take five years off and then you see that kid you like holy shrub in the hot water thing right yes it's happening it is happening but is this the eyes see this is where I can't again in the Maelstrom trying to analyze music positive or negative now you're enough I was that you're an optimist Joe we did a conversation before and I'm a little bit more cynical and misanthropic maybe um but I worry about figuring it out so if you say that human beings individually and as groups learn by mistakes yes so you have to have a holocaust type mistake to come out of this before we go Wow well here's where we screwed up on that social media thing I mean I I wonder whether we're going to be allowed I would not I don't know how you would turn the genie put the genie back in the bottle but I mean at what point do terrorists or dangerous people or I mean look at to go back to that Weather Underground New Left bombing thing that I said that they didn't know the South they didn't like me waterboarding Abbie Hoffman but I mean if you had a bunch of people back then with Twitter saying I support the the a bhop is I some woman okay at what point would the government first of all get you on a watch list then or now but at what point would somebody have said listen for our own good we can't have average Americans because look how many terrorists are using this tool I mean we'll see what happens but you'd mentioned 9/11 and how you know so much of that they were there was a feeling of community and all that other stuff but there was other things too there were there was the government literally and I remember Peter DeFazio the congressman up in Oregon who said this to me he said Dan he said there were bills that had been written and and put on a shelf because there was no way to pass them for the longest time and he goes when 9/11 happened they pulled all those bills down cobbled him into one thing and then he said here's the real scandal and most people don't know this he says do you know how many parts that bill were blank that we signed to be filled in later he said that's not unusual he goes because we get a lot of bills that they haven't figured out all the details because most bills aren't as important is that when he goes we signed off to a bunch of things with a bunch of blank categories to be filled in later ok gets us back to leadership right there what's wrong with the country a bunch of people signing a bunch of stuff that have nothing in it yet like I said before when you're talking about like are you optimistic or are you pessimistic is it negative or is it positive it's both and I think the negative and the positive are both necessary I don't think we're gonna live in this utopian world where everybody's just friendly to each other I think people are gonna make mistakes they're gonna be shitty they're gonna realize that they're shitty and the understanding of that behavior and the ramifications of that behavior is becoming more and more apparent every day and I think we're seeing that and I think we're caught up in this storm and there's a fucking hurricane going on man this cows flying by and bathtubs in the air all this stuff is happening right now the hope is though that we can get to the good cuz I I might agree with you in the long term right if you're saying optimistic real long-term yeah but how many I mean if you said in 1900 I'm optimistic long term that by the year 2000 things will be better yes but you have two world wars to go through in the interim and Newton misses on nuclear wars so I I can agree with you that long term we may have a positive outcome here I don't know what our immediate short-term with the you and I have 2030 for you probably have a hundred years left on your lifespan but some of us are not in great shape so um Hunt said the next 20 25 30 years are you gonna see good or bad from this we may have to go through some learning experiences and those tend to not be so fun to live through yeah there's that but also there's like how about just disengage from that every now I do do I agree with you don't have your life completely dependent upon the success and failures of other people's emotions and ideas like it just go off on your own more often spend more time buy yourself more time pursuing your own activities spend more time in nature with your phone off spend more time nature things a really good idea to try and you know what because folks that's what connects you to all the other human beings who ever lived before us the make the thing that makes our time period different here this vast human experiment is we've never had a generation growing up with mobile phones for example yeah what does that mean well one thing it does is it takes you away from the part that your aunt's I mean looking up at a night sky with nothing to do for hours just sitting there contemplating the silence or the rustling of the trees or whatever I don't know if you get anything out of that or not but that's something that humans have done since caveman times that you're sharing an experience that's innately human if that becomes less and less common because we're detached from that what does that mean and like I said we talked about an experiment earlier that we're in an experiment what does it mean when people detach from that part of the human existence to spend more time in this new part of human existence I don't know well I think that part of being a person like being in nature is in it's part of us it's part of how we developed it's a it's attached to our human reward system there's something that's deeply satisfying about lying down in a field and looking up at the stars there's a reason for all that and the more we detach from that the more you're gonna get these disenfranchised very unhappy people that feel like they're a prisoner or a slave to some system that doesn't give a fuck about them because it doesn't it really doesn't what the people that give a fuck about you are you community they're your friends the the the community of like-minded humans that you've bonded with that share your occupation or share your interests and that's how people develop satisfying relationships and satisfying lives the more you put yourself connected to something that doesn't even value you some huge monolithic creation that's there's no one even running it it's not like some architect has figured out a great way to design civilization to satisfy all the humans that are a part of it no you're feeding this machine and some sort of a weird way that nobody really understands the ramifications of because we haven't done it before there hasn't been this global connection of cellphones for thousands of years we know how to manage it we know how to manage your time and all your your your your emotions on social media no this is all this is all experimental it's all happening in the moment and we're all a part of it and what's your going to be like three generator from now I'm scared I'm scared that we're eliminating as much as possible boredom from our lives because I think the boredom is important when I was a kid we talked about being weird when I was a kid had a lot of free time on my hands had to figure out ways to entertain myself ya know video games and you you you end up doing things that like um you know you had talked about your whole you know we found this niche for me in this history show thing cuz it's what I was born to do or whatever yes but but it goes back to me trying to figure out okay I've played with these toy plastic soldiers every single day how do I make something new so that I can be entertained with these same toy soldier you know you know and I think that all you know if we think about building blocks in your brain the need to overcome boredom for example it's a prime mover when you're young you're not motivated by money you're not motive it's it's you're not even motivated by the opposite sex you know when you're a kid you're like what am I gonna do to fill this afternoon and you find ways to you know I remember tearing up my mom's garden wants to create a giant river system you know yeah yeah okay but but would you do that today we even bother took ours I mean well I wouldn't but maybe a kid would maybe there's maybe there's an app where you can do do that do the same thing on my point is is that there's these sorts of prime movers end up creating their needs that create the need for solutions if you get rid of that need do you need the solution anymore and did the need for the solution create a different Joe Rogan Dan Carlin or Joe Blow out on the street than would have been otherwise we talked about creating a more formidable human being having to overcome my childhood boredom created a more formidable human being dead Dan Carlin we just did three hours again just went flying but always done it always does we got to do this more often we always say this but can we please I may I may do a book suya Caillou would you like to have a stupid book tour interview when you gonna do that I don't know virtual reality comes out let's please sit down and talk more often I really I really enjoy and I just so you know you're one of the most open-minded people though and I do quote you at time because you've taught me a lot well thank you brother and you've taught me a lot too I appreciate it Dan Carlin ladies and gentlemen hardcore history go download subscribe [Music]
