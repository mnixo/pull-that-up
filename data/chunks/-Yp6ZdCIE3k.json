I'm Morgan yeah masters are out there I use one out three two one boom and we're live we're just talking about target panic ladies and gentlemen sure those people don't know about all that's like erectile dysfunction for archery it's a panic right yeah free panic because you want that arrow to go so bad by the way thanks for having me on my pleasure I understand from all the input I get from all my intelligent friends that you deserve me oh so you're your assistant reached out and said my people reach out yes she said I think you'll have more in common with Ted than you realize yeah I was hurt that was her pitch truth logic common sense spirit physics of the American Dream perhaps controversial and misunderstood people yes boy we're surrounded yeah maybe both a clusterfuck ring any bells yes indeed so yeah so target panic I got lucky in that uh I got hooked up with John Dudley early before I developed target panic he's the master and he explained to me two choices yeah shot sequences yeah and let's let's make this available universally to all of our podcast friends out there okay in life the clusterfuck to omniscience is what we aspire to yes maximum level of awareness on all fronts I don't care if you're a welder a podcast or a guitar player or a butcher right maximum efficiency being the best that you can be clear mind clear conscience true north compass in the world of archery because it does consume you and Here I am seventy years clean and sober because I'm currently and forever consumed with the mystical flight of the air which is the origins of Zen the Japanese religion of not shooting an arrow not being an arrow but being the path of your life and if you use the gifts from God to the ultimate application of efficiency and effectiveness you can put that fucking arrow right right what you want it to and the baggage that all humans have to deal with in its most painfully manifested in the pursuit of archery is too many minds you can't think about it if you got to think about playing Wang dang sweet poontang you ain't gonna play it it better just be you and unleash and with an arrow because you want to let that arrow go because they're shooting it now in our jury I need to put that arrow down there and that bullseye on that pump station or that crease of the Buffalo and so you want it to go because that's what you're here for is to let the arrow go so you got to tell yourself you can't let the arrow go you have to shoot so many arrows throughout your life that no no too many Minds subconscious physics of spirituality ingrained deep within your origins and Aboriginal ancestry there it is if ever there was an aim small miss small perfection its archery and let me I don't mean to monologue here this is so much of my life I know no matter what you do and I've done this since the 60s when the hippies were trying to get me stoned I'm gonna no that's not what you want to do what you want to do is get a bow and arrow what you want to do is escape what you're trying to escape the pressures the pressures fuck those pressures you be the source of pressure not the receiver of pressure and my dad raised me my dad was a drill sergeant god bless that son of a bitch he was awesome I hated him discipline discipline discipline discipline especially at the archery range and so I learned archery and when I'm playing guitar and I'm playing all this outrageous Chuck Berry Bo Diddley a little Richard stuff and everybody's getting high and drunk and they're really great musicians and the more high and the more joint they got they became less great musicians until the point where they weren't even musicians anymore and so I would escape that it has 11 12 and there was no hippies it was beatniks and I'd get back to my little house in Redfern on the Rouge River in Detroit and I get me a little bow and arrow and I go down to skunk hollow and in River rat and even as a stupid mushy brained idiot child I was able to the blonde bono recurs yet you know I could shoot a rat in the eye because I had no baggage yet I haven't developed any social baggage and that has served me so the many minds what happened many no minds bright so that's the baggage yeah too many mind I think what does he think that that's the thing that people who don't shoot arrows when you start talking about this they don't really understand what you're saying I know exactly what you're saying but for a lot of people this is a very misunderstood subject alright you know that this is a meditation there's a meditation involved in the absolute meditate uhit's out-of-body the ultimate arrow like the ultimate guitar lick I suspect a comedian on stage which I qualify you can't be thinking of your routine it's kind of flow I mean I was in the presence of Sam Kinison for 5060 spontaneous performances and Robin Williams at the Comedy Store and Lillian and Richard Pryor you see remember I mentioned a moment ago I've been on the mountaintop with Bill strop and the Broncos and Parnelli Jones taught me to race I played bass for Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley I mean I married mrs. Nugent I mean I've been to the peak of Peaks available to mankind I hunted with Fred fucking bear when did you do that I have five or six I met him he was started the brand-new archery shop and grayling Michigan my dad was already a follower before I was exploited to people who he is Red Bear people uninitiated powerful story he's like the Richard Pryor of archery yes I was expecting his afro to catch fire any moment it was awesome so I'm already into bows and arrows I don't know who fredbear was I really was just getting you know baptized by the Chuck Berry abode eerie electronic guitar orgy and in that late 40s early 50s it was a firestorm of defiance and rebellion musically manifested but Roy Weatherby was going beyond the 3030 which everybody used for deer hunting and it was a good hundred yard and for real marksman real Zen marksmen could shoot a 30-30 200 plus yards where their open sights are scoped and marksmanship and sniper discipline was a powerful force in a hunting family and in family every family I knew we all shot every weekend pistols shotguns rifles 22s huntin woodchucks in Fryeburg Pennsylvania with the Targetmaster remington single-shot bowl 2012 cents a box at the dry goods store it's awesome and wait my dad taught me to shoot him in the eye aim small miss small breathe site acquisition you have a responsibility to kill that animal outright if you're gonna utilize that precious gift of flesh and fur body fluids and bone you better kill him clean because you're a reasoning predator you have a moral intellectual and spiritual obligation to kill your dinner humanely and cleanly duh and so that marksmanship routine was developing with ballistic Ted Nugent ballistically maximized firepower and ROI well it stands for I thought it said bad motherfucker you know that has a ring to it maybe then maybe that's what it could all right yeah so threadbare fredbear so Roy Weatherby was extending long-range marksmanship and developing the the famous Weatherby Magnum with more powder more efficient burning powder better primers better designed ballistic bullets that would cut air better and go flatter longer better trajectory and velocity and so it was fun to shoot that deer or a bull's eye at a hundred yards that takes a lot of trigger control and discipline but now Roy Weatherby was creating whether it be magnums the 300 Weatherby Magnum shot 180 or 80 green bullet you know thirty to thirty four hundred feet a second which was unheard of and so you could aim small miss small and if you really got that really intricate meticulous triggered smoothness you could shoot thousand yards once you learn the trajectory of your gun however 1911 the last of the yani Indians ischium was discovered in Oroville I can't believe I remember all this in Oroville California Northern California and there was a bounty on Indians back then you could shoot a man Indian and get 25 bucks 19:11 yep they had bounties on him and instead of shooting this Yanni this last Indian they called the local sheriff and they took ishi into custody and they called some scientists and Pawlenty ologists from California University by the name of our Saxton Pope and Saxton Pope came and studied a Shi as a as a Aboriginal lastin Pope of Pope in young that's right and then he contacted his buddy art Young who also studied in that genre and they discovered a Shi and they were fascinated by his stealthy awareness of that wilderness in his archery control with his funny little style of shooting the bow with his thumb and getting close and doing ice-cold River bathing before the hunt to cleanse himself to be worthy of the beast so fred bear witnessed the film that pope and young eventually made of them becoming consumed with the mystical flight of the arrow now this was in the 20s and 30s and they put a newsreel out when all over the country and showed this newsreel of hunting with the bow and arrow by Saxon Pope and aren't young shooting grizzly bears in Yosemite and going to Africa filling Lions full of arrows because they they weren't really as good as he sheep so they'd fling a lot of arrows and these animals were pretty relaxed almost tame because they'd never been hunted like that before and so fret bear come from Pennsylvania around that time to work at the for moat company building cabinets for the new radio they just invented in the wood dashboards for the Ford Motor Company and he was also making bows handmade you would and/or Osage orange bows in his little archery shop with Nels grumbly I can't believe I remembered Nels grumbling one of the greatest Boyer's of all time so my dad got the archery bug because Fred defied the trend of easier hunting easier long-range you didn't have to be very stealthy to shoot a deer 500 yards they don't even know you're there I have to do is be a disciplined marksman which is a discipline and a great accomplishment unto itself and it was a new challenge for long-range ballistic capability well Pope and young and a handful fredbear Nels grumbly went and saw this newsreel of these guys these doctors these professors hunting all over the world with these handmade bows and Fred was already into it and he was I'll be damned this I didn't realize you could do that and so now people after seeing the pope and young newsreel started asking fred to make bows and it spreads so he started the bear archery company late 20s early 30s and he moved to grayling up in the northern part of Michigan where the wilderness was and they had cut down all the trees so there was this new growth of ideal wildlife habitat because not many animals can live in an old-growth forest an owl were too but you need low-level escape sanctuary in browse that the animals can access and so fred was now promoting archery in michigan won all the national field archery championship and Championships along with an Marston it's awesome it's so my dad was a follower because he'd come back from World War two and he needed that escape he needed that cleansing to get away from that horror which is why they never talked about it and so we'd go up north every year October 1st the Nugent family and the Ford station wagon and I have my little bow and arrow with the suction cups and I cheap stuffed animals off the couch but my dad would walked the woods with his real bow and we'd stopped at this little brick Shack that said bear archery and I had no idea and so I was already into bows and arrows shooting all the time I was obsessed I was under downriver every day no baseball no football no hockey bows and arrows bows narrows critters I think I had the songbird world slam by the time I was 8 and and so now I'm eating this tall lanky gentleman named Fred bear and didn't register with me until I started seeing him on the cover of true magazine and sporting magazines and in Life magazine with a grizzly bear and an elephant and a tiger and a lion in the newsreels and I'm I'm shooting River Rats which is so thrilling I can't even describe it and here's this long lanky tall lanky guy that was building bows in this rust rustic shop in northern Michigan on my way to my favorite thing in life October first opening day of archery season as a 6 7 8 year old boy and we'd have chocolate milk and cherry pie with this fredbear guy now it's registering this is the Chuck Berry of boning This Is It this is the guy so I became enamored with him and he was kind to me and he'd show me stuff but I got to hang out with him as I grew by the time I was 16 we moved to Chicago as my dad got transferred but I got to visit with Fred bear at least every other October never hunted with him and I'm now I started Amboy Dukes I'd already had a great band won the Battle of the Bands in Michigan with the Lord's we opened up for The Supremes and the Beau Brummel's at Cobo Hall Wow and so now I'm in Chicago shooting my boner all the time started to the Amboy Dukes playing like a madman graduated in 67 went back to Michigan that two years later and immediately went up to grayling where now there's this huge cathedral bear archery and Fred bear is like that dude he's like the sporting dude because he taught the long-range marksman that there's an intimacy there's a a better learning process in a more important lesson to not kill the animal but to understand your relationship with the animal and to try to use those god-given gifts I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate the otherwise impenetrable defense system of game because they are sneaky elusive crafty God made them to get away from guitar players with sharp sticks and so this caught on because people go you know I kill my deer every year with my 3030 now with the 30 out of 6 and Roy breath rather be long-range I wonder if I'm a badass enough to get close to a deer with a bow and arrow so it caught on like wildfire and they made the first Fred got the first legal season in Michigan the Allegan State Park on November 1st 1947 where George Nichols my buddy got the first legal buck in Michigan with a bow and arrow on that morning and so I knew these these were the founders these were like you were I was at the Concord bridge of our tree and so Fred embraced me and it was real suspicious of the long-haired hippie looking you know rocking maniac Motor City Madman but all of his friends would nah know he's not into drugs he's in fact he's anti drug and he's always promoting our trash shot my bow and arrow on stage forever I'd shoot flaming arrows at skulls and a big illegal I think it was a felony a big turkey vulture I add stuff but it looked great backlit you know and I'd shoot that fucker off this amps at night people didn't know whether to shit or go blind is this wild man screen the bird lands making all this outrageous racket I come out with a bow and arrow and a flaming arrow and blow up a turkey vulture what more do you want and so Fred look got look past the insanity of the fear factor of rock and roll and he finally admitted to me said every sporting goods show I go to Ted all the young people anybody under 30 all they want to know is if I know Ted Nugent because that was the first time they ever saw a bow and arrow and they read my you my interviews about the the spirit the cleansing of escaping the insanity of whatever your job description might be mind beating maniacal rock and roll I need to shut the fuck up take a deep breath get my bow and arrow let my guitars breed head back to the woods and and remember who I am and what I'm here for and I never killed a deer I was just a little too uppity and we didn't know what we were doing back then you were too uppity you think what do you mean I just I'm high energy so you're too I do I wasn't the stealthy I'll about too loud I'm a tacit Walker I learned from Fred I learned to walk toe first and I learned to go around anything yet instead of stepping over and to stay in the shadows so I knew the maneuvers but coming out of the tour and playing 350 nights a year and then you get a couple days off during November you get the bow and arrow it's hard to go from that to total songs yes but you know what Joe what I've mastered it I know yeah finally I mean I did but you've been you might have six along by the 60s I I don't know about masters you'll never master it but I had mastered the trends hey what do you say when people like that one of the arguments about hunting that people will bring up is why would you use in a bow and arrow a bow and arrows not as effective if you wanted to kill something you should use a gun there's people that don't hunt that think that hunting should only be one thing and it should only be killing the animal from me whereas I think that someone who hunts definitely kills the animal from me oh there's more there's more to the whole thing and you ever seen me expound on that fun sport meat yeah trophy you can't hunt without having fun or you won't do it it's fun to challenge yourself it's fun to get up and go some people have a problem with that word just my ass if it wasn't fun none of us would do it I understand your your take on it they can kiss your ass but you it means something to you it's not as simple as like fuck you this is just how we're gonna do deep yeah this is being the greatest basketball 3-point shooter isn't that fun must be discipline you win but it's all it's always fun it's because it's invigorating right and the bow hunting is more invigaron because it's so difficult so the borderline impossible fun sport it well I don't think sport hunting is good you shouldn't have sport how can you hunt without sport don't you think there's just too many of these words or and there's like Kofi hunting by it can't hunt without a trophy you know what I have on my wall to my northern cabin you're gonna you already are inclined to love me but now you're really gonna you're going for you too but fuck me right here on it loved well it's a metaphorically speaking for some of my buddies anyhow so on the wall of my cabin in northern Michigan here's my first kill November 15th 1969 my dad's pre 60 film unlock button buck do you hear the story yeah and I took it to the taxidermist and I said I want this monitor he said here to mount this oh yeah but button button buck is a fawn of the year the heads little buttons on his forehead which is a legal deer with a doe tag and I had that year and I said it's a buck feel you have to feel I'm they had to make sure it is a buck is it such a little guy and it's a legal deer and it's a delicious deer they're deer the year is a fawn that's why we have this hunting season in the fall because now they're independent they're not they're been weaned they're they're independent animals in fact the the button bucks are their asses get kicked by their mother to throw them out of the herd get the hell out of the way for more breeding which is what I do and and so I have that button buck mounted well who's gonna tell me that's not a trophy the the the experiences the memories the clothes the bullets the day the sunrise the crows the sandhill cranes the birds the movement the anticipation and I got back straps I had fun ultimate discipline challenge sport ultimate meat ultimate protein the purest most organic before it was even hip and if you could I dare you to tell me that button buck is not a trophy I got I have woodchucks mounted I shot a woodchuck in the eye with my grandson well I have I have squirrels ma it's always a trophy mountain squirrel I sure I'm the squirrels are you know when you when you first start out and you kill that first squirrel that's exciting stuff it's it's it's all put a squirrel that you mounted on a limb at the in the cabin along with Rocco Brock my son out here his first wood duck that he got very with much effort and we have that wood duck mounted there's a there's a love affair with our instinctual stewardship duties to the wildlife to harvest the surplus to make room for next spring's productivity because there's going to be more animals but there's not going to be more habitat hence sustained yield successful wildlife management model that is so perfect it defies criticism unless you're a lying sack of shit have you ever had to have a reasonable conversation with someone who's anti-hunting you ever liked soft down yeah often absolutely and to the man and woman I mean adamant vagin until I explained to him well vague and I like that vegan vegan I can't even pronounce much very so stupid by the way my son Rocco who I love beyond description yep vegan no yes yes excited he needs to eat more yeah when he's asleep I tried to shove a back strap up his ass but he's got more muscles than I do anyhow my point is is that how did he become vegan he hasn't died yet he hasn't died Ginny is a great hunter he doesn't like to hunt anymore he's decided not to he's our killed great deer great hogs I've seen him on your TV show yeah he's a great hunter but he just he decided he does not want to take part in the harvest I respect it completely but goodie for you if you really want to kill the most things be a vegan because the farmers who protect your beans kill everything I kill one animal per arrow in order to grow tofu you have to kill every ground squirrel every vole every shrew every snake every turtle every frog every bird every rabbit anything that gets in that bean field I'm either gonna plow and dismember which is why the crows and the and the seagulls follow the the compound that combines over here and then if anything does survived my first slaughter I'm gonna come in with man Santo and poison the shit out of everything so you can have a tofu salad and not be responsible for any death fuck you that's a really good point a lot of people ignore in a void because it's it's uncomfortable isn't life full of uncomforted thing and you shouldn't be uncomfortable to kill game to feed mankind is perfect to kill cows and pigs to feed mankind it's the system is often less than perfect but until someone comes up with a better system I salute and genuflect at the altar of farmers and ranchers and people who kill animals to sustain my fellow man I agree with you I think you and I would probably both disagree with factory farming when you see animals stuffed into cages but we have come up with a better system I killed a lot of deer and I feed more people than any any hunter ever okay kill so many much gamer of yours I have to I have to I know how your sharpshooters I I kill the animals on my beautiful swamp in Michigan in my Texas property that have to die they have to get out of there to make room for the next year responds so I've soup kitchens homeless sure I literally give tons and and I'm a sweetheart but I'm not an idiot I keep the backstraps but I give tons of venison to soup kitchens and homeless shelters and veterans we make jerky and send it over to the troops overseas I mean I have to adjust my Heil or just to get in the room so what I do is literally perfect well this the problem is what you do everybody can't do like everybody's not gonna have your kind of laying people could though more people could yes well you are you definitely I know the hunters for the hungry distribute 250 250 million Joe 250 million meals every year a venison and there are people that would ban that shame on you well I did I just think there's a lot of films and a lot of documentaries that portray veganism as being this perfect way of living that doesn't have any death or right habitat loss associated with it and they look at the extreme of meat-eating which is the worst aspects of it factory farming some of these disgusting pig farms and chickens disgusting horrible horrifying and their the upgrade because more alarms have been sounded not by paid and not by the Humane Society United States they're just scam artists by people who are coming to realize that we do not only have a responsibility to kill critters to feed mankind but it can be done in an environmentally beneficial way I mean if you watch my great late friend Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew Zimmern on the Travel Channel you watch their shows and the emphasis on environmentally-friendly productivity more and more organic farming more and more conscientious waste dispersal whether it's you know pig guts and they we utilize those or in Las Vegas to get all this wasted food and they feed the pigs so it's good food going in and the pork tastes better so there is upgrade taking place and here's the ultimate inescapable fact of upgrade environmentalism when I was growing up Joe Lake Erie would catch fire because of the pollution it wasn't environmentalists or greenies that sounded the arm it was the duck hunters that said you're polluting this area so bad there's no ducks there's no wild salary there's no walleyes there's no fish there's no muskrats for the trappers hunters fishermen and trappers have sounded the alarm more often than not about environmental irresponsibility and now Lake area that would spontaneously combust when I was growing up is now the number one walleye in smallmouth bass fishery in the world and it's still we're still producing you still got the industrial revolution going on there but conscientious higher responsible level of awareness is spreading like wildfire across the country and I believe that there's no mutual exclusivity whatsoever to productivity and environmental responsibility I believe that they both benefit each other and I've got so many unlimited examples where that worked from farms I mean people who live downwind of a painful big farm are going to be the biggest squawkers rightly so yeah and and so I see a lot of upgrade going on more organic more conscientious less waste it's not it's not as regular operating procedures it should be but I see upgrade I see I think you're right and I think that the the thought process behind all these people that are upset about factory farming people even that go vegan the thought process behind it is in the right place I just think there's a lot of misguided energy there because they don't really understand where the food is coming from they don't understand large-scale agriculture they understand when you and a lot of large scale agriculture is to grow food to feed animals essential yeah yeah but it's also wheat there's also a lot of grain that people consume and that displaces thousands and thousands of acres of animals sure and the the process is not a clean process it's not clean in terms of there's no death there's no harm its cruelty free just crazy it's not as if you can possibly go through a day without having blood on your hands do you drive on the highways does any of your sustenance come on the highways because billions of animals are slaughtered on the highways every day and if you are on planet earth part of that blood is on your and you've got to be who doesn't know this who's not willing to admit this but again I see an upgrade in level of awareness and responsibility but the charge began in the hunting fishing and trapping community because where does where does quality air soil and water come from I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife habitat well it's a lot of the people that are out there every day they are recognized in more and more you know I used to I still get death threats because I murder innocent animals yeah now I get those too what the hell so it's just so absurd and I think there are their heart like nice-nice they just don't know what they're talking know they're just haters there's a bit of that how in 2018 do you not acknowledge barbecue how in 2018 do you not acknowledge there's a few dead turkeys on Thanksgiving what emu gotta be brain dead I think they're so consumed with hate that they fight ignorant is acceptable I'm ignorant of when I go to the Indy 500 I couldn't tuna Cogsworth I don't Cogsworth ignorance is acceptable because you can remedy it with knowledge and research stupidity is when you guard your ignorance if you think that we're murdering innocent animals to feed our families with the purest protein available to mankind balancing the herds with more deer more elk more bison more turkeys more waterfowl more cougars more bears than ever in recorded history except for the Bison but we're way back we have as many bison as we can sustain in North America lot of the Native American tribes are desperate to get more harvested in an efficient and responsible manner so wildlife is thriving because hunters implemented regulations for sustained yield how many ducks can we kill how many will they reproduce where is their habitat where determines their reproduction we must safeguard that Delta waterfowl ducks are limited but see this information is universally available but the fake news academia Hollywood and half of our government is stone-cold obsessed with political correctness and denial yeah so I do what I do and our spirit of the wild showed but number one an outdoor channel is just 29 years now wow I'm getting old because we say it like it is we don't play around fun sport meet trophy sacred beasts prayer for the wild things resource stewardship conservation wise use walk the wild ground before you comment on the wild ground yeah duh well this is what I'm talking about when you're talking about that last Indian that they found the guy yeah River study Ishii okay I will write it down what suppose I Sh I you have to learn house I'm gonna send you a bunch of stuff I'm gonna get your contacts and I'm gonna send you stuff it will expand your horizons like you didn't know was available there history of modern bow hunting at the hands of Fred bear and and in Saxon Pope and aren't young and the families that wanted to get closer to game not necessarily kill because 90% of the time you don't kill squat with a bow and arrow but when you do it's because you dedicate yourself to a higher reasoning level predator awareness and you put your gifts from God to the maximum efficiency and again that's welding and carpentry but ultimately you're going to kill some you better kill it clean and being human and failing overall to be perfect you can be perfect and put that error when you learn to read the wild signals the the the attitude and the the the bird indicators when the deers come and you use the the light the wind the camo stealthy movements silenced and learned time mad shot my average deer dies in five seconds the the top of the hearts taken off both lungs are penetrated that deer falls asleep on his feet and there's never been a beefsteak ever had it so good the also there's a connection to what you're doing that's different than almost any other connection to food I mean the only thing that's reasonably close and it's pretty far off as when you grow it yourself so if you grow your own vegetables you got a connection to that food but that's the same it's not the same connection as you get no because you're just gonna send an arrow through an animal you look at its eyes you're looking at size but also that you know how difficult it is and when you pull it off there's this powerful connection between you and that animal you earn and you eat you earn it oh boy yeah and when you eat it you feel that you earned it I'm to tell the joy out of it when Anthony Bourdain came to my place he was still a little squeamish with kill and stuff even though he ate dead stuff on every show and got his paycheck from eating dead stuff Greg Manning he's a great man terrible loss terrible loss and we talked about it and I I shared my knowledge with him I'm not I don't have an opinion it's an animal it's dead you either Revere it or you don't you either utilize it with respect or you pretend you didn't have anything to do with it it's dead you're eating it you should have been closer to the system and the hunters fishermen and trappers of this country still carry on the definitive physics of spirituality that the native and original people's called the great spirit hence the spirit of the wild the prayer for the wild things but we're in a weird place Ted with with cities right we're right where you were yeah but I mean you got lucky and that your father was interested in bow hunting and that it gave him an escape which by the way it gives a lot of veterans today a lot of veterans and good friends of mine are finding the elds great relief in bow hunting as a discipline after combat life yeah talking to a guy that shared many campfires with those guys it's a narrator last night great transition for them it's consuming yes fredbear uses the phrase coin the phrase and I use it all the time it cleanses the soul when you leave the pavement when I leave the pavement and I make that transition from modern concrete jungle hand-to-hand combat City I because that's where my rock-and-roll career is the ultimate and you take that deep breath you literally go back to the Year 100 highway nearby and I know I can hear trucks off in the distance and the train whistle which is kind of titillating unto itself but when I get in my swamp in Michigan or my woods in Texas to quote Jimi Hendrix ain't no life of nowhere I am the aborigine it's me my resources and the beast and it's a it's a religious experience it's the spirit that it natives call it the great spirit thief to consider the Buffalo there brother and it is so consuming that I don't care what kind of stress you could be going through the ugliest divorce in the world and I have you could be fighting against people who don't think that America should be first and you don't need secure borders and and you don't need to earn your own way you're able-bodied but you want somebody else's income you're just crazy shit and all of a sudden I get out there and I'm telling you Joe it's perfect yeah I'm I'm literally intoxicated I'm I'm drunk I'm stoned trying to pick up all the signals and I do I do a pretty good job I've learned over the years because I need that so much to play my music like I play it that it cleanses my soul and I've been contacted since the 60s with vets who have gone through just absolute torture in their military careers and when I get them at a campfire and we go out and sit before the Sun comes up I can't tell you how many times they've cried because it's it's good again it was a great morning I didn't have any stress forgot all about that bullshit when I thought I heard the deer then when I saw the deer it was perfect so you've expressed that and I thank you for that because you're new to this sport yeah and for you to be an advocate and to articulate you learn because you're already a mature man when you entered it I was a dirtball mushy brain kid but thank God I learned about that spirit I learned about the discipline I learned about stewardship callings and responsibilities of course pounded by my dad god bless him and my brothers my sister we all are happy healthy successful hard work and funny cocky loving giving people because of that discipline that revolved around my family hunting seasons well discipline is one of the big word that there was one of the really important aspects of it because I recognize the importance of discipline and always have pretty much my whole life as a martial artist especially yeah so I came into or I handed up you were ahead of the curve you well when I recognized it I was like oh I know what this is a different thing this is not what everybody thinks it is and this is a this is a spiritual experience yes and because you were around the Masters Cameron Haynes yeah you had John Dudley on you Steve Rinella as the one who got me Steve he's a Michigan boy yeah yeah that's uh that they were good mentors for you I just lucky you got past the mistaken yet irresponsibly and dishonestly promoted aspect of the drunken hillbilly sighing shooter hunter well yeah that stereotype is so ridiculous I mean my friends like guys like Cameron Haines he's a goddamn ultra marathon runner runs 240 miles in a week and then you know is on the mountains all fall long I had mofo I'm glad he doesn't play guitar yeah he's a bad motherfucker but he's he's an incredibly disciplined guy sure this is his life is and he he'll tell everybody all that stuff that he does all the working out that's so can be at his best in the mountains as a bow hunter sure that he considers his true spiritual calling and I ever tell you're sitting across from a guy and I'm not bragging I'm just kind of sharing yeah but it's it's a celebration you know I have been humbled and blessed beyond description to share campfires with more hunters than anybody you've ever met because I've been donating hunts for years I started my sunrise safaris i guide hundreds of hunters every year I don't take them all out to their stand but we all get together at my Michigan place have 24 and a weekend 20 and a weekend and it's a campfire get down with uncle Ted playing guitar but we shoot our bows we shoot our guns we set things up a lot of them are newcomers I guide on my spirit wild ranch in Texas I guide in New Brunswick and Ontario their Kid Rock into bow hunting yes I did yeah that's a great story as well remember that discipline word we're talking about he's working on that but his girlfriend is a killer no she is a killer gorgeous gal but that Audrey is a dangerous bow hunting woman I mean always killing stuff it's possible she's addicted I get I get peace from her all the time and never from Bob that's hilarious she's awesome I'll start sharing that stuff with y'all turn you on to a higher level of appreciation of Finance women with her sharp stick this gal between my wife Germaine and Audrey I'm telling you yeah but anyhow the guys that you've hunted with you're talking about great human beings yeah men of integrity and discipline and productivity and a drive to be in the asset column and misunderstood because because of movies very rarely I get a tough life I was about to say I share campfires with lots of newcomers because they see it as rock and roll guy that they love the music and we share the appreciation for my American rhythm and blues rock and roll jihad and so they want to try hunting and they come to my hunt with me or they make a donation for a military of children's charity and they've never hunted and I'd tell them what to buy and they show up and it's Maddy bump man your daddy bump oh no need to get into that any help down to spout and I'm gonna sell Emma said it yeah James Fenimore Cooper he was a character in his last of Mohicans okay that's a new hunter natty bump oh he's like a novice of rookie anyhow I get a lot of these people and you know I've never met anybody at any of my campfires that wasn't honest it wasn't friendly wasn't successful to some degree whether it's a teacher on a teacher's salary successful there a teacher that's successful who care deeply about the wildlife and the wild grounds so when you hear about wow that drunken bombs just shoot at everything well nobody's spent more time with more hunters than I have I've never seen that or even seen there's not a priest that butt-fuck kids right you know but that's not the priesthood right I hope so there's always gonna be a burnt dipshit demonic behavior by our fellow man somehow somehow but it is so rare in the hunting world that I again I that's all I do seven months a years hunt well I haven't hunted as much as you but I've been around a lot of great people great people yeah and it goes right back to fredbear which is to start off of our dialogue here great man we hunted until 1987 together in October and he was on oxygen then he passed away have you ever heard the song yeah that bear song and then that song happened with a life of its own because of my love and admiration for the man and the way and what he represented someone like that that just carries that torch further than everyone and it was so important we had time where there was no indication that your I'd have to the animal rights thing hadn't really started meaningfully yet political correctness which wasn't even coined there was no fake news there was the beginning of the attack on hunting from you know ignorant Siddha fied people that somehow believed that their food didn't die or they're not responsible for any death and so they would you know played the holier-than-thou dishonesty move by attacking those of us that actually took part in the process of feeding our families and Fred was such a gentleman and he was so clever and he so efficiently promoted the challenge and the intimacy of man and wild connection that he will live in infamy everybody in the hunting world knows that he was a force to reckon with and he's always there and as the song says in the wind he's still alive and it's power from that well a lot of people know of him because of you oh yeah but more people have learned about Fred from me than from the archery industry do you do you this this conversation you've been having this conversation about hunting forever I mean I've heard a lot of these things you're saying today before from you is this do you ever get tired of being this evangelist no no no I love it so much and the other side is so dishonest that I know I make inroads euro to my Facebook and you know sauce do you think they're ignorant they know that they know that it's just gonna be new phones next year but there's not gonna be any new grummy know this they know that venison is good food right but they don't think of it that way well they're gonna think of it that's why I continue to do this because I caused them to think I can tell you thousands of examples since the 60s where people thought I was a coward for murdering innocent animals that can't shoot back what does that even mean what I mean they can't shoot back your left trigger fingers you jerk so I have taken this on and you notice I smiled throughout the whole thing I don't get angry so I know that by continuing to promote in the absence of any education in our education system fact is the opposite animal rights gets more time in our education system our anti education the media lion sons of bitches Hollywood goofy half of the government out to lunch so guys like you and me that know the truth we should never give up because there is a scourge of political correctness and dishonesty and that's what political correctness is it's denial and dishonesty and I know we're making inroads you should see the bombardment I got Joe's a big hunter now he's really a fighter he speak cleverly he speaks accurately and and passionately about it hallelujah there's a bunch of us out there with the advent of the Outdoor Channel and sportsman's channel the pursuit Network more and more people are getting you know wind of what we're doing I think a lot of it from the Internet to nd a monster communication yeah people I think people understand that there's more to it than they thought and if they're willing to just look a little bit further look a little bit further they realize like well especially Western hunting yeah these guys are running Hills and they're they're they're backpacking with heavy weights on their back discipline for hours and hours every day just build up their endurance so they can hike out with me these Western hunters man that are going ahead mofos yeah bo hunting elk and then packing them out by themselves or of course a five-day edible job I went to Alaska first when I was 20-something I guess I must have been 28 my first Alaska trip 77 when I was out there for two weeks and a soggy wet nasty cold tent a pup tent with George fair bear and I got a giant caribou a great black bear and a big old moose and boy humping them quarters in that that tundra yeah I thought I was a Superman athletic you know amplifier jumping rock and roll sinew muscle boy my ass kick carrying a moose shoulder oh just one big moose when you see one in real life it's hard to believe that that's a real animal and that goes back to what you were said earlier that when you dine on that and you put that effort forth and you spent all those days skunked and wet and cold and nasty enjoying it through what it was but there's also a pain in the ass you can't get wait to get back to some place with a wood burner but when you've packed it out yourself when you take that sacred flesh off that grill before you even finish the first knife slice all those memories and it just tastes better and it really does taste better but with that effort it is a spiritual moment that this like the natives say you don't kill the animal you accept the gift if you put your heart and soul into your reasoning predator ship and that's always been my mantra and my kids are all raised on venison that we just don't buy meat that's all we eat is the stuff we kill pheasants and quail and doves and Woodcock and grouse and rabbits and squirrels and ducks and geese and gully mules and snipe pen and and beavers and and deer and elk and antelope and bear and cougar it's the greatest food in the world I'm 70 years old and I'm forced to reckon with because of my discipline diet of the ultimate rocket fuel available on planet you really do look good for seven my head look fucking fantastic I had some sleep I'd be downright handsome but you think about you know the average person that's been eating the average American diet for seven years oh by the time they're your age they're deteriorating rapid and the fructose the chemicals the preservatives oh my god here's if I may on the Joe Rogan podcast please do my friends get rid of the goddamn sugar if you can't pronounce it on the package do not buy it do not feed your children high fructose poisoning my god people get the poisons out of your blubber --is-- lives good food is so simple buy a what catch a fish or buy a fish buy some fresh or grow some fresh vegetables put real butter and use the real fat don't take the skin off the chicken that's where all the good fat is that's where all the flavor is and eat real food wow we can't afford that no you can't afford not to everything that says diet on it or no sugar is poison it's not my opinion it's a chemical reality and when you when you die when you attempt to digest fructose and preservatives your body goes I don't recognize this bullshit we can't process this and it turns into blubber and here's a little update blubber is for sperm whales not people if you have to lift up slabs to dry off after the shower your diet sucks I saw you in an interview once a long time ago before I started wife done a budget I know you have but when I saw you I was like how's this guy have so much fucking energy I remember thinking that I'm like this guy's so fired up and then you started talking about your diet started talking about you said all I eat is venison and start going off about backstraps and then I started thinking like what like think about the dark red meat of wild game before you became a hunter yeah well quite a few years before I flirted with it for several years can't be flirted with I didn't have anybody to take and get a swan dive into it I got lucky Steve annuity with a mass on his show I know Steve doesn't like me but he's my huh why say he doesn't like you I've heard comments with his attacking me for the wacom and stack them because it would be much better if I just butchered them and slaughtered them because semantics is so important oh the way you phrase things wacom and stack them yeah it's fun I'm whack and I'm stacking I got 12 blue gills that's a stack shut the fuck up well people think that you're outrageous behavior is somehow detrimental to the the movement of acceptance stupid people do but the people who come and join the sport because of my exuberance don't well I would say that god bless Steve Rinella and God bless Cameron all those guys I revere them they're masters of their craft I have caused more young people to become hunters than all other forces in the world case closed because I'm having so much fucking fun they go hey this guy's out of control bows and arrows let's get up don't kill them they absolutely come to it because of the fun then they hear about the discipline and they hear about the quality diet and they hear about the spiritual trophy whether antlers or not that has guided my passionate life and manifests itself in these killer songs and killer guitar licks an outrageous fire-breathing concert and they go fuck I can do that and so they get a bone marrow they should get a shotgun they start hunting go to my facebook I don't know if it's millions but thousands and thousands of young people that would be inclined to be anti-hunting are now gun hole hunters because uncle Ted is having so much fun because I whack them and stacked them well congratulations with that yeah the the the thing is that they don't get when they hear your enthusiasm then they go okay well I haven't had this perspective before their perspective on hunting that I've gotten before is that these are cruel assholes that go out there and shoot animals and they don't care and or worse or worse Joe my critics and I don't mention any names but you know when they're on their hunting TV shows and they're so ultra cautious not to ruffle any feathers they kind of come off like mr. Rogers with a Lawrence Welk soundtrack and young people think you're a fuckin asshole if that's all you've got in a family and of hunting is that boring I think I'll just smoke some dope and go you know cruisin tonight which I know you like to smoke your dope in and I'll call it dope and go nuts County called do you call Mara well I'm a cop yeah there you go well but hot but I got buddies and Idriss Deby for that I just don't think that comfortably numb' is the way to go in fact I have a song song I ever well you won or better song shit without my new record it's called uncomfortably dumb my point is is are you a father yes you want your babysitter hi uh no how about your doctor no but what you pilot I don't want my babysitter sleeping either you don't want to what sleeping I want them paying attention you know so that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get high ever just means you shouldn't get high when you're watching kids damn right yeah or when you're flying my plane or you know compromise me doing anything delicate you know the only guy I want hi who my comedians it help like steroids I was there when Richard Pryor and and Robin Williams and Sam Kinison and God knows go ahead and snored anything you got motherfucker cuz I need to laugh till I shit it's hard to come up with that shit sober I do every night I'm a funny son of a bitch you gotta come see my show I want to I have so much fun on stage it's stupid I think the perceptions about pot are very similar to the perceptions about there's a lot of people that abuse pot they abused alcohol the abuses that people abused every sure doesn't mean you can't use it responsibly I agree unfortunately in my 60 years of pursuing the Chuck Berry soundtrack of Ultra James Brown type music I have never seen anything but heartbreak from drugs from the drug use yeah even a mnemonic new council by the way working with President Trump to legalize medical marijuana nationwide we don't want you to know that and I'm all for that that is awesome I deal with a lot of terminally ill kids and there's nothing that's off-limits to take away that suffering no I need to fight for that well it's great for people with epilepsy as well absolutely lot of kids sure kids autism I got my bag out in the truck some guys making water with cannabis oil with the CD B's and Marta CBD yeah yeah and it says it'll help me relax after my sonic bombast torture I'm just on stage every night I'm sure will think I have drinks unless yeah well I know you've had some problems with your knees I have both new knees and that will get them replaced no ma'am jumping off all those amps I never knew I never heard the word meniscus till my doctor said I had none I have a tear Oh mine I just got a stem-cell shots in it yesterday no tennis light I have two brand-new knees and I ain't dancing like the 25 year old Ted Nugent put your walking fine I'm doing fine so I used to have a bad limp right from that shuffle yeah yeah and now they were both gone Steve Tyler was here from Aerosmith yeah he's good he's got a new one he's got one new one and he's thinking about getting another one out of both the same time yeah how long were you down for I was walking the next morning so what do they do exactly well they're going to cut your knee open and they get a hammer and a chisel and they pound out the old shit and put in some metal stuff have you ever see this actually available online you don't want to watch it if you're gonna have it done it's brutal but I had a good surgeon and it came out good and the pain going onstage for so many years since certainly since the year 2000 with the Damn Yankees even what years you get it done mm what is it 18 no 12 maybe so 12 years of pain yeah no it was it was more NAT but up because I jumped off those fucking amplifiers Oh what kind of dirtbag was I somebody should have said you have meniscus well you know save your meniscus you know Maynard Keenan the lead singer tool right he blew his hip out from just stomping on the ground why because the music I have a new record called the music made me do it the music made him do it this music made Steve Tyler do it when you get up there it is a world unto itself it is out of body is stream of consciousness yet yet you got to be careful because you think you're invincible invincible on that stage with my away that movie invincible that you stranglehold best use of my song ever but best you see your song ever was Randy KOTOR coming out to stranglehold in the UFC yeah you're probably right yes I remember that yes and in the Blackhawks in Chicago every gigs for the 25-30 years they play story he came out to stranglehold when he beat Tim Sylvia for the UFC heavyweight title was severe under car underdog and he came out and the place went nuts when steroid says it all so here I come again a baby like a dog in heat she's telling me by the clamor baby I'd like to tear up the street I've been smoking for so long I'm here to stay I've got you in a stranglehold bitch get the fuck out of my way well knock an awesome you get it's a love song you getting excited it's a love song the connection between rock-and-roll guitarist and bowhunting for most people's like a big stretch just a wrench it's like well how are those different galaxies yeah different universes yeah except for the most important elements and that is discipline yeah the focus to create and I've been so blessed beyond words to have the greatest musicians at my side for ever for literally 60 years right now I got Greg Smith on the bass guitar just a god of thunder Greg Smith the best like a funk brother in heat and Jason heartless 23 year old drummer from Detroit is just an absolute animal and every band from my royal high boys and the 50s to the Lord's and the 60s and the Amboy Dukes and even the Damn Yankees with Tommy and Jack and Michael are you kiddin me I've had literally the a list of musicians at my side from Tommy Aldridge and Tommy Clufetos and Mick Brown and drums and in in cliff Davies are you kidding me Denny Carr Massey I mean the best drummers the best bass players I've just been the luckiest guitar player but it's a weird connection right like most people don't think of rock and roll and bow hunting but to say they're so you think it said no do you do you're the only one but there I was geographically in Michigan a firestorm of musical influence all the best musicians in the world they'll tell you come out of Detroit from Motown Bob Seger now Kid Rock Eminem and just just kill her kill her bands mc5 I got a great Wayne Kramer story he has a wonderful book coming out called the hard stuff ever ever talk to Wayne you need to have Wayne Kramer on your show he kisses them from New York they're from the mc5 but I'm struck city I'm thinking yeah I'm gonna turn you on - Wayne Kramer's got no good book about his tragic mistakes and near-death heroine prison dirtbag maneuvers but he's a great man a musical authority and in the music of Detroit and of course 50s Little Richard how do you not get moved by Little Richard and Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry how do you not how are you not touched by that and then you see him on TV and that is at Sullivan's show it I don't care who you are Steven Tyler or Billy Joel or whoever your Elvis Presley and now the stones and the Beatles are you kidding me on and it's Ed Sullivan and I had a guitar plus I'm in Michigan and I've every kid was born you got a Red Rider Daisy BB gun you had a whammo slingshot and you had a little bow and arrow of some kind I live right next to the Rouge River so I was always down there you know chasing critters and building forts and crossing the river and the music and bowhunting music and the bowhunting I met fredbear I got these great musicians the music and the bowhunting music in the book unbelievable what a life what a dream what a firestorm of cravings and fulfillment of those cravings every day and here it is last night where's my six thousand six hundred and eightieth concert and that goes all the way back to I'm all gotta do all the way back to the 1950s 6,600 you write him down now I did four years I took out all the books and started adding them up but from the from my musical revue with the Royal School of Music in 1958 and then with Joe pidor sick from the Capitol School of Music at the Detroit Fairgrounds and then we started playing sockets and pool parties and malt shops and everywhere you know basement parties I counted those those are gigs and then when the Amboy Dukes started in 65 we'd do 300 concerts three plus 300 a year for many many years and even with the Damn Yankees in the early 90s we did over 200 concerts a year so I added them all up and last year was six thousand six hundred and seventy nine in Okinawa for the US Marine Corps pretty intense and then last night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 6680 tonight is six six eighty one Jesus yeah cool that's why I look tired that's a lot of remedy how do you have the time cuz I always figure out I try to figure out how I have the time to do what I do but I think you do more than I do uh I think we can both agree the greatest philosopher of all times was Dirty Harry when he said a good man knows his limitations back in the app with the Amboy Dukes we do over three hundred concerts a year and I was still craving my hunting so I'd carve out a weekend in October and a weekend in November with my dad and we'd get out there and hunt but that wasn't enough what about practice time with the archery I'd yeah but we're on the road like a blocked our tab salutely you've been in a parking lot somewhere Morelle targets it's got a sponsor right but no I've shot my boy here on stage thousands of contract and then I always have it with me and I always have friends that have bows nails in fact I wish I'd have brought it today because I could show you some the Zen of mystical flight at the air of manoeuvres now you'd a really lightweight bow only fifty pounds yeah you see that new Matthews I shoot the new Triax man they're all there's not a bad boy out there not anymore awesome the competition is awesome so anybody listening the most important thing you tell Joe and I love the mystical flight of the arrow go get you a bow and arrow gets I know shop fine measured find a bow that fits you and make sure it's graceful enough don't struggle when you're starting to reach got to come back mushy archery is grace not power and get that bow so it settles back here for hand-eye coordination and you don't have to struggle people should start with a twenty five thirty pound bow to get that archery thing going preferably an old recruit or longbow if you can and find out where you're pointing where's that arrow going and you will be consumed with it yeah and and that's the way I can really teach you if yeah you have to have a mentor yeah because if you do it wrong and you start getting a bad rap yeah bad habits of play then you get target panic well it's that's a problem with martial arts too it's really important to start off with a good instructor if you learn things poorly first and then try to refix it I'll bet you're still kind of Wired incorrectly yeah yeah it's very difficult and archery as well right that's why America is in trouble because people are learning at schools that's a really good analogy I mean to really learn the wrong stuff I mean it really is what's going on you know you get taught that life is boring droning pay attention to the rules show me the racks show me a graduate from the American anti education system that can balance a checkbook does people do that anymore well they oughta yeah no unfortunately they don't it's the debt you know pragmatism don't want the way of maps yes but you know what I mean that be pragmatic be responsible be accountable utilitarian self sufficiency be the best that you can be call your body the sacred temple that it's supposed to be the reverence eat good be good be the best that you can be be competitive life isn't fair get used to it if you want to excel in life you show up earlier than the competition you work harder than competition you do a better job than a competition you stay later than the competition you'll end up on in the damn company yeah and learning how to think learning how to think and learning how to look at things yeah it's something that's never taught in school and it's one of the most important lessons in your life and you learn that lesson I think through doing difficult things absolutely it had a conversation about you once and someone's like well what do you think he's like I go look this is what you have to understand forget about all the public shit he's awesome at two things that are really hard to be good at guitar and bowhunting varied if they're both very difficult to be disciplined you have to be an exceptional person especially since you sound like such shit for so long in the guitar there's no satisfaction whatsoever you go how many years took years I was the worst all my buddies learned faster than I did in fact I just met up with Donnie Henderson he's probably listening right now and he was in a band called the gang when I had a band called the lawyers we kicked their ass and won the battle of bands in Michigan when I was about 13 or 14 and he and I are still friends and he's I guess he's gonna be 70 soon too and he played all the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley stuff perfect and I'm stumbling and making stupid noises but you know what happened because I couldn't figure out the exact licks I created my own style and I started playing people thought I was being clever but doing them wrong it still had a good rhythm yeah yeah like John Coltrane meets you know a punk kid playing Bo Diddley lick and so I developed my own style and I've had a lot of fun with it but with all your question as though with all your media all the stuff that you do you're constantly doing interviews and phone-in interviews you're constantly doing things how do you have time to do all this still write music I have a great team you were talking about Linda getting a hold of your team Linda Peterson's been with me for 30 years Doug bankers been my manager for over 30 years of all my crew Chris Helms and Jim Knapp and my sons and my dog my wife Charmaine is the goddess I mean have you ever seen Shane sure god help me I've seen your show oh she's so good and she's mean of the forest she is the queen of the forest full time not a damn thing you can do about and I have such a great team my crew on the road right now I leave nothing to chance I don't have to worry or think about a thing all I have to do is play my guitar and rock my balls off so I've always had a great team professional work ethic monsters that are conscientious dedicated professional knowledgeable so there's no loose ends yes how I'm able to do all your this but you're also this really loud voice in the culture war have to be you know you have to be I refuse to let lies go unchallenged I refuse to let anti logic go unchallenged anti logic like what like did you don't need secure borders really so the Democrats don't think we need to secure our borders right and the Democrats don't admit there's a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration let me give you a little metaphor if you go to the bank and withdraw from your account you're a legal banker if you go to the bank and draw from someone else's account you're a bank robber there is a division there were four legal banking we're not for illegal banking and this kind of anti logic is weaseled its way into policy and it's just tragic with a multi trillion dollar debt and unsecured borders and we're worried about separating families what we fail to say if you're going to come here come legally or we will send you back we sent on a message have a debt just go ahead and swim across the damn River well do you personally have a problem when they separate families because well sure I do I'm a father and a grandfather yeah I fucked up but the real fuckup starts with the the the insane irresponsibility of daring to subject your children to that I don't think they have any choice of not in front of a dinner over there they living in always power yeah because because Mexico to Guatemala is one big gang-infested government military law enforcement shithole yeah yeah if you call it a shithole I'm racist well if it wasn't a shithole they would stay it is a shithole you ever been there well some I saw some of Mexico saw some of Mexico hasn't been raped and pillaged yet but give them time they'll make it Resorts they're murdering and raping and brutalizing people I mean it's just a hellhole there's definitely some bad things happen and a lot of it is because of the drug war out of control yeah and a lot of people think that the remedy to that is legalizing drugs and taxing man yeah yeah we'd like it you know they mean the same thing with prohibition the same thing that would happened in America would be really boosted organized crime and Al Capone and they got a stronghold because of the money they were making from illegal drugs I just alcohol at the time I think that right now that the spoiled brat epidemic in this country if you don't get everything you want you start shooting people or you cut people off and road rage if everything doesn't go just right everybody is so touchy and so pussified that when I was growing up sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt me what do you think that's coming from the liberalisation of policy and the the horrible lie of the welfare dream that people who need a helping hand are always given to helping hand by neighbors and family and friends and if they have them yeah well the Catholic Church has a trillion dollars just in jewelry they could probably provide some sandwiches and blankets so there's plenty of help available but when you get into a system and you you play on the people's emotions that we need a safety net these poor people are destitute they need to help ok let's create a welfare where we can help these destitute people meanwhile it's infested with scammers and bloodsuckers and Liars who were able-bodied and they just don't want to stop at the Help Wanted sign they want some of your income because you're stupid enough to get up early and work really hard and they don't want to that's pandemic so meanwhile the people who are truly needy they slip through the cracks we don't even get to know who they are and in the liberal policy of eliminating the heartbreak in the disrespect of Cuckoo's Nest we can't we can't call them mental health centers we might hurt some feelings so now what are they doing they're putting spikes and boards and attacking people walking their dog in LA yeah there's no place for them to go when I was growing up there's a place in Detroit called Eloise it was a nuthouse and that's the Cuckoo's Nest that's where if you were mentally ill and you needed help that there was a place for you to go to get you off the streets so you don't attack people with spikes and do by voice what are you talking about the spikes and - by the guy right here right down the street here one days ago yeah attacked some fashion photographer walking his dog and hit him in the head with a 2x4 with a spike and almost killed him you know and a citizen I didn't even hear mouths oh you have an awesome citizen jumped up in the air caught this guy with both feet right in the neck and knocked up beat the shit out of that's nice oh there's a rare occasion of Justice Pro Wrestling come in handy but yes but that that incident is not rare where you go to San Francisco and the mental health institution isn't supposed to be the streets the mess was a good example of too much liberal policy you get people that are a little bit too progressive and to also know the rest of that's regressive I don't know how did they ever utilize that term that's bastardized that's what progressive it gets so far that it becomes regressive when you're letting bums shit all over the streets but thank you I think that would be an indicator so like there's so the ideas that just like these poor people leave them alone you know they're fine they just you know they it's okay if they live on the streets but if you go to San Francisco they're very aggressive it's it's one of the weirder places I've ever been in terms of homeless people and one of the most heart brought unquote progressive places in our country yeah it's one of the most progressive cities heartbreaking yeah we need more Cuckoo's Nest but even those institutions the corruption and the abuse of power that runs rampant a nurse crachit I mean that that that that wasn't just a fantasy a script that that happens the irresponsibility and in in pharmaceutical problem and then they increase the mental problem with big farm yeah I mean I've had personal experiences with that with the dear friends of mine that we're having mental problems and they end up in an institution and then their mental problems are exasperated by chemical warfare upon them you know when I was growing up how old are you John fifty fifty just a boy when I was growing up there's this this mantra this colloquialism better living through chemistry yeah and in many ways it is I mean we saved tens of millions of lives in Africa with DDT by killing the tsetse fly and we saved tens of millions of people and then some environmentalists came in and the DDT is a dangerous chemical so they stopped it and we lost tens of millions of people it's better to kill a bunch of tsetse flies to save human lives than to ban the DDT that allows tsetse flies to flourish and kills people so now it's gone full circle and that's where the toxins have accumulated and the the horrific waste that I had texted Anthony just before he died congratulating him Hahn is hosting that brilliant documentary if you haven't seen it yet it's waste waste exclamation point what we do to work foods in this country and the the self-inflicted scourge of toxification of our precious environment so there's not a lot of easy answers but here it is 28th of June 2018 and here you and I are at least discussing this stuff to millions of people I suspect and I see upgrade taking place I see upgrade in awareness not fast enough to make me happy but enough to indicate I mean an upgraded prognosis for people's awareness accountability responsibility where you seeing this whether it's you know like the circles that you travel the circles certainly and we don't waste one of my biggest pet peeves is little fat kids that you know take a sip of $2 bottle of water and then they leave it there and then the thrown it away and that the waste is pandemic in this country and I see my kids are like like Stormtroopers they're like drill sergeants with that we just don't want to waste and we've always recycled and the jury is still out whether that has any effect at all but the the the disconnect in unconscionable misbehavior of just tossing and throwing away everything you know what drives me fucking crazy cigarettes out the window Oh people just went the people that smoke cigarettes for whatever reason did about my problem throwing it on the ground I'm probably wouldn't litter how about would drive me crazy there's somebody still stupid enough to buy cancer yeah you're here let me invest in the companies that want to kill me here here's a couple extra thousand dollars kill more of us do um a cool makes the I don't think so never smart I'd never smoked a cigarette no drug no drugs no alcohol no you drink a little wine no real fat pussy I'm telling you that shit will kill you no families no logic I'm a big fan for those who want but no I also drink a little wine though I do drink a little wine but I don't think that qualifies as a drink right it's having a glass of wine with oh the me my sons and my daughter's my brothers sisters the Thanksgiving dinner beer beer is better than coke right vastly it's when you start to enter the drool zone that I have a big problem and all of a sudden if there's a problem I can't rely on you anymore right I want to be reliable yeah and that's why I have a problem with comfortably numb' yeah I think in my experience you can't wake up the bass player because he's comfortably numb the guys don't show up he can't tune his guitar he forgot the flicks we're not as tight as we could be you're fired right I know what you're saying but this is what I'm saying to you is that this is just a discipline issue and it's not the marijuana or anything that gets people like that it's a lack of discipline I actually own these Jitsu world and the jiu-jitsu world is filled with people that smoke pot and these motherfuckers work hard they want what's the number one karate guy who the guy that died Bruce Lee yeah Bruce Lee did he smoke dope uh he ate hash ate hash yeah you know he's into getting half here's my question but that's not what killed him here's my question to you as I offered to my son Rocco uh-huh because he's an advocate of marijuana yes okay and I said Rocco and I said and I said so do you really believe that perfectly clean and sober mmm-hmm taking care of your health with a conscientious diet good athletic workout discipline physical prowess mm-hmm do you really think that an outside source peyote mushrooms dope whatever you want to call do you really think that with that outside influence you can do something you can't do unto your god-given gift individual self I'm convinced Joe that you will be the absolute best you can be you will accomplish what I think is a self-inflicted curse of modern man that ninety percent 98 percent of humanity might be tapping into five percent of their capabilities because they get on a treadmill they get in a paradigm self restricted Maronite ever so decreasing view of the world and experiences and the overwrote the destroyed road over traveled versus not only the road the less traveled but the non road untraveled that's my favorite I'm convinced that you Joe Rogan mm-hmm we'll find your superior definitive best without any outside influence I believe you have the power I think I have the power when I get on stage tonight and you gotta come you gotta come witness this what my bad did I do it's like it enough for out of time I can't come tonight it's like I got orgy show at The Improv of human fire we put our fists together and chant James Brown and Wilson Pickett and Funk Brothers and it's like the last wolves on an island ganash enough teeth over the last bone and shard of flesh it's it's a it's an out-of-body soaring above life itself experience that we have in us I don't need anything I understand me I understand that but you don't use anything so you're talking from a place of non experience when it comes to marijuana or mushrooms or any of these things but my 70 years I say at least 55 of those years from the beatniks to the hippies to the end of the friends and you got to meet this Wayne Kramer guy mc5 guitarist new book the hard stuff he and I were born the same time same influence Detroit the swamps the outdoors but Bo Diddley Chuck Berry Motown James Brown he started smoking dope I didn't and he's got a heroin and I'm trying and any prison again stealin and been arrested and I'm having the time of my life and he's like Halloween and a cesspool of dogshit and I'm not knocking Wayne I'm saying that he was courageous to write this book it's a brilliant book you got to have them on you're gonna read it you're gonna you're gonna be consumed by his conversational writing of the mc5 ascension to the most authoritative powerhouse music I've ever witnessed in my life to a bunch of dirtbags on the downward spiral because the drugs and alcohol I know that happens it definitely happens but it happens with everything it happens with people with a eat too much food it happens with people with gambling it happens there are different things but I think it's because of discipline it's because they don't have a clear path I think it's because they let themselves become self-indulgent and let themselves be weak but I'm saying is that I know a lot of people who use whether it's psychedelics or they use marijuana and they use it to enhance their perspective it doesn't become the primary focus of their life it doesn't consume their life they don't allow it to consume their life there's a whole other world of disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and that they're confused the same way people confuse hunters then what same way people think of hunters as being lazy drunken slobs who are cruel to animals and you and I know that that's not the case at all rare so the most disciplined focused and best people or intense people because to be to be a Cameron Haines to be a John Dudley you have to be a superior type of human being super athletes you have to be able to execute in that extreme moment that moment where that animal walks out into that shooting window and you're looking at this 390 bull elk and reaming screaming and overwhelming all over it's so overwhelming and it's 40 yards away and you're centering that pin it takes magic powerful human being to execute that shot and I don't think most people are aware of that most people don't know in the same way that that's misunderstood I think marijuana is misunderstood because there's a lot of dummies in this world if you get a group of a hundred people what are the odds that one of them is gonna be a dummy fuckin a hundred percent yeah right more than water nowadays more than one well if you get a group of a hundred people that use marijuana the one loud fuckin stupid one defies or defines rather what marijuana users are you see that fuckin idiot who's pissing all over himself and falling down so high you can't walk that's what you think of you don't think of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt that smokes pot and then goes out and strangles 50 people in class you don't think of people to take yoga class I like to highlight marijuana I'm absorbing absorbing and respecting and considering your words it can get away from you yeah let me get away that's all I've ever said everything can get away from you that's all I've ever seen but I think it's because these people that consume it they have those other qualities they don't have discipline and focus so they don't have respect for their body see the thing with that especially in the jiu-jitsu community it's super common marijuana is really really really common yeah I mean they there's a show called high rollers where these guys they put together a jiu jitsu tournament and everybody had to get high before they rolled and you're talking like elite world-class Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts competing high on marijuana and that's got to be one of the highest forms of disciplines very available - yes it's a very varied right there with the campanilla mountain climbing bowling calling an elk in your lap it's well you're you're you're doing an art that's designed to break bodies and the two of you're gonna do it together and the whole idea is that you're going to get someone into a position where they have to tap or they're gonna get their arm snapped or they're gonna get choked unconscious so intense extremely difficult pursuit and a lot of people do it under the influence of marijuana do you know any of these master jiu jitsu martial artists oh yeah that that don't do any oh yeah oh yeah and how do they perform they perform well do very well there's this look there's elite world-class athletes and jiu-jitsu that don't you know I wanna do you know if the world champion got high or not well I know a lot of you know where I'm going what I do but I know a lot of them do a lot of world champions do I know a lot of like real multiple time world champions there marijuana users yeah how about world champions that don't get high there's a lot of those to see what happens with marijuana is is increased sensitivity that a lot of people talk about they talk they call it paranoia because there's a lot of things that people put blinders on their life a lot of people aren't aware and I'm sure because of your hunting you're spending time in the woods you're soaking in all the variables the sound the wing I'm a radar you're there right you're aware there's a lot of people that go through life like this nope go through life like they're looking through a toilet paper there in the left lane right now and yeah they're not using their blinkers and those people those people when they smoke marijuana they freak out they get paranoid because what's happening is the marijuana increases your sensitivity makes you aware of all these variables and a lot of people consider that paranoia you start freaking out about all these variables you start thinking about your mortality and instead of embracing this time as a magical moments that being in this moment you just start getting overwhelmed and you feel your own heartbeat you start freaking fearless all the time yeah it's without anything it's an entheogen it brings you closer to whatever you are well they're not encumbered by your ego I will admit it's inescapable that everything affects everyone differently yes but once you make it widespread I mean I've studied the results of legalization for recreational use in Colorado and how the highway fatalities and accidents have increased but you know what else has increased the population in proportion so causes breathing tells us more people there more people are there so you having more accidents there right the problem is is a boom of population also a boom in the economy a boom in the real estate the real estate's taking off yeah there's a lot of losers there too there's a lot of hacky sack playing dirty stinky hippies that are wandering around with no shoes on you're gonna get those you're gonna get those you know if you have an opening welcome society that's that doesn't lock those people up you're gonna have those as a part of freedom yeah it sucks losers are part of this safe world that our kids are allowed to wander through we want the world to be safe so sometimes things are to say if you nerf the edges and you get a bunch of people that are used to hitting their heads on things they're not worried about it sure you're gonna have these losers but it doesn't mean that everybody who does it's a loser I know a lot of like CEOs of big corporations have extreme wants responsibilities and they like to smoke a little pot I get I get um punched back off and on Facebook I'm a successful guy run my family I'm a good dad I'm a good hunter and I'm a I'm a trump supporter and I get high it's like oh god bless you just I don't want you you know babysitting my kids while you're high yeah but it's discipline discipline is the thing that fucks people up and the lack of it is lack of it the lack of discipline and I think if that's with everything it could be with sex it could be with gambling it could be with extreme risky behaviors people could just get get real nutty and get carried away with things and sometimes those things are just a big distraction for the lack of discipline they have in pursuing their own goals in life I think that that is the real high in life the real high in life is pursuing difficult thing ratification yes getting good at them and then accomplishing your goals there's a there's a hi to that that's you can't find that and pills it doesn't exist in the needle that high is a high of discipline and determination and focus and learning but there's so much weakness out there especially in a society that's been spoiled for so long and you get a trophy if you don't even show up yeah and you can't hurt people's feelings and bully or get bullied and your cry instead of fighting back I mean there's so many manifestation of a cultural deprivation that runs amok in our society that my fear is and I've studied all these mass shootings Jo the Virginia Tech shooter hi well they're online hi yeah but the wrong on SSRIs they're all on pills and pharmaceuticals all of them are under the prozac and they're there their parents or all of them are chemical covering up a kid that shows enthusiasm it's called attention disorder now I mean if they had that back when I was growing up I'd end up playing I don't know it I didn't be an Aussie the problem is the word drugs like you and I are drinking coffee we're on drugs right now we're on caffeine this is a drug there's some drugs that if used responsibly are okay a glass of wine with dinner is a drum understood it's a mild drug a little tiny toke yeah for sex with the missus that's a little drug it makes you money see I've never smoked because I can't smoke and when I shoot my machine guns all I do is chew on a Cuban I don't really smoke it well you can get a little little buzz just joining us I love a good man it seems to go with brass rainbows when I was way faster now my best my best morning with my m4 it's a it's a m16 you know carbine and I got a POF upper it's a piston driven so instead of 600 plus rounds minutes over 700 rounds a minute and my bass 600 Stu's well just way too low but they actually had the original your Thompson's were 900 rounds a minute and nobody including sergeant Rock could control that so they back to down us 600 but that's 45 minutes got a whole lot of lift my two to three M for my best morning this is a local Ted party's Apache helicopter M for bags of ammo 469 hawks one day we played videos that you and pigmented are lips no ridiculous diet that is every wild but that big problem is the one that throws in the face of vegans that's a weird one because you you got to do something about those animals because they're gonna destroy your food or they're gonna eat every well when we kill pigs like that in such mass numbers from helicopters with machine guns we're literally saving the environment feeding a lot of people we the port that we process thousands and thousands of people get this pure organic pork and it's delicious it's the best the wild pork with that white fat that kaemark dark meat candy so so we're saving the environment from the pig destruction we're saving agriculture ie food production from the pig destruction we're saving tax dollars from hiring sharpshooters we're saving all wildlife because the alternative would be not indiscriminate poisoning campaign and we're creating a huge new industry of helicopter hog hunting win win win win win win win Party Time USA and guess who passed that law you did thank you very much again me and Chris Kobach we were hunting and we weren't allowed to pay the helicopter pilot by law it couldn't be a for-profit outfit unless the government paid him but she was so so untaxed is like so Chris Kobach who is the secretary of state in Kansas and who's running for governor and should be governor of Kansas he's a constitutional master and he he took the current pig hunting law from helicopters that was government controlled no no citizens no commercial value whatsoever he rewrote it we gave it to then Attorney General Greg Abbott and Governor Perry at the time and we said this is insane this can't be Texas where you get to hunt the pigs on our land but we can't so literally within a week or two they passed the law where it became a commercial outfit we're we the people can hunt the pigs on a helicopters and it's become a huge success it really knocked the shit out of this dangerous pig population in those areas where landowners allow it and give authorization and it's so much fun it's stupid well that's what people need to realize that Yuri there's no other way to get to them in certain circumstances they have three four litters a year and there's no way to take care of them naturally machine guns and helicopters unless you're gonna let hundreds of thousands of wolves loose in Texas I really don't see them from the helicopter Jeff I mean how I mean that's what they do in Alaska right they decimate the carry have to there's no other way to catch all these pigs other than kick on unless you join not many people know that they don't know that and it's a it's a real problem when you talk to people or animal rights activists like how do you propose to fix this that will like well you know they shouldn't be here in the first place they're an invasive species that people bro that's fine you're right but they're here I'm over in the 1700s yes so what do we do so so arrest Captain Cook Yeah right exactly arrest William Randolph Hearst because he released a bunch of them right here in California as WordStar things that we hunted to honed ranch came from those pigs down and they worked their way down and they're awesome they're delicious honey I'm the best pork in the world people who eat normal pork have no idea what the real part tastes like I spoke some for a friend of mine this is insane I'm like this is like this is nothing put it over a good cold coals yeah it's candy brined it for a few days here's a little trick for you I I'm a Vernors ginger-ale guy Detroit brew bottled and ginger a Detroit Vernors it's the only ginger ale with ginger but unfortunately is full of fructose yes so I don't drink it anymore but you can't cook with it next time you brine a slab of pork put in a you know good olive oil and all the seasons you like but also a can of Vernors ginger-ale because it's got real ginger and just enough sugar in it to affect it and soak that overnight and a glass dish covered up in a cool like a refrigerator and then put that sumbitch on some hot orange coals I don't care apple cherry mesquite Hickory whatever you got Oh doesn't and let that sombitch just singe on the outside it's it's food sex it's your you get an erection your palate erection you get a culinary boner it's so delicious that's what we eat at home that's how we eat that's why I'm like this do you ever use a pellet grill I haven't no my my ranch manager chris has got one I mean he's a big fan of those things because it's real wood right it's just compressed wood shots they take like from making this table should make that sawdust compress it down but I have all this timber we have at our properties I like cutting down dead trees and making my own firewood is that what you do you cook over you and well there's a there's something to that right yep yep it's the real McCoy yeah my my taste buds are as sacred as my dick I mean I want to make sure I treat my taste buds really good I consider my life to be like one big six-foot to 220 pound purple rim dick I'm susceptible to all influences and stimuli and that's where I get this passion and this happiness every day is Wednesday I'm spoiled rotten I get to hunt everywhere that's what's crazy and I get to rock my balls off every year so I'm in your yard you essentially leave your house my swamp in Michigan I have to close the door quietly because I have tree stands really close to the cabin yeah and it's this swamp is it's a miracle it's just I think God loves me more than you love you because I created this place just for me and it's a it's a glacier cut Marsh swamp femme you know what a fan is now Fenn f en it's a very unique wetland habitat that's a cross between a marsh and a swamp and a bog and it's the the habitat that produces the Mitchells satyr butterfly environment which is the Christmas tree firm and on my Michigan fan I have the healthiest productivity of the endangered species Christmas tree fern and Mitchell's satyr butterfly according to the biologists and the botanists that visit there every year from universities because I kill lots of critters that would otherwise denude those touchy for wild vegetations and that's why I hunt everyday up there I Koons and possums and skunks and beavers and mink and muskrats and pheasants up the a side I'm the only ground in southern Michigan that has pheasants because I wage war on varmints you cannot hurt varmint populations in fact they are drastically under harvested but on mine I kill so many egg raiding environments that I have the best biodiversity of all including the endangered Mitchell sadder butterfly and Christmas tree fern because I'm a steward who actually walks the wild ground unlike a bureaucrat who looks at the computer screen and his D in our office and makes an assumption of what the model might indicate instead of what the actual wild ground will show you if you get the fuck off your chair and go walk that safe well that's a big criticism to people or from people that especially like people in BC that are now part of that grizzly bear been unbelievable it's honest they're getting people that live in the cities that don't have any interaction with these animals and that these animals are trouble there's a lot of them yeah they're not their kin old and you can eat them too by the way yeah you think they're steaks bear backstraps candy especially in the spring if they're eating berries and the grass right but the perception is that what you're doing is trophy hunting that you know you're eating you're shooting something you don't plan on eating just to put a head walk because you're a cruel person how dishonest can you be well they're not talking to the people that are in the forest the actual people that are on the ground and that's that's a real part of the problem is that these laws get passed by these people that have no interaction with this actual environment it's like people who live in a drought voting on what's going on in your floodplain yeah you know it's like the people in Detroit voting on wolves and the Upper Peninsula if you don't live with vole with the wolves you don't get say-so yeah you need to respect the people who live with the wolves and wolves don't buy licenses wolves don't buy permits wolves don't pay fees wolves don't have bag limits wolves don't have seasons they just like to kill stuff and if you have too many wolves nobody spending money on deer license or bear license or small game hunting and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has been abandoned by a bunch of politically correct ignorant city jerks who think they have to save the endangered wolf I want wolves in Michigan but not to the detriment of wildlife that actually pays for the game department to manage it for a sustained yield productivity duh well that's the thing we're talking about here right like wildlife management like this idea that you have to manage the population of pigs you also have to like what you're doing in your your place in Michigan you're managing this wildlife to of the ultimate diversity know that you even if you don't have to deal with wolves and if you don't you higher tax paid sharpshooters that have no respect for the animals at all they're just doing a job of killing stuff which is what they do in California with the mountain lion unbelievably you're responsible and here's a challenge and a condemnation for the California Fish and Game society the whole coefficient game anymore they call it fish wildlife because of that how can you go to work every day violating your oath to wildlife science how can you force the mountain lion in the black bear in California into the liability column as a game warden as a person dedicated to conservation how can you violate your wise use of and turn the mountain lion and the black bear into a liability because some dirtbag in San Francisco think it's unfair to use hounds or bait for bear and then you have to go in and shoot black bears with tax dollars and bury them in a hole in the ground instead of a family recreational resource that's you buy licenses and fees and permits and guides and Outfitters hotels food lodging grocery supplies butchers ice taxidermists none of that happens because that some liar has forced the wildlife manager the wildlife mismanages of California to ban mountain lion hunting while you continue to kill them as damage control instead of manage them as quality control on the California Wildlife officers shame on you for not blowing the whistle it's like call me at the FBI how dare you walk into that building that says j edgar Hoover over the top and not feel a sense of guilt because J Edgar Hoover was one of the biggest criminal Punk's that ever walked this earth and now Comey is following him in his footsteps and I challenged my FBI buddies how did you go all these years without blowing the whistles on the corruption the power abuse and the criminality by your so-called leaders I don't know enough about what he's saying to comment but I just know about what you did do I do know because he's a liar and he's a he's a he's a perjurer and he's a felon and he had I'm really angry because I work with the FBI I've had to rely on these guys to cover my back on raids and they're great warriors and they look the other way because they're saving their pensions instead of blowing the whistles on their corrupt criminal leaders damn them well I don't know how that relates to mountain lions I'd like to bring it all back corruption is corruption same thing corrupt but I was saying I don't think it's corruption what is there's wildlife officers that I don't think they're getting this conversation I think there is summit that they're trying to preserve their jobs they don't want to stick their chair with a very liberal government but you know I think that there's there's a real problem with education that this conversation doesn't happen in most circles this understanding of balance of nature of that you really do have to manage a mortgage they know what they study they got degrees in it and they defy it and it's gonna give out permits after the mountain lion is destroyed millions of dollars worth of livestock and pets and you scared the shit out of people and killed people then they kill them do you know a tell them before they just do the damn supposed to be quality control not damage control they know the system they've abandoned it and they've gone the political correct denial route and said that the mountain lions are not game animals that is a lie so the California game Department are liars period well the idea that mountain lions on a game animal comes from people that have never eaten one yeah the ultimate backstrap most people don't know I've never eaten one but I know I can feel that have they they're delicious Alicia's what's useful you hear you tell that to people make our wait a minute what a lot of people don't think eat bears well of course eat bears you dirtbag who doesn't know this wake up a lot of people don't know they're idiots I've had conversations to people because I've hunted bears that no one has gotten more mad at me and anything I've ever done then when I killed a bear good good for you like that you pissed you're not pissing off the assholes you're an asshole but it's people that don't understand what a bear is they're not around vendors they don't understand I just recommend shut the fuck up go do a little research and come back when you have some knowledge until then suck my dick don't you think though it's better to just explain to them what it is they refuse to listen yeah they like their ignorance they go to maniacal levels to protect their ignorance because it feels good because it's boo boo it's really occurred to and I respect animals so I'm gonna reduce them to the level of a cartoon it's also weird too because there was a deprivation permit that was issued for a mountain lion in Malibu because it was killing they got to this alpaca farm and just went fucking crazy and killed like ten alpacas and I'll be like a YUM yeah just didn't even eat him just fucked him how they light lions like to kill I'm a big fan so a deprivation depredation permit was issued so yesterday destroyed a bunch of lives yeah this lady could kill this cat that had been you know really because if she's qualified so she was gonna hire somebody but then she got all these death threats just which is hilarious but here's the thing people say they love animals well you obviously don't love these out pocket obvious this Lions coming in and fucking killing them all the time by the way they die a slow death because the lion just bites them and lets them bleed to death and flop around for a couple hours and then goes to the one that's next to it yeah it's trying to get away it's the ignorance is staggering and that's why I can let's go fight it it's a convenient right it's like I we love animals we don't want to kill this mountain lion okay well if you love animals you'll let them kill this one mountain lion that's obviously targeting these pets because this is not hunting and by the way you know why the mountain lion is targeting the pest because there's too many mountain lions and the dominant males have run all the other mountain lions out of ideal habitat into your neighborhood yeah because you didn't harvest the surplus now the surplus is coming into your home now it's a liability because you were too stupid to keep it in the asset column it's absolutely sinful the animal rights people have accomplished they have a pond over it to hone ranch they have a game camera a trail camera on that pond they got 16 different mountain lines on that camera and they're not allowed to make a damn thing it's hard to find deer it's hard to find deer here it's like it's nothing like I mean the one thing it's good people aren't dying in car accidents with deer but if you see a deer in California it's it's pretty rare but again there's plenty of cattle I fly over California I love California man my blood brothers live out here where I'm the greatest conscience of my life last night in San Juan Capistrano fire storm tonight tomorrow night were in Pasadena and then we go to Agoura Hills and Santa Clarita yeah then we go to Big Bear then we go but to Reno and we go to Iowa and Ohio and Pennsylvania and then over all over the country and I fly in a little plane over the country and it's God's country it's wildlife habitat eternally all across this country and California is one of the most beautiful wilderness states in the world and because mountain lions have been irresponsibly mismanaged now you have a destruction of the wildlife in the deer category in the small game and other game because they're mountain lions are in the liability column if you reduce the mountain lion numbers then hunters will pay for the deer licenses which pay for the game departments and the scientists to manage the wildlife see we have balanced California is em balanced it's out of balance because of the lie of the animal rights that have how the wildlife officers of this country accept that bullshit is just a crime they should stand up and go you're wrong this is a renewable wildlife research resource and we're going to have a season on it because now we're killing them as damage control they're still dying the killing but then we're taking millions of dollars to compensate the llama in the alpaca and the cattle and the sheep and the goat and the horse we're millions of dollars compensating and then we're gonna kill the lion and bury it no you don't get to eat it no you don't get to spend money and provide game department finances no you don't get to go to hotels and travel and food and lodging and supplies and sporting goods and taxidermist you don't get to increase the economy of the entire area because of one mountain lion hunt we're gonna take your tax dollars and compensate all the dead Riyadh livestock and then we're gonna hire a guy to kill the mountain lion Joe dig a hole which by the way you're gonna take your tax dollars to hire a guy with the front loader dig a hole and bury don't but this magnificent animal public perception it's because of the average person like you say perceptrons I have dogs it's not perception it's ignorant in its irresponsibly but this perception that does come from ignorance is that we love animals like I have a dog you have dogs my I live for my yeah I have three dogs we love dogs can't without them you go home you pat them people that don't have any interaction whatsoever with wildlife think of animals like they think of their dog I don't want anything to die and then you hear about a mountain lion look why would you kill a mound mind you're being cruel like you would only kill them out mind if you're one of those dickless assholes and wants to go to Africa and shoot a lion in the head and mount it on your wall just as well but this is the thought process behind it and there's no pushback because the public speaks and then I push back in the attack baiting they attack you bring it on bring it on because ignorance bounces off me like personal hygiene from Michael Moore it just has no impact whatsoever I think he washes boy what up what a swine he that's a subhuman mongrel of Iver oh so I'm an abuser he's a prick he's a liar what do you think he's a scam artist i gun control well how about the fact that he put together that move that so-called documentary that hollywood actually gave him an award and he copy and pasted out of sequence the attack on the great Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow responsible for the little child killing herself with her paroled felon father's gun and they put it out of sequence and attributed Charlton Heston defending such irresponsible gun ownership Michael Moore is a lying cruel stoned punk is he stoned constantly all day all the time I think he uses posit or ease I don't know him I do and I he's a punk has he ever had a conversation yeah yeah i'vei've was on his TV show and I was responsible for ending his TV show cuz he tried to fuck with me and I don't know if you'd notice Joe but I'm unfuckable you fuck with me I'll eat your family tree and shit sawdust into your face ask Piers Morgan that seems like I saw your coming out here the clothes I was rustling at or so well the Piers Morgan the problem is he didn't understand the facts when you talk about gun violence he didn't understand I think that's absolutely + explain what we're talking about because when you say the numbers of gun violence a giant percentage of them are suicide a giant percentage of them are cops killing bad guy and citizens defenseless so all of those are out of the and then accidental gun deaths well may I summarized it for you so Pierce Morgan fancies himself a cocky rather witty limeys you've got the accent and everything that funny little not actually an accent it's an impediment but he came out and of course he's going to take on the Motor City Madman I mean this guy's gonna be easy pickins he actually wrote Wango Tango pee all intellectually this thing you're doing that's that Lime Eve God manufactured confidence based on nothing except an ego that has no foundation in fact so Piers Morgan the CNN exec so let's put Piers Morgan on the Motor City Madman they put in a gun store - well the first time you didn't see the first one at the CNN offices that's yeah yeah yeah that's the best one yeah and so they think I'm a dirtbag and a goofball because I not only wrote Wang dang sweet poontang I meant it but when they take me on they don't realize I never went to college because I was too busy learning shit and if you take me on on any subject that I am even slightly aware of I will fuck you up because I've studied this stuff I've lived this stuff I've been with guns since I could walk I have had universal unlimited access to firepower my whole life both in a recreational a a disciplined a law enforcement military training and just family plinking competition so in every considerable imaginable gun use I've been 68 years of it so they SiC Pierce Morgan ami to teach me a lesson about how irresponsible gun owners are and that if we could just ban guns that all the violence would end and of course if you haven't seen it you got to google it because it is what's his take well I almost fixed him because I so overwhelmed him with evidence that they finally research and realize that every word out of my mouth was absolutely indisputable what was most compelling that you were saying to him I was summarized it as this way like I did to pierce the anti Gunners have their dream it exists it existed in Paris where all those people were shot with Kalashnikovs collision the cops were banned they have their dream piers morgan's dream exists its called a gun-free zone Virginia Tech Columbine Sandy Hook Aurora parkland every instance where the most innocent lives have been slaughtered have been in Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters Eric Holder Hillary Clinton Barack Obama's dream their dream is a gun-free zone but where three people are forced forced into unarmed helplessness where the most innocent lives are lost and that dream has produced more carnage and destroyed lives than anything in the world compared to the NRA convention where you have the highest innocence of gun ownership or opening day of deer season in Michigan where you have a hundred percent gun ownership and access where nobody gets hurt so if you know that your dream is a gun-free zone and that's where the most innocent lives are lost what kind of demonic dirtbag would actually want more well let me stop gonna let me stop being a take his position or anybody's position on the other side you would say the real gun-free zone would be having access to the gun that killed those people in the gun-free zone yeah not a gun-free zone and the real and the real answer to drownings in America would be to ban water Banyuls you work on banning water I'll work on banning guns we'll touch base every few weeks and see Howard you can not ban you cannot eliminate guns Finland you cannot eliminate guns Alberta Canada where the guy who came in to the University of shot everybody up it's impossible so what you do instead of thinking you could ban water learn to swim and watch your children by the pool call me weird but the way to handle violence is to carry a gun practice with it and when someone brings lethal force against you shoot the motherfucker but people are very uncomfortable with the idea uncomfortable baby sorry you're uncomfortable to go ahead and bend over and die but you know I'm saying I know what you're saying but wouldn't it be better if there weren't any concern that the idea is to somehow or another take away the concern of people being shot randomly by some psycho that you've got to figure out if you get all the guns away how do you get all the guns I don't know I don't know but this is what I'm saying is that you don't know so let's just stop if they're not right if it's not that then everybody's got guns to shoot no but everybody will not have guns every some people have guns some people here I studied San Bernardino I studied Aurora I studied Virginia Tech I studied Columbine I studied Sandy Hook I studied them all do you know Joe and everybody better write this down because I'm the only guy that will tell you this I've studied the cadance the bullet manufacturers the rate of fire the movement of the perp and the movement of the victims in every instance including in Connecticut including Aurora including San Bernardino right here there were American citizens who would have had a gun on their person if they were allowed to and they could have been a meaningful force to at least reduce if not terminate the violent murderous threat but by law we have been so dumb down and so forced against our natural survival instinct to have a tool on our belt that in every instance where the most innocent lives were slaughtered those people that would have intervened with the firearm not many of them but there was a janitor there was a couple of guys in the office they had concealed weapons permits but they weren't allowed to have him in that building in Virginia Tech there were guys that had concealed weapons permits but they weren't allowed to have them there in Aurora Colorado are you kidding me all kinds of people would have had guns they could have returned fire but they were forced into unarmed helplessness here here's the gun debate in its computable conclusion if you are forced into unarmed helplessness you are unarmed and helpless what a horrible irresponsible suicidal condition that in I'm just a guitar player Joe I've never been unarmed since I graduated from high school I've always had a hankie and a pocket full of guitar picks and a pocket knife and a belt knife and a belt tool and a pistol and some extra bullets I just had them everywhere I go I've never been on armed I find it how do you travel around I improvise adapt and overcome I luckily I helped pass House Resolution 218 which means all sworn law enforcement officers allowed to carry a gun nationwide I've been assured deputy since 1984 and my credentials allow me to carry gun everywhere I go and I carry gun everywhere I go in fact even in England American law enforcement not allowed to carry guns my Kure gun over there it's just a tool if somebody comes at me carry a gun in England yes he's some dirtbag comes at me with a spike in that bore I've just shoot him but why not Plan B no I I agreed that I'm just better to be hard yeah have it and not to need it than to need it not to happen go the thing that we would all like to have is no school shootings no mass shootings no Aurora no Columbine no so how do you stop that do you think you stop that with more guns we don't think you stop that with mental health education figuring out how to get people off of pills figuring out how to keep people from living despondent lives where they want to just tear it all down and shoot everybody and hurt a bunch of people well here we are that's the route right sure here we are 2018 so we can't go back in history and find the goofball from Virginia Tech and what motivated him right you're right we can't go back there because we have failed as a society to take care of people or respond with any sense of responsibility or effectiveness to the glaring danger signs most outrageously in parkland where the guy called him pick cops 42 times called the FBI three times the guy's gonna shoot up the school okay we'll make a note of that no the guy's going to shoot up the school okay we'll make a note of that the guy is bringing a gun to school to shoot people here's his manifesto we've made a note of it but are you kidding me so now if we go for them to do something or someone does something no no it's not I don't think it's a failure of law enforcement I had what's the matter it's just a shooting like two hours ago oh Jesus Christ another one five people are dead in multiple viewports we're we're Annapolis Maryland data Oh Maryland where no one's allowed to have a gun by the way garland to a newsroom and shot a bunch of reporters Jesus how much you want to bet it was a free zone in nablus newsroom shooting leaves five people dead suspect in custody a newsroom well what's a mine there's my point so I'm in a newsroom and I'm ready to rock I'd rather be sitting where you are but I get free you got me covered my point is is that the cat is already out of the bag right it's not too late Columbine guy's glaring signals red alarms going off over Virginia Tech guy red alarms going off for years the Columbine thing is a difficult one because it really hadn't happened before that you haven't expected it but the parents walked through the garage for three years where the bomb-making materials were on the table yeah they weren't the best pair these guys were like zombies these guys were like doper freaks for bonzai zulu land maniacs well he's just he's just different no he's not he's freaky we need to sit down with this guy and get him some help the Aurora guy told his psychiatrist my goal is to shoot as many people as possible in this mattress didn't say anything really it's on record he said it in numerous visits with his psychiatrist that he had threatened his goal in life was to kill as many people as possible and he's now got his new ar-15 to do it with and the psychiatrist didn't say anything I've studied this stuff we need to not only see something say something we're missing the part the final part do something when this kind of aberrant threatening violent red alarm behavior is going off intervene sit down with this kid at the first instance when your kid comes home all glassy eyed and goofy and in communicable and in showing weird signs like the Sandy Hook guy did all his life and the Aurora guy did all his life and the Parkland guy zombie you know staring like a wouldn't blink in a sandstorm somebody's got I know I would I mean in my life whether it's musicians or family members I go are you alright what is it going on you look like you're gonna shit yourself man are you okay but if you do know what that conversation with somebody like the psychiatrist did to the Aurora shooter doesn't mean how do you fix these people I mean what you're saying is if you have no gun-free zones and people allowed to have guns at least they'll have an ability to defend themselves I agree with you I agree with you on that but how do you stop it from happening in the first place the anti-gun people say the way to stop it is to have no guns available to civilians that can do things virtually impossible a virtuous point posture so what we're dealing is just pragmatically when you look at 300 million people and probably 400 million guns well you haven't counted mine yet yeah for every guy like you that has hundreds of guns you know I have almost everybody I know has hundreds of guns he just not like a man I got hundreds of arrows I have four I have dozens of guitars we need to be a more assertive aggressive aware society and when we see these glaring indicators we're never gonna stop at all there's always gonna be evil in our lives and you can't stop it hence you should be armed and prepared and if you're not comfortably being armed by all means don't be if you don't want to go like I saw the debate bill Marcia well you can't expect every teacher to have a gun I go who's ever recommended that that's what the anti-gun people always go why should a man everybody's have a machine gun you just shoot at everything yeah that's a pretty good that's quote for quote what I recommended they go to the deep end every time well they're trying to make fun they're trying to make fun of the proposition unbelieveable should be arm talking about life and size against killers there are people I know everywhere teachers grocery shore store baggers you name a walk of life my welding buddy my mechanic my dentist my doctor your doctor strap yes I mean they just their pragmatist their utilitarian they're self-sufficient what when did that become undesirable to be self-sufficient and capable don't think that's the problem I think what we're saying is that we have such a gun problem there's so many people and so many guns that people just want to somehow or another they diminish the numbers Joe we do not have a gun problem and I was growing up we had guns in school during the season rifles shotguns were brought and put in your lockers there was unlimited ubiquitous access to firepower throughout my youth no school shootings something else has happened and it has to do with big farm and the this the irresponsible knee-jerk bandage on a gaping wound of ash of a child showing you know up indeed childlike behavior and all of a sudden they prozac him and they did Riddle in them this stuff turns into a zombie my dear dear blood brother cliff Davies the greatest drummer on the planet listen to what he did on the Ted Nugent album and the cat scratch fever album in the free-for-all album and the weekend I mean this guy was a god of musicality he became depressed and was proscribed and the incidence of people being prescribed mood controllers in emotion controllers and depression controllers the incidence in the consistency with which they attempt to go cold turkey and kill themselves you your brain becomes changed it becomes altered your logic meter is off duty with this pharmaceuticals in your system cliff came home decided to get off the Prozac walked out in the yard screaming throwing his clothes out the window and shot himself in the head and Aurora guy all the they're all on something it's true it's and mothers and fathers out there discipline is the answer not pharmaceuticals conversation is the answer probing parenting is the answer when Ike I said when I was growing up we had a Cuckoo's Nest we had Eloise and people showed dangerous and in an antisocial behavior you intervened and you put him in an institution and even that was a mistake because it was always a chemical response instead of a compassionate response nothing was needed chemicals some people are fucked in the head yes you do you have to do something absolutely but there's the argument that there's a lot of people to take these pharmaceuticals and they have no violent outbursts which I agree with too but the people that do have violent outbursts are almost universally on something University yeah yeah if you look at the numbers and I've said this many times that I don't think we have a gun problem I think we have a mental health problem justifies does a gun problem absolutely because whether it's someone driving a truck into a crowd of people that's the same thing do you think do you think after 42 calls to the Sheriff's Department threatening to shoot the school and three to the FBI do you think the parkland shooter should have been visited a little earlier than after forty two and three calls of threatening to shoot up the school do you think the authorities should have the right to go visit this game right and get the guns out of there don't you think when you say I am going to shoot up the school in my world that would be good enough to disqualify that person from owning a gun I agree with you I don't know what the circumstances were with the Parkland kid and I do know that the FBI did visit him on one occasion that's not good enough you don't know what they went there it's not like he was you know peeing on the Alamo and just being a dirtbag he was threatening to kill as many people as possible that to me is enough information to disarm the guy and probably institutionalize Muresan take him in for review to a psychiatric ward at that point you can't say I'm going to kill people you can't say that Dee are you comfortable with a world where there's so much gun violence that everybody just has to be strapped or no no way that last thing I would I've said it a hundred times I'm going to say it again on the Joe Rogan podcast write it down I do not want everyone to carry a gun I do not want everyone to own a gun I don't want everyone to hunt I don't want everyone to have an 850 horsepower Ford Bronco I don't want everyone to go on the Joe Rogan podcast there is a time and place for individuality and individual choices and many people will always be uncomfortable you know taking a hook out of a fish's lip so don't go fishing and if you don't feel comfortable around guns by all means just don't have one but those of us that have a hint of warrior instinct and rugged boy scout being prepared desire don't disarm us were your best friend with and they're everywhere they're those teachers in all these school shootings there were teachers that would have had a gun but they were forbidden to and there are instances and this is something that people that are anti-gun don't like to talk about but there are instances where trained shooters have stopped mass shootings someone killing people it's--there's there and let me come in on the train of well I suppose they get training let's let's let's squash that myth big old fat Jewish lady in New York City back in the 60s she was robbed at gunpoint nice point over and over again remember they had like 2000 murders a year and man yeah just run away mayhem she was getting upset she wanted to get a pistol oh she went to the police station I don't need to get criminal I'm sorry we don't give permission but I've been robbed all these times I'm scared he comes come back all the time I've got his good points gun wants my money I'm sorry you can't have a gun so she was frustrated this was a documented case and so she went to Uncle Joe Uncle Joe I'm scared I need a gun this guy keeps up he's gonna kill me so Uncle Joe got him I got her a revolver she died I don't like it just put it under the car I won't lie back I'm scared I don't like guns never fired it in her life no training had no idea but she knew which which end the bullet came out of next time she was robbed she shot the son of a bitch she know what to do she know was the trigger and a no training she one shot the guy that was threatening her life now they put her in jail Italy it's like you know Bernie Goetz defending his life but eventually the charges were dropped because it was clear and present she was defending herself from an engineered recidivist 'ok write that down engineered recidivist 'ok the system in knowingly and intentionally lets out knife errs and stabbers and rapists and murderers and child Lester's they keep letting them out those are the people 96% of the time that commit the violent the ones engineered do you think they do that because of prison overpopulation funds and you hated you because they want society to be dangerous I can't imagine engineered I can't imagine do you don't you think it's just incompetence and unjust incompetence and it's an illusion of responsibility Radek individuals yep bureaucratic institutionalize your responsibility yeah in corruption and abuse of power they don't want to deal with it lack of resources yeah DLE only shot three people let's I get him on jaywalking okay well cut him a deal in only served six years of his life sentence for killing those people happens all the time yeah and that guy's on the street and he kills somebody goes I can't believe it he had a rest record goes back to his youth it was a hundred pages long I can't believe you let him out what we let him out we knew he killed people in fact he stabbed two people but he missed the artery so we're gonna let him out and see if he can study Anatomy enough and get a good stab next time there are court systems are a joke our prison system is a joke I mean if somebody stabs somebody do you want him you want him on the street with you if he stabs somebody you are killing that person you're just shitty at it if you shoot at somebody and you miss that's murder you're just you're just bad at it if you're willing to throw a bullet at a human being I want him in a cage forever or better yet dead right there and then if he's capable of taking an innocent life I want him out of the gene pool I don't believe in how did I put it in that one interview I know I don't believe in repeat crime repeat criminals I believe in dead criminals if someone threatens innocent life we'll get them out of here I really believe that and you know who the best person to make that decision is the person about to get stabbed the lady about to get raped the guy about to get shot at this all makes sense I mean I I feel what you're saying I think the real problem is why does it happen in the first place because we're a society that doesn't respond to alarming signals in the hope of not hurting feelings instead of saving lives it's a liberal mantra of feel good in action versus tough choices and harsh choices that will actually save life don't you think it's also a lack of resources too and a lack of I mean these people that are interviewing these psychos before they snap based on that really psychology based on my tax bill I think they have the resources has just mismanaged and wasted by the way while we're doing this can I hit the bathroom really yeah therefore I squirm well we'll be right back we'll stay yeah amazing you're walking fantastic on those robot knees man it's crazy it's it's amazing how few people can hold their piss sometimes it comes yeah he's got two waters down yeah he slammed two waters this uh this shooting happening while he's on is so appropriate I mean it's so crazy that this is the time so this is a newsroom why do they have a motivation for this guy no motivation is being interrogated right now is what I just read and it's amazing that these guys want they get captured but they don't get killed like the Parkland kid and a lot of these people like how are they not killing these people when they're when it's happening supposedly a white guy in his twenties is it some fake news thing I mean he shot reporters you know until the interrogation comes out I feel like it's not fair to Ron Cey but there are people pointing at things that have been in the news recently oh fuck it's just so much I mean I hear what Ted saying that you should be able to defend yourself and I agree like if you were in a grocery store somewhere and some guy came in shooting and you had a gun I would want you to be able to defend yourself you know I want you to be alive I agree with you I get that but that's is that the only way I mean or is it's just what we have to do right now I mean I don't know what anybody on the other side wants other than taking away everyone's guns but if you take away everyone's guns how are you possibly gonna do an audit of 300 million guns in this country how are you gonna find all the illegal ones how you gonna find all the stored ones and then there's that old cliche if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns I mean it's almost like the same thing we're talking about when in in terms of legalizing and illegal illegal drugs and when drugs are legal they can be taxed and you can make sense of the situation you can have treatment centers the stigma of you know the the appeal of them of doing something you're not supposed to do is no longer there and then you're not funding these illegal organizations organizations like you know the cartels in Mexico or back when it was organized crime in America for alcohol when the prohibition was going on it's I don't think that you're gonna be able to take away all these guns but I don't know what the argument I would like to talk to somebody who has an argument that you could do it because I know they did it in Australia but Australia is so small and by the way you can get guns in Australia people use guns they're for hunting all the time so guns are available and occasionally they do have gun violence but they had like one mass shooting in the 1990s in Australia and they just banned all the guns but Australians are there a different culture to like this fucking culture is gun happy from all of our movies and television shows and the solution is always like bang bang bang like shooting people is a part of the solution you know I don't know I don't know man I just no one has an answer didn't no one on that side no one on this side every answer has holes in it you laughing what happened I always say to you know this is conversation about guns you know and and I don't see an answer I do I really don't I don't see an answer the ultimately Oh bleep look I'm all for a responsible gun ownership I have guns of hunted guns I believe in gun ownership but how do you stop gun violence and I don't know I don't know what the answer is and I think this is ultimately with everybody is trying to find we were talking about when you were gone the Australians where they they banned guns because of one mass shooting and they've never had a mass shooting sense yeah but then crime continues to go up and down based on other social factors so and there's many of them there's only 20 million people in their entire country you know I would like to address probably the glaring beast in the room of America you're 50 something right fifty fifty fifty one and art I'll be 70 and I've had a pretty good radar got a pretty good absorption factor of information evidence experiences ideas opinions activities what the hell happened that would allow Americans so many of us to become so evil that we want to hurt each other and kill each other and kill children rob and and molest I want to make the biggest impact they want to hurt the most people because they're hurting what where did that delineation from a post-world War two celebration of the freedoms that motivated our armed forces to defeat the worst evil on the planet the Japanese slaughterers and the Nazi Devils that it was our Constitution and our individual rights that motivated these guys to fight harder and you know as a martial artist you have to see beyond the contest and it's almost like you don't you don't make your hit where you want to hit you want your hit to go past where you want to hit we were a United Nation in 1946 1947 is certainly right 48 when I was born and Detroit was the work ethic productivity epicenter of planet Earth universally known we we were the war machine that built the tanks and the bombers and the planes and and pride of ownership and and you got up early and you busted your ass to be the best that you can be and you kept your yard good and you kept your house clean and you earned your own way and it was an embarrassment enough to earn your own way and you saved for a rainy day and you live within your means and you discipline yourself my upbringing was and wasn't poverty I was never in need but you couldn't drink a whole coke you couldn't buy something cuz you wanted it you needed some sock sheep I got him for Christmas and if I wanted an arrow I had a you know go to the pickup garbage and try to sell golf balls back and in and bought get deposits on bottles and cans and cutaway yeah there was a the rugged individualism the self-sufficiency the neighborliness the giving and caring and you know did take a village it started with family but you cared about your neighbors and you watched over each other and then I saw and with all due respect when the beatniks and the dope and then the hippies and the disconnect and a carelessness erupted and and a meanness I started seeing more meanness and anger and and disconnect and and then after weather was the New Deal or the Great Society which kind of incentivized not being the best that you can be and you can actually stay home and get a check and the unions would negotiate not on quality automobiles but money that may or may not be there but we'll get you some more money and you can make Chrysler's that won't even start you can't even drive them they're such a pilot yet and I saw this Detroit go from this glowing epicenter of goodwill and decency and work ethic to Liberal Democrats scamming people and bribing people for votes by getting you something you didn't and then all of a sudden the city burnt down and no couches in the street and refrigerators on the lawns and it just turned into a lump I shit uh and it breaks my heart I go downtown Detroit now and building the beautiful architecture still boarded up from the 67 riots I took my kids down for the 42nd anniversary the Amboy Dukes I wanted to show them this beautiful city I was raised in and what happened to it and almost for dramatic effect almost like Cecil B DeMille was you know directing a scene for me to emphasize how deteriorated Detroit got here's this guy on a sidewalk with his pants down taking a dump and middle of the afternoon and I go wow I didn't actually hire that guy that's really what's happened here so if you allow your society to crumble before your eyes without intervening and go ahead you can't do that you got yeah you can't do and I've done it with my musicians on my life ago goddamnit we were really rocking last week and now you're all stoned and can't even wake you up but don't you think that when you're talking about 1946 the United States we were we were all against the Nazis in the Japanese we were United certainly know that our our lives were threatened the world's future was threatened and people felt like they had a purpose purpose do you remember I was in I was in New York right after September 11th and one of the crazier and something happened a friend of mine fainted and they we had to call the fire department you know EMTs showed up and the the respect and the the happiness that people had when they saw the first responders and I was like this is this is fascinating because I lived in New York high voice it was it was a high point because people had felt what it was like to be attacked to be at war I mean that was what the attack and the Trade Center or the the Twin Towers was we were at war and they felt this and they felt United because of it and when these people showed up to help they were excited to see them there were like heroes they treated them like real heroes and I was like this is a different feeling than anything I've had before and I had I had to imagine that this was probably what it was like in the United States in the 40s a figure right in the middle of the war and when you're right when people were you know United working together to make sure there was enough scrap metal and enough rubber and they were carpooling so they have enough raw materials to create wine and rubber bands for the people felt like Rifai Singh for the benefit of their society yeah and they felt like there was something real going on whereas when there's no threat and no worries I think people get lost I think especially people with no discipline not everybody of course but some it's there's a tendency to get lost then there's a tendency for people to take advantage of those people that are lost and say it's not your fault it's the government's fault and the government needs to pay you and the government needs to help out so but there's this very strange tendency that people have and also if I may exalt Here I am with Joe Rogan we never met I didn't know much about yes everybody was bombarded me so you gotta go on Joe Rogan see guys reasonable sensible smart and funny and he's promoting honey now and I found mother fucker sounds like my boy let's go do this you have to admit with intelligent conscientious well formulated prioritization 2018 we can go on and on about the the problems in the world do you know that I'm the happiest motherfucker with the greatest band the greatest crew the greatest family love my TV show and New York Times bestsellers and successful to some degree and the things I pursue in my passions and I'm doing your show we're talking about important issues and I have dangers on people that come backstage we raise money for charities every night do you know Joe that I can't find a dirt bag but it's a pretty big circle but you're pretty big circle down the streets here I go to Starbucks and get a coffee and I'll go dad they pay they pay for it for me and love spear in the wild thanks for standing up for our freedoms god bless you know I can't find a dirt bag I'm sure I could but here's a salute on a Joe Rock Joe Rogan podcast to all those people out there that do intelligently and responsibly prioritize and they bust their ass because they're out there there's no monster armies of working hard playing hard shit-kickers who sacrifice and take risk and try to start a new business and fall down in the arena and stand up and brush themselves off and get back at it those are the people that I want to talk to right now because they're the best of the best don't back off friction don't back off discomforting encounters whether it's your kid because i've got buddies kids died of fentanyl great families that fat and I'll show oh my god I'll cry for you and you take him in your arms and they didn't do anything wrong and they're burying the fucking kid did you confront of you are you telling me you didn't see this man here's my alert to people listening to the out-group Ted in Oklahoma boogie look harder be more assertive if something doesn't look perfect look into it and if if there's needy people instead of giving them money because they could probably buy drugs or alcohol and you're probably gonna die if you make a donation to most homeless people you're helping to kill them right now I'm gonna buy good shit with it yeah and badger your elected employees we need to have mental health facilities what what are you wasting money on you don't need to find out the sex life of a turtle you need to take those billions of grant money that you're blowing right now for some jackoff and you need we need to address the mental health homeless truly needy not the greedy not the scammers who are able-bodied they just like to stay home the people who have mental issues and physical issues and that the download' Trump has finally got a point in time where you can fire a veteran administration scam artist punk who doesn't care about the vets doesn't show up for work and absconds on revenues that could have got a couple wheelchairs for a legless marine now we can fire the bastards so there is upgrade happening but those that do know and do care no more care more and in and demand answers whether it's your family member how come I couldn't how come you didn't show up at the family event what are you doing dude are you high are you using money what are you doing I think if we start family neighbors and don't be afraid to tell your neighbor yeah I saw your son the other Dave's passed out at the curb I don't think we intervene like we did back when I was growing up nobody would have tolerated that shit when I was growing up they would have sounded the alarm and I don't think there's enough of that neighborliness not being afraid to hurt feelings well it's none of your business well you know it is my business cuz you're my neighbor and the guy just shit in my lawn I mean I don't think we're aggressive enough I come from a world of aggression not not being a prick about it but asking questions at some point you might have to shrug your shoulders ago I doesn't want any help there's nothing I can do but I tried but you like conflict you do yes I do I'd like to eradicate it I like to intervene to reduce clearly you know that the way you express yourself is entertaining but it's also polarizing like a lot of things you say you know sure and you you invite this sort of not intentionally I think by being a pragmatist you're going to invite conflict because some people don't like to hear this shit yeah some people don't like to hear the ship with the style in which you talk like even when like you're debating Piers Morgan you're very very powerful with the way describe things and you you you get people that want to argue back with you it's time for that because I think the gentleman's approach Mitt Romney and and John McCain you didn't represent nothing the reason Donald Trump won is because finally the shit-kickers who work rough and tumble those construction guys outside the the four seasons like stay at the four seasons how cool is that they're busting their ass they're getting upper and they're working hard and to go throw back a few beers and have a little barbecue at night these are the guys I'm talking about and talking to and and they're the ones who voted for Donald Trump finally because he came out it wasn't afraid he sounded like a shit kicker boy sounded like them someone like us yeah there's a there was a real problem that we have in this country with people that are career politicians and he was really the first the problem career politicians is the problem status quo that's you know Donald Trump isn't perfect I like Emperor imperfect is cool you and me good examples but he came in swinging a crowbar to this horrible status quote can best be described as well he's not presidential you're goddamn right he's not presidential because all these pretend presidential guys got us into this mess because they were so cautious and they didn't want to ruffle any feathers we we want to have a big tent including all the you know bad guys in people that don't believe in secure borders what's that and people that don't believe in earning your own way what's that people that don't know the difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration what's that so the shit-kickers finally her saw somebody busting the status quo you're damn right he's not presidential because presidential got us into this train wreck and we're done with it so the republicans better be paying attention because if your status quo we were not voting for you if you come in swing you'd have to be rude enough to be screaming you don't have to be condemning but you have to be honest and forthright and sound like somebody you'd have a beer with it a barbecue and if you sound like a shit kicker and one of us working out playing on americans and you address our concerns will vote for you if you don't we're gonna stay in our tree stand in november which is what happened traditionally that's why michigan wisconsin in Pennsylvania with eight hundred thousand hunters wanted for Trump because we are a hunters nation and those families were a huge voting bloc they'd never felt like they have skin in the game finally somebody had skin in the game including my teamster buddies my Union buddies instead of just like puppets pulling that deal ever they went the Democrats have been lying to me the Democrats had been scamming me I'm voting for Trump he's the status quo wrecker yeah was I what do you say look lying and scamming what what do you what do you examples like what do you mean good grief but like what what gets to you like what is the thing that you when you think of Democrats and you think of lying and you need to sign it to find out what's in it Nancy Pelosi on the House floor with this huge voluminous health care bill actually said you don't need to read it you need to cite it to find out what's in it wow you don't remember that no holy shit that sounds pretty ridiculous yeah she said it and then try to form a sentence watch Maxine water desperately search for a syllable listen to the words out of their mouths well did you say reeks did you see this thing that she was calling out for people did you see anyone in the administration including Ted Nugent yeah bring it on asshole disrupt and cause a crowd and tell me what you're not welcome Deborah that's an insanely irresponsible thing to say that's treacherous every one of my promoters have death threats because they dare to hire me every one of my bandmates and my crewmates some guys that are building this wonderful Bell amplifier they they just showed a picture on their website with me testing the new amplifier and people attacked him and threatened to kill him because they're working with the coward animal murderer here are the the gun nut I'm a gun nut I'm also a screwdriver or not too but that's what I'm saying about you being this polarizing figure that people that aren't deeply into it or listening to everything you say but you can't rush things how else can you address it because oh that's why I'm asking well I'm telling you you know Joe the guys who've tried to sound very polite and uh very non-confrontational got us into this mess if you don't believe America needs secure borders you're the enemy of America you need secure who doesn't know you need secure borders Nancy Pelosi doesn't Hillary Clinton didn't Loretta Lynch didn't I mean come on these people are freaks America first pisses off Democrats how can that be if it's not America think release it as you're denying opportunity to people that live in an impoverished third-world country that's connected to us they thought of it as racism all my ancestors came through Ellis Island as did mine and denounced their allegiance to where they came from you can still cook Swedish and you can still cook German but you got to denounce allegiance to where you come from because you're coming here it's fucking hard for someone to come over from Mexico and don't you think that the real problem is that Mexico sucks that parts of Mexico sighs overall to figure out a way to help those people really the only way would to make Mexico so healthy and in a great place to live that it's just like the United States there's no reason to come over here and certainly we have tried our policies have been very generous to those countries in fact were the only country that has been generous to them but the roughly the right yeah there's a question stream yeah mass across the entire Mexican Guatemalan that all those governments are as criminals Al Capone in Chicago in 32 I've been so infested by the law enforcement is the cartel the military is the kind of town so so where are you so that affects we have the right to secure this is not my opinion we in America have the right and the responsibility to secure our borders if you think otherwise you're dangerous we need to break I want people who need a better quality of life I'd welcome them I got buddies that game like that Mike my sound man Frank went through the seven year process from Germany and now he's a legal citizen in America why should someone be able to swim across the Rio Grande and circumvent all that process so we know whether you're going to be an asset or a liability it's not rocket science it's liability or asset we want assets and that's why our immigration system is horrifically legal one so I know it's a problem but we're putting all these resources and man-hours into securing the porous border instead of processing those who legitimately would like a better quality of life in America but first they have to we have to differentiate between the protesters who think that we need to turn over California in Arizona and Texas back to Mexico so it can turn into a shithole of course they left Mexico they know it's horrible that's why they're here why would you come here to get away from a shithole and then turn the place you came to into the shithole we have a constitution we have a bill of rights you need to earn your own way you need to work very hard if you're in the asset column I love you if you're in the liability column I love you if you're having hard times but if you have squatted intentionally as an able body an individual in that liability column you are a detriment to America and you should get the fuck out of here that's when you look at in perspective the people that are able-bodied Americans that don't do jack shit some poor bastard is trying to yeah anything they can to get here from Mexico to the point where they're literally dying in a hydration desert yeah and they would bust their ass if given that opportunity it's not fair it's not easy it's not gonna be easy complicated right but it is doable but our priorities as a government are so clustered they're so dis prioritized that all this efforts going towards you know securing the Rio Grande when people are illegally swimming across and jeopardizing their very life and limb when just down a couple miles there's a legal entrance and it might be a pain in the ass but you're here with me today June 28 2020 18 have you not put up with major pains in the asses of martial artists as a comedian that's a tough life you got your world carved out because you put up with a pain in the ass and you over you improvise adapt and overcome it makes you happier at night to do that very fortunate I was born in America I you know I didn't grow up in an impoverished crime-ridden community understood to deal with gang violence but you're certainly not advocating them coming in illegally no I just think there's got to be there's got to be a better conversation about this and I think that the conversation is that if you oppose these people that are illegal immigrating into this country that you're a racist police is what's going on right now my bass player Marco Mendoza is a Mexican it might be player Johnny gunnels a black guy but it's simple to call people racist like people love to do that they love to reduce you isn't that still one rule but it's its rule it's it's ignorant of it's a denial of nuance well that's a that's a tsunami of accusations against me and I've always made it perfectly clear throughout my 70 year life I have always judged by content of character never by color of skin I have to admit there is a racist element in me because I'm an expect a black guy to be able to play a better groove than a white guy that has been that had been overruled over the years because there's so many white guys that learn from the black masters that now it is raceless but in growing up I always figured the black guy would be a better musician in in the racist against white people yes in the early days it was that way but nowadays we learn from those black soul artists that were the consummate definitive authority of emotional music from the James Brown The Funk Brothers and Chuck and beau and Little Richard and BB and Freddie and Albert and all these monster black heroes of everybody's and there's not a musician the world that won't admit that but now because of that influence all these years the white boys can keep right up there with them in fact in many instances compared a lot of the rap in the hip-hop there's a whole lot of white guys out there I think at Joe Bonamassa and Anton fig and certainly Jason heartless and Greg Smith and all the guys Niro Smith and and ZZ Top I mean you close your eyes and there's not a Caucasian to be found in these bands nowadays soul wise so yeah race the the the the repugnant dishonest charge of racism is completely it's one that you can't shake just someone calls your racist no that I shake it heat it I know but people have called you a racist conscious and everybody everybody with a heart and a soul knows I'm not in a you had you know you know who the racists are people that call me a racist those are the racists well and dirtbags to be it's just it's an unfair thing to do that people like to do because it automatically puts you on the defensive you're automatically on your heels and you have to defend this charge against racism by proving you're not a racist which is people suspicious that you might be racing I don't yeah I'm just I just live a great life with great people and race creed ethnicity religion gender gender confusion matters what do you think about that I think I think Kaitlyn I think Bruce over went Kaitlyn because I beat him in all the races we raced against high pray for Bruce Kaitlyn what a great guy with all her a girl now I will if that's what he after if that's what she likes it's a weird one right yeah where was this when you work yes it's it's it's a different arena of thought um and only she can make that choice and you have to respect that choice it it's mind twisting twisting and anybody says it's not it's not being honest but but it's very strange like Diane Sawyer God loved her but she had the opportunity of a lifetime when she was interviewing Bruce and he was saying you know for all practical purposes I am a I'm a woman and she said she should have said yeah except for the dick but I raced against Bruce if she did say oh I wish like that man but I got to be friends with Bruce when he was the god of manliness yeah you know the coolest on everything is just the holosuite he's the baddest mother hurdled the earth and I raced with them in off-road races and stuff and I always beat him which was just shit luck because I was more aggressive and he was a great guy and I spun I suspect he's still a she's still a great gal yeah I mean I respect anyone's choice to do whatever you want as long as I'm having people now that category absolutely how many people have come to you that you run into in all your you know your circles and musicians curious about hunting that didn't know where to start because that's what many things it comes to me a lot people like I want to get I have so many comedians is great isn't it yeah and they don't know how to get started I'm like man I wish I had the time to take you but I don't I've barely have enough time to go myself I've witnessed you articulated and you're doing a great job and I thank you for that and I salute you made great progress and inroads in that arena of ignorance and presumptuousness but I'm very blessed because I'm a loudmouth and I'm alive I mean I'm engaged I exercised my duties as We the People to talk about policies and get in the face of my elected employees and hold them to constitutional accountability I'm I'm like I missed the Concord bridge so I'm you're doing this now and I in my everyday walk at the sushi restaurant at the gas station at the feed mill at the charity event people are always coming up and they those that would hesitate I guess never showed up because I never felt any hesitation they're always genuinely intrigued and they express confusion and uncomfortableness discomfort with the concept of killing game but within minutes when I talk about sustained yield habitat carrying capacity just simple readily understood earthly logistics they go I never thought of it like that before yeah well they're gonna have babies next year and there's not gonna be any new ground we're gonna have to grow next year's wildlife on the existing habitat and in most cases reduced habitat but thank God the Cougars can live in your backyard and the Bears can live in the cul-de-sac in Pennsylvania and coyotes to live in your bathroom if you don't like the door so wildlife has adapted miraculously I mean geese and ducks and turkeys are and deer and elk and bear they're literally everywhere check out an Estes Park in Colorado I mean they're there landscaping Destructo Derby so we don't need to worry about encroaching on habitat because they will adapt and they have wonderful and again more deer more elk more cougar more bear more turkey more geese than ever in recorded history and were slaughtering him by the gazillions every year because they growth the gazillions every year and once I expressed it to people like that and then I inject the the inescapable truism you talk organic you talk close to the earth quality real food is there something better than venison I cuz if there is I want so this conversation is what I'm talking about they people don't know how to get started they hear about that and there's all this talk about organic and you know close to nature and being connected to your food but they don't know how to it's pretty easy to start a garden if you have a yard but to start hunting that's a there's a great barrier to entry there is but it's easily overcome and again go to my Facebook I mean not just be my Facebook but I am the the glowworm of the hunting lifestyle I mean people have always come to me for that because I've always promoted it and I've never backed down and almost every interviewer brings it up since the 1960s because it was the tip of the culture war controversial spear it really was hunting and guns those are the tip of the culture war from the beginning because people were moving from urban self-sufficient hunting fishing trapping earthly lifestyles to the city where they were catered to and they didn't hear the chicken squawking so they didn't feel responsible for its death right your avid cordon bleu you're a killer yeah when I expressed that they go yeah you got a point there and I went yeah think yeah so I I use blunt street term nomenclature and easily identified colloquialisms of modern terminology that is timeless and it its registers with them quickly now getting over the hump to have access to hunting ground I also have been effective in educating people on that because everybody's got an Uncle Joe everybody's got access to some state or federal open ground and even though the hunting isn't very quality on those public areas oftentimes if you are willing to pursue what should have inspired you to ask about hunting and that means to go beyond the beaten path which is part of the spiritual experience leaving the modern push and getting into a wild area I find that a lot of my new baptised hunting young old and other that they like going deep and they will find that deer that's not on the fringes of public ground that have already been you know so pressured that they've moved into the interior nucleus of more sanctuary habitat and these guys it's they almost cry they're so happy even if they didn't get something cuz I got in there took me two hours to get in there was still dark and I was concerned about my safety I'd never been that deep in the woods before from the Manistee National Forest at Michigan or in any wild ground with Colorado Wyoming Montana California and they said you're right Ted it's changed my life just watching that deer come down I forgot to draw my bow so it it's an immediate aliveness that is rarely available in a modern setting except for great family times birth death sex laughter around a campfire primal moments primal primal moments yes I call it a prayer for the wild things I actually wrote this in the New York Times way back in the I guess it was the 80s I wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine feature about my Christmas buck and I've written it in all kinds of place and I'm amazed that people still question whether I'm serious about hunting or not are you kidding me I've written New York Times bestsellers and the number one show on our channel for 30 years almost who questions whether or not you're serious about hunting yeah I did someone actually questions that yeah just not sure what it's all about they don't know what my statements are just how can you how can you avoid them well I mean there's many people that would hear about you and then immediately go oh fuck that guy I heard him talk yeah I said he said fuck and he called somebody a motherfucker he did something and you've never been on the street really the street you've never been on the street you never heard this language before you lying sack of shit being this polarizing guy though does it get exhausting like so many people don't agree at all figure rating it's entirely justice constantly doing welcome battle with people but I don't I don't do battle I merely put out the truth logic common sense the science its irrefutable it's not my opinion I have no opinion I'm just genuflect at the altar of truth logic common sense and science and I share it and if you can't grasp it you work on it and I'm here if you need me but you clearly like it you like well on these Piers Morgan interviews yes because without me who's gonna do it that they're lies will stand there their their dishonesty and their mean-spirited well why do you think they have these love why do you think a good press there's Morgan does he's been so removed they are so Siddha fide that they say fine they think their cordon bleu didn't die right they think that they're pulled pork sandwich came like that and and within just minutes an honest person will admit that their tofu salad has a whole bunch of dead ground squirrels in its vapor trail and but unless they're unless I tell them then what nobody else can I tell them that well another thing that's a big blind spot is they don't understand where conservation money comes from when you talk to them about the pikmin Robertson ash you talk to them about what how many billions of dollars every year is it generated from sales of ammunition hunting gear jewels and arrows and we did that we self imposed that the hard time but yeah the hunters there wasn't before my time but yeah was that well a third Engle Robert and Pitt's man yeah it was almost a Teddy Roosevelt thing but the real battle cry was in my lifetime we there was no anti-hunting first ten years of my life it it was the concrete jungle certification removal from the system by which we are sustained that was a convenient disconnect and you could deny it because you didn't hear the animals die I didn't see the blood it was nice and cleaned up in the little cellophane package and then this is new over the last few generations yeah and that denial metastasized into a cult of make-believe in fantasy but to their credit there is only a lunatic fringe I don't believe that the animal rights even though they've succeeded in in California they run into a dead end brick wall everywhere else even though in Michigan the dirtbags succeeded in banning the hunting of the number-one game animal on planet Earth the mourning dove where we grow more doves in Michigan than all the quail pheasant Woodcock and grouse combined that's a weird one right because that's the people have never eaten dubbed they don't have a delicious and you hear about a dove you go wait a minute that's piece yeah can't you pee this is this isn't an analogy of everything that's wrong in America you're killing piece you're killing piece but what it's that's a lunatic fringe though it really is a loaded fringe it's it's a convenient a pain because it seems like it's invincible yeah you're a dove why would you shoot a dove Ted you like listen I'm gonna cook up some dove for you yeah and then you tell me why I wouldn't shoot a dove yeah why is it okay to shoot a chicken it's not okay to shoot a duck well is it okay to shoot a pheasant it's not okay you're much too pragmatic Joe and watch the logic you might hurt somebody conversations don't take place well they just thank you thank God you've been baptized because this has a great impact because your average listener does not come to here hunting truth your average listener comes to here smartass dialogue and issue review and intellectual analysis of life's experiences all good all perfect but that you have inflected and injected the truth about conservation wise use wildlife management is a hallelujah moment which is why I'm sitting across from you today well cuz I value that and a lot of it I got honestly from people like you that were enthusiastic about it that got me curious when I saw how enthusiastic you were about hunting and about the eating of wild meat and how much energy it gives you I got very curious many years before I ever started hunting because I because I I saw a lot of those PETA videos we see these horrific conditions and factory farms and I didn't want to be a part of that I was trying to figure out how to not be a part of that and so when I first decided to start hunting but before that I was making to decide was either I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna hate it and I'm never gonna do it again and I'm gonna be a vegetarian or I'm gonna become a hunter and the moment I shot that deer and then we ate it I was like oh I'm doing this forever magic sucker brewery actually came out and admitted that if he's gonna eat flesh he's gonna kill it himself a whole year everything he ate he killed you know and I think that people would have a better understanding of what their food is and when you have these conversations with people when it talks when it comes to animal rights ideas and what shouldn't shouldn't be legal 90 what five ninety seven percent of the people eat meat I mean it's a crazy number it's our life support system it's protein food people think you're just gonna stop that listen you're gonna get a lot of people that aren't healthy this is not the way to go and if some people want to go vegan and they can with careful studying of their diet and making sure they're supplementing with all the right things good luck yep good go for it well you know yes you asked how we can initiate this conversation after my great hero fredbear died in 1987 it was the next year I started the Ted Nugent camp for kids which was a a movement forward of what he told me to continue promoting conservation and hunting the way I was so I started a charity 501 C 3 charity the Ted Nugent camp for kids where we run in Colorado South Dakota Nebraska and Iowa every year we've graduated over 16,000 boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 17 from great volunteers men and women from every imaginable walk of life that I have to vet because it's got my name on it but great heroes of law enforcement and military and just great families and we teach them the discipline of archery the discipline of wildlife management if you don't fish upon the fish will if they'll over populate and they'll die off that you have to harvest a surplus to make room for the next productivity and trapping the importance of trapping that that's how you keep disease under control and that's how you keep value to fur bearers and that's how you make really great great warm clothes and atlatl x' and fly fishing and the meticulous detail and discipline of tying flies and being clean and sober and being the best that you can be and self-sufficiency and rugged individualism so this has been going on since 1989 and still you haven't read a word about it in new york times you haven't read a word about it anywhere because they're too quick to condemn me because I'm so good at promoting hunting and gun ownership that they they avoid me like the plague but the real tragedy is that outdoor life field and stream sports the field guns and ammo all these sporting publications not a word 30 years of a wonderful charity created by a household name celebrity about the most important things in life they just don't care it's so I'm mentioning it here on the Joe Rogan podcast because my volunteers have been doing God's work for all these years and plus people have been very generous the Sheik our safaris donate money every year and people just dig deep and make donations to keep the camp alive so if people want to find out about that then go to my website but it's a charity for children about being aware of resource stewardship and hands-on boots-on-the-ground environmentalism if you're gonna cut a tree you might want to plant 50 simple I know you do a lot of them we do a lot of that a lot or every planting and you've you've done every year since 69 yeah I've got forests in Michigan I mean giant towering forests it's fun to kill deer on your own ground it's fun to kill deer anywhere it's exciting it's challenging it's all the good things but to me you do it on your own ground that you earned it's really special but when you do it on the own ground that you earned and you lately built the forest yes it's it's spiritual it's almost like I levitate when I'm in my forest well I remember you had I don't remember who it was you had some rock and roll guy on your Sebastian Bach I think one time was one one of the guys but you were you were talking about how someone was saying this is amazing I wish I had my oh this is great yeah was that that was Steven Tyler we were like my vagin snorted your own forest I said you snorted the Upper Peninsula who are you kidding and they did that you had a mine here he could have bought one hell of a nice ranch that the life that you live like that life having this you you essentially live in an area in both places when Michigan into Texas you hunt in your own environment you have your own hunting place but ER its controversial and this is what's controversial about it the fence well the Texas property is fenced because I have exotics so by law and why do I have it fenced why do we have exotics because if it wasn't fenced with exotics those exotics would have probably been extinct by now but landowners in Texas we took the lead from South Africa and a lot of people don't know this Joe in fact I articulated an upcoming spirit of the wild show high fenced hunting saved wildlife in Africa because the the development of agriculture in Africa was in total conflict with the migration of wildlife we're talking all those incredible species from Elin and kudu and gems Bock and in Yala and wildebeest and in in in the warthogs and in elephants they would migrate every year of golf sudden the migration came to your citrus grove and destroyed everything it killed all the wildlife because you want to sell your citrus well some of the ranchers who valued the wildlife more than citrus and there's nothing wrong with citrus they literally said well goddamn it every time my herds migrate only a portion of them come back because they all these Agri concerns are destroying killing the wildlife to protect their agriculture so I'm an offense my twenty thousand acres and I'm gonna manage it twenty thousand acres is huge even my spirit wild ranches 300 acres it still has a finite productivity every habitat is finite yeah and so they started selling those hunts for the surplus every year of these magnificent wildlife species instead of agriculture so those animals are thriving an absolute natural habitat as is my home ground spirit wild ranch in Texas you must harvest the surplus fence or no fence and mark my words people who condemn and criticize high fence hunting is not fair chase are speaking out of their ass Ted Nugent hunts more days in an average year than most people will in their lifetime I hunt hundreds of days every morning every afternoon the animals have to die I must make room for next year's productivity in your situation in all situation in your situation in particular because you're only on 380 that's right you're a certain amount of animal in habitat but everybody even on its outside my fence you still got to kill them animals too but a lot of like purists would look at that and go man is that really hunting I mean your ears my ass you read in area you ready yeah life time experience hunting you know most difficult animals in the world the most challenging animals in the world pressured are my pressured animals and spirit watch on my open 1,100 acres swamp in Michigan if I want to shoot a deer I can 90% plus tell ya all my different choices of treestands and my strategies of wind and in habitat and positioning bait or no bait just travel corridors I've been living there owned it since 1978 in fact the one place I've owned since 1970 I I have a like a 20 times the shot opportunity on my open ground than I do on my fenced ground my high fenced hunting and all the high fenced hunting I've ever had is as absolutely pure fair chase as any wilderness I've ever been to from the Sudan to Alaska to Saskatchewan to Ontario to Montana to Wyoming to Northern California it is hunting the roll the fence plays is zero in my killing an animal it only plays a role in keeping pressure outside so I don't have to shoot that two or three or four year old buck I can wait till he's five but I still have to kill those fidgety dough's and it's absolutely pure hunting I understand your perspective the way the way people disagree is that the idea of these animals can never leave they're stuck they're stuck there so you know that they're going to be there which is the difference between that and like say you go into a backcountry hunt you know you park your truck in the trailhead and hiking twitch I've no idea I'm sure you do these animals you have no idea if they're there or not well if you're white ranch you have no idea whether they're right but you know you don't you know you have a lot of sure right it's just it's a different thing to be both so but again it's like do people have a problem fishing in a stock pond or in a pond that's not stocked but managed on my property so that I fish it adequately enough so that the bass get to be six seven and eight pounds right but I don't let him get stunted the same thing those fish ain't going anywhere and quite honestly in those suburban areas and urban areas and even farming across America those deer are there yeah they are there and I have no better chance of shooting a deer on spirit wild ranch in the high fence than I do hunting the suburbs of of Columbus Ohio where those deer can go everywhere except that there is a highway right there there's a hospital over there there's a school over there and there's a neighborhood over there and there's a factory over here so every habitat has its limitations yeah I had a conversation with someone about axis deer and lanai we just got back from lanai awesome overpopulated there it's crazy overpopulated so I said there's two responsible 20,000 axis deer and 3,000 people on this island and so someone says to me what's the challenge in that I'm like oh Christ you never seen an axis so uppity they are why are what they're what they're most wired species this side of Bongo and I'm gonna say mature kudu these guys can go Bongo is a huge antelope it's actually orange with black and white stripes from the Central African Republic and Cameroon and so they evolved to get away from the lions whereas the axis deer evolved to get away from Tigers yep yeah they're just anything that lives around cats like mule deer hi country here just switched on you're looking for my well Michigan deer because there's you know so many hundreds yeah they're pressured from the time they're but that's the thing about your place in Michigan like in Michigan it's very hard to find a large mature deer not on our property cuz I'm saying we stop shooting young ones and all the neighbors agree just like they did in Buffalo County Wisconsin which is all just decisions by contiguous landowners right to not shoot young bucks because somebody shot a 200 inch and then went on my farm so they knew they were there that's why I was so popular because deer hunting was not popular and guys were shooting six or seven year old mammoths and so there are hunters that started deer hunting went well I'm not shooting that two year old you know booger buck cuz Joe down the road got a got a massive stag I'm gonna wait for one of them and by waiting for them they do get older and they do have that mysticism of stagnant is better for the population because of that guy gets to breed yeah here to spread those good genetic let's talk about that to luck blood people go trophy hunting takes out the best genes yeah no it does not understand we keep we keep setting records for deer and moose and elk and care and bear and mountain lion and antelope every year we set world records constantly because our hunting system of being disciplined and waiting for that mature animal our hunting system has produced the healthiest most monstrosity specimens in the history of record-keeping every year so we're not hurting anything by being disciplined and patient which I've learned over the years and my son is very adamant about and so many hunters are there's a there's a mysticism to that mature stag sharam the breeders of our ancestors were the best hunters and they did the breeding because they were more resourceful and more intelligently connected to the system by which we fed the tribe so those those killer stag hunters were always the leader of of tribes and and it's still that way today I'd like to think and also this pursuit of bow hunting which is more difficult and more rewarding because it's more difficult is many levels more difficult when you're chasing after a 200 inch box so imposters this is six seven year old animal that's been avoiding mountain lions and bears and whatever else is trying to eat it for years and years this thing is switched on they take very clever paths they let the the dough's and the fawns wander over sand they lay back and typically come out around turn they come out about midnight and go back to bed around 1:00 yeah now there is a variance there in South Texas where age management was created because they they supplement and they got center pivot agriculture down in the deserts of South Texas and that genetic is a very fortified genetic anyhow two hundred pound deer are not that rare a lot of people think all deer in Texas are little but they're not and if you let them grow which text is pretty much pioneered those bucks in South Texas are the easiest deer on the planet to kill there's a couple of dynamics there's just some strange genetic lineage there that they're a calmer animal plus they're on wide open vast private ground which means they don't get the public hordes of pressure and once that buck is a button buck the first year nobody shoots at him so he encounters he smells that person he sees that person he hears that person no problem second year he little booger buck he ran into people nobody brought nobody messed with him third year he's got a nice little rack he still ran into people no problem there's some corn here is where the wheat field is yeah I smell that guy but three years he's never bothered me I'll just keep you forth your same thing so they've reduced their fear factor of the encounter with humans because nobody shot at them because they're not gonna shoot until they're sick is that natural but right is that wouldn't that be consider like that's weird it's almost like this is a pet or a farm liner about that I mean just a relaxed animal that was not pressured we'd not just relax but accustomed to humans yes but they're still elusive you're not gonna walk up to them and Club them right um though there are some places down there where they get so relaxed that they do hand feed some of the dough's now they get so relaxed that seems so strange to me well but everybody's got their own little preference and I I've never thought of wildlife as pets I just wouldn't own a deer as a pet I would you're asking for trouble and it's it's not natural but if that's what you like I'm have a nice day well you know those farms the deer farms that's one of the primary ideas of the source of CWD right no they think that a lot of it comes from deer farm those came from Colorado Department of Wildlife what do you mean 1967 they injected Scrappy's which is the Sheep version of the spongiform encephalitis into the mule deer in 1967 and they got out that's where it started why did they inject I cannot imagine bureaucrats being assholes I suspect and so that some sort of experiment I don't know the sku know that sheep were more popular in America than cattle there were way more sheep and cattle until scrape e's came in which is that that CWD version for Sheep mad cow in bovines and creutzfeldt-jakob in humans and of course Crutchfield Jacob was a result to scientist determined by the scientist Crutchfield and Jacob that the Indonesian people that got this this spongiform condition from a mutated prion because they ate the brains of their conquered enemies we'd never a good idea so so I'm aware of all this stuff but believe me when I tell you live on the Joe Rogan podcast the CWD hysteria is a scam more deer are killed in Michigan every year by feral dogs then all the deer ever worldwide by CWD I think the concern though with CWD is that it's spreading it's not my friend Doug his farm in Wisconsin they're just starting to test positive for CWD there's Yoda you know why because they're looking for it well it's not just that they were looking for it before but they think that it's come from animals that get out of these high fence farm operations where they all feed from the same trough and they spread this from there I think there's no evidence to support that dr. James Croll just have testified with me in front of the Michigan natural resource Commission and Department of Natural Resources and all the exhaustive studies have concluded that CWD cannot be cross-species you can't get it by a person can't can't person can't get it they they had on macaw monkeys get up but that's because the injected massive quantities into the brain of the macaque monkey otherwise they couldn't get him but CWD Wisconsin's spent seventy million dollars I'm not making that number up Wisconsin spent seventy million dollars tried to eradicate certain herds which is a virtual impossibility by the way and even if you were successful the the mutated prion they they stay in the ground typically through urine yeah and there is a part of plants as well there was no evidence whatsoever that CWD is ever compromised a servant heard it there's been no reduced seasons even in the epicenter the endemic area of Colorado Wyoming worst where it's the most prevalent no seasons have been reduced no reduced tags no reduced in harvest it's in consequential it occurs so rarely they've studied the deer for 18 years in Wisconsin and deer that had CWD 18 years collared and monitored still having fawns they say it's always fatal it is not always fatal go to dr. deer slash Facebook either dr. deer calm slash Facebook or are you not worried about it at all not what do you think it worried about bureaucrats that have scared away hunters in Wisconsin and caused butchers to quit processing deer because of the manufactured hysteria CWD is not a concern Buicks kill more deer than CWD it it the bureaucrats go in and slaughter deer by the thousands so if CWD is killed 58 deer in Michigan which has they found I don't think any of them were fatal I think they had to kill him though they did find one in Jackson County they claim I don't believe him I just don't believe bureaucrats remember these are the bureaucrats Jo in Michigan that claimed that there were quote 5,000 to 7,000 Russian boar running wild in Michigan can we analyze that analyze that claim for a moment maybe you can tell me Joe what the fuck is a Russian boar I'll tell you what a Russian boar is it's a male Pig in Russia there's no such genus as a Russian boar it's all white stale bullshit and that was the official statement by a game agency in Michigan lion sons of bitches and then they claimed and here's another one so isn't it our moral and spiritual obligation to wisely use the animals we harvest isn't it yes in Michigan the farmers can slaughter sandhill cranes which are known as rib eye in the sky right it's supposed to be delicious it is farmers and Michigan's can can shoot sandhill cranes but by law are not allowed to eat them what is this a game Department you can trust wait a minute no I will not wait a minute you heard me right you're not allowed to eat Santa this game Department is gonna try to tell me about wildlife management when they claimed there were 6,000 or 7,000 russian-born by the way let's say there were 6,000 5,000 to 7,000 wild pigs in Michigan back when they claimed it in the 90s you know how many that would be today show me some game cameras 800,000 deer hunters in Michigan what is their 1020 thousand game cameras it's a lie CWD is a lie CWD has killed 58 deer in Michigan so they claim the DNR's authorized the slaughter of tens of thousands who's the enemy of the deer hunter the bureaucrats are I'm telling you in Michigan they have lost their souls it's a heartbreaker I can't understand the rationale for not eating sandhill crane there is none but what are they saying when you shoot them you have to just let them rot bait you have to bury so later more shooting them as a nuisance animals that the idea even if it even if that's that's the idea but here's them here's the truth you're the guitar they don't have tags the guitar player will help okay if there's enough sand no cranes for farmers to shoot open the season sell licenses create a management plan and show some decency and respect and let us eat the rib eye in the sky you stupid bastards yeah that makes sense now see I'm confrontational now because I've been confronted with an offensive criminal law that forbids us to utilize God's precious protein that doesn't make any no sense it doesn't make any sense that the mourning doves you know the picture of the Dove on millions of boxes of ammo in Michigan there's a picture of a dove earnest says game load but the Michigan DNR will say oh no no that's a songbird you can't shoot him and eat him it's it's Planet of the Apes and it's Cooper's new people that don't have any background whatsoever in wildlife or hunt well but that they're trained biologists it's different right and they're influenced by politicians bureaucrats they're liars that question too wild boy look whatever go to restaurants as like wild boar sauce and like as a male yeah why are you calling it a bore that's right it's wild pig it's but it sounds sexy yeah with Russian boars we have 8,000 Russian boys what are they gay yeah they're out there in the woods ban each other there's girls thank god they're all males there maybe that's what happened maybe they did have 8,000 boars and they're all going where's the fucking check but how can a game Department use that kind of terminology yeah it's a real problem with a straight face it's a real problem that when they when they speak about it that way you immediately dismiss what they're saying because you're not they're not being accurate they're not being accurate with describing what the animal is and you're inclined to dismiss anything so you're only allowed to shoot those sandhill cranes as a nuisance animal you can't shoot up and eat them it's unbelievable that's crazy and they're by the way they're everywhere there's plenty of sandhill cranes in Michigan to open the season a lot of people go a lot have you ever talked to senators and congressmen they go away you can't you can't shoot sandhill cranes out when it's a game bird yeah dirtbag you need to cook before oh yeah I watched the episode of Rinella show when they were cooking I was like that looks like a thief it's it's I'm red animal yeah red meat you know it's just tragic in California can't eat mountain lions you gotta bury him you don't eat him it's only shot one with a depredation permit any variant that's right wow that's that's indecent that's why that's why I'm confrontational I'm confronting indecency and trying to get some honesty involved and you can't do it by backing off and being Mitt Romney like and bring it daily to a grenade fight to Whateley I like to bring an a-10 warthog to a poker game Ted we just did three hours in like 15 minutes right even warmed up just flew by right it's time just flew by that's because it's a lovefest of truth logic and common sense well listen man it's been a pleasure to meet you back at be able to sit down with you Megan and have a good conversation here my friends were right you do deserve me and I think it's I think it's a good opportunity for people to get a chance to see you in a long-form conversation rather than these sound bites they could just choose to hate ya when the sound bites are edited and yes and let's make it perfectly clear I did not avoid the draft I did nothing oh let's go I am NOT raising real quick that was an old school story of an interview supposedly that you should all over yourself in high time and by the way Joe you know me pretty well in the last three hours if I had shit on myself to get out of the draft do you think for a minute I would deny it I would have it was the story's not about I went in and got my draft physical by the way when I win in 1969 I was Superman I literally would hurtle Volkswagen bugs I was all muscle and sinew I could I was Superman I was the most athletic running jumping gazelle known to man and I went in for my Dryden or anything about Vietnam I didn't know anything about war my dad was a war hero but nobody talked about it I never heard of the Bataan Death March I've graduated from the American education system so I knew nothing and there was all protests around me but I wasn't ready tuned in to the protests because I was making music every day I mean just obsessed with the Amboy Dukes and playing gigs every day and I didn't pay attention I never watched newscast in my life but I was given a draft notice and I went down I went down I had my draft physical and I passed with flying cover colors and I got a draft card in the mail a couple months later through my mom and dad's house and one wide but not a deferment it's a designation I was in Oakland Community College at the time so I was why was a student designation I believe but I was ready to rock I didn't want to go I didn't understand me but my buddies were going on John break my singer had to go Rob Leonard from Amboy Dukes had to go so the only way you could have gone is if you dropped out of school is that what it is no it wasn't a deferment no I wouldn't like I would have been called any time so you could have been called earlier just weren't sure and then the Wikipedia claims I got a 4 F 4 F what is a 4 a 4 F it means you're physically incapable I've never been physically incapable of anything so they make this shit up so so I did an interview with the High Times which by the way let's clear I've done this so many times but people ignore my actual statements so I had been doing interviews all because the Amboy Dukes were on fire and I was just an outrage onstage with the loincloth and the bow and arrow and feedback and these killer songs and the band was so good greatest musicians in the world so I did interviews all the time talking about the music I loved and they never got anything right these stone dirtbag hippie writers got the gas guys than the band's names wrong they got the facility wrong they mention songs we didn't perform they got nothing right and every time I'd read the interview oh god we were talking about my music you didn't even get the song titles right so I started having fun with these interviewers much to the entertainment of my bandmates who would break out in hysterics when I'd make up stories because I'm not gonna even try to be accurate anymore it was an ongoing maneuver of mine we'd have these hippy writers come in to take notes and I'd say yeah I played his Fender Stratocaster as I hold up my Gibson Birdland which was known for and they'd write down he played in Gibson Stratocaster there's no such thing is it gives the Stratocaster so I was having fun with dirtbag anti journalists so now I'm invited to High Times Magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug so I go weird and this guy is you know in his interviews typically so so tell me about this i Amboy Dukes what is it like a band I mean yeah it's like a band so it's almost exactly like a band so anyhow he started talking about when I'm with the mc5 and the Stooges and we would party and I go yeah man I was snorting something I don't know what it was man I just got higher than a kite and he goes wow you think I might have been crystal meth and I went yeah that's what they called it I never snorted Chris I just made up sighs I just went nuts and I we went into the war thing and I go I don't anything about war I'm a I'm a guitar player but I went down for my draft physical and when I went into the booth to give my urine sample I made sure I eat Mexican food all week so instead of pissin in the urine Cup I took a big dump in it was green and went all over the place and the guy went Wow really yeah really and so I made up this story for High Times Magazine you know the great magazine of good information and and then it turned out that my drummer KJ Knight God blessing me to actually admitted this and and testified that that's what he did we thought it was the funniest thing in the world were teenagers and this guy went into the draft physical just an absolute near-death lump of shit to get out of the draft and we thought it was funnier in hell we weren't paying attention to important things in life and so the the Ted hating liberal press started quoting the High Times Magazine and quoting an ex-girlfriend who claimed that I adopted her that her I adopted my girlfriend have you read that one I did read that what I forgot about it so this kind of stuff I was like you adopted her so you could take her on tour with you know so I could fuck her that's what the story was but that's a absolutely no works that's not don't think it makes it easier to talk and once you adopt them I didn't adopt anybody right I never shit my pants since I was I think eight months old I've never been with an underage girl since I was underage I'm not a racist and what else they said oh and they same that the claim that I made Courtney Love blow me when she was 12 I think she claimed that I yeah I never met Courtney Love you can tell I don't have a rash you just gotta be kidding me they just make this shit up because they know I'm so good at bringing my basic conservative agenda forward that they have to go full Saul Alinsky and lie and lie and lie and if you go to Wikipedia to find out about Ted Nugent they will repeat these lies their lies when everyone knows thing every one of those things if I had done and I go yeah it was awesome but I didn't do any of those things anyone can edit Wikipedia the boss very strange you might have edited it yes so I'm glad we got that so this thing is just persistent forever obviously it's stuck in your craw cuz you wanted to bring it up at the very thick my crotch just it's a fascinating example of the dishonesty and the anti journalism agenda driven anti-american anti Ted anti Second Amendment anti-freedom buffoonery they exist and I think it makes for an interesting podcast exchange I think so it's not in my craw it's not even in my universe but I notice it it's hysterical Ted Nugent ladies and gentlemen there you have it full up until next week bye everybody [Applause] [Music]
