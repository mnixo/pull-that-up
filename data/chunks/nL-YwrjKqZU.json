three two hello Barry hi Joe great double double guns good to see it take a seat so I'm enjoying my tumeric you are right superfood it's good Laird Hamilton's onto something right Laird Hamilton and Gwyneth Paltrow no no no no one is a world champion athlete one of the greatest surfers the world has ever known the other one is a wonderful actress who is Iron Man's girlfriend this is different this is a big difference and you know a major mogul and determines what people like me want to purchase buy and look like she wants you to put vagina rocks yeah in there right Jade Jade stones something like that I don't know maybe there's a placebo effect that so when we were talking so well before the podcast rolled out the I just wanted to just just start it you know we don't wouldn't have to talk about presidential candidates we don't have to talk about all that but we're in a weird time you know and to speak to what we're talking about before we're just talking about how people are so strange there's so much so many people there's just a big disconnect between what people actually think and what they actually say and I think this is in my life this is the first time that I've ever really experienced this at this level there's a hysteria because people are being punished for their real beliefs instead of like having the ability to express themselves and have other people disagree and have some sort of rational discussion there's this is a strange time what you have to toe the status quo you have to toe the line and I'm trying I've been trying to figure out what it is but I think a big part of it is the opposition to Trump I think people's opposition to Trump is so strong they lost their minds yeah it seems like the people that oppose him they just want complete and total compliance with with opposition with with this different way of thinking does that make sense yeah it's like the stakes are so high that everyone needs to be on side and an active part of the resistance and if you deviate in any way it shows that you're a squish or that you're actually loyal to the other side and in fact with that side of things is doing is that there omitting the spectrum of what's allowed to say so so so narrowly that people I think are becoming kind of secretly radicalized because in the other way yes yes and honestly like you're great but I think one of the reasons you're so unbelievably popular is because you just say what you think and you bring other people on here just say what they think and the number of places where that actually happens is unbelievably small and getting smaller it's so straightened you get shit for it that's what's really crazy like you'd I'm I'm a nice person like my thoughts on these things that I discussed in the show are well thought out and I only hope to do good like legitimately I mean I mock things and I you know I'm a comedian but at the end of the day I want everybody to be happy I really genuinely do I think that's possible I think it's possible in small groups right I mean this is what the analogy I always use if it was just the three of us on earth I think we get along great we have our disagreements but there would be no war there certainly would none the three of us wouldn't kill each other right you me and Jamie he's a good guy but but my point is like why can't we scale that out why can't we all just get along in larger groups what a lot of it is a lack of communication a lot of it is you know greed and there's there's so many different reasons why you can't scale that to millions and millions of people but it just seems like there's no no weirder time where things don't make sense and progress seems to be stalled socially than today and like the way that I think about it lately is I feel like normalcy is closeted like normal people I know that have just like very sensible beliefs are scared to even say those things out loud right and I think that that is just a sign of deeply unhealthy culture and it like it only contributes to this sort of polarization and extremes that were that we're seeing yeah like you were talking about the denial of the biological differences between males and females like and we're that's this is something that people owe openly we want to support today they want to pretend that there is no difference well it's like you can both believe that there are two sexes and that there are biological differences between men and women and also believe that if someone asks you to call them by a different pronoun than the one that they used to go by or whatever that you want to respect that person and that life is so hard and why wouldn't you just go along with that sure those are two beliefs that many people I know hold and yet to suggest that gender and sex are only a construct and is something that people don't feel like they can express right now that it's only a construct I know a lot of people who feel like they can only say that gender and sex are a construct oh yeah they're stuck they're stuck saying that the way you were phrasing it sound like the other way I'm saying that like two things are possible at once shorten can believe in biological difference and believe that people should be respected and that you know if someone wants to change their gender and that life becomes much more you know cheiron's gender is real and also sex differences are real yes and those two things are possible at once yes yes I think about that a lot you know with my with my book with the case of someone like congresswoman Ilhan Omar it's like Ilhan Omar is the subject of bigotry not least from the President of the United States and yet Ilhan Omar herself has said some things about Jews and Israel that are themselves bigoted both things are true at once and yet we're living in a society where it seems like you can only choose one of those two sides yes a binary society as opposed to a nuanced one that's what's weird about today it's like we're dealing with the same amount of intelligent people but they seem to be shackled in their their ability to express themselves honestly and so what are they scared of right repercussions right those are real right you look at someone I think that one thing that's overlooked in this when we talk about canceled culture right and the social ostracism and the actual firings that can happen when you break with one another orthodoxy is that the people who are inoculated from it or people that are already extremely successful and can take the risk it's why Ricky Gervais is can be Ricky Gervais sits why JK Rowling can tweet what she tweeted a few months ago and survived it because they've already accumulated enough capital the people that I hear from that are completely screwed by it are people like artists and poets and untenured professors who aren't famous and no one knows about and are you know having to go with a begging bowl on patreon or venmo or whatever to get support after they've you know made a bad joke or whatever it is yes yes that that is exactly what's happening yeah it's um I mean I'm I'm sure that this is because of social media I'm sure this is the the repercussions of having this new form of communication that people don't wield responsibly that this these attacks on people you do them much more flippantly than you would if you were across from someone of course because there's no there's so little shame on the internet because people are disinhibited it's like people say things to me on the internet that are I wouldn't even mention them here I mean they're so vile they're just they're disgusting and yet I've seen some of these people in real life and they would never even have the courage to approach me on the street what's they're not real expressions when oh when they're doing that they're just they're button-pushing they're throwing rocks at glass and this is a good jump off point for your book on anti-semitism you know I I reached out to you because anti-semitism you know obviously I'm not Jewish so it's it's something that has always baffled me I don't hope for you to thank you can I convert you up to smell a rat but I I would have to I'd have to go through a little lengthy thing like you can't just convert right my uncle my uncle Salvatore Salvatore D Joel and oh I love it yeah see live oh yeah yeah he converted when we were kids that was when I first found out about Judaism I was like what is it like I didn't understand what it was you know we were raised Catholic and I was like god I guess I was probably like 5 or 6 when he was converting so he did take all these classes and you know go through all the stuff that you have to do and be converted even married a woman mm-hmm was Jewish and she was like crack that whip Jackie she told what's up so when but when that was all going down that was the first time I'd ever questioned religion because I was like wait wait wait what is that what is Judaism and then they explained I go do they believe in God yeah okay but is it different God and no it's the same God Jesus was a Jew jail yeah that's why I was confused I'm like well what is the difference like why why is there I didn't know there was anything other than Catholic I was five you know yeah I was baffled and I remember thinking like what how many of these fucking things are there and then I was told there were hundreds that's like oh Jesus this is a mess and then I went to Catholic school for a year and that really cured me of Oh any any idea of religion being legitimate Catholic school was so brutal what would you learn about the Jews in Catholic school nothing uh-huh yeah wasn't that it was just meanness it was just compliance and in fear and we're gonna make you sit in a closet and on a bed of nails oh my god these two wack kids in the head and nuns there was a bed of nails no no they would threaten you okay if you're gonna stuff to stay overnight and sleep on a bed of nails yeah they would just try to scare you if you cry they'd laugh at you and oh my god the meanest ladies there's no very few people a whose name I remember from being six years old but sister Mary Josephine that bitch I'll remember that bitch to the day I died she was so mean like I thought my parents were getting split up when I was little when I was five years old so I was really enthusiastic about God and religion because I felt like at least in that there's some sort of there's structure there's something that makes sense and I remember just being in Catholic school for just a couple of weeks and I was like well obviously this is horseshit - you know my parents relationship is horseshit this is horseshit like what is in this life but it was good for me though was very it was good at that time of my life to experience just the just a hypocrisy and the the meanness of it all the lack of love and the disdain for children like the whole thing it was an awful situation to find yourself in I'm sorry it wasn't that bad nobody sexually abused me I didn't get you know there was nothing hard no one beat me up but it was enough of a nightmare where it kind of like made me legitimately start questioning everything in life yeah so you're raising your daughters with saccular yes 100% secular my wife secular too but we talk about things and the one of the things that I think is important is that like I tell them if you live your life like God is real it's better because you live your life by these universal principles that at the core the core good of almost all religions follow treat each other as if they are loved family members treat people as if they're you treat to treat them as if it's you living another life the golden rule like all those things don't deal don't murder people are created in the image of God and whether or not that God exists if you believe that you'll treat people really well and if you do try and if they treat you like that like you live the world is better the world is a better place and that's that's how and the other thing that I say well I think this sorry that's okay but honestly I say honestly no one knows like if you say I know there's a god you're not being honest because you've met unless unless you know something that I don't unless you've died and experienced it and even then we could chalk that up to a host of neuro chemicals that your body releases when things are things are dying and some of them I've actually taken before so I I know what the experience is like and if you if you say there's no God you don't know what you're talking about either you you you really don't know if there's no God you no one knows no one knows what with the even the concept of God is you're talking about thousands of years of trying to decipher experiences and things that are translated from one language to another from different fanatic languages and it just it's very strange to try to tell people that you know something for a fact when you've never experienced it and this is what we talk about this is when I talk to my children I don't say there's no God gods bullshit religions bullshit everyone's lying to you I just say no one really knows but it gives people comfort it makes people feel better and then there's a lot of things that are really good about church and one of the things that's really good about church is the community yes I mean this to me connects to the thing that we opened by talking about which is polarization and tribal you know the tribal politics were living in I think you've had Jonathan height on the show and his book the righteous mind is brilliant about this that we were evolved to be religious creatures in a certain way and what happens when we lose religion that impulse goes somewhere and I think that impulse has gone into you know politics in the culture or yes you know it's like why are the stakes of that so unbelievably high because that is sort of the operating system that people are organizing their life around 100 percent right I think it's the Protestants versus the Catholic but it's like what what do we do right because we're not gonna go back like to convince people that are unconvinced that they're you know I think fighting for the idea of God is sort of a losing argument in the culture so how do we retain the good things that came from religious structures in a post god age I think that's a huge question well what are what are people really wary of one of the things that wary of is the recluse right we're wary we're wary of the Unabomber wearing that that guy who lives in the woods and and doesn't the the isolationist who doesn't need anybody else there by themselves like well that person doesn't follow by the rules of our community well what are we comfortable about we're comfortable about friendly neighbors we're comfortable okay you need help you know you need me to help dig you out of the snow do you need this do you need that like that's what we love right because then and we love people that share our values right we like to live in a community of shared values because then you like you're all we're all comforting each other we're all saying we're all in this too they're gonna have hardships we're gonna have good times but the the will have more good times will they'll get through the hardships if we operate together with similar values yeah but we're kind of we're not living in the age of the Unabomber but we're certainly living in an age where people are completely isolated you know everyone on the campaign trail is talking about the diseases of despair and how the lifespan in this country has gone down for the past three life expectancy has gone down in the past three years because of Trump out of work because because factories are closing because we're going through whatever Andrian calls at the fourth Industrial Revolution because of globalization because like we're living through an unbelievably trance what I think will be remembered is an unbelievably transformative time and Trump is only one data point yes like he's a symptom and he's a catalyst but he's not the whole picture and to see him as the whole picture I think is just like completely missing the moment that we're in well put very well put yeah I think I really think you you just nailed it I really think that's a lot of what's going on here and I think I mean what you said but people enjoying when people can speak their mind when people see someone like Ricky Gervais get up at the Golden Globes and say yes yes or like Chappelle's like Chappelle's you're like that to me Uber's yeah but the Chappelle one was so good because if you looked at Rotten Tomatoes right the critics rating of it was something like twenty percent favorable no it was zero first it was zero yeah and then they'll open it up to the public but the only 99 percent you know and it's like we just keep living that out again and again and again and I just wonder like how that resolves itself or maybe it doesn't it does it resolves itself to a conversation like this yeah that's really what it is with the people or when you have it I come to meet the common man young the common man and basically I mean when we talk and people listen to reasonable discussion then they feel more emboldened to have reasonable discussion of their own maybe perhaps some private may have to fucking put tinfoil over the windows and bolt the door shut and make sure that they can talk that's insane yeah it is like we're living in the freest society in human history and people are acting like the Stasi is looking over their shoulder yes because it is social media folks no for real look if I wasn't promoting comedy shows and podcasts and like I don't think I'd be on it I would I would definitely be off of it I mean I'm on it now but I'm on it like a posted and leaveit thing I don't pay attention to luxury on that yes you know anyway no I don't know I think about like what would it look like if all the journalists at the Washington Post the New York Times and Wall Street Journal were banned from being on Twitter no for real cuz like what happens right is like it's this circular thing where we all know the land mines right like the things we don't want to touch like the hills we don't want to die on and it's what's scary about the stasi like atmosphere of it is like my job is to write opinion columns and commission other people to do that and yet I feel the self censoring even before I've written right where I'm like wait I don't want to die on that hill I don't want to die on that is that really the battle I want to take on I should probably just stick to this topic instead of that topic because I know if I do that topic like I know it awaits me yes like why am i why would I willingly go to the guillotine yes you know it's like and people pretend like the reputational smears have no cost like they're insane well that's what's weird about your position because you're an opinion writer right I mean that's what you do correct and you're not allowed to give your honest opinion in a lot of people's eyes they want you to be compliant with what culture and I think one of the reasons that I get in a lot of trouble or I'm provocative or whatever the words that go before my name are whenever I mentioned now controversial is because I you know I think more than other people I refuse to follow the rule because what's the point like we're all gonna be in the crown yes like I'm not gonna waste my life following some fake ruled by random people on the internet no and like this desire for you to comply I mean this is part of the game that's going on when people don't have control of their own lives they love to control other people's lives and one of the things that happens when you have an opinion that does not follow the you know whatever the path has been clearly grooved for us to when you you're supposed to have very specific ideas about these very clearly defined subjects when you deviate from those and people start attacking you they're what they're trying to do in many there's a lot of what they're trying to do this it's nuanced but one of the things are trying to do is they're trying to get you to listen to them so that they have some power they feel powerless in the world and if they can push your button if they can break your glass then they have some power but they're also trying to issue a warning right they're issuing a warning to the people in their group saying if you deviate we're gonna do to you what we're doing to her right now yes and it's gonna be relentless and you know and it's just like what's sad about it is like the number of young people I know who are so talented and you know or heterodox are just independent minded people like liberals they choose not to become public people like right they decide not to go into journalism not to do company not to do any number of things because like why would you choose to you know be in that arena if this is what it means you know one of my favorite stories went to speak to this is that woman who was in Canada who was a trans woman who still has her penis and balls and went to a bunch of different places you know close down these immigrant waxing places because they wouldn't wax her male genitalia and it wound up going to court and she wound up losing but these people lost their businesses their businesses get you know Canada is very different in the United States and they have nicer they're very nice like 20% nicer but they also have weird human rights laws like they have you know this is what Jordan Peterson was rallying against with these compelled speech laws he was explaining in a way that didn't make sense to us because we have freedom of speech in America they don't have freedom of speech in Canada it's not right it's different and with this woman when she went to these places and was saying hey you know you have to wax my my dick and balls and they were like no we do Brazilian wax on women and they're like you're a bigot and then she turned out to be a complete fuckin lunatic if you follow her in the news now like assaulting people and all sorts of other stuff but still biologically a man and has all the parts and they this was this was the line in the sand this is like okay here's your case now you've got one because this is not just about discrimination against a trans woman and this is some new thing this is the very real possibility that some trans people trans people are human right some trans people are fucking crazy you got one here here you got one now you're gonna treat this like an abusive insane person or you gonna treat this like trans people they have these undeniable rights and privilege because of the fact that they've been put in this marginalized position by our society that you have to look at them in a very specific way and if you deviate at all you will be punished and that's what happened these poor immigrants they lost their business I completely missed this story I was a great story Jessica you Neve I think is well the times needs to step up you guys are covering burning those people yeah who do you like for president well I just I was just telling um Jamie that I was in I spent New Year's in New Hampshire with Andrew gay and the yang gang I'm writing about her right and I have to tell you like I'm really not just saying this the power of the like the what I'm calling like the Rogen effect it was insane like I went down the line waiting to get into this bar was snowing outside and I just like asked everybody how'd you hear about Andrew yang like 80% of them was from your podcast it was really unbelievable I like I like his energy I don't know if I agree with him like I don't have strong views about ubi or what he calls the freedom dividend thousand dollars a month I don't know what I think about that he's like against circumcision him on most of his things against circumcision you don't agree with that I know really yeah no one cuts no baby dicks I'm not like passionate about that are you yeah people lose their dicks a lot of kids every year do you know children die from that yes all the time it's very common really yes like multiple children per year lose their penis from an unnecessary antiquated operation where you cut off their dicks to make it look different okay cutting skin off of their dick and they wind up getting infected and they lose their dicks it's I mean it doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough time where you go this should never happen this is a completely unnecessary operation Robert Baker 229 deaths per year from circumcision in the United States bones your estimates that apparently approximately 119 infant boys died from circumcision related each year in the u.s. 1.3 percent of all male neonatal deaths from all causes there are several case reports of death in the medical literature yeah this it's not simple you're cutting skin skin is an organ you're you you have an unnecessary you have an unnecessary operation that you're doing to an infant and it's decorative we don't buy any of the studies about how it prevents STDs and no no I don't wash your dick we should be talking about it well why not kids are dying like it's like how many of them have to die before we say this is a ancient ridiculous ritual it doesn't make any sense okay I've seen the arguments for and against like that it prevents STDs like Latino prep prevents us who needs condoms and abstinence that's what prevents STDs and and in some cases vaccinations this is what prevents STDs this circumcision is ridiculous doesn't even makes any sense okay cannot believe I stumbled into this because I was talking about injury Yankee fucked up I guess I did I didn't know this was like a strongly held you're an int activist is that what they're yes whatever int activist that's a good way I've never heard that expression but that's exactly what I am yeah don't cut baby dicks it's real simple you say it that way people go yeah it sounds gross please say Oh circumcision like oh what a wonderful ritual and it's a symbolic of your journey until if the fuck out of here you're cutting baby dicks it's it doesn't make any sense I mean it's not as disgusting as what they do to woman's clitoris is and in that makes it one alike yes it's a different reason for doing it but it's um you know lighting a kid you're just doing it in a way that it's okay like if you cut a piece of my earlobe off I'm gonna be alright family of four daughters I have not thought deeply about I I did not know that statistic you put it up not good yeah most people don't know it and I've talked to people who have had immediate family members who have had horrible illnesses or injuries from circumcision it's terrible it's an organ now talk to you about vaccines I hope you're for it I'm for vaccine a hundred percent yeah why would you be nervous talking about that I don't know like what am i stumbling into here look vaccines are established I had dr. Peter Hotez on who is he's he's out of the University of Texas University Houston is that what he's from but what he's famous for is treating and making people aware of tropical illnesses okay and and vaccine safety and vaccine health and again and also just someone who uses education to dispel a lot of these anti VAX rumors and the the anti-vaxxer I ain't like this is why there's so many people this is why we're so healthy this is why there's no smallpox this is why we haven't had these fucking horrific diseases grabbed this is why measles is making a comeback because of ignorance so because there's this unbelievably strange coalition of like lefty Waldorf family school people with like ultra-orthodox Jews who believes that they're like remnants of pigs in the vaccine and they're coming together to do what they just did in New Jersey which is like they were I think New Jersey was close to passing a law to end the religious you know there's religious exemptions for vaccines in a bunch of states still mm-hmm and New Jersey was very close to which has had a bunch of outbreaks to ending the religious exemption and then you had these like very strange bedfellows come together in Lobby against the law and it lost which is really upsetting like I do not think there should be a religious exemption for vaccines yeah vaccines are a strange one right it's like should you force someone to put a chemical into their body yes because it's protecting yeah all of our lives but that is why it's that's why it's an interesting one it's a very unusual one because it's a very rare time where you're you're talking about something that if you do put it in someone's body and it is effective it will stop a deadly pandemic from spreading yes so how do we act as a community how do we act as a culture when it comes to that and then there's also with everything there's people think there's conspiracies with every fucking thing that ever happens on this earth Conor McGregor just destroyed Donald Cerrone in 40 seconds there is an entire community of people on write online right now thinking that that was a setup and that it was a fake fight and that they had planned it all in advance and this is just to make my I mean I mean I'm talking about volumes of writing I mean people just page after page after page talking about things that don't make sense about the fight and like this is just what people do they look for conspiracies in everything whether it's vaccines or politics or or witches or Jews yeah oh presidential candidates though yes or you want to go to everything presidential candidates I don't know I love yang's yes love his energy like him as a person a lot he's like he's real you know he's like most politicians or aliens and he's not and it's so refreshing and you know I learned a lot he also said that police officers should have a purple belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu which I completely like I went to look at the policies on his like this super rational he's great and one of the things that is so like refreshing about him is that the I don't know if I've been in a room in the past year with so many former Burnie and former Trump people which are a lot of his supporters mmm you know we're like disaffected disappointed Trump people and then people that supported Bernie in 2016 and there's just I don't know like when you hear him talk the villain of his stump speech is not Donald Trump even though he hates Donald Trump the villain is Amazon and Big Pharma and you know automation like the things that are actually transforming and decimating the country yes I think it's refreshing but he's like a Paul Revere for for automation he's like hey fucking jobs are going away jobs are going away yeah yeah he's a great guy liked him I don't know and then I also feel like I've gone on this emotional journey with Biden where at first I'm like toad like I liked him then I'm like old he's kind of losing it no way he can win and now I feel like I've gone back to maybe like let me put you back on track because he's way too old it's not just these two old he's not coherent he's falling apart like hasn't he had a stroke or something I don't know if he's had it had a lot of plastic surgery that's for sure how's he look at his face yeah kind of look younger in the caps and I don't know but but I think the candidate I will be very surprised if the candidate is not Bernie both because of the fundraising and because of where he is in the polls and because and this is the most fundamental thing the the energy in the country right now is a populist energy and I just don't think that a moderate like the ones that I like like a club Achara Biden can capture that the energy of the base I think it I think that energy is just really with Bernie you have Democratic Party than I do I think they're gonna fuck up and put Elizabeth Warren and I thought oh my god I'm just gonna chew her up don't you think Trump would okay but if it's Bernie versed Trump yes who wins because I think Trump still wins I think well you're always gonna have a hard time when someone the incumbent right you're always gonna have a hard time when someone is the sitting president who is extremely controversial extremely polarizing but also we're in a great time economically that's that's hard for people to deviate from it's hard from people to deviate from good economy when you look at the stock market when you look at don't have stocks like it was true people are like it's working the perception though it's a perception you look at unemployment unemployment rates are very low you know there's there's a lot of things that you could point to the standard issues that you point to and then you deal with all this luminous on the left that Trump is the complete opposite of if you he's the antithesis no finger job exactly yeah when I when he got in office I said political correctness just got hit with a missile to the dick that's what it was like when that guy got off is like what the fuck he just want after all that grab the pussy stuff and all that all the craziness that yeah the fact that he was able to weather that storm and it didn't even seem to shake him like you said you could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue I'm gonna think he actually good yeah well as long as the person was a dick there's only the person who's shot was a real asshole like it well you know we do do we really need that guy no well you need Trump as president it's gonna be hard it's gonna be it's always hard to get someone out of office I mean what's sunk George HW Bush was Ross Perot and a lot of people forget that Ross Perot this eccentric billionaire got on television and bought an entire half hour of regular primetime television and put on this display of why you're getting fucked and explain taxes to you and explain so as Mike Bloomberg gonna be the Ross Perot of 2020 no he's not as charismatic and he's not very well-liked and it doesn't make sense he doesn't make sense I don't think he's wasting his time I just think he's the opposite of what people want yeah they don't want a billionaire no no they don't want that if you're not what Bernie stands for is a guy who look you could you could dig up dirt on every single human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display those display those worst moments that said you can't find very many with Bernie he's been insanely consistent his entire life he's basically been saying the same thing and for the same thing his whole life and that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from yeah and he's addressing the thing that people are most obsessed with right now which is economic inequality and he's really consistent on it did you see him here did you see him yeah of course I did he was so normal he's normal did you find him winning though like did you like him I was I feel like there's a huge division in people I know either they love him or they really really think that he's like gruff obnoxious all of that well I know you don't like Tulsi but I love her I love her I think she's awesome I love her I love Bernie and I love Andrew yang and I talked about Tulsi and Bernie the other day but I forgot to bring up Andrew yang I apologize for that I said everybody else can eat shit I didn't mean Andrew yang I really I do like him I just it was just a mistake what is the Tulsa appeal for you well I think she first of all is someone who served twice overseas been deployed twice and understands the actual cost of war worked in you know medical units saw people murdered and shot down and destroyed by war and she wants none of it she wants us to have less intervention interventionist foreign policy decisions that affect people's lives and send our young brothers and sisters over there to get killed that's one thing she's a person who served in Congress she understands how it works she's a very nice friendly person I believed her when I talked her she's very genuine you know and you know if you want a woman president that's that's what you want you want a young woman who has served in Congress who has served overseas who's been deployed she makes a lot of sense with a lot of things she's saying that's what I like about her got it okay khlo Bashar zero opinion on her okay yeah I like her zero charisma though yeah I've been paying attention like this there's certain look there's only so much time you have it day and only so many days in your life and until things start really poppin where I have to pay attention to her I'm just like shaggy but who you gonna vote for in primary I think I think I'll probably vote for Bernie interesting yeah because I I think Bernie and Tulsi together would be a fuckin devastating combination I really do I don't know if they'd ever work out together I don't know if that's possible but I think them together might work that might work that might get enough people to go you don't want this is all just too fuckin crazy let's let's try something different and what do you make of the people that are speculating that Tulsi is gonna run as a third party or else it's not going to okay I don't think she's going to I don't think she has any plans to do that but that was the worried that you know she's a rust Russian asset that was one of the things that Hillary Clinton had said that I found that very strange and Hillary Clinton was calling her a Russian asset I found it strange that Hillary Clinton said that I do but I I you know I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton I just I'm not a fan of that whole they're a part of a different world right they're a part of a different world where corruption was open and accepted and it was a part of the program you know if you pay attention to the Clinton Foundation if you pay attention to the the amount of money that they would get paid to speak to bankers and the fact that they wouldn't release the transcripts that was the great thing about Bernie during the 2016 election released their transcripts let's see those transcripts you know I watched my life looking at Larry David like it's so strange like I only see Larry David Larry David doesn't fucking amazing job is like the MELD it's very weird like I was watching the weekly episode of when the Times endorsed the candidates or the two women and it was like I'm it was very strange I was like thinking that I'm literally looking at Larry but him as a human being when I was hanging out with him yeah I believe in him I like him I like him a lot I know that like they like most scandalous thing about him the Daily Mail just like was like Bernie Sanders he requests his junior suites in his hotels to be 65 degrees and he asks his staff to collect honey packets like this is like for his tea that's all they got yeah it's good I mean the thing to get on him on is like you know his apologetics for Soviet Union for Nicaragua mean his foreign policy stuff it's just a disaster and that's what the depth that is what Trump will crush him on I mean Trump wants Bernie to be the candidate you think so you don't think he wants Warren I mean Warren would be great too cuz then he has pocahontas like but I love the fact they said that it's racist when he calls her Pocahontas it's racist like it's a funny movie well a lot of people oh yeah but also I mean the moment that I you know gave up on Elizabeth Warren's political judgement is when she decided to publicly go through the DNA the 23andme or whatever it was to prove that she was in fact partially Native American it was like just dude back off from she had to she had to no she did not Trump is gonna attack her on it forever now attack her own it forever no matter what but now at least it's off the table she showed the slightest sliver of Native American no Joe it's not off the table you think that if Elizabeth Warren's not the candidate that's not gonna be what he hits her with every single time for sure but it would be more on the table if she had never taken the DNA test he would be oh for sure really yes yes because it would be this this hidden thing no no no he knows he knows I'm lying about my ancestry it's a big thing to lie about because if you look if you lie about being Dutch okay it's like you know it's kind of a cool ethnicity but it's not that but you lie about being Native American it's different because like they're one of the most maligned and repressed peoples ever in in recorded history I mean they were wiped off the face of the map and stuck into these little pockets of land that don't have strong natural resources I mean I've been I'm on my fifth book in the last three months on Native Americans Wow yeah I became obsessed look higher the summer moon okay it's a book on the Comanches and it is fucking incredible it's incredible when you realize like that this was going on in this country just a hundred and fifty years ago and that for hundreds of years the Comanches just dominated the West they dominated the plains and until they invented a gun that could shoot more than one bullet the the white men were fucked the Comanches would just dominate them because they could shoot arrow after-hour and they were just a ferocious people they didn't that no artwork no beadwork they just they just made teepees like they'd work really they weren't they didn't have like illustrious like works of art and beautiful can with what the Comanches were a war people they they raided they hunted they ate mostly meat all they ate was meat they bare they didn't farm they didn't do any farming they just roamed around and killed Buffalo and just dominated the entire western half of this country for hundreds and hundreds of years because they were the first ones to figure out how to ride horses they were the first ones to not just figure out how to ride horses but to raise horses animal husbandry they they they figured out how to accumulate large stables of horses and ride them better than anybody could I need to read this that's fucking amazing it's amazing it's so good it's such a good book and horrific do you see the woman out there that's on the wall the outside the Native American woman that's breastfeeding woman a baby oh my god I think you're talking about a real a painting there's a no it's a photograph of Cynthia and Parker's Cynthia Ann Parker was she was abducted by the Comanches when she was nine years old and then became accepted as a part of the tribe and then went on to be the wife of the major chief one of the major Comanche Chiefs and then was kidnapped back by the United States when she was thirty but she didn't want to be in the United States because her whole lot were kicked but yeah yeah when over the Pioneers whatever the fuck they would call them the Americans that's her right there that's the photograph so far how did you get in like what started your interest in this I'll read a book by my friend Steven Rinella called the American Buffalo and it's the the history of the Bison and the United States and the Native Americans that would travel with the Bison and all these different tribes that would they basically coexisted with the Bison just moving with the Bison as they might hunting the Bison and I was just like what a strange thing that these people live in this Stone Age but fantastic way with all these myths and legends and stories yeah so much magic in their life and then all that's gone all that's gone and now we just like so when Elizabeth Warren he Civ yeah so when Elizabeth Warren lies about being that yeah like that's a big deal because they're one of the most mythical cultures one of the most magical cultures in a lot of ways because look they did horrific things to each other there's no doubt about the Comanches were fuckin ruthless to each other to other Native American tribes they went on war constantly they were raiding each other constantly kidnapping abducting murdering I mean there was this there's no like this idea of Native Americans of being like a peaceable passports it 100% horse shit that's not how they lived but the way they lived was I want to say admirable but fascinating fascinating and powerful and and they had their very strict rules and codes of operating that were very unlike the Western world and they were invaded they were invaded and dominated and killed off by disease and then ultimate I mean it was a they were shooting Buffalo just to starve the Indians out I mean there was a lot of crazy shit that went down so when she comes out and says you know oh I grew up Native American the fuck you did the fuck you did and the more books I read now I'm on Black Elk speaks which is my favorite one so far because Black Elk speaks is an actual man named Black Elk who is a AG lawless Sioux medicine man a Lakota medicine man who in the 1930s told his story so he was alive when he was there when Custer was murdered Wow yeah he was he was there when the the Sioux were forced into reservations he's telling the whole story of them going from living this nomadic life to being forced in these reservation reservations and starving and alcoholism and all the the chaos that came with it so and this one is the this one's the best because it's literally his words so you get a direct translation he's talking to his son his son is talking to the author and the book was written in the 1930s do you spend any time on reservations no I haven't other than Indian casinos doing stand-up yeah yeah I'm sure with some I mean well we're working on that right now we're reaching out to a couple different Native American groups to try to find a good representative representative to come in and talk about you know their grandparents and one of the stories that they had heard yeah it's um it's a crazy subject and it's to me the look pretending you're anything it's not good but pretending you're Native American to me is like whoa that's because that's one where everybody it's there's like a spirituality aspect to Native Americans it's implied like you say you're Native American people like aha I kind of fucking knows things you know you're allowed to have feathers you can have an unexplained go to that yeah totally yeah it's it's it's a weird one you know and you know mainly someone lied to her people people get the wrong information all the time from their great-grandparents and you know people they get and also the thing about Cynthia Ann Parker right Cynthia Ann Parker was zero percent Native American but she was 100 percent Indian she still was a Native American because she's a abducted when she was nine and lived their life she wanted to go back yeah I mean that's like she threw in her lot with them yes and that made her them well she didn't like the Western world when she was forced to live in cities and live in towns and she fucking hated it and you get her words you know when when when she's describing the difference like the Comanche world was filled with magic and gods the water was a God the sky was a God everything was there was magic like you would through there was rituals that would do to protect themselves in combat and all these things made life fantastic this the hunting of the Buffalo and the nomadic way of life and then all sudden to be locked into these buildings and wearing these clothes and stuck within these rituals that the why men would live she didn't want to have any part of that so even though like you know if someone was Cynthia Ann Parker Ziff she had sex with a white man and made a white baby that is not a Native American baby but it kinda is you know I mean in terms of culture she was 100% all in Comanche when they eventually abducted her back mm-hmm amazing stuff so fuck Elizabeth Warren fuck fuck fuck that crazy I'm Native American talk meet me again no disrespect to mrs. Warren maybe someone lied to her maybe someone loved her maybe she didn't know she was one mm Native American I don't know I also just think I don't know she's she's an expert and and she's clearly manipulative no I was gonna say really smart and has like she knows what she's talking about I just don't think I just don't think that she sells to the American people in this moment I just don't I don't see it yeah I really don't well that shit she pulled on Bernie what she was saying that he had pulled her aside and in private and said a woman can never be President okay you tell me how you saw that moment well the CNN moment was very interesting right when she walked up to him in this very public way and said I think you just called me a liar on national TV he was like did you see the video where someone put the curb your enthusiasm it's like and it's like the intro music to curb it's incredible it's Bello that's funny because Tom Steyer standing there like yeah I don't think I think it was a ploy I don't buy it he's been her ally forever and to me it shows a sign of great disloyalty and great dishonesty like the way she did it she did it as a it's a ploy like ideally her and him could be allies and she could be but only one person can win right but maybe she wins and he's her running mate like something that is a hundred percent possible right so if you're all in the DNC together you should be allies right he's a powerful force in the Democratic Party she's a powerful force in the Democratic Party yes why you attack each other and why attacking each other with some bullshit story from like many years ago where he said that a woman's never gonna win I think what how I I don't know this is one thing where I can give them both a generous read I think it's very possible that they had a the kind of conversation that people like you and I have all the time which is can a woman win the presidency of the United States and I think Bernie gave an answer that probably led a lot of people give in those conversations which is maybe not maybe the American people are to sexist to elect a woman like that's possible and she you know and he meant that in an observational way not at any judgment on who she is or the capability of a woman to be President and she heard it in the negative way of a woman can be President yes that is possible that is possible I agree that she that this was absolutely a strategy her part that backfired that's why it's gross not a question but I also think that you know I am I have those conversations every day can a woman be oppressive yes people really misogynist hey sure well they have these ideas about what a president is and a president is an older male who is you know well-spoken and educated who understand yeah there's many factors yeah that's why people to judge to short yeah well and and a lot of other there's a lot other things I was also a fuckin mayor right now and you aren't you working what did you know man yang is like are you saying no govern like lack of government experience I was saying no no no he has a job that he's not doing right and he's out there running for president like engineering is not he's not a mayor somewhere where he's ignoring his constituents he's not ignoring a city South Bend Indiana they're freaking out what the fuck are you doing man you're supposed to be the mayor well that's on New Yorkers felt about Bill de Blasio which is like our cyclus mayor is now running for president I mean that word feckless is one way I never used oh good you got to use it it's a great word feckless he is who calls someone called someone a feckless cunt yeah how was that I don't know god damn it I forget who it was soin on the show like musa Mantha pee called someone a feckless continent oh my god what's in the Trump yes I was like Jesus but she was feckless and then countries hard she came hard she went hard she came at her heart yeah I I'm not good with language sometimes but the the Warren thing that was the real problem with it was that it was obviously calculated it didn't it when people are talking if someone said look if he was like a closeted misogynist no he's not obviously he's right but I also think that he had a conversation with her where he said that a woman can't win and I don't think or maybe not sure she could sure she could be making it up of course she could I don't think that she is and I think what Bernie meant was not anything sexist or misogynist I say sometimes I asked out loud to my friends I don't know if a woman can win for president well Hillary won the popular vote right now I know I know I know can win yes they can win yes the idea that they can is nonsense but it's also talk right if you and I were just sitting around having a cup of coffee and we're just talking we just talk and then I went and what a nice that against yeah you say this is a statement and like that's not what I'm sight I don't know what the fuck I'm saying right now I write when I'm talking I don't know what my next word is going to be right everyone knows that we we all know that when we're talking it's one thing if you're reading a speech or if you have like a very clear doctrine that you you like this is my this is my idea of the world let me let this through very carefully I've written it down and I like to share it with you this is my okay well then I'm gonna hold you to that and then if you change that opinion I'd like you to tell me why you changed it and tell me why you why you were wrong but that's different to talk they've talked like fucking a woman campaing a woman can't win a woman can't win a woman can't wait maybe that's what he said you know maybe he was upset and then she's like he privately told me a woman can never be present he's like let's don't do this now I'll do this up you wanna do this now watch the clip with a curb music it's so good it was just oh god it was amazing Oh is Bernie Jewish are you kidding that sounds like it I don't pay so little attention to people's religion oh but Bernie the Brooklyn Jill Oh does the name Bernie and then Sanders you're not religious you think going back to your book do you think my book even started on that but sure we touched it with Lincoln times we touched it a couple of times do you think that that could be an issue no I don't I think I think it might be no I just don't see that being an issue with him I mean it's not a fundamental part of his identity unlike Elizabeth Warren's Native American roots she's not running on it right he you know he's he says he's a proud Jew but he's not religious really at all I just don't I don't see it I don't see it you don't see it being an issue I think he'll maybe use it as a way of I think one of the things that people are gonna say about Bernie especially from the right is they're gonna attack him on his foreign policy credentials and they're gonna say that he is not gonna be a good ally of Israel not serious on foreign policy not hawkish and they'll point to the fact that some of his surrogates are extremely problematic people like Linda Sarsour and I think in that sense Bernie's Jewishness will be important because I think he'll use it to say but I'm Jewish you know like how dare you accuse me of X Y & Z thing right right but I don't think it's good like if you're I think you're asking is it just qualifying for people and I don't see it that way at all yeah I was saying would it be a factor that some people don't want a Jewish president I see it being more of a factor with someone like unlike Bloomberg it's like do you want a Jewish billionaire like that it plays into a lot of stereotypes billionaires are religion into it's onto their own you know but in some ways the way people what I mean by that is like people look at them like a different thing yeah like oh they're Mormons oh they're billionaires you know what I mean totally it's like a billionaire like that's a category if someone has accumulated at least a thousand million dollars what the fuck yeah who are those aliens million dollars yeah I like the way said that yeah yeah I don't I don't think it's gonna be a defining factor for Bernie I don't mmm but I don't know but again I also think Trump is gonna win yeah let's talk about your book okay unless you want more no I so want to talk about my book but have to be there no worries no worries does it matter that uh for the movie here don't worry don't worry we're good we're good that Bernie Elizabeth Warren stuff was started I believe as a report on CNN the day before they hosted that debate has just maybe a way to drum up ratings which it did work these were higher than like the previous two or three jabs like people love controversy man people love it they get excited look half of this stuff is so goddamn boring and so hard to follow when someone calls you a liar and no I'm not a liar like yes now we got something now we got something juicy we would sink our teeth into I was also gonna ask if you saw any of the curb stuff from last night no it was great yeah he's wearing a mag a hat just to get rid of people say yes to like eat lunch with him I realized it would work he's genius man I would like to get him in here I love him I love Larry David he's the really one of the big reasons why Seinfeld was so successful I was such a great show he's uh he's a special character you know that guy really does fucking Drive a Prius apparently he's probably worth 500 million dollars yeah I was driving a fucking Prius of money with Jerry and has the no question yeah Jerry has got probably 200 cars and Larry David drives a fucking Prius he might have a Tesla now he might have changed it up no it was great though Bridget fed us he made a little cameo in it really yeah yeah Bridget was it no shit oh that's awesome good for her good for her yeah he's special you know that that show is special and it's like Jeff Garlin on it and everything it's like it's so perfect all of them together accused of being Weinstein the whole time episode it's great well you think about Weinstein using that Walker let's get the fuck out of here bitch she could walk I'm seeing them you've got walk up like that looks so fake you get extra like lawyer time or something right if you're if you're disabled yeah if you're disabled in court or something I don't know you're part of here and maybe if you're being held well what is it what what all the sudden happened to him did he fall need surgery of some sort but it's new right it's back hurts you but it seems greasy doesn't it seem gross for sure that's definite move yeah someone told him to do it's a greasy move yeah it's like I see what you're doing shut that shut the door please we're just talking about a Harvey Weinstein's Walker I don't buy it not a fucking second right oh yeah we got to talk about that too that yeah yeah he didn't help Jewish relations at all know this fucking the Israeli flag painted mosque you know all that stuff remind me he's a really flag paint yeah I thought it was great let Sam know the temple yeah temple that's right god yeah you didn't see his temple temples painting the colors of the Israeli flag but those are also the colors of the Greek flag good point but he's not Greek I don't know what did he work for the Mossad did he work for the American government like who did you know can they disagree that he was murdered i if you had if you had all your chips on the table like Barry you gotta go all in we're good there are too many coincidences yes to make it plausible that Jeffrey Epstein liked the video and we could go down the line I'm sure you guys are like not even gonna try it's something that I followed not as closely as you have but believe me that I followed it makes me incredibly suspicious of the official story reminds me after the show I could tell you off the air some crazy shit wanting to tell me now yeah why because I'll tell you after a show and you understand but yeah the thing is so it's so bizarre and it's like they're hoping that the new cycle somehow and other buries it and then just like oh he's gone he's gone skid sumo Iran is a problem we're going to war about Jeffrey Epstein but he's clearly been murdered he clearly was the guy who was in some way shape or form a part of a gigantic ring where you would get underage girls to these pedophiles or public figures who were interested in having sex with sixteen-year-old girls well that's the part that's known yes that's public right like we know he was a pedophile we know that there was some kind of pure curing that was happening for famous wealthy public men in his circles we know that Bill Clinton was on his plane I don't know you probably know that six times not a long time I mean come on we know Trump knew I mean like yeah that's the part we know but the part I want to know is who was he actually working for yes why did he have that home yes how was he so wealthy when there was no oh that's right he had a painting of one in his house oh my god wearing a dress but just stop and think about what kind of guy he's like he's basically saying Clinton's my bitch I'm gonna get a painting of him in a dress and I'm gonna put it in my house like do you think he made Clinton dress like that at some point in time like what you couldn't do that for fun the thing is is God keep him alive little such a sick picture how did they not let I mean I mean no I mean no one knows who he really worked for right no no one no no no no no me someone must know what I was gonna say is like you know I've talked to enough people that knew him met him went to parties at his house and said like everyone knew this about him it was like a Harvey Weinstein thing right you know in the sense of the the young women you know yeah or in the sense that everyone knew about Bill Cosby that came into contact yeah like there were things that were just very agreed to never speak about runs like it's just absolutely sick I was up when the story broke about him hanging himself I was obsessed for like a few days but then I had to move on another course that's world is a big place that's what their shoes are getting beaten in the streets yeah but it's also like there actually are things that are more important to me the story of Jeffrey Epstein right and I hope that there's some investigative journalist digging into the truth of what happened there I wonder how much there is to dig I mean how much dirt is there that you could actually get a shovel into what are you talking about we like it don't you think there's a ton I'm sure but I think it's the the girls who were the victims yes and then the men who were shot in their fucking mouths right except for Prince Andrew which is like that was everybody everybody should go to jail just after that oh my god everybody knows everybody get in jail the Royals are falling apart man yeah I know Prince Harry's moving on they're like becoming like Instagram influencers but I don't understand that it's probably more money I don't know a little things well isn't being a royal basically being an Instagram influencer sure but it's like I don't know this is this is a strategy question of if you really want like progress and all the things that he talked about I could make the argument that yeah you're part of this crazy ridiculous retrograde institution but you can probably do more good in that role then you can I don't know like living in Canada well Canada doesn't want them coming they're not gonna let them because apparently if you're a part of a royal family you're not allowed to actually live in Canada what yeah yeah there was some something that there were there pull up Prince hair it might be illegal for Prince Harry to move to Canada yeah I think it's the ideas you don't want a monarch moving into this you know Canada is a colony of England but they have their independence so the idea would if a royal from England moved into Canada it's probably some ancient fucking rule but they would be able to set up shop and start running Canada because they have power Oh for the Prime Minister I get it in theory I just haven't heard of it yeah I mean in C I'm held like season two of the crown I mean I got a like ketchup yeah so good well it's all weird I don't know oh I know who's Epstein yes and Prince Andrew yeah that's right we started with obscene being really bad for change and guess just like Elaine Elaine go lately miss lane nobody knows I don't know how to say anything but I think it's ghilane mm-hmm like her whole thing like that whole photo op at the in-and-out reading that see I mean yeah people death CIA does it's so good it's great oh good it's crazy and where's she I don't know she the base in Antarctica right now fishing for penguins but the whole thing is crazy it really is you think there are penguins in Antarctica right there in the other Pole either way the the whole thing is it's gonna go away and we all kind of know it's gonna go away and that's one of the most disturbing aspects of this case like that they did murder this guy they did erase the film of his first suicide attempt oh so we erased it sorry they erased the film of that and then the cameras weren't working on the second one it's like everything and the security guards fell asleep no like yeah well they were not on duty or something no but the problem is right like you couldn't see it the world moving on is the kind of the world the press is a conspiracy or you can just like the way I see it is there are so many things to cover in the world and the press is been so gutted that we need to decide like yeah is it more important to cover like sulemani than Jeffrey Epstein right yeah it is yes you know right so it's not like I don't see it as malevolent in the way that you do maybe because I'm inside of it and I just see the way that it functions and like the oil T is malevolent I just see it as inevitable that look yeah not like once Epstein died the world's gonna pause hey let's have no more news so we could sort this out that doesn't want you know it doesn't work that way I don't think malevolent I just think it's just a function of life in general and just the insane amount of information that we have access to and the same insane news cycle we're operating under now everything gets buried including a obvious murder yeah yeah have you had like who is the world's leading Jeffrey Epstein expert probably Bravo yeah I don't know I don't know who is I don't well Erik Weinstein is yes definitely really into this yes he knows a lot and he met him he tells him he met him and you know Erik loves cloak-and-dagger stuff and so he he told me right away guy was an actor he was like this guy's full of shit he doesn't know anything about finance he's like this guy's not some financial wizard has made billions of dollars he's like it's not that's not who he is yeah like he's acting he said when he met him he had a young girl that he was sitting that was sitting on his lap and why the girl was sitting on his lap the girl was like 21 years old and he would just kept jiggling his knee like bouncing her up and down sir your tits were jiggling while they were talking yeah what imagine imagine having a conversation with a constant yeah and he's got a girl city wants to talk about like real stuff and he's got a young girl sitting on his lap and he just keeps balancing his knee up and down and her boobs are bouncing around why did all of these respectable people keep like going to parties at his house even after he'd been arrested for prostitution which is really that's a very good question like that's really the sickness yes right the people that went after he was arrested like how that happened well I think because the way Eric describes it Eric thinks that there are people in these look these are enormous ly high-profile people that have very buttoned down respectable positions in life where you really can't can't get wild right but they're also they're also still men all right so he thinks that there are people that provide services and I'm definitely paraphrasing how Eric described it to me yeah because he'd have like 20 different like coinages yes but he thinks that there's people that procure these experiences for people that find it very difficult to get buck wild and so they would do it and this is probably why I had fuck Island right fly them out this crazy island and it'd be easier to get away with it out there hey we're no one's out here we're in the middle of nowhere every fucking pic as eyeballs that are cameras and you fall in your own oh you know I mean it's it's a crazy story but of course that's just practically true right like if you're an Elon Musk or it's someone at that level like a public figure Eric Schmidt or whatever you're not gonna like what are you gonna do go on like tinder Araya no you're gonna rely on like a a guy yeah Wrangler yeah that's a sec Sacha Baron Cohen says he turned over disturbing who is America footage to the FBI oh right that's right I don't supposed a pedophile ring in Vegas okay when he was undercover yeah we're gonna go down I love him too he's so wonderful but I don't know I didn't I missed this yeah but wait was it expose what happened well they just turned it over to the FBI into it at all really they didn't look into it no yeah it was a real word story yeah we're gonna use playing a fake billionaire character and asked for something like that yeah and someone said they could help him and he'd turn that video over and nothing happened well you know I don't know what that is it could have been that the guy was like yeah I can help you I'll help you by calling the fucking cops like we don't really know what the guy said I mean unless we can watch the footage they have the footage or it's going on who knows but that's what you should have him have you animal no I'd love to love him he's awesome Holly G in the house you ever see that okay film the old school you can't film uh it is hilarity people don't know about that film that film is fucking hilarious he is well thrilled the Jews down the well I mean that was just pivoting just transition he can get away with stuff because he's Jewish you can get away with that yeah yeah yeah so did you down to Val so my country can't be free I mean I was like watching this one like wow this characters bad all they're so good yeah I didn't love his new show as much whatever it was this it was gone yeah he played like a funny there was like a Jewish like a self-defense Mossad instructor that was like getting you know that was fun there were some parts that were funny but it wasn't in the interview Oh Jay in the new one you know that's the very very very end you know he was that same billionaire character and you're telling him to it was great it was a great way to end it didn't shoot a 3-gun already get him to admit to it remember when she got him she was he was gonna write that book like if I did it yeah yeah remember that yeah somebody gave me a copy of that and I just found it in my office it's signed by OJ Simpson yes well there is that's right that's right hey come on now yeah anyway we should probably your book let's do it yeah let's do it the way it opens is very so we should tell people that you really transitioning yes why not no I love it we should tell you you're from Pittsburgh yeah and you did your Bat Mitzvah at the temple where the Pittsburgh shooter yeah and so that was like just tell people sure so I grew up in Squirrel Hill which is like pretty much down the street from mr. Rogers like it was quite literally mr. Rogers neighborhood he's from there and was amazing place to grow up I became about Mitzvah in 1997 and it happened at Tree of Life I actually was a member of a different synagogue called Beth Shalom but there had been this fire and so all of the kids who were becoming a Bar Mitzvah that year did it at Tree of Life and you know in the same way that people think about 9/11 as a date I think about also October 27 2018 because that morning I was in Arizona to give a speech to a group and I looked at my phone around 10:00 in the morning to like my family whatsapp chat and my youngest sister had just said there's a shooter at tree of life and my thought immediately went to my dad because my dad is kind of what we think of as like a promiscuous Jew like he goes to different synagogues he you know pays membership dues at various ones he likes the sermons at 1:00 and the you know the the Scotch at another and I thought that there was a good possibility that he was there thank God he was not there but my mom wrote back you know we're gonna know people there my dad knew most of the people eleven people were killed it was the most lethal anti-semitic attack in all of American history I knew several of the people that were killed and I ended up I was supposed to actually go to Israel the next day on a reporting trip to report on this fascinating archaeological dig but I ended up putting that trip off doing that story later and just spending the week to see what happened what happens to a community when when something like this goes down because like we read about mass shootings all the time right so much so that they become kind of an abstraction and I you know I don't report on this stuff so I had never borne witness to what unfolds and it was it was a really transformative week and I write this in the book but I feel like in retrospect I had spent my life on a kind of holiday from history both because I was you know I'm a Jew of the post-war era which is to say the lime part of the luckiest Diaspora in all of Jewish history like the Jews since the end of World War two in this country have had it better than we've ever had it ever before and all of the kind of mythology about what America could be the idea that it's a shining city on a hill the idea that it's a New Jerusalem like I was raised on those ideas and even though anti-semitic things happen to me like speaking of Catholic school like I would wait for the school bus to my Jewish day school with my sister and there was this Catholic school bus that would drive by and they would scream you know kikes and dirty Jews and wear your horns and I remember in high school people someone telling me to pick up pennies like things happen but it all kind of like didn't register it really rolled off my back because I saw those as like vestiges from an earlier and uglier time like something that those people should be embarrassed about not something that said anything about me and you know even after Pittsburgh though I was kind of like you could still delude yourself into thinking like this is a one-off it shouldn't change you know the fundamental Jewish America an assessment of our experience here and our place of belonging here but then six months later to the to the day there's another white supremacist attack on a synagogue in Poway California and then we've had you know we've had this rash of violent anti-semitic attacks happening in the New York area which I hope we'll talk about but you know it's weird because I grew up in a very political family like my mom my dad's a political conservative my mom's a liberal were obsessed with politics we were always talking about politics and and we're always talking about like Jews right like we're really proudly Jewish family and so it wasn't that I thought anti-semitism had died like I was you know I watched anti-semitism as it was sort of resurging in countries like France and England in Western Europe but I sort of looked at all of that with a with some level of distance and maybe even a little condescension like we're sort of inoculated from that disease in America America's singular America is sort of separate from the tragedy of so much of Jewish history and I have to say that like it sounds naive but I was sort of shocked to see it that it's here too you know and that we haven't escaped from it and I mean that that awakening happened a little bit before Pittsburgh which is it happened I think it was April 2017 you'll correct me but when was the Charlottesville March remember the unite the right March Jeff I know but I remember being shocked right when those people were marching and they were shouting blood and soil like gluten Bowden which is a Nazi slogan and the Jew will not replace her exactly right and the Jew will not replace us and when I heard the Jew yeah sorry August 2017 when I heard you won't like the Jews will not replace us right I heard it in like the plain meaning of that phrase like the Jew is not going to take my job the Jew is not gonna like take my job in the corner office or whatever but in fact it was like a reflection of this replacement theory ideology which is that brown people and black people and Muslims and immigrants are coming to replace our white civilization and the the the Jews job is basically to pass as a white person but in fact do the bidding of these people that we deem to be not pure where does that come from that is a deeply deeply ancient anti-semitic conspiracy theory right it's the idea of let's go back to the New Testament let's go back to to Jesus right what happens in that story the story there is that the Jews go to Pontius Pilate and say you know like this person is unacceptable to us and in the mythology of that story the Jews get what was then the most powerful empire in the world the Roman Empire to do their bidding and you have this line in the book of Matthew that is so so I mean the bloodiness of this line cannot be quantified where he says you know his blood be on us and on our children which goes you know down through the centuries to justify the killing of of Jew of you know untold numbers of Jews but the idea of the Jew is sort of like the wily manipulator as the Jew as having proximity to power not being in power but being able to sort of be the puppet master pulling the levers of power you see that play out in lots of different iterations through time right you see it I'm trying to think about useful examples for your listeners but but that is sort of the trope right and it is an ancient one but it's being utilized in really new ways so it's not literally that the Jew is going to replace us that is that the Jew who the Jew in a way is sort of like the greatest trick the devil has ever played and this is the language of Eric Ward who wrote this amazing essay called skin in the game and he talks he's in he's a black anti-racist activists and he talks about figuring out how anti-semitism is kind of the linchpin of white supremacy because the Jew appears to be white in fact he's not white I mean this is all based on this lie that Rhys is not a social company the race is not a construct right it's which it is but they're saying that the Jew is not white but he appears to be white but in fact he's loyal to these people who are coming to sully America and so when you have someone like Congressman Steve King saying we can't replace our civilization with someone else's babies like what does that mean what is that idea it is so deeply anti-american because the idea of America right is the idea that Americanist is not about bloodline Americanist is about a shared set of values and ideas and fealty to those ideas so the idea that someone else is but what does that mean you know it doesn't make any sense because this entire country is based on immigrants of course and you know as we talked about with the Native Americans I mean you want to we have replaced our country we've taken over their country it was theirs first what we're talking about with anti-semitism one of the reasons why it's always been so confusing to me is because it seems to be this there there there's a lot of these white supremacists that they they lean in that or they lean towards anti-semitism first like almost the the it's almost more acceptable it's almost more like they think they can get away with it they'll find more support online if like if you say online in a lot of these forums like if you say hey we got to get rid of all these black people you're you're gonna there's gonna be so many more red flags than if you say we have to get rid of Jews mm-hmm like that that doesn't I don't understand that one because I it's when people look different from you if you are an Asian person who is racist against black people or a black person who's racist against white people or if someone's different than you that it's leaf racism is racism is always disgusting it's always horrific and ignorant but at least I can kind of see how you could be tricked into thinking that way I don't understand anti-semitism anti-semitism is not just a normal bigotry right it's a conspiracy theory it's a way of understanding and making sense of the world especially in times of economic and social upheaval the reason that anti-semitism is resurgent right now is because I'm not justifying it but it's because we're in going back to our earlier conversation a time where people are disoriented they're disaffected they're confused they're shortchanged and they're looking for an easy answer so looking for a scapegoat yes but there's no lines that point to Jews this is what's so confusing to me it's like there's no there's no clue there's no clear thing do you know what I'm saying well it's you have to wrap your mind around the idea which is a huge huge huge idea that anti-semitism is built into the scaffolding of Western civilization period it's never going away it's like think about it like an intellectual disease that's built into the foundations of the civilization that we live in and in times where that civilization or that's a given society is healthy anti-semitism along with xenophobia and racism and all kinds of other bigotry are sort of kept in check and when the society becomes unhealthy and we're living in a deeply unhealthy society in many different ways right now anti-semitism is something that people reach for right it's like if you want to understand like the Nazi rise to power you kind of can't understand it without looking to the fact that there was you know an incredible economic depression in Germany and there was a scapegoat and if you look it's not to justify it but if you look throughout history right look at the bubonic plague the bubonic plague came because of rats to the European continent that were brought on ships from Crimea but people did not at the time they looked why who did they blame they blame the Jews the Jews were dying at a lesser rate than their non-jewish neighbors probably because of religious rituals that Jews have like washing your hands before you break bread and say a blessing dunking in the ritual baths before the Sabbath and all of these other things that probably kept them more protected against the plague than their neighbors but rather than looking into it and saying oh maybe they're doing something right and something we should mimic their neighbors said kill the Jews literally like throw the Jews down the well and it led to you know massive pogroms killing Jews for and the claim was that the Jews literally poisoned the drinking water throughout Europe so it's like it's this irrational hatred but it is so so deep because it goes back to the most important myth that Western civilization is built on and that is the Christian story Jewish people are it's it's does that make any sense it makes a lot of sense but the fact that it still continues it make any sense that reason I it's very hard to talk about this is because it's so enormous it's like accepting the fact that it's like you have to accept as a foundational principle that this is baked into the world that we live in and we're never gonna cure it and it's never going to go completely away the best thing that we can do is build healthy cultures that protect certain virtues like Liberty like freedom of the individual like religious liberty all the things like it's not a coincidence that America has been so good for the Jews it's because so many of the ideas that protect minorities and religious minorities like Jews were sort of for all of their fault for all of the founders faults right and they had many including owning people but you know George Washington in his he writes this letter to the first Jewish community of this country in Rhode Island and he says something that was then incredibly radical which is pathetic that it was but he says no Jews in America are not just going to be tolerated they're gonna possess the same the same citizenship as everyone else that at the time was a radical departure from history in the Islamic world the Jews had always lived as dim ease as second-class citizens and in the Christian world it was worse I mean what would people forget right it's like right now radical Islam when it comes to the religions is the greatest threat to Jews but for most of its history Islam was much more tolerant of Jews than Christianity was which is something that's kind of like has gotten lost to history the phrase it's never going to go away yeah bothers the shit out of me but I'm being honest with you you don't think that it's possible that we can evolve past where we're at now yeah in a utopian idea yes but I just knew utopia is a scale where human beings used to be a hundred two hundred years from now and you scale it up a hundred two hundred years from now we're clearly moving I mean I think one of the reasons while the social justice warrior shit is going on right now I think it's good I think there's good signs the sign is that all these things are moving to stamp out racism to stamp out sexism stamp out misogyny and in homophobia and all those things that we know are a real problem in culture and society it's the overcorrection the overreaction the virtue signaling that's driving people nuts but the trend is all moving towards an area where any rational reasonable person thinks this is a good thing it's a good thing to not be sexist it's a good thing to not be homophobic it's a good thing to not be racist it's all moving in that direction it's just doing so in this chaotic virtue signaling very obviously sort of a manufactured way hmm I hope you're right I think I am but but the thing that's strange again about this particular pathology is that some of the most anti-semitic countries in the world are countries with no Jews right like Egypt has less than 20 Jews you know honey 20 do you know them no is Warren in Afghanistan Jesus one person get out one who are you hey Jew and Afghanistan bro he was there there were two until recently and of course they weren't talking to each other hop on a yak fucking make your way over the moment the point is like Egypt's one of the most anti-semitic countries in the world and there are no Jews there how do you explain that yeah this doesn't make any sense Jews Jewish people are very unusual in that they are a culture a race and a religion people a people yellow tribe yes the categories don't fit modern modernity yeah that's what's so confusing about us yes right like we presaged all of those categories that you just laid out which is what makes us so hard to categorize the only thing that mirrors it in some in some way is Muslims in in some way Muslims they've very wide wildly in terms of how they look in terms of what part of the world they're from but they think of themselves as Muslims and Christians think of themselves as Christian yes but it's not as tribal it's it's a minor it's not a lot not a lot of difference but enough difference that you could categorize it in a different way but the difference right is you can't be an atheist Christian or an atheist Muslim right you can be an atheist you there's a million of my best friends Ari Shaffir is an atheist you it's it's a strange group and do you think that because of that because when when people are so loyal to their own people which is one thing that I actually admire about Jewish people I think it's it's will be nice if more people were like that that they are profoundly Pro Jewish there's not a lot of apathetic Jews towards Judaism or towards the tribe I should say well there's a reason for that there's like you know when you ask the norm an average American how many Jews they think are in America in the world you get like this enormous number we're less than 2 percent of the population in America and there's something like 13 million of us in the entire world less than 2 percent yes isn't that the same as transgender people I don't know mit expert on that you know I don't know about I just know about crazy stories in the news whenever a guy wants get his balls washed it has a builds business closed down because of it but that just that this do you think that that might have something to do with it that this know what people for whatever reason when they see someone who is in this sort of I mean I don't want to use the word isolated because they're not really Jewish folks in America are not really isolated unless maybe like Hasidic C could say they're very in a very established community in Brooklyn and in other parts of the country but that maybe people look at this community this truck and they think they don't give a fuck about us they only care about Jewish folks they might think that and that would be an anti-semitic idea you know in the same like there's this really strange idea that people think that Jews cause anti-semitism right like when the evil man who walked into the Walmart in El Paso talked about a Hispanic invasion and then went into that Walmart and killed I think upwards of 20 people no one thought maybe he's right maybe there is a Hispanic invasion maybe that was like somehow justified because he saw them as insular or isolated or looking out for each other do you know and I mean like that would be a crazy idea right right and yet when it comes to the Jews people are like well you know they wear their funny hats well you know they seem to you know be looking out for one another I mean like but do you think they were that kind of rationalizations after the tree of life horrific massacre do you think that people are saying that like hey they wear their funny hats they like people just looked at it like this is horrible this is disgusting in that case yes but not in the case of what's been going on in Brooklyn there we keep hearing things like this is the result of communal friction as if you know disputes over zoning laws cause someone to pick up a machete the size of a broomstick walk into a rabbis house and hack people up that was the story I emailed you about yeah it's just do you see what I'm saying so like the case of tree of life let's take that that's like a very what that's like a clean case in the sense of these are innocents mostly elderly - two of the brothers who I knew who were killed or mentally disabled okay was the people that show up to services on time which is a certain kind of person and you have this white supremacist who says all Jews must die he's totally unequivocal about it he and he goes in and he tries to do that so you have just a case of someone who any reasonable person sees is evil which is this neo-nazi and people who any reasonable person see is totally innocent which is you know Jews in prayer was the guy the shooter killed no he's standing trial yeah did and there were and and he actually embodied this thing sorry I stopped no I just what the question was like who do they when they have something like that do they extensively interview him and try to figure out what the fuck brought him to that I mean is he schizophrenic is he well a lot of the people like the guy in the Munsey case that we're gonna talk about the machete guy he showed signs of mental illness I think that Robert Bowers in Pittsburgh also did but you know but then so did Dylan roof the guy that killed however many people he killed at the Blackshirts Church in Charleston South Carolina but he was also white supremacist it's like these hateful ideologies often they draw people that are deranged or young or somehow on the fringes of society with a guy in Pittsburgh he was deep into this replacement theory ideology the reason that he selected tree of life as his synagogue is because tree of life the previous weekend had participated in this program called National Refugee Shabbat or Sabbath it was celebrating the idea of welcoming the stranger which is a fundamental Jewish value do not oppress a stranger because you were strangers in the land of Egypt and he said specifically that you know highest the group that was organizing this National Refugee shabad it stands for Hebrew immigrant Aid Society it started in the 1800s as a way of resettling Eastern European Jews who were fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe now works to resettle refugees including Jews all over the world and he specifically selected tree of life because of that because he said the Jews are bringing in the dirty immigrants into this society so he was like kind of the perfect embodiment of white supremacists replacement theory ideas in Brooklyn it's much harder cases because it's much harder for people to talk about because how do you talk about the fact that in many of these cases and a lot of them have been caught on CCTV you know that it's a young black man attacking on a Hasidic guy walking down the street and who's visibly Jewish it's much harder to talk about when someone is someone who we talk about as being rightly as being from a group that is himself victimized a poor black kid in Brooklyn is then going on to victimize another minority group it's just much harder when the attacker is not a white supremacist to talk about it that that is a strange one the Hasidic one is a strange one but in some ways I think it's easier for ignorant people to look at them as the other because the way they clearly distinctly dress they dress so much different it's almost like if yet Amish people move in and they stuck to themselves they lived in one sort of community I think they would probably experience a similar level of hatred but then you add into it the sort of acceptance of anti-semitism in a lot of communities it's like it's ramped up but there's this myth that the Jewish communities of Brooklyn are interlopers they've been there for more than a hundred years they've been in Crown Heights in Borough Park than before Caribbeans before lots of other communities the mythology like mythology yeah the interloper the cultural vulture the evil landlord like these are themselves expressions of the anti-semitic idea and people don't even realize it well I think there's also a genuine jealousy in the accomplishments and achievements of Jewish people you know I mean if you look at Nobel Prize winners from from Europe in particular I mean how many of them are European Jews it's fucking stunning you know it's stunning when you look at the amount of lawyers I mean we don't just joke around about my Jewish lawyer yeah you know I mean it's like a standard thing you think of doctors and how many successful and educated people are Jewish and that's one of the things you actually touch a touch on in in your book you you were talking about I mean it's how but then why is successful Jewish people have become in this country and there's got to be some sort of a resentment for that as well especially by again we're talking about mentally deranged people people with like severe some of them are mentally deranged but some of them are young some of them are that's what's really difficult impressionable yeah yeah it's like the the disease is sort of like Unleashed you know it's like Dylan roof was mentally ill but he chose a black church he didn't choose you know a white Mormon right it's like the guy in muncie he was mentally ill by all accounts but he googled you know like why did Hitler hate the Jews and he googled various synagogues yeah I mean the really and you know do you remember last time I was on here the Covington video remember the Covington feels like it that had just come out right do you remember in the video there were those two or three black men who were members of this sect the black Hebrew Israelite the Hebrew Israelites and everyone kind of laughed them off is like haha they're just this obnoxious weird sect yeah well they their ideology right the idea that the Jews are not the real Jews that were pretenders to the faith that the Jews are behind the slave trade that the Jews are subhuman vermin that was the ideology that informed this recent attack in Jersey City I don't know if you followed that one that was the one where it was a couple and they were driving or they wanted to target police officers and Jews and they targeted these officers and Jews yes yes they hated pigs and they hated Jews that's what they there were diary entries and Google searches and think I mean it sounds horrible to say but they I went the next day to Jersey City to see to see the aftermath of it and they had targeted specifically this kosher grocery store and they ended up killing I think for people but literally this right above the grocery store to the left it's a grocery store and then a synagogue and above the synagogue is a school where there were like 50 young children and thank God they weren't murdered then they find comes to light if you like a week ago that they had a bomb in the u-haul that had the range of five football fields that they wanted to deploy I mean and everyone was laughing ha like look at these crazy people that believe this crazy ideology well this crazy ideology is moving people to do very very violent things and there are things that things that haven't even made the news you know like you know if we believe this idea right that the that this what's going on in Brooklyn as the result of communal friction well how does that explain my friend's father-in-law who was walking on the Upper East Side wearing a yarmulke on his head and gets the shit kicked out of him how does that explain my friend of rum who is a progressive Jew wears a rainbow yarmulke is on the subway and he has he's had several interactions with this group who scream at him hold one of them held up a picture of Louis Farrakhan saying you're not a real Jew you're a faggot all of these horrible things this is like creeping in everywhere I had a friend on the Lower East Side that was visibly Jewish not wearing a black hat wearing a yarmulke but looked like you were me got punched this was like two years ago by a black Israel no he was just a random guy but that's no not all of these are black Israelites what I'm saying is that there's this kind of inchoate hate that's like being unleashed and that's the thing that's most disturbing like if you look at the anti-defamation league statistics only a small percentage of hate crimes committed against Jews something like 15% last year were committed by white supremacist they're among the most violent and the most visible but who's the rest of them that's actually more alarming to me the fact that it's like coming from all of these different directions and how do you contain it once it's been unleashed when you think about these social media sites gab was one where this guy who shot up the tree of life that was a member of and is is this like I'm not a I'm clearly not a proponent of censorship but do people do you think they get radicalized in these when you get to a forum where there's no restrictions whatsoever on language or ideology or behavior you could say whatever you want as long as it's long as you're not saying something you don't I mean gab has rules like you can't do things that are illegal you can't threaten someone you can't put up their address you can't but you could say a lot of really fucked up shit and they're not gonna they're not gonna police you do you think that these places that do allow free speech that there's a catch-22 to it in some ways it's great to be able to express yourself freely but in other ways you can get radicalized and they can they can it can lead to a lot of people forming these groups where they support each other in these fucked up ideas yeah I'll see to things one of the reasons that I feel so strongly about keeping the spectrum of acceptable opinions so like as wide as possible is because I think that the narrower it shrinks like we're talking about normal ideas being closeted then people go into these underground layers online and they become radicalized right because they're like that you know the elites are in the mainstream media or whoever they're not telling the truth they're lying to me so there's this secret world and this secret world has all of these actually bigoted ideas Junor and I mean yes so do I think that it is a catch-22 yeah yes I mean the whole thing about the world were living in is that you no longer have to like find a KKK meeting you don't have to find a jihadist preacher you don't have to fight you know go down the line you just have to find a reddit chat or a 4chan chat or something on gab comm and you find your little online village like it no longer requires a real person or real interaction right and there's no stakes because there's no shame because you can just be totally anonymous in these forums right so I just like I I think that social media is supercharging this in a way that like we can't even grasp and it's very hard for those of us like me and you who want to protect free speech and Liberty to think about how to deal with it you're right how do you deal with that like when you have someone like the Christchurch shooter who was live-streaming this and making references to you know what what did what do you think he referenced the Tree of Life reference PewDiePie as well like yeah he was it's like all in elaborate troll that's what's crazy it's like he's shit posting and murdering at the same time and what is the I mean there's no in my eyes there's no clear solution to that I don't want to restrict free speech I certainly don't want you don't want to honest people you also don't want someone to be free - yes live stream killing people on a platform right but how could you I mean there there are men at scale how could you possibly know when someone's live-streaming that they're about to go and kill people right when the guys never killed anybody before and then all of a sudden he's got this camera on and he walks in the synagogue and he starts shooting no that's right it was a mask with him it was two mosques he killed like 52 people yeah I mean it's all insane what how do you how do we manage that I mean what what do we do what do we do and that certainty there's no in my mind there's no clear answer here there's not a clear answer but I think that look the idea that a private company should be obligated to stream someone killing someone or let's even go like take it less stakes than that call Jews kikes why should why should a private company say yes to that it's degrading what the platform is right yeah that makes sense that makes sense the question is where does that line get drawn I know you know this is this is the real problem I mean there's people that get kicked off of certain social media sites for just not representing well culturally for instance Megan Marco knows I don't know what is her name Mary Murphy Megan Murphy that woman who got kicked off of Twitter because she said a man is never a woman and she got kicked off for life totally but this is what I mean about when reasonable opinions when the spectrum of what is reasonable becomes so narrow people radicalize yes and they go to these bigoted ideas yes and it's an enormous like it's like why do we need a healthy conversation about immigration and like in the the conversation about immigration is I think very very limited and what people say and you know what they what is acceptable like it's like open borders or xenophobia right you know and there has to be kind of reasonable middle and way to talk about it yeah because if not people self radicalized that's just I just see that happening again and again and again on so many different topics yeah the immigration angle is a perfect example that I mean should be absolutely possible for hard-working people to make it to America and do better it also should be possible for us to keep gang members cartel members from crossing the border freely and shooting people and killing people and selling drugs in our communities and all the things that were scared of when it comes to the open border policy idea the the thing about the the social media thing in in a lot of ways it's this new experiment right there's something that we've never had before like if you like you're saying about a KKK meeting you used to have to go to one okay right and now you don't don't just have to go to stormfront or wherever you know whatever website you can find that supports your ideas and this is this is a new challenge and there's a new challenge that hasn't really been mapped out nor has it been I don't know if it's been rationally dissected in terms of like if we do this this could happen if we don't do this this could happen which is is a or B better well how do we stop a or or B from happening how do we somehow or another educate and improve how do we reach out to a lot of these people that are going to get radicalized and offer them some sort of a positive community as as a possible alternative because this is what a lot of this stuff is a lot of these people that get radicalized one thing that happens is you don't have anyone that cares about you or supports you but you find people that are very strongly believe in an idea they believe in an idea an awful idea so much so that they're willing to kill people for that idea and then you find a bunch of them and then they reinforce each other's beliefs totally with these positive affirmations and and they're essentially they're signaling to them they're virtually signaling to these horrible people that they also agree with a lot of these ideas and then you go out and you do something you act like the guy in Charlottesville that ran over that girl this these these horrific acts are almost there encouraged and supported by these tight-knit groups of people that all they're all they're all fucked up and fucked up people find each other and hurt people hurt people right so they find this category of people is this group of people whether it's online or whether they actually have to go to a KKK meaning but and they find support this is a group that somehow or another gets them what's I think one of the things that's alarming about our politics right now is like things that were just regarded up until like five years ago as the kind of lunatic fringe have made their way into mainstream politics like sleep Steve banning proudly declared himself like and Breitbart as the platform of the alt-right and then Steve Bannon was sitting down the hall from the President of the United States what was they all right in the beginning though see the alt-right became something in the public eye in the beginning I thought the alt-right was like Young Republicans that were a little different you know thing I don't know why this no no no not now yeah for sure but I mean in the end my perceptions of the all right in the beginning was like what I thought my lowly innopolis was when he first burst onto the scene sort of like you know a guy who's the whole thing that Milo is revealed right just like it was an ironic posture that revealed like if you're joking about you know fags and kikes you're still saying the thing well but he's gay and he's Jewish and so the idea was that he could get away with these things provocateur was the word I was looking for this is essentially what he's doing and he's using that to build social currency right that social currencies developing this large group of people that follow him and talk to him and he thinks that there's some merit to his idea so he finds some sort of justification for having these provocative conversations in this stance where he's saying these things and a big proponent of free speech and all these things are happening all at the same time that's what I thought the alt-right was initially what I thought the alt-right was initially was people that wanted a new younger more more current take on what a Republican is and then it became racist and then it became you know all the things that we think of it now in terms of like public perceptions yeah okay the house themselves art right now who even says there all right I mean it's almost like such pejorative like the label has become so toxic but but the law don't misunderstand the fading of the for the power of the movement it's just become kind of more normal Republican now all trite ideas have been subsumed by the trumpet Republican Party to some extent like which ideas I mean look like the idea that some Americans are less American than others that is certainly an all trite idea that I think is extremely dangerous I mean you saw it when here's here's a great example when Trump went after the squad okay as and remember when he said that they should go back to the totally broken crime-infested places that they came from right hahaha those people were three of them were born in America one is a naturalized US citizen the idea there right as I heard it and maybe I'm hearing something you're not that some Americans because of their skin color or their ideas sort of have provisional belonging here for me is a very very it's more than a dog whistle brought something that is deeply on American and deeply bigoted if he had said that about one person who had come here from somewhere else that was awful and was criticizing America then that would be a more valid statement and that would be like Ileana Omar is not from America initially alone Omar no but and I can't stand her ideas but she's a naturalized citizen who is sworn to uphold the values of the Constitution yes she's just as American as me or Donald Trump or you know I agree and I also agree that this idea that go back to where you were that sucks is the response to someone criticizing the way things are here is pretty ridiculous you know I have to go back to where it sucks you're here and you're a United States citizen you just think that this place should be better yes and you can just agree with their ideas but that I that concept right that you're not entirely of a place right that is something that has been used against Jews forever the idea that you're not fully Iraqi because you're Jewish or you're not fully American because you're Jewish or you're not fully French because you're Jewish like the idea of provisional belonging is something that is that I'm extremely sensitive to so it's a toxic tribalism that's attached to the concept the alt-right ideas well but then the OL trite idea is like there's true mean look at who's Steve Bannon has made common cause with right people like Nigel Faraj people like marine lepen I mean there was a really good documentary about Steve Bannon where he's meeting with people who really are not just like normal conservatives who is marine lepen marine lepen what is her party's name in France she is a deeply xenophobic politician in France whose father was profoundly anti-semitic she claims that he's that she's not but she's someone that you know you say her name in any Jewish community and there's president of the National Front just that name National Front that sounds like Stormfront it's really not Marian and preened the French politician and lawyer serving as a president national rally political party since 2011 with a brief interruption 2017 she's been the member of the National doesn't say what she does doesn't say okay anyway so back to her and or Jews or I mean just like I don't know I I see ideas getting expressed like there there are people that tucker carlson has had on his show who are like a valid white nationalist look who recently can you google that Jamie there was a guy that he had on the other day or even even these whistles right of like there's a way to criticize did you find it sorry there's a way to criticize I lost my train of fellow NORs there's there's a certain here goes list of cut Tucker Carlson's guests who have links to white nationalism but he's he agreed with these people has he argued against their ideas Roger stone Roger stones white nationalist no his links to white nationalism Peterborough's no there was something more recently wasn't the first white nationalist Carlson was it okay that was 2018 anyway I don't know I mean are you not alarmed by the turn that you see in the Republican Party toward sort of like I don't know the Trump is cult well I think one thing the Republican Party has done that's wise if you want to keep a solidified team is that they haven't come out against him and they've supported him and there's very little dissent and this is this is a good idea if you want your team to win right and there was a lot of people who were kind of never Trump errs who softened their stance once they realized the power of his presidency that he's really there sometimes a minute sometimes jumpers yeah yeah I'm alarmed I'm alarmed by people I'm alarmed whenever there's not were this outward there's an outward lack of compassion and when there's an outward disdain for the other because essentially this country is all the other the whole thing that's all we have is the other I mean that's that's the whole thing well in the whole thing that yeah yeah I mean there's just Trump is just beyond the sort of like he said various things that are like he was speaking to a Jewish group and he talked about your Prime Minister I mean he said so many things that are ridiculous but the big big thing that he's guilty of is he is like dismantled the guardrails of the keep society decent and civil and normal and like once you dismantle those things like it's very easy to reverse not very easy but you can reverse policies what's much harder to reverse is a culture and he has just been gleefully making war on what I think of is very very important cultural norms like like not attacking the weakest people in our culture like not attacking gold star families like I mean he has attacked he's denigrated like the most heroic and the we because people at our culture at every possible turn yeah the gold star family thing was very disturbing and weird how it just kind of went away I mean it didn't go that was I remember that moment remember when he people forget this when he said about Judge Alonzo curial who was born in this country that he couldn't give a fair hearing to Trump University because he was born in Mexico I mean this America yes this when was this years ago it was during the candidacy really was it yeah we you just confirm why Jesus Christ any say something about loyal Jews you're a Democrat as well oh yeah that the Jews are disloyal because they don't vote Republican because look at all the great things he's done for Israel know that if you're a loyal Jew to Israel you would vote Republican yeah or that the Jews who don't vote for him or disloyal I mean yeah that would snow I was a high point but I mean just the main like I'm I feel like I haven't given you a satisfying answer about anti-semitism itself I think way to think about it do you remember this it's too jarring to read Indiana born federal judge who president Donald Trump once said could not be impartial because he was Mexican cleared a major obstacle standing in the way of trumps long-promised border wall with thanks great so I hear that and I'm like oh that's mmm yeah yeah crazy it's all feeding this idea that like there are some people who are more American than others that are more belonging than others yes and I think that idea is despicable right reinforces his tribe right and that's one thing that Donald Trump has clearly done is calculate cultivate rather a tribe you know here's a tribe I mean they have a fucking they have a hat yeah right they have a slogan and it's a weird slogan because it seems so positive make America great again that seems positive hmm but it's not like if you if you like people punch you if you have that hat on it's so crazy we've gotten to a point in society that something that's a positive statement like make America great again is so polarizing that people will be violent towards you and feel like they need to they feel like they need to like you're the enemy where this is again when it comes to the idea of the tribe you know there's there's positive aspects of tribalism right it's positive aspects of community there's positive aspects of people supporting each other and then there's negative aspects the tribalism that we're experiencing in this country politically is very it's very toxic and we all we're all aware of it and the tribalism that we're experiencing ideologically is very toxic where there is no nuance and you're not you know you're either with us or against us and I think there's some parallels to anti-semitism there's some well yeah yeah no I was gonna say that like that is a culture the whole culture you just described is one that's deeply unhealthy for Jews or any difference really and I yeah it's just not a coincidence amazing percentage of Jewish people also that that that club that tribe rather it's I mean even though there's millions of Jews there's hundreds of millions of non-jews yes but it's also a word tribe than anyone like isn't it you can join us yes you know it's not there's a lot of work though sure but yes you can you're doing the Mormons like you declare the faith you put on the undergarments you're Mormon what have you joined the Muslims they're allowed to kill you if you leave yes apostasy yeah but I don't yeah it isn't I met this amazing guy last night who we were talking about he grew up in Egypt hussein abu bakr's his name he's really incredible grew up in Egypt and was you know he was like I was swimming in anti-semitism I just didn't even know it wasn't normal like the mosque I went to the school I went to it was like the Jews were this supervillain and the whole message was like become a superhero and go and kill and defeat the Jews and he was like I went to a normal mosque normal school this is what I was taught and I never met a Jew in my life and he gets arrested during the Arab Spring because he starts learning Hebrew on he's really curious about who the Jews are and he gets arrested I think they're suspicious that he's a zionist spy anyway he ends up getting asylum he lives here in LA he got arrested for learning Hebrew oh whoa oh yeah you think I can like just go visit Egypt I mean no these are so if you wanted to visit the pyramids you'd be fucked I don't know well I would specifically be fucked because I have like a public profile as a Jew right um you don't want to go looking online for my name in some of these forums it's like really scary but do you look at it no no there are people who look at it for me and tell me what I need to like be aware of and you know like every cynic every synagogue I speak to it's like people don't realize that I went to a synagogue Friday night in LA like there's armed guards at every synagogue and Jewish function that I go to now it's like going through TSA to go to like imagine that if most Americans had to do that when they went into church like we think that's insane but that is the state of affairs for Jews and Jews that I know hide evidence of their identity everywhere they go I there was a woman who wrote me who was reading my book on the subway in New York and was like I'm nervous to be seen reading a book with this title in public and like hid it but I understand why because it's it's become so regular and everyone else just isn't living their normal life and we're like sounding the alarm here because if there's one thing the Jews have gotten really good at it's like we have an instinct for danger like that is something that we have cultivated over years of being discriminated against persecuted against nearly wiped off the map in Europe like we understand and we smell danger sometimes but for other people do you think that anti-semitism is more prominent on the East Coast and the west coast I think that's a good question there are just more Jews on the East Coast there's a lot of Jews out here there are yeah there are I don't know I don't live out here so I'm not sure I also think it's different right like there are different kinds of anti-semitism like the kind that we've talked about that comes on the far-right it brasses itself one way and there's also anti-semitism that comes smuggled into the mainstream through the political left that comes cloaked in language that is very seductive like the language of social justice and progress and if the right claims that the Jews are you know fake white people the far left claims that the Jews are handmaidens to white supremacy so whiteness plays like a really really key role in the way that anti-semitism functions right and here let me explain it this way anti-semitism is a shape-shifting conspiracy theory except that right and that is how under Nazism Jews are the race contaminate errs how under communism we are the arch capitalists right how under the idea of white supremacy we are these fake white people right we appear to be white people but we're actually doing the bidding of these groups who white supremacist view to be lesser than black people brown people Muslims immigrants and how on the far left the Jews are seen as sort of the great what is the greatest evil right now to the far left whiteness and white privilege and Jews are seen as sort of handmaiden to that why because of our success because many of us are of Eastern European descent eighty-five percent of American Jews are of Ashkenazi which is of Eastern European descent so we pass as white so we have white privilege and so in the intersectional view of the world right which reverses the caste system that we've been living in until now where you have someone like Jon Hamm at the very top and black transgender disabled people at the very bottom well the intersectional worldview comes around and reverses that and says no John Hammond cisgendered white men like Joe Rogan are now at the very bottom and at the very top are the transgender black disabled person and so where are the Jews in that new intersectional caste system of the world we're kind of like right above Jon Hamm or right near him because we have we enjoy all of the sort of privileges that he enjoys it's a crazy thing but that's sort of where we are in the handmaidens to white privilege or white supremacy is very strange that's a very strange one and the anti-israeli sentiment yes yeah no I understand what you're saying and well I see it with people where they openly expressed disdain for Jewish people I've seen it from a lot of people that you would call activists you know of varying religious identity you mean left-wing activist yes yeah yeah it's like I think of it very crudely if racism is the sin that's sort of acceptable on the far right hating Jews is the sin that's acceptable on the far left the far left because of support for Israel they believe that Israel is dominating Palestine and that Hezbollah is misunderstood and then there's there's all these different sentiments that get expressed openly in these left circles mm-hmm that's right then they're telling you no they're basically propagating they're repeating without even realizing it this Soviet propaganda line which is the design ISM is racism which is an unbelievable thing to say because the majority of Jews who live in Israel are Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent they are non-white people they are Arabs they are Arab Jews and yet you have the far left basically exporting parochial domestic American racial politics on to a foreign conflict in place that they know absolutely nothing about you know these people are delusional they think that like all of the conflict in the Middle East would be resolved if only we took care of this one tiny conflict between this tiny group of people and their neighbors we're in fact it's like a tiny local conflict in this huge drama of the Middle East of which there are a zillion players and you know the Jews of Israel are only one tiny part of it the the zionist thing is define the difference between Jewish Jewish and Zionist okay Zionist is the idea of that the Jews have a right to national self-determination the Jewish shaky of going no no no no the Jewish longing to return to the Land of Israel is something that's like inescapable if you read the right like it's all over there the whole idea of and you can discount it discount god whatever the fact is is that the Jews are a people that were birthed sort of in this land which we now call the land of Israel and they somehow and they were expelled by the Romans around two thousand years ago and then they came back to that land right it's it's like they defied the logic of history in doing that because by all rights they were an indigenous group to that land they were kicked out and expelled and then they went back 2,000 years later like it's a crazy extraordinary story so leave that to one part tsiyon ISM the way that I the way that I I think is the simplest definition is the belief in the Jewish right to self-determination and it's the Jewish liberation movement and so in the night let's go back to like pre 1948 which is the year that the State of Israel is established and you have Jews in you know pullin in all of these other places debating like what is the way that we can solve our constant just like the systemic oppression that we are constantly enduring and there are all of these different responses to that problem one argument was the socialist argument you know if we are the you know the anti-capitalist argument if the problem is capitalism and if only we defeat capitalism anti-semitism will go away some argued that total assimilation was the right way to solve it we just need to kind of disappear as Jews that's the only way we'll be fully accepted and another group you know which was not even the most popular group is this idea of we need to be able to determine our own fate and the own we will never be fully accepted the only way that we can determine our own fate is if is this idea of us having our own state and our own army where we can protect ourselves and that is ultimately the idea that sort of wins out so when you're having a debate about you know when people say today they're an anti Zionist yeah the reason that that is so problematic is they're not making that argument in 1920s Eastern Europe when the state doesn't exist it's one thing to be an anti Zionist in theory right it's the same analogy I like to make is if we're a couple and we want to have a baby and we're debating should we have the baby can we afford the baby where we can send the baby to school all this stuff that's a totally moral argument to make you can't make that argument of should we have the baby after the baby is born the baby is born it exists Israel exists it's a place it's not an idea it's not an abstraction it is a place that contains the largest Jewish community on planet Earth and so when people say that Israel doesn't have a right to exist it's like what are you talking about it exists so what do you want what so I asked the person that makes the anti-zionist argument what do you imagine will happen like are you do you think that you're you're advocating for and genocide right away or like you have to have no sense of Middle Eastern history or politics to make the argument that you can be a minority in that region without protection we know what that looks like that looks like the story of the azita's it looks like the story of the Kurds the story of the Zoroastrians the story frankly of Christians who are going to be completely expelled from the Middle East within the next decade which is a story no one talks about so the anti Zionist sentiment when people start talking about Zionists what they're essentially talking about is Israel just existing yes they're anti-israel existing correct and Jeremy Corbyn made this very plain where he actually said the words the BBC has a bias towards believing that Israel has a right to exist who said that yes yes so he's thinking confirmed and he's on the left like he's on the feet epitomizes the the sort of anti Zionism which bleeds into anti-semitism of the far left meaning let me put it this way anti-zionism has become such a plank of like normative political progressivism that if you're an eighteen year old and you go onto a college campus and you're like during the you know orientation week you're signing up for like legalizing pot club and better rights for cafeteria workers oh and by the way you know the boycott divestment sanctions movement against Israel which is an anti Zionist movement you're not an anti-semite you don't hate you're just kind of like swimming along with progressive waters because that's how successful this movement has been but if you step back in your leg wait hold on there's a political movement gaining popularity in the West that was in fact embodied in the person of Jeremy Corbyn and what became of his labour party that believes that there's only one state in the world that doesn't have a right to exist like that's crazy I can't believe he actually said that he did do we he said a lot of things apparently I'm kind of funny he definitely said it he's a ridiculous person one of my favorite things that he said was I mean he's what is he like fucking 60 he's like my pronouns are he/him like shut the fuck up like like I see what you're doing I know what you're doing just crushed yeah you know I think the thing to like the analogy I make is like America has done horrible things we have you know the example everyone loves right now is children in cages at the border yeah it's a disgusting immoral thing that we're doing but no one goes from that horrible policy to say America shouldn't exist and we should just meld into Canada or Mexico and by the way they're saying that they're making that argument in a context where they are literally surrounded by neighbors who want to murder as many Jews and Jewish Israelis as possible like it's it's an immoral or it's it's a like it's it's an argument that I really can't wrap my mind around like how people get away with making it well it's a strange concept to even say that it doesn't have the right to exist when it does exist correct but so I could see how you could say hey what does he say Jeremy Corbyn accused of anti-semitism over shocking 2011 video when she questions Israel's right to exist and says the BBC is biased in favor of the Jewish state questions our right to exist see I could see how someone could say that there is evidence that some Israelis Israeli soldiers have done horrific things to Palestinian course I have yes of course they have yes I will never deny that and I could see how you could look at the where Palestine is in the state of the Palestinian people and saying there has to be a better way for them it has to be a better civilization for them it has to it has to improve these are human beings they have it has to be a better just a better situation I mean they're not even recognized as a true state or as a true country by a lot of people I could see that yes that because distinguished right yes I believe that because I'm a human being and I believe that also because I'm a Zionist I don't want the State of Israel and the state of that's supposed to be embodying Jewish ideas to be occupying and other people like that is a state like that is horrible what can be done about well here's the problem right we saw what happened in the Israeli pull out from the Gaza Strip it pulled out completely all of the settlements from the Gaza Strip there's not a single Jew left there it's completely udin right and yet Hamas is still sending tons of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel the occupation there is ended it's over and that's still going on and so then you have to ask yourself like does the average Palestinian like I believe that the average Palestinian I've spent time in the West Bank talking to Palestinians whose lives are in misery 'td by the by the Israeli occupation like they just want to live a normal life you know and yet they are being held hostage I spoke to this young mother in Gaza who fled and she said to me on the phone were being sort of misery at twice you know once was by Israel and now by our own leaders by Hamas right these are like kleptocratic authoritarian regimes that hate women that hate gay people I mean it's horrible like life under these regimes is absolutely horrible so the problem is Israel then sees what happens in Gaza and they're like okay we're in this situation where we want to be a liberal democracy and yet were you know occupying another people it's in it's an untenable situation if you want to be a liberal democracy to occupy in other people the problem is is literally geographically if they pull out of the West Bank they will likely have another situation like they had in Gaza and now all of a sudden not only do you have Rockets going to the south of the country in places like stay wrote from Gaza you have rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv and the population centers of Israel so what do you do what do you do I don't know does anyone know I don't have a rational course no really no I mean I think I think one of the the places we've arrived to write is like what does Palestinian nationalism really seek Western liberals like me want or for years I told myself and I think this was certainly like the view of lots of experts but what Palestinian nationalism really wanted was a Palestinian state Palestinian just want self-determination like everyone else in the world and I am absolutely on board with that the problem is is that their leaders and then you look at some of these polls and the numbers are really disturbing and they say no the goal is not having our own state alongside Israel the goal is erasing Israel the goal is for Israel not to be there right and then you look at the evidence of all of these peace offers that were you know Oslo and Camp David and we can go on and on and they were all rejected so it's like is the goal your own land and having a place of your own or is the national or have we told ourselves and I include myself in this a lie about what Palestinian nationalism or at least parts of it seek and that's really really upsetting to confront so the hard core position from people like from Hezbollah is that Israel is stolen yes Palestinian people yes yeah and so but Hezbollah remembers in southern Lebanon yeah right that's like you know but they're all Iranian proxies and Hamas oh yeah Hezbollah all these they're all Iranian proxies Hezbollah is in Iranian proxies yeah and Hamas as well right mm-hmm and they're all their position is that Israel shouldn't exist oh absolutely they do not want any which state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea they believe that any Jewish presence in the Middle East is heretical and that's what they believe that's probably also accentuated by our support for Israel all right because the United States is fully in support of Israel militarily politically socially I mean that's like saying you know I'm trying to think of the right analogy here I mean they're they're not like these are these are terrorist groups unless you think terror like terrorism is rational I don't think that anything is accentuated by like I think they would think that about Israel whether or not the US was supporting Israel yeah when you see a situation like that where there doesn't seem to be a solution mm-hmm it's well the solution is shrinking the conflict as much as possible right I do not believe right now you can resolve the conflict because Israelis who have lived through times where it was normal for buses and cafes to just blow up you know the number of people I know who were touched by the Second Intifada like I was there during times where you know a cafe would just blow up down the street so like they have been thoroughly disabused of the idea that I think I think that many of them have given up on the idea that there could be peace in the short term so what can you do right now to make things a little bit better you can improve economic life for people for Palestinians living in the West Bank and you can try and shrink the conflict meaning no settlement expansion and I would say pull out of some of these settled Jewish settlements that are like you know far-flung and that the Israeli army is sort of protecting for no reason but I think that's the best case scenario for right now for Rome there's a there's a book I think it's called on catch 67 by Mika Goodman that I would recommend to people that's about how to shrink the conflict and that for now being the best-case scenario but again it's like why does you have to ask yourself like why does in the world obsessed about this particular conflict yeah there's a weird obsession with it why do you think that is I think it's inescapable that part of it is an obsession with the Jews like there are 500,000 Palestinians living in Lebanon most of whom live in refugee camps and by official Lebanese law are barred from being lawyers from being doctors for being accountants it's a horrible situation do you think most people in the world know about the situation of the Palestinian image duration in Lebanon they don't even know Palestinians are are in Lebanon or in Jordan they've no idea the reason is because you know it's like Palestinian lives matter when the people that are hurting them are Jews they don't seem to matter when the people that are hurting them are other Arabs that's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about it's that this acceptance of anti-semitism almost globally is unique it's not it's a it's a weird racism or a weird discrimination oh it's weird it doesn't it doesn't parallel with any other sort of discrimination right it's like people aren't sitting around thinking about how you know left-handed people or Koreans are uniquely evil like they're sitting around thinking about that with regard to the Jews there's going to be a certain amount of population a certain percentage of the population no matter what that's gonna hold those beliefs and these have been passed down for thousands of years yes and the challenge is to keep society as like healthy as possible to keep those forces at bay really I mean it's it's really it's unbelievable the extent to which it's it's become accepted like I'll give you an example like there was um and this is the way that anti-zionism presents itself the anti-zionism i think is the modern form one of the modern forms of anti-semitism because what else do you call a movement that says that the Jewish state that already exists does not have a right to exist like that sounds like oh that's like a cool theory but it's like it exists they live there they are surrounded by people that want to murder them so what are you suggesting that it just like goes away like the effect of it would be nothing less than unbelievable bloodshed and yet lots of people in this world are going around Saint calling themselves anti Zionist do you think that they've it seems like almost a sentiment that gets expressed that hasn't been really examined yes so it's a criticism of Israel like people should be Israeli government is full of like lunatics just like our government just like any other normal country but it's like Israel's not treated like a normal country it's treated in a way like this has these superpowers both superpowers to like effect peace in the Middle East and superpowers to like like a supervillain it's both at once people hate a country that doesn't exist and they love a country that doesn't exist they project themselves and their ideas of things on to this place and it's just like a normal country that's where it's it's so strange because that's where there really doesn't seem to be a way out of this because it's an idea that's now that hasn't been fully explored but has been expressed so frivolously almost mm-hmm well it's just it's like if you think about think about if there was a movement in the world that suggested that you know the Japanese weren't a real people and the in Japan does not have a right to exist like think about how crazy that sounds right but that's a normal thing that a lot of people believe a lot of people that you and I know why did you write the book well what was what was your goal like when you when you sat down you decided you're gonna write this book how to fight anti-semitism what what were you thinking well first of all I wrote I was supposed to write another book that I'm still on the hook for I went and begged a publisher to do because after Pittsburgh I just kind of couldn't stop saying it everywhere I looked um and honestly like yeah I think a Pittsburgh hadn't happened I wouldn't have written this first but I just became so passionate about it and so passionate about here's I think maybe the shortest answer for this when we talk about anti-semitism even you and I like we think about Jews like the Jews on the streets of Brooklyn or in Pittsburgh or in that synagogue in California as being the victims of it but the act and they are but the real bigger victim of it is the surrounding society like when anti-semitism shows itself in a culture it means that that culture is extremely broken or in some stage of death and the reason that I think it's so important and the reason I ultimately wrote the book is I want people to understand that the fact that anti-semitism is rising in America says nothing about Jews it says everything about America and where we are right now like we don't want to be come a place where anti-semitism is normalized because guess what societies were anti-semitism become normalized or societies that no longer exist on the face of the earth I like how you described in your book as a symptom like that we all have certain bacteria or we all have certain viruses but our immune system keeps them at bay when those viruses show themselves it's a it's a sign that the immune system is weak that the body itself is weak yes that's exactly right couldn't said it better that's all I said yeah I think that's true and the question right is how do we rebuild back our immune system and one of the reasons that I'm alarmed by and I completely understand the populist moment but I'm also scared of it because populism often does not end well for Jews or for the political center and I think one one of the reasons that we need to like how do we rebuild our immune system like those are the sort of things that I suggest in the last chapter of the book and I think I just I just hope we can do them because I'm really really alarmed that we're living in an America in 2020 where people I know you know who wear a Jewish star like put it inside their shirt when they walk down the street that's crazy mmm like that's crazy to me imagine if that was a crucifix exactly and fear yeah I mean to say nothing by the way of like Jews in France that have you know they've been hiding themselves for a very very long time that's normal they're you know a lot of Jews I know are taking shooting lessons I just had a guy reach out to me that was like I read your book I've read your speeches I think you're great but none of them are gonna help you if someone attacks you on the street let me teach you like Krav Maga self-defense something to do that are you really oh yeah of course I am aghast legit yeah I'm definitely doing it basically take the best aspects of all martial arts and combine them together striking grappling self-defense techniques I'm gonna do it you get a gun I can't I live in New York you can get a gun in New York no really yeah it's not that hard I have to say I hate like the few times that I've gone shooting I hate it yeah I really do dresses me out okay I'll go with you I might enjoy it more okay I'll do it okay are you serious yeah I'll take you for sure next time you're in town I'll take you to tear and tactical the other light up some target let's do it okay I think I should know how to shoot yeah shoot right yeah um the other thing I was thinking about is like what would it look like if you got some like of your MMA buddies to put on you know to dress like Hasidic Jews and walk around Brooklyn in the next few months okay like they have they have things to do they can't go out vigilante style and why superheroes it would go away like seriously it's like they're these guys are being preyed on because because the people attacking them know they're not gonna fight back Ryan I see what you what if they go with your bunch of guy the guy just like wrexham yeah you know you get enough of those enough viral videos maybe the whole thing will die down um that is I think that's a simplistic view and yeah it doesn't usually work that way works got way in comic books maybe yeah listen Barry thank you so much your book is about is out right now how to fight anti-semitism available everywhere there's also an excellent audio book that I was listening to you're really good narrating it thank you very much thank you bye everybody
