the girag and experience so we live in strange times Greg proof that it's amazing how the exciting part is like I'm ready for a lot of the old stuff to go away yeah I think I mean I have tradition obviously I write with a piece of paper and a pen yeah do you really I feel like I can't write as fast that way so ideas slip away from me but I do write it down before I go on stage mm-hmm because when I especially new stuff I feel like if I don't physically write it down with a pen and a paper I don't remember the same way that's exactly what I was going to say Joe I've done a survey of every comic I've talked to in the last two or three years every club I played I make everybody get their book out and show me I go where do you keep your ideas and everybody yeah book a little book with your lists on it yeah mine are on hotel room stationery thousands of them yeah piece of thousands of pieces of paper mm-hmm and I say why do you do it that way do you ever write it on the your phone yeah if I think of a one-line and I write it you know did it it it but do you write your hole lock of the phone no in the end I have to put it on a piece of paper and read right yeah and I just think it said metal yeah that's the really old-fashioned part of performing I have note lists of set lists on my phone that I'll go to like right before I go onstage sometimes if I want to make sure that I remember some new shit that I'm working on but when I write I go when are you going to that like trance I can do that so much better when I'm typing because I can the words just appear like I can type a word in a second whereas it takes but can you remember it if you type no but but I can write better so I get the trance out and I can get more information out as I'm ready but that's and then I go back and I'm like fucking write that I remember writing that like oh how laughs at some of my own shit and then I'll go okay I got that I got to keep that part night because I don't even remember writing because out of five hours of writing how much do you actually remember but the act of actually scribing it into a paper a piece of paper there's something about that that's like it just really like it's it just stores in your memory yes like it's like a we humans have been doing it that way for so long it's like man well it's been five seven ten thousand years since people started writing yeah I think it there's a real profound can with the paper yeah have you ever thought about releasing those like with your like with a special like when you release a special release your notes as well Wow now I haven't one time I did a fun article for filter magazine the guy came over to me he said how do you he saw me fumbling with my notes and I said it's all different pieces of hotel stationery so I asked my wife to pick it he goes well that'll be the article just I want a picture of these you know notes a setlist and I said to my wife you pick it out I gave her the folder full of shit let's picked up four random ones it was one from like Paris one from Minnesota one from a place I didn't remember being in and somewhere you know and then there was another and then it just said like Quentin you know what on the like you know corn whatever the fuck was on the list Olsen twins and I kind of went through the list as the article just went like yeah I was doing Clinton jokes in Paris you know well I think it's always 92 when I rock the mic rock to mic or whatever you know like there's a weird insight into kind like what's going on exactly then with all your set lists because they're different notes you may call them and stuff I don't know that there's not much to be garnered from I mean I could probably remember some of the debts and some I couldn't I think maybe is so just something that might be cool like if I was a fan and I'd like yeah yeah yeah definitely to see my old self like maybe if I put it up on his own or something if you just put the photos online will you ever see a website called letters of note no and there's another one something of note but letters have noticed uh a lot of people wrote to each other or even though that I think there's one called lists of note and then the list of note is just different lists that famous people wrote or any but you know never like the one I remember it's the loneliest month because I read it on my show at the lines monk you know he had different mental problems and stuff you know if you've ever seen him play like he'd play and then he sort of get up and walk around the stage you know and really yeah and he's extraordinary and then he was given drugs and they didn't quite work out but anyway some genius and he he could both compose and arrange and extemporize and his band was you know kind of put in the position of having to deal with his analogy right like he wasn't like a regular guy who hey let's you know I'll be there five you know he had to kind of be pushed around to the places but then when he could play so he wrote a note like and on the net it says how to address tonight sharp as possible underlined right and then if you're the drummer think of something you know like there's all this rule like really broken down like the thoughts you have before you go on stage like about the band and how he wanted the band play and look and I would I would read that out sometimes in it and so I would say on the show how do they dress tonight sharp as possible oh that's bad yeah right so there's lists of note and there's letters of note and then the last letter of note someone sent it to me was um Jackie Robinson wants you a luncheon or a dinner that Ike was speaking out right and Jackie was an executive yeah Jackie Robinson was an executive at chock full of nuts coffee right like he got a job in the corporate world because he was an intelligent capable and famous person he became an executive at chocolate nuts in New York and so he went to this like banquet and Eisenhower spoke and there was a lot of black people there who were in business and Eisenhower said you've got to be patient right your time will come and all that this is the fitties Wow so Jackie read him a very respectful letter but also very pointed about your patience you know and I'm not doing it any justice was you know Jim mr. president having recently attended the lunch Sharad I have to say that on behalf of myself and my race the time for patience is long past you'll find that over the past several hundred years we've endured nothing but count listen to me you know right right right and then the repast is the next letter Eisenhower wrote him back J mr. Robinson thank you for your letter as I take on board what you said and I profound that you know blah blah blah and this exchange in a very civil and highfalutin language not the language that we use now but like formal letter writing language with the idea very explicitly expressed that he no longer had the patience to weigh that he felt that why shitty way right and why should you have to go to a dinner where the president told him the way weren't even the first fucking black guy in the big leagues and they get a job in fucking business and you know trying to run his life and yeah yeah and Eisenhower like you well you know one day schools will be integrated and you won't have to drink it another faucet and you know you don't want to hear that yeah and so those kind of letters I think to me are like fascinating yeah so letters have known and list of note are quite good if you want to just you mean you have to read everything on it but it's it's different letters to people and dude that's fucking bad-ass yeah how will check that nobody writes letters anymore in in future it'll be your set list of note and your emails of note and your blog of note the probably a letter yeah it's going away the physical act of writing is going away if I didn't have to write my setlist down or occasionally like fill out a form like when I go to Canada or something I found I don't even write anything anymore I do I mean I read myself I write in my computer right all right in a book - because it's funner you're a fucking human being
