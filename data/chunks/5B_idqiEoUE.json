hey everybody what's up man hey thanks for doing this I appreciate it man there's so many people that I really enjoy and respect have been contacting me about having you on so when they found out that I was having you on Michaelmas everybody like Malaysian gentleman and when they were when I was saying that you were gonna be on or people heard about they get super pumped so that's a very very flattering yeah and Dave Smith who I love very great friend of mine yeah he's a great guy he was super psyched oh yeah sure so welcome sir Thank You mr. Rogan it's a good time for you to be here two men it seems like we might be going to war with North Korea so your book dear reader I'll hold it up yeah it's probably an important book for people that are like um what exactly is going on over there well that's why I wrote it so that because everything you read in the press is crap really everything pretty much yeah what's what are they getting wrong they're getting wrong that so there was an article a couple years ago so the example I always used where you had all these women marching in Pyongyang the capital city and the headline said Kim jong-un's mini skirted robot army you know how how they are you know look they're all brainwashed and robots it's like they're all hostages if someone puts a gun to your mom's head you're gonna March yeah if someone puts a gun to your kid's head you're gonna do what you need to do to get that kid food these are human beings who are in prison and of course they're gonna do crazy silly things when you right of course yeah and the press is like ha that's also like they believe this silly shit you go to school and you're taught something and if you don't believe it you go to get a labor camp you're gonna smile and fucking not what do you there you read the articles and it's just like look what these stupid people believe it's like no no you look what these hostages believe yeah that's a better way of putting it for sure do you really think though that people aren't aware of that or some people aren't aware of it I have a lot of love what a dictatorship it is a military dictatorship essentially I have it down to 45 seconds when I I did an interview with an NPR affiliate and the woman said well Kim Jong Il's a very campy figure and I oonh ill about the dad and she goes he's a very campy figure I go well that's a very unfortunate choice of words and she wanted to kill herself because it's a pun on concentration camps you know yeah so I mean if you look at like the interview which got it right because they said he's a evil killer but you look at Team America and they look at him as this clown figure and and I always say the Joker from Batman is a clown but you're not looking at all the bodies behind him so yeah he's silly in a buffoon but this buffoon has millions of corpses to his name and you think it's wacky that they're marching in a parade well yeah I mean for in team America's defense though that's what those guys do that's what they did with Saddam Hussein and of course what I'm saying is I think a lot of people in the I'm talking at the press specifically they take that step they take a lot of North Korea at face value so why I wrote the book is so like you can understand what the hell's going on there because it's all smoke and mirrors with them well it is one of the most public and one of the most visible military dictatorships it's still still viable yes in 2017 which is really it's it's kind of shocking that I mean when you can walk down the street in Los Angeles and you know go to you know go to a Starbucks and get a coffee and everything's free and people you know as billboards protesting this and people talking about that and there's this certain amount of freedom that we just completely take for granted we think well this is what life is like in 2017 right sure it is in Los Angeles but in North Korea you might as well be living a thousand years ago actually what's funny as different people are living at different times when I landed on the plane there was an army guy who stopped a rich lady and he was like from the 50s and she was from the 80s in their clothes so they have different time periods overlapping there so how so basically he's in 50s Russian gear like the soldier a nice touch in gear yeah cuz they're their Soviets you know they're their origins the Soviet right so they really wear like Russian issue or that Russian style it's like green and they've got the gold but it looks cheap you know that I mean that fabric it we saw it it doesn't look contemporary okay the cut I don't know what it is but something about the eye you just look at you're like this is Communist era of stuff and he stops her at the airport and it's obviously like papers please and this was within ten to me being in the capital and she rolls her eyes at him which I was like shocked and she'd go and she's on her cell phone and she's a and she dicks to her purse shows him something and he nods and she keeps going because what's happening now is wealthy people in North Korea can run the government and run their way around the law which is great as long as they run afoul no meum jong-hoon correct right but in which case they just get killed depending but yeah so when you're empowered like the laws don't apply to you it's not that everyone's scared the cops is when you're when you're rich you can have a huge black market you couldn't bribe your way out of anything so how do people get rich in a communist dictatorship so what happened in the 90s when Kim Jong Il chose to have a famine and chose to have millions of people starve than lose his hold on power they started looking the other way and all these little markets that popped up little black markets because the government wasn't providing food anymore so people would go to China and trade stuff and come back and you know they'd get rice and so on and so forth so these markets are now the backbone in many ways of the North Korean economy and yet the cops can come and hassle you but you got to bribe that cop but it just basically works out to attacks mmm Wow so these people are essentially running black markets inside of this communist dictatorship and just paying off the cops so they can keep all this going and it's public it's in the town square but it's not they don't regard themselves as communists anymore and it's not it's much closer in many ways to fascism than to Hitler south fascism into communism so the are they putting their money in a North Korean bank well that's the trick so they used to have like the money stuffed under mattresses and then North Korea said we're switching currency tomorrow you got to switch it out they're 48 hours and everyone started going broke so the government figures that what the people do here's something else to go and fucks them over every step of the way here's something else that used to happen it used to be if you go to China right to escape you just bribe the border guard because he's hungry and then you go to China and do what you need to do and you come back right let's suppose you're trading he gets a cut now they changed it to he can keep the bribe as long as he arrests you so he lets you go and then he comes back he takes all your shit and he keeps his money and you get in trouble oh wow so March so they did that to discourage bribes and encourage arrests oh right to keep their control and do the North Koreans know this now they stop trying to bribe these guys like after a few of them Adam rusty well that keeps kind of changing and then it's all this you never know ahead of time it's like a drug deal at night is this guy cool is this guy not cool and that's why so much of it is like you know talking between lines and and working with people and who do you know and who's close and it's all these sleight of hand kind of things it's just it when you see something like what they're doing is in terms of like the way the government is running the country it's when you watch it on television you my feeling is how long can they keep this up like forever you think well no not for much longer than they should have because here's what happened in the 90s the UN famine hit right and I can explain why I get into my book the UN came to give them food and Kim jong-il said well if the UN is giving people food they're not going to need the government so what they would do is people in the UN were not allowed to have any Korean speakers on staff so they went to village a on Monday and they saw healthy people and they went to village B on Tuesday and on Wednesday they went back to the first village and the Koreans were like oh this is a third village they go we were just here at Monday and they go no you weren't and it's like what are you gonna tell them and eventually the UN left they're like fuck this we can't help these people so they were willing to let the population hold on so the first village was pretending to be a new village no right correct not even pretending it's just obviously the same village but they're lying today why were they saying that they were a different village because that way they're saying we showed you three towns and everything oh I see so it's basically they just put people there to act and be nicer did you ever see the Vice Peace when Shane Smith to North Korea and they pretended to have a restaurant no so he got that wrong he did my opinion okay so what the scene you're talking about is he's in the hotel and I I think I stayed in the same room as him in that hotel it's nicknamed the Alcatraz a fun because it's on an island in the middle of the river in the middle of Pyongyang so they took him to this ballroom and they are you know distributing food to all these tables but no one's there and he asked the waitress he goes whereas everyone and she goes they just left what I perceived that to be and I don't I'm not inside her head of course in North Korea I when I was there I'm like I got to figure out what their rules are because I was born the Soviet you have these little rules to figure out what works and what doesn't and what it was is you can never acknowledge anything's wrong because if you do that's complaining and completely criticizing the government so if he if she had said this food's all wasted she's you know making a complaint right but if she is doing improv and she's like everything's fine then the best you're gonna come up with this everyone just left this everything is you know so you have to maintain disappearance that everything's good all the time his perception was and she's on camera keep that mind right does she know what she's on camera for it doesn't it doesn't matter if you're a hostage on camera you're gonna smile a nod aren't ya right the worst one was Laura Ling she was interviewing this family in the capital city and she goes can Kim Jong Il do anything wrong and they pretended that she they didn't understand her and she and she's like I'm like wait a minute you're asking a family on camera to criticize the government and say their jaws yeah what is wrong with you woman it's the wrong way to do it yeah um Shane's perception was that they had set this place up as a restaurant and it wasn't really a restaurant cuz they don't really have restaurants per se and that they were trying to pretend and put on this air like they were a normal society and you could just go to the restaurant and buy some food but when he went in there he said the whole thing was clearly set up just for them that's my assumption I didn't go to that restaurant he went since I can't speak and that they do and I went later than him they do have restaurants for sure in Pyongyang we went to several their crappy but a lot of the stuff that is for show it's pretty easy to tell what's for show and what isn't so if he's saying that this whole thing was a setup just for him that's plausible mmm yeah that was what he was thinking he was thinking that they were putting on like a big PR display for him cuz when I went when you go to the maternity hospital a lot of that stuff is clearly for show because there's computers but they're not even plugged in maternity hospital yeah they're very proud of their maternity hospital maternity turn to take okay do we have kids put some attorney house it sounds sorry I think rush announcer so they have computers aren't even plugged in right why are they so what's what's fake about it they're for the computers are for display purposes only so it's like oh we go online we're advanced we have science it's like and you know you go into a lab and someone's at a microscope you know cutting edge technology and they don't look up it's like listen if you're working at a microscope and 20 people walk in the room you're just gonna glance something's think that way so everyone essentially is a hostage from even from the police down to the doctors to including the leaders themselves so when these countries liberalize like Libya and Iraq the leaders themselves are killed so even if Kim jong-un wanted things to loosen up he's going to get a bullet in him and with good reason so it's a system where everyone is a prisoner Kim jong-il became a bigamist because he married a woman in secret and then his dad the great leader Kim il-sung is like when he gonna get married he's like soon dad soon and then his dad's like I found a wife for you and he's like okay so he married a second woman and kept his first family in a hidden compound and that was that now is that first son who was just recently killed Wow and this was the son that was killed by Kim jong-un they thought that they were trying to organize a coup against him well it's not even if they're trying so North Korea has a constitution which is for display purposes only but what really governs the country is the ten commandments of Kim il-sung and the tenth commandment is I forget what is something there it's the revolution shall be continued through the generations until it's completed which means only a descendent of Kim il-sung can be the leader so Kim jong-il had three sons the middle one is a sissy so he doesn't count he's a sissy yeah how so they said he's too much like a girl like that's all we know about him and he's a big Eric Clapton for I like this guy there's some online you're sitting there with shoes off so the eldest son was Kim jong-nam and the youngest was Kim jong-il and Kim jong-nam wanted to liberalise Kim jong-il said no so if Kim Jong Un's gonna be replaced the only one who could have replaced him was his older brother Kim jong-nam so if he's killed that's an insurance policy oh so he killed him just to make sure that he wasn't overthrown yeah and he killed his sons too right no he killed his his his aunt's husband oh Jesus yeah but she drove her daughter to suicide so there it's Game of Thrones inhuman sick sick sick stuff Wow and they boast about I mean when I was doing my research for the book you know how they boast about all the sick shit they do like North Korea was recently criticized by the UN for having concentration camps and they literally said we don't use that term so we don't have any that was their response what are you gonna do about it Wow you got a point yeah chase case Claes if they don't use that point yeah they don't use that term there you go something different yeah so they're there's so many layers of hell in this country that it you know why I like speaking about it is someone's got to do it and people don't know what's going on and it's it kind of bothers me you know when you hear people on TV trying to give their opinion and they don't know the actual that it's so much worse than people think yeah there's well we have a very peripheral knowledge of it like in terms of like what's put out on mainstream media we know that it's bad we know that it's a dictatorship we know that the people are under the iron thumb right but we don't know too much more right right so I had to do all the homework and now you can read this book and now you have everything you need to know and when you went over there what what year did you go over there 2012 so kim jeong-hoon took over in 2011 11 so he had already taken over correct so what was it what was the this was like post all the crying in the streets oh yeah the craziness so yeah did you want to be there for that that must have been fascinating to watch that there's nothing in North Korea that's not fascinating because when you're going through the city you know in the countryside everything's there for a reason and you're looking around you're like why did they make this like this and you're not gonna have an answer because everything constructed you know what I mean right so you're trying to find analogues between what's what you know to be saying and what they have and sometimes it's not obvious like I was we showed us they took us this place and they claim that there's an invisible wall that we built that separates the Koreas right and you can only see the wall from the north and this is to keep the Koreas divided permanently I got the brochure and they shed you a little telescope and you're like what am I looking at is this a wall this is a path is a mountainside and there was a praying mantis there and I told my guide I go yo I thought this was a communist country an atheist country why is there praying mantis you know huh huh and she's like I don't know you're talking about and then I'm like okay well I mean they're not gonna call a praying mantis they must have a different word so I said well this reminds me of a favorite fable the Fox and the Scorpion you know the Fox and Scorpion went across the river I thought it was a frog it's it's either right so we could do frog and score foxes can swim that's why the frogs can swim to its glory so the Frog says the Scorpion says let me hop on your back so I can cross the river and the Frog goes how do I know you won't sting me and the Scorpion goes if I sting you we both drown and halfway through the scorpion stings him and says the Frog goes why just think we were both dying in the Scorpion goes that's my nature and I told this to my god she's like what's a scorpion I'm like okay so I'm like it's like the lobster lives in the desert she's no idea I'm like I draw it she'd never heard of it and you think how many times you've heard of a scorpion from comic books from nature shows from nature books you know just logos the horoscope and it's like holy shit like her level of what is known is so limited that even something as basic as that is completely foreign to her because they don't have scorpions in North Korea so you don't need to know about it it's just it's so fascinating that in the same time period as the Internet at Google uber satellites Elon Musk all the crazy shit that we're experiencing that these people are essentially completely isolated other than what a many web sites is like 18 websites or something yeah very low on their North Korean internet right intranet yeah intranet yeah right which for folks like intranet is what corporations and companies use to share in internal knowledge so they have a system set up like that and so these people that want to go quote-unquote online that's what they're gonna get there's only very few people are gonna have that access also it's amazing yeah I mean it's terrifying it's horrifying and it doesn't seem like it has a solution but it's also amazing and it doesn't have to be this way well what could be done I just mean this is being done intentionally oh for sure and and this is being done methodically so when I was doing the research it's like the Russian writer iron Rand said something like errors of this magnitude are never made innocently so this was a step-by-step process from the great leader Kindle song and the D leader Kim to slowly close the walls and these people and to keep it as airtight and as much like a prison as possible it was a very step by step by step over the decades and you can you know as you read the history you could just feel the walls closing in well we were talking recently about the wailing in the streets when Kim jong-il died and about how people who did not they didn't cry hard enough right we're sentenced to six months of hard labor right so what they have there is you know people again when you think it's just the dictatorship so everyone in North Korea is slotted into some group like your school your workplace maybe the young workers women's whatever once a week your whole group has to get together and you have to stand up and say what you did wrong and then your other friends have to get up and denounce you and say what they saw you doing wrong and they better have something to say right so everyone is watching each other all the time so it's almost like a a right flick from hell so this has been going on since the 70s so not people are like well i'ma just get to get in revolt you can't revolt when everyone around you is looking to make sure they have something to tell about you at your weekly meeting it's really kind of brilliant it is absolutely that's the thing when people like these people are crazy and stupid like this is brilliant they have it all worked out yeah and it's working for them well it's it's a conspiracy at the highest level yes I mean it really is like the entire country is a massive conspiracy yes it's fucking stunning really when you really look at it that way that this is how many million people 24 million fucking incredible yeah yeah and that they've been put and everyone's like they're suicidal they've outlasted everybody except for Cuba they're the last ones standing and they gloat about and they should be gloating about it it's essentially Los Angeles but a prison you know imagine if Los Angeles was a prison but larger than Los Angeles well you guys have warm weather they have the old weather and they don't have warm clothes and the Camino populations oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah even it's a population size of Los Angeles and yet everyone's a prisoner everyone's oppressive yeah fucking incredible so I just want people to keep that in mind next time they are laughing at one of these you know articles or like how stupid these people are it's like you are gonna believe whatever you need to believe in prison well people don't really look to it I mean when you see his goofy fucking haircut right you know and then you know there was some sketch recently where he made everybody get the same haircut that's a myth yeah yeah was a sketch right a comedy sketch but it was just there was like oh yeah it is a stupid haircut ha ha oh what's Britney Spears up to her just going crazy in fact Jennifer Lopez got a dwarf ooh whoo look at this Kim Kim Kardashian's a fake ass and we just move on to the next ridiculous thing and the reason he has that haircut is because that's the haircut the great leader his grandfather had in the 40s so he's like I'm migrant when Kim jong-il took over in 1994 his campaign slogan was do not expect any change for me that was literally from on the billboards I am the same person as my dad who got in trouble recently for having a Hitler haircut there was a story recently someone in Europe some kid in Europe was kicked out of something for essentially having a Hitler haircut which is like today my friend Moshe Moshe kasher has a Hitler haircut yeah he's just a hipster Hitler Youth yeah I had that a couple years ago it's like shaved on the socks and I kind of had that how he looked at the top grow a little bit more yeah but I mean that's uh that's kind of like what he's rocking he's rocking this retro haircut yeah yeah and with good reason and we think it's silly you know we just hee hee ha ha right I mean while we're watching this mass atrocity go on yes yeah and it's funny for me because every time you know I talk about it everyone I met is still there like everyone I saw on the street is still there every little kid I saw still there my guide is still there who's a very sweet young lady and it's it's heartbreaking and I hate being one those people who like oh I run this trip and changed my life you know like the whole Facebook shit but you it fucks with your head for years because being Jewish being born in the Soviet Union those who this is why I took on this project those are chances for me to have been in a camp you know back in the day for sure so to see and there my friend is also from Russia he goes it looks like Russian people the architecture and the clothes but it's just Asian people in them he's like it's a total mind fuck well it's also fascinating when you considered the small amount of time between the concentration camps of the Holocaust and today I mean we look I'm almost 50 I turned 50 in August which when I was a child seemed like it right and now as a man there's almost 50 it seems like it just happened well the rush yeah yeah yeah which 50 years ago you know we're just out of the Holocaust 50 years ago were just into the Vietnam War right right I mean it's so quick it's so recent yeah so I mean what we think of as modern we think of as like modern civilization it's only modern civilization in a couple of spots right and this was the attitude right before World War one remember they're like we're civilized now there's never gonna be wars against we've got it all figured out and then World War one happens and they're like what the fuck just happened when I was a boy I was living in San Francisco and it was all like we were right off of Lombard Street is where we lived that really crooked Street and I remember when the Vietnam War ended I remember because I remember thinking god I don't want to go to war I'm glad they figured this out that was a little kid I was like good we're done with war thank God and then when I was I think I was 21 or 22 thing I was 21 when the Gulf War broke out right and I was sitting there with my friend Jimmy my roommate at the time we were sitting in our apartment watching the missiles they showed that night vision yeah yeah scene of the missiles fly and he was like holy shit buddy we're at fucking war yeah I was like this is crazy I thought we were done with this oh yeah and and you mean the second Iraq war the first one okay Desert Storm yeah that was what was at 89 somewhere around then so I was 20 miles 99 yes okay stunning to me at the time because I was like how is this possible this is we're still doing this I thought we were done I thought we're finished with Vietnam I thought we realized like as a culture like wait this is something we need to evolve past but it's just so reason there's so much pro-war propaganda like on the one hand you'll hear how bad war is and then you'll hear the glorification of FDR and Woodrow Wilson and like if you look at the end of the Cold War Reagan Thatcher and Gorbachev they ended it without a shot they freed half the world from this communist dictatorship and that's almost like an asterisk and it's like that's the way to do it like if you want to end a war do it peacefully and without the body count them I want to avoid the body count I don't want the funerals I don't want the destroyed buildings and people just on some level revel in that both on the right and the left well one thing that's undisputable is that if you look back a long enough we are clearly evolving human beings are across the board pretty much I say for places like North even Pinker yes yeah perfect sample what he's talking about is if you go what will anybody's talking about if you go back a thousand years ago and you look at today with it's it's in arguable that this is a far safer place to live yes far more inclusive people are far more understanding and compassionate and far more willing to be open to strangers it's a different world but like how does anyone get past this this is the thing that freaks me out when it comes to something like North Korea it's like when you have this absolute power at the top like Libya like when moammar qaddafi was killed and then you get rid of that you have this fucking chaos right and how does that ever help those people that live there it's almost like those people that live there those 20-plus million people that live in North Korea it's almost like they can't be fixed like oh you're wrong that's not what I meant I didn't mean like it's impossible but I mean it's like what they're so programmed to living in this environment and they're so under the grip of this guy right if you take that guy out don't you think there'll be some kind of a massive power vacuum that someone will try to fill yes that's one concern however like I've met refugees and they're the most annoying boring teenagers you'd ever hope to meet which is great because I want my goal is I wish I want these people to be sitting on lazy boys with their bucket of kimchi and their pounder and watching little pounder like a beer the tall beer right oh and just watching TV like everybody everyone else like they have the right to just be lazy assholes like that's all I want for these people and a lot of times they are very act they get acclimated pretty easily it's a big surprise individuals yes leave that environment what I'm talking about is the environment itself it's gonna be a extremely tough transition because it's been 70 years of dictatorship and abuse and isolation yeah when you have a country that's programmed in that way that essentially has been programmed from birth and I was reading an article about a kid that was born a prison can yeah escape from camp 14 yes yes which is horrific right I mean that is a horrific account of like the different stages of physical depletion the prisoners would be like so like if you're at this stage you could be assigned to physical labor at this point you can't do physical labor anymore an extra he's drawing pictures of what these people look like and if you kill yourself your family has to fulfill your quota so even death is not an escape from the North Korean regime this it's a fucking stunning so what happens I mean how is there even a conceivable plan the only way so first of all China doesn't want 24 million people who don't speak Chinese who have no skills whatsoever crossing the two men in yellow rivers into Manchuria and setting up camp there that's their concern however they started backing down and that's the greatest possible thing so what would happen is how so back and down meaning they started standing up to North Korea they were like refusing take some exports they sat down with Trump and clearly talked about North Korea there's no way Trump is running his mouth without having a plan with them I'm sure that's the case they were very friendly with him at mar-a-lago so at golf what's that they like golf and hookers do well they don't like golf so because them that's the whole thing it's capitalist now had this whole thing against golf this is real controversy yes it's it's the it's the sport of millionaires oh I see yeah but isn't China like a totally different environment now we're getting off track though the point is once that government is somehow vanished and I have no idea how that would happen you would have to have China Russia South Korea and Japan and us working together to kind of have a Marshall plan of some kind that's the only way that's going to happen and even in a Marshall Plan well how do you deal with all those people and give them meaningful employment and give them some sort of a new philosophy or a new culture a new some sort of government I mean I don't think it would be that hard really I really don't because it's not there's not like this agent like like this the Muslim Brotherhood whatever these are people who want food clothes a roof over their heads and opportunities for their kids South Korea who's the same people has the highest per-capita income of any country in Asia which is saying a lot so it would just be it would not be easy and it would be a long ish process but I don't think it would be as much of a shit show as like Libya or Syria or any of these other places that's interesting um why do you think it'd be easier because I think once they find out how much they've been lied to and now they have like look just go this office work 9:00 to 5:00 gift they're very hard-working because they're slaves right so they don't like they don't have a work ethic it's not like they're not ambitious it's just like their ambitions gonna get them nowhere and frankly the ones who were the most loyal to the regime were the ones who starved in the 90s because they thought foods coming foods coming foods coming and then ones who were shady and who were like I'm gonna get fed by any means necessary who are entrepreneurial they're the ones who survived when you left that place yeah and you got back home and you're sitting there you're about to put this book together and you're thinking about this world that you just escaped from yeah what do you how does this play out did you did you think like where this goes did you like look at what you saw and come up with some possible scenarios for how this eventually plays out well I I had one quote from either Hemingway or Steinbeck and the quote was how did you go bankrupt two ways gradually and then suddenly so it's going to happen overnight we're not going to see it coming I don't I think at all those countries around North Korea I've agree it's a problem all those countries like this is a fucking nightmare and I think just like with the first world war Gulf War they would very quickly get together be like alright we can't have this explode into some nightmare let's work together and figure this shit out I think it'd be very very difficult but not difficult ideological ideologically plan to come forward well it's so fascinating when you compare them to South Korea which is a nice arriving economy right you make some of the best electronics in the world some of the best phones and televisions and you know and it's just amazing that they're right next door to each other and there's such a consensus internationally that this place is evil you know what I mean it's not like you know Libya where these other countries have their back and Iran and Iraq and all this other stuff well that's more religious though right and with this they don't know one has their back well maybe some weird African countries they have allies with but everyone in that regions like all right this shit's a nightmare and enough is enough well it's fucking hilarious whenever they try to like show some Display of power and they have a launched of like some missile that shoots 13 feet up in the air and then explodes that could be intentional you think so so they can't back down ever right but if you want to back down without backing down is you make a mistake right so it looks like you don't have the power really that's that's where I would put my money wow that's that's some weird fucking multi level chest they are they've been playing multi level chest since the 40s they yeah but they're all about face about showing like that's one of the things about Korea well all I know about is South Korea right I know quite a bit about South Korean culture in the way like I grew up learning and teaching Taekwondo so I was around a lot of Koreans and they're very much about honor and they're very much about hard work and they're very much about appearances right like the idea of giving like showing a weakness like that intentionally seems pretty alien well the choice is are you if Trump says if you go forward with this we're gonna attack you so that's not on the table so Plan B isn't like okay we're gonna give in plan B would be to act like you're defying him but not actually defining it that sounds so ridiculous it's fascinating they're so smart with their shit I mean that's where I would put my money because think about it if you are doing these tests you're gonna be you're gonna be testing it publicly how many times like in America you're gonna have some you know I guess windows crashes but people go through this over and over especially when your life is at risk right so you're gonna make damn sure that it's going to be working before you announce you know April 14th we're having our big launch right but aren't they developing this technology in a vacuum as opposed to most of the rest of the world like if you're you're dealing with the United States right like the United States is first of all we have the Internet second of all we have some of the very best aerospace engineers like world the most knowledgeable people in terms of rocketry and explosions and all that shit like you're dealing with this fantastic database of human beings might draw from but they're isolated like wouldn't it make sense that their stuff kind of sucks but what I'm saying is if it sucks they would do the test privately and in some hidden place until they got the kinks out then they would publicly do it when they've got the kinks out why would you publicly show your hand unless you had a purpose well they probably don't have enough money to run near enough tests like we we know that they have done some tasks that we've observed but remember there was a there was some concern they detonated a nuke right Jacob nukes 100% right but there was a concern that they had detonated one underground yeah it was a few years back right but my point is we don't know this would be something that would be up their alley and it would be I don't understand why they would announce something unless they were sure they could do it because that's really talked about face it's like you know here's our big launch and then you turn on the TV doesn't work that's amazing I never thought of that you might be right but it's it's fascinating to think about it that way does anybody share your opinion is this a call yes yeah it's not I mean really it's not sound like there's a huge community of people who understand North Korea but this is I mean what people who watch the country do share is the consensus of you can't take shit at face value ever with them wow that's amazing that's a really amazing sort of strategy if that really is the case it's that's really very self-aware yes well look at look at two years ago my buddy called me they had a data photo they released of Kim jong-un on his MacBook and behind him was a map of the US where the nukes are gonna hit including Austin my friend calls me goes are they good a new Costin it's like listen if I'm new King Austin why the fuck am i putting this on my Instagram what are you talking about you know and of course they didn't nuke Austin and when Austin I don't mean maybe they bullets are in Texas well that's the last place to fucking invade well the way they operates like this like there's two types of bank robbers right there's the bank robber comes in shoots up the ceiling gets the loot gets out then there's the bank robber comes and shoots up everyone and you know you want to deal with the first one when they were firing their missiles they're firing them to the ocean they're not firing them into Tokyo or Seoul right that's telling right yeah well they don't want to get killed right they want to show that they have missiles right and they want to say hey we can launch missile at Los Angeles alright that's but Seoul there's 10 million people I mean you can't even I mean they're like what about nukes what about nukes I said this on Fox the other other day goes you really nukes Schmucks you care about missiles hitting those skyscrapers in Seoul can you can imagine what that would look like it would be like Independence Day yeah being saying and it's close it's extremely close so the missiles would get there in a matter of minutes if not it's not even lying yeah yeah yeah what do you think about the theory that's been run back and forth pretty recently that the United States sabotage those the same way they sabotage the Iranian how it'd be great now would be that's also conscience a census I don't know what I'm talking about say knows okay they sabotage the Iranian nuclear program with viruses and they're saying that it could perhaps have been the same case with North Korea that they sabotage the missile program was some sort of computer virus yeah that we hacked them that also is very plausible would it be hacking or would it be something along the lines of someone clandestine selling some sort of you know technology to them that turns out to be technology with an embedded virus my understanding was it was hacking allegedly allegedly yes but if they have okay I'm not sure I understand how they would do that but basically one well they are on there I mean it's there online of kind of online right right so there would be a way to get to it especially if China's helping us you know the the ins and outs of international espionage and politics and sabotage and all that shit it is unbelievably fascinating to me yeah and I think most people don't even have the the slightest understanding of how deep that shit goes and how hard people like in the CIA work and the people that are embedded in these essentially terrorist organizations like this was one of the things that came out about Trump revealing to Russia that these laptops that Isis was planning on using laptops for bombs and in doing so he gave them top-secret information that he felt he had the right to declassify it and give it to that what he claimed to have left but the people that have I that I have talked to that have an understanding understanding of the intelligence community say that in doing so you compromised all the people that worked very hard to get to the position to find out that Isis was doing this so now Isis has to take an account of all the people and some sort of an audit of all the people that they're in contact with and then try to figure out how the fuck this got out and who are the sketchy people or the questionable people and then puts people in danger and people have to flee and they had to when Trump did that they had to alert the intelligence community like immediately and this is one of the reasons why even though it seems benign to him on a surface level because he's thinking about a million different things right he's thinking about a million different things all at once and his lack of understanding about the importance and significance of top secret clearance according to the people that have I've communicated with is why it's so dangerous for him to just talk about this stuff we'll also this is whole thing where people like oh who cares about Hillary's server it's just like this is the Secretary of State what kind of shit she's got on there who the hell knows we have a real problem in this country of being on teams and we have a real problem this country of people that don't like Trump thinking that Hillary would have been a great president it's it's a real problem because I'm not a fan of either all right I think you as a human being should expect more from someone who wants to run the free world right I should expect someone first of all you'd expect someone who you can clearly tell is going to be honest and you can't tell that from either one of them you want someone who has principles and sticks with them you can't tell that from either one of them right you know that it's it's not what we need we need something greater and I think there's a great article in motherboard today about it's essentially something that I've been saying for years that the United States is far too complicated to be run by a president and that the idea is antiquated it was an idea that was created back when people came over here on boats well I I had an article I write for the observer an article called the case for American secession and the point I made was we've had two cultures since the beginning and I agree with you completely to have one guy running everything or one woman is nuts what's not to break stuff up when he fired call me that woke a lot of people up it's like we could just do that he just fired the guy who's in charge of investigating him right how the fuck does that work I think it was also cuz called me six eight yeah he's a giant dude yeah and I tell him what's that you think that bothered him you tell you telling me that Trump doesn't likes looking up to someone no way well if the guy was totally down for him and hugged him back and told him that listen don't worry about it your boy Flynn's no I just meant physically he can't handle someone look what I'm saying that if Clint but if Comey was like totally on board a total Trumpkin if he came in and just och we asked you don't think that he'd still be on he'd still be on but rumpling liked it he'd make him you know be sitting when he what's another person I say I mean he's a very petty person which is what I admire about him I was listening to Sam Harris's podcast recently where they were he was talking with two political experts I forget their names but two women who were talking about the case for succession secession yeah or excuse me the Kay the case for impeachment and they were essentially saying that his attention span is so short that they have to give him visual aids and they have to put his name as many times as they came in in memos because he searches for his name when he goes and reads to her memos now I don't know if that's true I mean I don't know if that's maybe some sneaky way of getting under his skin to get him to go fucking crazy which like you're talking about multi-level chess yeah yeah yeah doing that thing I would feel like if that's the way to fuck with the guy it's to leak a shit like this out and say things like this like he needs visual aids or he needs his name research funny so he could rather his name mentioned multiple times in these mammals so he looks for his name what look there's me yeah well III think people are so willing to believe the worst about people that they hate yeah that it gets cartoonish I remember during the 2000s where some journalists said I don't think george w bush can read it's like he went to harvard and yale yeah well I don't hate Trump I don't a lot of people think that it's a it's a good thing to hate him I hate him as president I don't hate him as a person I don't I don't I don't hate him I don't just doing a good country a great service by making them suspicious of our democratic absolutely I think that was I've been making this argument or a couple years on many different shows that it's very healthy for people to be like if this is the outcome you need to double check that this is the system you love he's the monkey wrench and the ears of the Model T yeah and we don't need a model team right Tesla right this is 2017 right something far more advanced and what we can't just keep patching up the Model T right it's Curt year yeah we don't want Windows 95 with all the upgrades for 2017 right get the fuck out of here right and 95 and to have politics divided geographically is a very outdated way of looking at things yeah and also to have represented government's very outdated we don't need someone to represent anymore we can communicate instantaneously right everyone has a communication device essentially everyone except Ari Shaffir that crazy fucker he doesn't even use a phone anymore but everyone else is using modern cell phones where you could tweet from or you could you could vote from anywhere in the world essential right right that's how it should be yes yes you should have technology and we should have a government I mean we should have rather a government that recognizes the current technology and utilizes to get the voice of the people out there well the technology is what's actually making the government put in its place and it's it's going at a very increasingly fast race to integrate it is and it's also what I'm fascinated by is all these trolls I'm a professional I'm writing a book about this on trolls and then you write yeah well the new road well it's not just a new right I mean you can call them the new right but they could easily be left what I'm fascinated by is these people that they belong to a group yeah and they are in an identity group yeah and that's what it it's like you tell me that green frog is all right no man that's people having a good time I hold a chat whole chapter with this there's a group online on Twitter who were yelling at me to shout them out I'm not gonna say it cuz I said well tell me what it write it down I'll shout him out no no hold on I said you got add me on Facebook so I know your real name I'm not shouting at someone turns out to be a mass murderer he wouldn't do it I'm like you're not getting a shoutout boy he's a whole group murderer well just the one guys like shout out our leader I'm like well you can't have a leader boys I'm not shouting yeah if you have a leader yes absolutely there shouldn't be any leaders I don't think we should have leaders anymore I really don't I think there's 350 million people in this country the idea of leaders is some old-school alpha chimpo let's say right here that's the very first sentence in my book Wow when the world leader or leadership returns they're currently yeah man yeah you're essentially saying exactly that mmhmm yeah relapse into barbarism that's a great word yeah barbarism is a great yes it is Mussolini was ill do che he was the leader and this is Patterson from what was 1943 yeah yeah well I think they recognized it back then and they you know it's escalated since then because society's gotten more complicated we've gotten more diverse ideologically remember in the 80s where every hack comedian would make a joke about how this diet coke and caffeine free coke and all those other cokes it's like we still have two choices for politics why yeah I know is that amazing that was in the 1980s yeah we had a hundred different kind of cokes and coke coke he doesn't James Farrior area died man remember new coach Jimmy he knows things from classic to the new coach yeah we were aware of Pepsi spice isn't that new my friend Brian single-handedly might've nuked pepsi spice back is it by Pepsi fires now fire does he I wonder if Brian still has that website he had a website he bought Pepsi spice calm it was fucking hilarious is one of his best trolls like and he started writing about how he was on a diet of drinking only Pepsi spice and so and as time went on he started getting sicker and sicker and his diary and he's talking about like shitting out blood maybe I should go to the hospital and Pepsi spice is fucking freaking out and I have to figure out like who is this guy how did he get Pepsi spice calm I bought Pepsi spice calm like the moment it came out well two things first of all if you go read the reviews for sugarfree gummy bears on Amazon it's the hole it's the same thing yeah I own Cadbury Creme Eggs calm and I guess I should use I do I should do something with it why do you don't want to sell it to Cadbury cream eggs why would give you a million bucks they got my email Mike alright here and I also will off throw-in fucktards org for free woo that's worth trying to hide it Pepsi is if you just google it it looks like vending machine oh good tryna know they search inspires you search instead it's Auto correcting for you incorrectly see that do the second thing there you go Brian red bands perhaps of ice challenge hoax is one of the funniest things i GN go click on that yeah and he did this in I want to say he did this in like 2004 and I can yeah that's what I was gonna say it was one of his best trolls that's beautiful yeah every day - he kept updating yeah it's Pepsi spice dot blog spot.com oh that's amazing it's 2004 yeah my friend he he gave me the idea for this book just an ass he invented bacon haze bacon salt all these bacon products and Taco Bell had a line of like tacos with bacon in it was like a special promotion so he made a taco out of bacon the shell was bacon like a week and he goes your move Taco Bell corporate meeting you know because this is on their big launch and they're just like thank you for your appreciation of bacon like they do know what to do that's crazy that how were they getting all that bacon that's what you really want to see this fucking warehouse full of tortured pay yeah I don't we got way off track here yep we're saying essentially before we got on to this crazy rant is that we need an updated form of government you know and we need an updated form of government with qualified people neil degrasse tyson had an amazing tweet the other day i think is really important he was talking about members of congress i believe it was and he was saying look at all these people in government and what what are their occupations lawyer' lawyer' lawyer' lawyer' he's like where are the engineers where the scientists where the math petition that's a that's a dangerous road because rest of what all communists said there was scientific it was scientific socialism and those engineers are the ones who regard human beings as factors to be thrown into equation and that's when you get the meat grinder Jesus Christ so you say in sciences fill meat grinders I'm saying when scientists try to become politicians they start looking stop looking human beings human beings and start looking at them as factors in the machine yeah it's very sick have you been paying attention to what's going on with Bill Nye scientists are all going after Bill Nye Nye the weimar guy the why Marv yeah which is why why mark Germany was right before Hitler was all decadent and like everyone's you know just completely loose and its culture liberal and he's having these dancers about talking about their vagina it's a white mark that was what was ridiculous it's not even a scientist and though he's not he's yeah it's he's a con man isn't he an engineer yeah but he's not as the climatologist he's not a scientist and he's also changing his tune there was a steven crowder did a bit about it where he showed the original show that he did many years ago where they talked about how gender is from chromosomes there's double X which is men and XY or women and XY which was men right and he's establishing like what causes your gender right and now he's completely gone off of that right and his new thing had this woman who belonged in some fucking Venice theatre group like Rey barking out at a poetry slam some unbelievably god-awful song and this motherfucker put it on Netflix on a science show about gender and he pretended to be like a DJ in the background like this is so not science right it's insulting progressivism is just Christianity without the root mythology so it's it's very much this kind of Christian ideal radical progressive is correct Jeff Angelica professed him specifically I don't mean someone with like believes in welfare I mean there's this ideology that he's fallen into yeah whoo it's a complete religion which has complete divorced from reality and stuff like this it's it's full left-wing I mean I think there's there's great ideas in being progressive there's some amazing ideas in terms of inclusiveness yeah it turns them yes live and listen letting people be whoever they want express yourselves in any way that you seemed see fit as long as it's not hurting other but that stuff is literally propaganda it's meant to be propaganda what is his show his show is yes it's not I think what he's doing is licking his finger finding out which way the wind is blowing and giving in to those people no I think he's a true believer because you have to be a true believer to put something like that out under your name I think this is a good idea it's just like it's like Christian rock I think it's debatable I honestly think that these people especially a guy like him who was experiencing life in the public eye fairly late in life right and you know and he when when it comes to people that are really enthusiastic about science and really enthusiastic about these ideas that he's trying to push on his show other than this janitor thing you're dealing with the great majority of him are liberal great majority and I'm sure he encounters a tremendous amount of pressure to be inclusive and gender is the hot topic when it comes to like weird science as it were like trying to figure out like how much of this is what people feel how much of this can be explained in genetics how much this can be explained with sociology how much of it is nature how much of it is nurturing it's a very complex - of human beings and we know for a fact that people very broadly yes we have but there's a wide spectrum of human behavior and likes and needs and feelings and and all sorts of weird dis Morpheus right we don't know why people behave the way they behave so for him to like boil it down like one of the shittiest rap songs the world has ever known right it's an insult but I think that's my point is that I think you have to kind of drank the kool-aid to be putting this out as your product maybe I'm less cynical than you I don't know that could be it I feel like you see been influenced by real well I think the people that are super progressive are far more likely to push these ideas in a very enthusiastic way yes then people who are more conservative in these matters doesn't even approach him about this right you know I feel like he's just been influenced by the influencers well he certainly is getting rewarded for it once you get rewarded for something your brain gets a feedback loop and it's China it's kind of cell validating so that could be it I can't speak here's the here's the challenge I always have two people who always talk about climate change if you can't name two types of clouds and what they look like you don't know enough about science and climate to open your mouth right and that's him I probably an exception he probably knows about clouds but I'm saying the average person who reads The New Yorker and they will tell you every scientist agrees about climate change you don't know the names of one scientist who would rise in climate change so shut the fuck up it's a mantra yeah it's a mantra that people say well this is a scientist degree go for it yeah it's I'm not disagreeing with it at all but I am agreeing with what you're saying I'm totally disagreeing with it because with climate change with this person with this perception of climate change because if we had a meteor coming toward the earth that is going to destroy our life we're not gonna be sitting here talking about North Korea we're talking about hey what about the meteor are they doing something with this fucking meteor right the climate change supposedly is going to decimate all civilization within a hundred years why are we talking about health care why are we talking about China and Trump spelling and his name no all you're gonna be talking about is the government's gonna be shut down until we have an answer to this and every politician who has children and grandchildren is going to like we gotta fucking get together and solve this problem and the fact that this isn't happening is telling me that there's more the story than we're being led to believe how so because the fact that we're talking about other things if this is really this imminent existential crisis how are we talking about anything else ever because it's imminent in terms of maybe 50 years thank you okay let's say I'm 49 how am I gonna I'm not gonna be here in 50 years you also think if a meteor is gonna hit America in the world in 50 years we wouldn't be doing everything possible immediately to stop it I think there are plenty of people that would just do coke and fly jets I'm not necessarily sure that they would ask to all of their energy to save people they're not even gonna be around to watch sure but I think there's certainly 90% of people in Congress a 90% of people in industry care enough about their children that this would be the only issue ever yes if they felt like it was absolutely rising and eminent I don't think they do I feel like 15 years is so far away you can't feel it I don't think that's true I I think for such when you get older when you get older you start thinking long term why is Trump back the way he accident' cuz he's Trump is one data point and he's I know but there's a lot of those lunatics with tremendous amount of resources that aren't thinking about the future he's rolling back the EPA regulations he's trying to fucking frack everywhere what he's doing is he's like he's the guy who's doing coke and flying the jet wow look how much opposition there is to him right yes so the point is if this was a real thing there wouldn't be opposition it would be complete unanimous unanimity well there's a lot of opposition because he is air quotes the 1% which means 99% are gonna be opposed to the behavior this one person who's got billions of dollars and also has the power to do all this crazy shit like rollback the EPA regulations like somehow another this fucking lunatic got into control of Environmental Protection Agency regulations I mean it's pretty fucking bizarre so that's why this guy's not doing anything he's that he is the radical thing that we're worried about but as you said earlier I think he's a good thing and that he's exposing how bizarrely flawed the system is that we are trying to patch up windows 1776 right that's really what we're doing 1789 1776 we had the artist Confederation 1789 was the formation in the United States was the Constitution so why do we always celebrate the spirit of 76 that the American war is over we were in desperation yeah the Commission yeah as far as I'm concerned that's it that's when it starts 89 is when the United States was officially found was that yeah but here's the thing if the Constitution was illegal you know they went in in the secret people talk about the founding fathers they went into Philadelphia secretly they said you're not allowed to throw out their ala confederation they look at each other girl were throwing the shit in the garbage right oh yeah yeah swore each other to secrecy which they did not have the power to do Martin Luther went out and told everyone goes you know this is a coup and it was it was illegal and everyone still champions them like their this was all this great great thing this was a complete coup and I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it was a coup in terms of like so who was in control back then you mean England no we had between England and and the Constitution with the Articles of Confederation so the founding fathers in that convention had the ability legally to edit the Kartika Confederation the first thing they were like yeah fuck this thing we're totally throwing out the window despite our mandate and and we're swearing each other to secrecy wow that's fascinating yeah well that's what we need what I mean that today I I need someone to fucking go this is ridiculous really for this whole thing I think that was the big percentage of the Trump vote was this shit's ridiculous yes I think you're right but now it's even more ridiculous which is weird well first of all a lot of people who were into the idea that America was gonna look after America and that we're all this foreign interventionism which is yes interrupting our lives and becoming a huge problem and then what does he do bomb Syria drops the molap bomb it starts ego he's over in Saudi Arabia right now holding on to a big glowing ball with some dude who's dressed like a wizard here's what I heard about Saudi Arabia and the Moab would you hear from Jim Norton no I don't remember who I want to say Alex Jones for comedic purposes those were two moves to show North Korea that he's not joking because the Syria thing went against everything he was saying the whole campaign Afghanistan where the fuck that come from and then the next week they're all saying we're not messing around with you North Korea the time for talk is over so that's one theory I heard that the Moab bomb was just to show that they're capable of dropping that and that they're willing to drop it but they just dropped in the middle of nowhere that's the people think about it if you're gonna show do a show of force when you just throw it in Afghan then rather indan peon yang yeah that is the move I guess it's so fascinating to me that we have nukes and we like to ask too much we're just gonna drop the biggest conventional bomb known to man we won't drop any nukes we're cool were cool but cool cool with that but if he just decided it that would be really fucked up if he just decided to drop a nuke on Isis if he knew that there was this place where Isis is and only Isis yeah there's 50,000 of them all concentrated in this one area and we just saw this fucking mushroom cloud like that one mushroom coming is classic ones from the 1950s when they did those nuclear Nevada Day yeah but if we saw one of those in the news over and for color from every angle you have the camera phones people from the space station filming the fucking yeah you could probably see that from space oh yeah for sure fuck yeah and you can see the wall China you can see that I think that's a myth isn't it yeah unfortunately I think you can see it from certain satellites round you can't see it from space it's like how high to get up right 400 miles probably but not like the Himawari eight yeah it's 22,000 miles yes that's these all about that one not me he did see space there rather from a jet I wonder like what would it would take for a Trump to want to drop a nuke in like a select location because I feel like if there's ever a president that be willing to drop a nuke in the right spot he'd be the guy you don't think they put a bullet in him first enough resistance I am currently you don't know who's around him though the Secret Service if he's gonna nuke Russia I can see them being like executive decision I'm shooting this guy cock damn that would be the end of their life though somewhat did them not necessarily it was someone shot the president because he was about to drop a nuke guarantee someone was shoot the guy who shot the president I unless there's some kind of protocol in place that if this guy goes completely nuts what do we do then you know what's really fucked me up ma'am house of cards oh yeah i watch that show the same thing I'm a comedic perspective II oh the new seasons coming out like next week yeah ain't great yeah just a masterpiece just finished we me and the missus watched the entire series divorced with four seasons right yeah of course a couple months oh wow fucking awesome if you haven't seen it ladies and gentlemen it's a masterpiece it's maybe one of the best shows ever on television and it gets it starts out you like it was pretty good and then it gets deeper and deeper and crazier and crazier and there's never what I call a cut the shit scene like in every show in season three when she's in Russian she feels bad for the gay kid that's a cut the shit this woman's a sociopath mmm okay she's not losing her control on power just to some gay Russian she knows the dude yeah yeah spoiler alert yeah I don't know I felt like that was as much political as it was anything else but they showed her really caring and I gotta do some no these people are murderers perhaps you're a bit cynical [Laughter] is he a boomerang thrower I thought it was like wrestling crocodiles and probably that bless everybody knows how to write yeah just chuck them I mean is there a technique to throw in a boomerang oh yeah of course right yeah because there was weapons to knock things out what was the idea was that you would throw it and then it would kind of come back at you if you missed right but which is funny cuz if you actually have good aim it's not coming back because it's rejection completely change but you're knocking things out of trees you're knocking birds out right I mean the great way to get a beehive off a tree I was that what they use them for I'm guessing I don't think it kind of makes sense all right what did I it's kind of an ingenious device when you think about what a boomerang thank you everyone you were a kid the first time you saw one or played with and you're like oh my god this is magic I may be only play with one once or twice on whole life when I was a kid I got had one and I couldn't get it to work but I got the kind of work and I'm like this is the this is the future yeah I was like this is a gay for his booth all due respect to my gay friends friends I like this just make any sense it was like a weapon one it wasn't for war that rose for hunting yeah I think so yeah it's like don't you guys know about the bow now hook you guys up lack of Birds over in Australia they didn't have enough feathers like what we do with these sticks but what about the kookaburra what about the kookaburra what's a kookaburra it's their big bird that's always laughing bah bah emus right don't they have feathers are you most of us one of them is in Australia there's the ostrich the EMU in the rear I guess the emos are huge feathers yeah you feel like they could be trimmed down for fletchings oh yeah didn't know any better did you see that recent thing where they said that the most the they've found that the earliest Australians the earliest indigenous people landed in Australia if that's 50 thousand years ago which is fucking incredible oh yeah how the hell they get there fifty thousand years ago well I mean didn't they any same thing with like Siberia and the Bering Strait right getting to America that's the question was there some sort of a landmass that connected them to somewhere else like 2,000 years ago I mean they're essentially an isolated continent right right nothing's closed unless you have those archipelago so here's the linen halfway Nagini well those people especially the South Pacific people were incredibly daring in their journeys out to sea thousands and thousands of years ago nice dugout canoes and these boats that they would construct and they were just fucking get out in the ocean like let's see what happens they must have been having really bad marriages to be fucking get in this boat bitch I'm going west I don't care if this land I'm not staying here with you yeah well what what makes a person get into a boat thousands of years ago and looking out into the ocean go I'm gonna take a chance and the funny thing is we think that they're brave but maybe they're just really dumb and like a bad directions right who knows who knows what causes someone to want to do and then you get to a continent near like what the fuck do I do now I guess this is my house now well how about what they did with Hawaii I mean they essentially found a fucking volcano I just got lucky yeah yeah volcano popping out of the middle of the ocean yeah we lucked out though yeah why fuck yeah they did and then there's the people don't like out someone very few bugs no predators oh I do I thought there's huge bugs it's not I don't think so they don't have snakes I know that they don't have snakes I mean maybe they have some bugs but you rarely see legs maybe they see spiders and shit the problem with Australia excuse me the problem with them Hawaii is that a lot of the stuff that they have over there came from somewhere else right tremendous them things like birds and like they were stowaways on boats and shed spam yeah pigs dogs in general like with wild pigs and deer all these weird deer axis deer from Asia they just recently had to save the the giant parrot the kakapo in near Australia because they were like 100 left because the rat because they had no defenses they can't fly and the rats were eating them also they found they found all of them move them to different island kill the rats and brought them back and they're there being safe oh wow they're really cool well they've had a bunch of crazy experiments in Australia with the Toad's toads and then with bringing in cats and then they have feral cats and yeah they kill all the ground nesting birds foxes to kill the cats and cats are nasty like they kill all they do is kill birds and kill like rodents and small animals and they're just vicious and we think is they're cute and you've played with their belly but they are killing machines well they're cute if you raise them yeah have them at home and you domesticate them and you give them nothing but cat food and you'll Pat them all the time and they purr right they don't have any desire to go out there and eat and rape yeah all cats sex is rape well that's what you like look at it they will they have barbed dicks right yeah they seal her up and then if you keep on if the male cat sees the female with the litter he kills the litter so she'll get ovulation yeah yeah that's super common in the animal yeah unfortunately yeah in the bear world it's even worse they eat them do they really yeah bears are almost 100 percent cannibals oh wow yeah the for the male bears eat all the Cubs it's like the best way it's it's so counterintuitive but the best way to ensure a healthy population of bears is to kill the males Wow yeah you have to kill the old boars you go the like that's one of the reasons why they actually encourage especially with black bears black bear hunting is encouraged it's also like really important because one of the main things they eat is fawns like if you want to write have healthy moose populations and deer populations but yeah I was there in Alberta when a friend of mine actually saw a bear kill a cub and chased the mother away killed the cub and then the mother came back and finished the cub off she ate it herself it's a dark world yeah in the woods you think North Korea's rough I mean a fucking bear well my life I might my first job was writing for an Aquarian magazine so I've been obsessed with animals since I was a kid aquariums yeah that was my thing back in the day oh man I always wanted to have a massive saltwater like oh it was your best thing ever and I had all these circle attention oh no no I had the kind of fish I had with my friend called God's mistakes because they all look like monsters so that's the kind of shit I what did you have there's something called a big eye there's something called a cowfish which can't it's encased in armor and can't move and a soap fish which releases a cloud of poison when it's upset and an anglerfish which also doesn't move at a slipper I mean you pull up these things there they all look like aliens they're amazing yeah so it was really kind of fun yeah it's just I electric catfish is an electric calf and when they shock you you feel in your balls I touched the electric eel one fish yes I did if you touch an electric eel you're gonna get fucked up those things are no joke no they're not that bad electric eel can kill you hello how big was it there's big enough for me to grab I mean we did a fear factor was one of us done but you have to do it in one hand you can't do with both hands or else they'll go through your heart remember well yes you I remember this fear factor so I'm like holy shit where they get these electric eels from and the thing is they have to do with one hand or else it makes a circuit if you using both hands maybe slipper Lobster but what I do remember is it sucked like I definitely grabbed it yeah it's no joke it's amazing that a small animal can give you such a charge like that and it does it with its body right the hole the anus is right by the mouth so the whole thing is electricity yeah it's like oh that's why it's electric yeah mouth is right by its asshole it's all fucking confused that's crazy-looking what is that called a slipper lobster slip so what you have lobster tail it's not instead of claws they have face flaps with two hinges what yeah if you look at the top you see that one hinge another yeah there's one the hinges goes up and down the other goes left and right and oh my god so it's like the predator yeah it's really cool do they have one with its mouth open the mouth underneath I mean did it mean where where it's exposed where it's like grabbing something you'd have to be up no say you won't see it cuz when I would feed it it would grab it and put it like in your way Wow yeah yeah yeah and pull up bones pri ste GE NYS I didn't know until like two years ago what cuttlefish and octopus could do my friend Remy he used to have this show called apex predator where he would study these predators and try to figure out like what strategy I used for catching their prey and one of the things that he studied was octopus yeah and he came on octopi and he was like dude they're from another planet oh yeah there's smartest cats yeah they're very smart very smart super smart and they can not just change the way they look but change their texture right and they fit in perfectly with their environment yes he showed us some videos and I'm like how am i 48 years old and not knowing about this they're absolutely and the ones at the bottom to see even crazier yeah then you have the zebra octopus which is a mimic and the question you have for a philosophy person is is it consciously trying to look like something else or did it evolve coincidentally look like cuz they look like flounders and then squids and then line fish and mantis shrimp and like some of these forms wouldn't be advantageous like why would you want to look like a flounder right but it just changes from shape to shape just very quickly well not only that like how does it know what the environment looks like a point where it could changes does it know what it looks like it doesn't have a mirror and that's the other thing they put them on top of a checkerboard to sense they can image imitate and alienate they don't know what to do yeah yeah yeah well they can they can imitate all sorts of different surfaces coral and all sorts of different crazy things and it's and what they'll do is they'll release their cloud of ink and then won't move but they'll just change shape so it looks like they vanished yeah like a supervillain yeah yeah well they think that that's like there was one speculation that that blast of ink that they shoot out is almost like the like correction fluid like whiteout like doesn't that's not what I meant like oh yeah that they do it to each other like to like to stop conversations huh and that part of what they're doing when they're changing their body is like a visual form of communication that way they definitely do like they like chameleons also chameleons don't always change color for evolution they'll do for protection they'll become red to show anger yeah and its mood like a lot of fish I've had change color based on mood to communicate it's fascinating mood fish our mood rings well it's good because some fish when they are the waters dirty they'll be a different color so you'll know it's time for water change the cowfish did that oh when they look sick yeah no they just get darker Oh just not good it's just duskier it's like all right I need to make him lemonade colored again oh wow yeah I thought that when they put an octopus on a checkerboard it did mimic the checkerboard no it couldn't figure it couldn't get it right see if you can find that that was confusing to me they did there was something similar to that maybe some sort of a stripe and then it mimicked the stripes thick I think they can do but the checker boards are problem if I remember correctly what crisp oh the best one is the flamboyant cuttlefish that just discovered it's two inches long it walks but it's colored like a it's like an acid trip and they're just fascinating like flamboyant official name flamboyant cuttlefish yeah isn't it true that they've only they've only researched like 10% of the ocean floor oh yeah it's instant that's I mean that's what my friend came up with the name God's mistakes because God made some fish he's like what well no one's gonna see that they're just throw at the bottom of the ocean because they all look like monsters and I my theory is because there's no light down there that things like visuals which are based on mathematics don't apply so it's okay that they're hideous cuz no one's gonna be seeing them what about bioluminescent fish though and phosphorescent ones yeah there's weird ones that they create their own light bulbs they all they almost all have them and there's one which uses red light because others can't see red and they use them like searchlights oh yeah there's so much crazy shit at the bottom to see it's so fascinating I mean if we found what's really fascinating to me is if we found any of this stuff in space we'd be freaking out this is why I never could like Star Trek because it drove me crazy as an autistic young boy are you autistic IV for this purpose I am that I would know all these zoological animals that look like insane things you know walking back fish we can't swim and then I turn on Star Trek it's another planet and it's a guy with fucking blue skin you I can get blue skin show me something that's not based on the human form you fucking ass bitch all right so the job here it is here's an octopus the Jabba the Hutt scene was what blew my mind of the kid because they look like aliens well my favorite one was that stupid lizard guy that Captain Kirk had a fight with oh god I remember that one oh I never watched Star Trek for this reason I'm not even joking it's so bad okay so here's the cuttlefish he's on the ground and there's a like a sandy bottom and he kind of looks like the sandy bottom and then they put this the beginning it took it off so good switchback see the best it did was that little block Wow that's still pretty impressive if you fucking close you do its best but how did it know well I think the eyes are in the side so they're looking in all directions at once like a rabbit but how's it know to make a square right what the fuck look it's doing it right there it's kind of doing all this shit that's creepy Wow Wow Jesus Christ there look a flamboyant cuttlefish you got to see this shit it's toxic as hell to these animals I mean what caused them to evolve like this and they've been around forever forever and they also very short lifespans yeah so it's not even working what keeps you alive it's not the reflects not the water it's making it look like there's a wave of skin look at those eyes too right it's a clock they're they're all they're the first ones they found that walk it looks like a tiny water hippo stuff is that lady she's cute just once isn't what everyone know she's cute look at that thing my girls are not amazing that is amazing and I think that's if not it gets in it to be hypnotic licky break up the oh look at that oh yeah yeah you look at it and it shoots this fucking alien thing like like the Ridley Scott a Leah yeah yeah and jabs at fish Pelican a man okay like if we found that on Jupiter variety goes right we'd be freaking out it's 2 inches you're like what the fuck is this yeah I mean if this was anywhere if they found this you know and pick up pick a planet in our solar system we would be so obsessed with it but the fact that it's in the ocean like yeah it's right over there who gives a fuck they just found it pretty recently tooth really yeah I think in the 90s there was a website that was dedicated to a bunch of animals that were uncovered during one of the tsunamis I think it was the big tsunami that hit was it Vietnam or Thailand Oh was it somewhere yeah but there were they I think now that I'm saying this I feel like it was debunked like someone said no that's not where they came from but it was a series of super bizarre animals that were found super bizarre fish there any found at the bottom of the ocean that literally looked like they came from another world look up there's something called a mouse trap fish where it's now is like a mousetrap it's hinged and it works like a mousetrap well how about the angler fish she's got a fishing pole hanging off his fucking head well I had there's a bunch of different kinds of angler fishes and the best there's one called the clown angler fish which has warts all over it and they're very brightly colored and they're this they get a there's like a Jamie this one I'm sorry tritium too many things just one thing this is the one will blow your fucking mind the football fish and what's amazing about them is the females are like a yard but the males are 2 inches long and the male's attach to the females and lose their sense of identity and become sperm glands Oh like regular dudes that's amazing yeah so they couldn't figure out where the males were for a long time the females had just these growths on them and they were Mills they were the males yeah but he's tricking backward ish with that yeah but there's one with he dangled it yeah she dangles that's as a female so she dangles in yeah that's look at that they dangle it over there and then the mouth those are the anglers go back to me the name that's the fellow fry California day that's the family the family of angler fish there's a bunch of families of them look at that thing god there's so many of them how many angler fish are there oh there's look at the one the tank go to that one that one that one they have one in display look at that what a creep yeah I mean that doesn't even look a real thing right Wow isn't it amazing look at that one but that one's bioluminescent yeah you can see with the spots are wow that's beautiful yeah and they can't keep them in a crayon what is that called it's a landing flip ball fish go back to sub what do you get a TD over there amazing look at that thing oh yeah the colors in that thing and it looks like it's bolted together oh yeah it looks like patchwork like some sort of an animated movie there there the deep sea is my favorite kind of stuff with all this just crazy shit it but what's the most underappreciated and overlooked go to that one that's up right above that Jamie the one yeah right there what is that one whoa yeah they're all do you want to see something really good man that's that does not look real yeah kaha these things are amazing look up red-lipped walking batfish because there's one that's a relative of this that wears lipstick walking bad little walking back fish Wow why in the fuck is that thing they can't swim so they yeah whoa and they have a nose and out of the nose is where the angle comes from yeah that's my favorite fish look at that shit oh my god leave the lips yeah Wow is that amazing yeah they're very hard to keep in captivity of the species cuz they always have parasites oh is that why yeah why can't they keep great whites in captivity the great whites are extremely sensitive to electric impulses in the water so they keep banging their heads against the wall plus they're pelagic which means they live in the ocean where there's nothing around them so they're not used to any barriers so this really fucks them up they need to be able to go full-speed for miles at a time oh wow yeah that's interesting they got whale sharks in captivity they have Georgia and they've got three in Georgia in Atlanta how big is the tank it's Jake it's like the biggest tank in the world or second-biggest yeah the glass was like two feet thick something crazy just seems stupid to keep them because go go see them in the ocean man Philippines for them the great quad then watching on video it just seemed too fucked up to me to keep those things in captivity doesn't make any same do they yeah I guess yeah they're awesome great if you could talk to them you know probably like prisoners like super bummed out it's just like North Korea but for fish why just have a joke about that about like someone like saying like hey man you know things who's that went to the zoo I saw these chimps playing with a rope and they look at they having a good time I go yeah go to prison you watch dudes playing basketball doesn't mean it's awesome right right specially with the high rappers that are intelligent yeah yeah like people have pets where birds I don't I'm a big pet person but the bird wants to be flying around yeah like when they clip their wings now you don't need these yeah I need to keep you around yeah the only thing that makes you special and I want you to say hello I clip your wings yeah it is I don't know we're weird we're weird with our dominance over other animals yeah but I mean I guess every animal that has control over other animals is weird like if you've seen that thing about dolphins they take puffer fish and they get high with them oh yeah yeah pass them around what are killer whales they kill babies for funding oh yeah they have a good time there's sick well yeah well dolphins do that exact same thing you were talking about the cats do where they kill off the the the young to make the female breed because a female dolphin won't go into breeding I think it's like six or seven years while I was raising the kid okay yeah so one of the things that females do to mitigate this is they fuck as many males as they can because they obviously they don't have Maury Povich and DNA tests in the ocean so they fuck is there like extremely promiscuous and the idea behind and if they fuck enough of these males the guy will have no idea whose baby it is so think it's his baby wow I fucked you that might be my kid all right am I gonna eat them my knowledge of the sea is just limited to fish so once again some apples I'm left have kind of a C student but you're a sea dork like you really love it I'm a zoology dork all different kinds of species yeah I can rattle off things all day like every what do you think about the Tasmanian tiger do you think that thing's alive that they they're thinking of trying to clone it back because they have ones in formaldehyde do they yeah so it died out in the 20s I believe I think it's somewhere around there and because we have video of it yes someone in captivity and they are thinking of trying to clone it and bring it back I didn't know that there it is right there Silas it's the only animal that can open its mouth to like 120 degrees or something well they think that they might have a few of them still in the wild because Australia is essentially the size of the contiguous United States but with the same amount of people as Los Angeles right and they think that it might be possible because there's been seven sightings at these things but then you gotta think there's several sightings Bigfoot right I love cryptozoology it's it's just absolutely fascinating cuz it even the coloration looks like the okapi which is the giraffes closest relative and they thought that was fake and then they found one yeah another ensues yeah but do you think that that thing is I mean there's enough sightings where they're starting to actively consider there was a a movie with what the fuck Willem Dafoe may have several years ago or someone had hired him to go and shoot a tasmanian tiger that they knew where one was and that somebody wanted it to stuff it or something like that well I mean they there was this species of insect on st. Helena Island I think it was where they thought is extinct that they found a bush there had 13 of them and now they bred them there's like thousands so if they found one it would be great because they'd be able to breed them to huge numbers pretty quickly also it's like one of the last predators other than like saltwater crocodiles right in Australia yeah the dingo is no joke they've been taking out a lot of stuff they haven't dingo offense for that reason yeah yeah it's Australia's a really weird place man somebody's mine were just over there they were hunting water buffaloes oh those Asian water bottles they're huge huge and also an invasive species yeah so these things come over and they just destroy the water like anything else that like yuck yeah mm plus yeah yes yeah and they just shit everywhere and ruin all the water sources so all these birds all these different animals that need that water all getting fucked up and dying did you ever see one when it took out the line I did see something like that recently yeah yeah where there's like it was a cape buffalo yeah yeah it's just amazing so like kill it just swings it said the lion goes flying like 20 feet have you ever seen the documentary relentless enemies no it's that it's so good because it's about these lines that adapted to only eat water buffalo what happened was they had a change in the current of the river changing the course of a river and it isolated this one island of lions and they only had two things to eat and one of the things was cape buffalo which are fucking enormous so these Lions became freakish mutant lions enormous lions like their average female as the size of an average male issue in Africa but Google relentless enemies Giant Killer lions because the females don't even look real they look like Hulk lions they're fucking jack this is another reason I'm very skeptical about this climate change stuff because nature is far more adaptable than we give her credit for you mean climate change not like the doom and gloom yeah like if the temperatures of one degree that the corals can't handle it I don't buy it we'll move to Canada I love Canada I love drama see if you get these are those cheese ones going after but see if you can get an image of some of the Lions from relentless enemies because they're just get you just google it because go and look don't just keep popping these up on the screen because there's some of them if you go and look and find it you can find ones that are just jacked that's relentless enemies yeah but see if you can find like a good image of the line right next to it that one yeah that one know something I know there's some really good ones there's some really good ones where they look freakish there's a good look at the size of that fucker like that is so much bigger than the average female lion that's great it's because they're all they're eating is these Cape Buffalo's he's fucking enormous Buffalo's so they've grown to like 600 pounds for the average female lion yeah they're much bigger oh my god did a huge there they look so huge didn't even look real and they still even this big they have to gang up yeah yeah of course jump on their back and one of them jumps on the leg and I mean it's just but the documentaries amazing and interestingly enough there's several prides of lion on this one island and they're not all that big it's just one pride is that big the other prides are like fairly normal size but one pride has it's just freakishly large species of lion you know I ran through a lot of scenarios but what we're gonna be talking today and this was not one of them that's why I know we're gonna talk for sure about North Korea but I didn't know we're gonna talk about giant lions or psychedelic cuttlefish yeah flamboyant cuttlefish what a perfect name yeah yeah why do they always usually is fucking Latin names because that way and this happens with when you inter Aquarians if I'm sending you something from England to America or England to Cambodia you know we're speaking exact same species because what you might call a gray parrot is not the same as what I would call a great parent right that makes sense that's interesting lovely chose a dead language well that way it's universal right that makes sense why not just use English since we kick ass because this world American I'm sorry this America we gotta buy England and this just take over that that name of the language I keep calling it English like enough already you guys can see it right you guys speak wrong and you spelled tires wrong too I really think that they've evolved that accent to come off as smarter than they really are I think Americans are smarter than British people and it's a big lie that's a vicious that's rude you're racist against through the British yes oh they're all ugly so oh how dare you have not you not seen sporty spice she's a hot one what is it boy he's pretty hot she's American I decided American but the thing is it's when you hear British people talk you think they're smart and you talk to them like you're not that fucking smart you just have to said accent Guy Ritchie's really fuckin smart well he's one data point Madonna you're trolling I see where you doing wait wait you wait usually a lot of people from America and English do you think English people are generally smarter than Americans I think that people vary widely okay but you can still learn a lot of really dumb American people of course a lot of really dumb American b-but I think there's a lot of really dumb British people I'm sure yeah I'm sure I never met him everyone I'm at as a genius from England everyone all of them oh yeah Guy Ritchie and sporty smiles okay my work here is that sport okay guy Ritchie well you hit me Madonna she's a genius listen her Madonna's English now yeah gave him we gave her away I mean the idea that you can with a straight face just put make up a British accent you know you gotta realize the kind of dick that Guy Ritchie was slinging he fucked her up so bad that she doesn't work anymore and she speaks English she barely even saying that is that is dignified if I've ever seen it he's just laying that fucking Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels dick are they are they they're divorced though right yeah yeah yeah but she still fucked up from she really fucked up he's recovered greatly but she's being she's she's still like real and she's a mess she's got like those Tweety birds for the universal thing for some fucked up birds in circled it how did we know what they meant like someone got clocked over the head with a frying pan and we'd see those birds but I think she's got a mix of those birds and cuckoo clocks yeah well it's gotta be hard man when you're like a sex symbol for women it's like there's this weird phase that women go through which is very disturbing everyone except Christie Brinkley who I'd still fuck sorry sorry I couldn't no disrespect she's like in her 60s right he's still hot but every other woman who was like really hot when she was in our 20s they get to a certain age and either they let it go like Meryl Streep and just accept and age gracefully or they start shooting a bunch of shit in my face and they get real weird-looking right or they just become like a monster and so they go from being extremely desirable to repulsive the uncanny valley well the uncanny valley deals with software but it no it deals with like when robots look too close to human beings it's repulsive right so it's like artificial intelligence with no artificial virtual reality right right point is someone has to look like a person but not too much like a person was this creepy so they become like you look human almost right so then it becomes very repellent yeah that's what's that's what's TWiki about we went to Nvidia a few years back when I was doing this sci-fi show and this was I want to say 2012 or 13 where they were just getting good at this virtual reality software and the reproduction of the human body but they couldn't get eyelashes down right Oh like blinking it was weird like the bland so you'd watch this guy like that's me there was something weird about the blinking like he's trying to give me a message it's like Morse code fucking bizarre like wasn't there some Vietnam hostage American POWs blinking SOS oh yeah what was that I think that's what I think it was that pow2 three one two three yeah do they want to say yeah they'd probably kill them yeah they I mean the Americans of the Koreans head hostage did similar shit and they got tortured beyond belief well that was something I was reading about China about how many CIA operatives in China have been killed over the last two years like eighteen is that oh my god yeah eighteen different informants have been killed or jailed over the last couple of years and they were complaining we can we can fucking spy on them anymore it's like hey would like they don't want you spying yeah like to get it yeah but with the way we look at it like we're allowed to spy like you can't be killing people that area is yeah so they're interviewing him here can you hear it yeah yeah there's something entirely terrifying about watching someone who's a prisoner of war oh yeah so when john mccain has these like racist quotes sometimes oh yeah it's like you know what you get a pass you can even you you're fine you can't lift your hands over your head you're yeah you do whatever you say whatever you want you've earned it yeah he how does he get dressed like he can only do this yeah that's cuz they broke his arm daily yeah like his shoulders I think they pulled him and then kind of had him hanging by his wrist I believe if it's just and they still have and you know you can't ties tying all this stuff it's like you know you can say you can use slurs that's fine using cleaner I think for him you know so it's just like yeah get him some stem cells fix that shit my mom listen to this shit my mom god bless her heart started taking stem cells by which it was plant stems in a pill form and I'm just like I just what do you say to that what does she think it was gonna do to her well I mean stem cells are good for your energy knows what you say I don't even fucking know at that point you're just like okay mom well they are steady so they are yeah loopholes go yeah you're gonna live forever yeah I wonder like if John McCain's ever tried to do anything about his shoulders or if it's just like fuck it I'm sure he did I mean I wonder this is decades at this point he's a fascinating character yeah he's a grumpy old dude and sometimes makes a whole lot of sense and a lot of people like totally down for him being president and all suddenly a Sarah Palin running with him and you what are you doing man yeah like what the fuck is going on that sort of unveiled like the the machinery behind all the Republicans in like what what do you think America is like you think America is like some sort of weird reality show some honey booboo type shit or this lady it should be one heartbeat away from being a fucking president well when she came out she had when she was nominated she had the highest approval rating of any governor in America and her first couple of speeches everyone's like oh yeah this lady's a ballbuster and then that interview hit and you're like holy shit she doesn't read she's she's she's good like learning-disabled yeah well I don't know if she's learned to say but I just don't think she's interested in learning I read her book and it was really interesting or you read her book why there's only so many hours in a day all right so many days in a week this many years in your life if I can read North Korean propaganda I could read this and there's this one part in the book where I'm like her ghostwriter should be fired because she her daughter willow whatever goes to her mommy why don't you ever cry and I'm like if this is a murder mystery that's how you know she's a sociopath yeah and it's in the book I'm like holy shit that's terrifying mommy's too dumb to cry I don't I think this mommy's just to understand sadness mommy it's just skin over wires and circuitry oh man see I didn't see that I just saw as being adored well it came out I think she there's just like with George W Bush remember the first 2000 he won those debates against gore or at least held his own and then there was just declined to the point where he's not even speak English well do you remember when George Bush was running for governor Texas no I don't I mean I wouldn't have noticed that up from New York well the reason why I remember is because they showed the stark contrast between his ability to communicate while he's running for governor versus his ability to communicate once it became president I felt like he was almost like a guy who had all his responsibilities taken away from him and he just like atrophied yeah like Dick he was kind of running the show and he was just sitting back fucking up lines and and making mistakes with things but if you watch the speeches that he gave I hear it will play this I think that the mission in education ought to be excellence in literature and math science and social science if school districts want to enrich beyond that more power to them but it's a different person he gets better on four subject matters and see if we can do it right we ought to determine the cost per pupil necessary to achieve excellence in the classroom and we ought to fund it the funding priority of the state of Texas ought to be the schoolchildren of our state and it has not been under the past four years the state share of Education has decreased to forty-four percent that is why we have property taxes on the rise in nearly every single school district in the state of shit amazing define the mission determine the cost per pupil necessary from will be the holy shit amazing then compare George Bush 10 years ago to George Bush today now so that in the video it says this listen to him now about 35% since I've been the president secondly we first of all I agree with my opponent that the facing this country is their weapons of mass destruction the hands of the terrorist network yeah he was clear and concise but he was also a younger man you have to realize like this is an older man he's tired and the the grind of being the president for four years was wearing on him so hard when he was running against Kerry there I mean he was just a beaten man I just think that job is just unbelievably dreaming like some sort of a psychic vampire just locks on you in saps you of all your fucking mitochondria well he doesn't have an excuse because his dad was president so he would have known what it's like maybe his dad was only president for four years only I mean come on that's not gonna be a short four years yeah and his dad was the head of the CIA before that so his dad was maybe more deeply entrenched in the ideas of politics than he was yeah I met his uncle I went to Yale with a friend of mine who's doing a master's T and that guy I was ready to go out come out swinging I thought I was gonna be a troll that guy charmed the fucking pants off me no bush I don't like holy shit I can see why these people are in power one on one they are so charming well when JEB was running for president I almost felt like he was throwing in the towel I felt like he was like I'm gonna go through the motions and fuck some of this up and just like Rick Perry when Rick Perry was like and then there's something I forgot yeah remember that what about did you see jeb Bush's tweet when he was swinging when he quit he said sorry mom that was his tweet jabot tweeted this out yes his mom's ROI secretly happy well she did wanted to run Barbara she said that publicly before he announced yes she's like enough to to is enough yeah well it's a monarchy yeah what's also crazy I mean why would he want to do it right who the hell knows Ludovic um why does anybody want to do it but he seemed to be like the least qualified Jack album well trumps the least qualified but no I mean of the bushes oh yeah yeah as far as his ability to communicate he was like the worst of know so Jeb in 1996 I think it was he ran for re-election against this guy I forget his name Baylor Ben something and they were tied and then they had a debate and Jeb crushed him so bad that he ended up winning by double digits the guy who beat Janet Reno in the primaries it was Bill McBride I think is his name this was for Florida yeah when he was re-elected governor Florida so he was a beast get back in the day yeah and then you have these debates and he's standing there you know I mean it was it was hilarious - I think you just didn't want to do it the thing is like I don't think fast I don't think any of them have ever known what to do with a Trump figure especially he's leading them and the guys when Trump's on stage saying this guy is a realistic guy he said he was gonna pull down his pants and moon everyone and Jeb's like what do you say to that this is that what Trump said yes you know it would be really fascinating if alec baldwin ran against trump you think he's gonna run no I don't know but it would be fascinating because there's a guy who not only did Trump on silent live but is more than capable of holding his own and that kind of a fisticuff sort of a debate I give insults of being thrown back and forth on that kind of night otis agree because you remember when alec baldwin lost his shit in that reporter and called him a fag and all this other stuff lemonis so alley wasn't that guy a paparazzi fine the point is he said was taking pictures of his family he's got he's got thin skin and that's not in those those debates trump knows how to swing prep italic palms never been in the debate the point is if alec baldwin loses his shit he's trying to present himself as the same calm alternative to this lunatic so if they're most sane they're both fucking lunatics was was Baldwin's advantage better looking not nearly as power-hungry not a billionaire oligarch type I don't think anyone thought Trump was power-hungry that wasn't the knock against him hmm but they definitely thought it was money hungry well yeah but like Ted Cruz came off as much more power hungry I think that Trump did well the Ted Cruz was kind of sunk by those weird commercial out clips we the outtakes we got to see them redo it uh yeah remember when he said to his mom because my mother played prays for me for an hour every day and she's like there was awkward hugs and they had a redo take that's like my favorite thing during the primer is was Ted Cruz's regard is like the best debater in Washington right is he yeah they all respect him that he was like it has this long debate history from wars at Harvard Yale where he went to and this guy could practice for a hundred years with a hundred different fake opponents and in that time no one would ever think of throwing at him your dad shot JFK killers oh that's the green frog approach yes sad that's that's the green frog effect yes it's one of trolls I started calling Hillary America's mother-in-law and that caught on a bit and that's how you have to take down these people is not through their ideas but just kind of take their strengths and turn them into weaknesses that's all Harris I remember there was a real clear moment during the campaign where Ted Cruz had not yet stepped away you know not not yet resigned but there was he was at a speech and somehow or another some Trump supporter was in the front row wearing sunglasses telling him to quit and calling him lyin Ted yeah yeah I'm saying you've already lost when he gonna quit he was trying to engage this is outside yeah and I was like oh this guy's fucked yep he doesn't know how to deal with like a real person what about what he had Fiorina as his running mate and she falls off the stage at their announcement it was like this Curb Your Enthusiasm moment it was amazing how is this ever gonna turn around like what what do you anticipate happening my whole 2020 my hope is that the gears of government are going to be increasingly shut down that political communication becomes impossible and we start breaking this stuff apart that's my goal but don't you don't think it'll take like forever to come up with some new sort of structure to run this I don't think we need a single country I don't think we need a structure I think a lot of the structures in place that most of the interaction you have between humans is already there with structure we didn't have any structure here for me to get here right so I don't think we're gonna need much replacing right but but there's no way that the people that are in the positions of power right now whether there be senators Republican Congressmen Republicans Democrats whoever the fuck it is no way they're just gonna accept the fact that this structure doesn't exist incorrect so the way to do that is technology and here's here's an example I always use like let's suppose it's 1980 right and me and you are technologically advanced humans have walked on the moon you know we have mobile phones so on and so forth and you and I are having an argument about censorship and you're saying we need to censor some things mine Kampf child pornography I'm like we have to have free speech and Jamie appears from 2017 and he goes you guys are wasting your time because soon you will be able to copy any book with one button and with one button you can send it anywhere on earth at the speed of light how much does it cost it's free and if you have to have a magic word so other people can't read this book so censorship is technically impossible you would you would both look at him like he's crazy but that's what's happened yeah so technology is increasingly binding the hands of government when we were kids the idea that Apple would Apple didn't exist then maybe but the Apple would tell the government we're making a lock on our phones that even we can't open because we understand that you are the problem that would have been unthinkable and now we have corporations openly defying the state because they realize that they're often the enemy you know and that's wonderful uber look overs whole model is we're gonna we're gonna ask for forgiveness not permission we're gonna break the law until you guys say it's illegal we're not gonna have licensing it's great and we're gonna become entrenched in the city until you know then you can't get us out and then someone like lyft comes along and says well they're doing it but they're not doing it right right yeah yeah and then that's the spirit of competition yes yes it's a beautiful thing I just wonder how that applies to government well because if the government's hands are tied just like with religions then people are going to negotiate through peace just like we do now like I mean if you have a problem with Macy's you either return the sweater you take the loss but it's it's fine but how does that play out though in like a real-life scenario I I think what's going to have to happen is just like with books and books you know can go anywhere earth the speed of light once you have people being able to move very quickly from place to place they're going to stop becoming effectively the property of whatever country they happen to be in because right now we have things divided by geography but if you have your we have a landline technology when it comes to government as in a cell phone world or even a beyond cell phone world if you had it where I'm the government or whatever cell phone provider I have that would carry with me if I'm in Taiwan or Russia or the United States as opposed to when I'm in the between these two oceans it's US law when I'm in between these two oceans is British law that's fascinating so do you think that in the future we'll see like a dissolving of borders yes the ability to travel back that I think a lot of people support that that's already started happening yeah it's I mean the idea like right now I could go any country on earth including North Korea right now I mean this Trump thing that got him elected one of the things was build that wall build that wall this do you think that this is like a retro idea or an idea of like almost like a longing for nostalgia like a pushing back against technology notions progress I think it's the pushing forward for the idea of self segregation and the idea that you should surround yourself with people that you choose as opposed to people that you are forced to surround yourself with and that people are pack animals and I shouldn't have to the idea that me and my neighbors in my building are going to sit down and make a consensus is bullshit I want to sit with my friends and make a consensus right but that's but you're talking about the whole entire United States though the building the wall between us and Mexico but the point is to me that they're just wanted to keep out the unfortunate people well they also want to keep themselves as a cohesive whole right so they want to maintain this idea of Americanist whereas they're being told that American this means everyone on earth can come here mmm well they're not saying that they're just saying I mean no one's really saying that anybody can come here a lot of people I mean if you're gonna what I've never heard any criteria for saying we can't let this group in there's always some reason for letting each and every group in and if there's never a reason to say no well the the rational filter would be we don't want anyone in here that has an extensive violent criminal history right or I mean it could be level of education levels a vacation of education rather someone who wants to come to this country like this is a country of immigrants this is a country where people try to do better right the if you're coming here from somewhere else and you want to come to America well you would you would be coming here because you want to do better you want to elevate yourself or elevate your family or give your children an opportunity to be educated in the way that you weren't sure that's kind of what this is founded on that way was founded on it's what's become it certainly wasn't founded on the idea of a country of immigrants the founding fathers weren't like yeah yeah immigrants my hero Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant I'm an immigrant but certainly I mean there's plenty of reasons to have criterion for why people are let it just because it but how do you define the immigrant just because like if I'm in a war-torn country Helen I want to go to America because it's going to be better for me and my family a hundred percent that's understandable that doesn't mean that I'm bringing something to the table to America not always right well I mean you can't say that even about someone who comes from a thriving economy like 1% to come over from England as I said earlier and they're ugly ugly losers so maybe we should have a looks contest right from there's 6 or 6 or above Oh 6 yeah how do you fit you feel you're 6 III think I'm above a six you don't think so where you are maybe we're in like Holland the men are all giant and handsome I think you might not be a six well good thing I'm not in Holland Sweden B stores the president please new Colin if I'll make them bigger though yeah 20 feet tall but the yeah right they'll grow God so like there's lions yeah exactly under pressure right but I mean but going back to the immigrant thing I mean this entire this country essentially everyone who is here who's not Native American at one point in time was an immigrant sure but I mean there's different types of immigrants as the immigrants who try to assimilate and there's immigrants who don't assimilate and just because we've done stuff simulator I don't see anybody walking around with buckskin on wearing feathers I mean there's no one assimilated from Europe what do you mean I've assimilated well sort of but I mean there were people that came here originally people that came here if you're gonna assimilate you're gonna assimilate with the Native Americans no one did that sure they conquered them you could say that yeah any it was more like genocide than conquering would you Jenna isn't genocide just when you conquer really well well yeah and a lot of it is unfortunately because of disease well it's also the fact I mean the idea that it's genocide I mean these Native Americans were tough cookies I mean these were not these like nature hippies that they're made out to be I mean there's the reason the baseball team certain a deaf to Native Americans because they were I mean they chopped up what's-her-name the one who founded Rhode Island I mean we know the rock she was hiding behind which before and she got scat scalp so they were tough more like population as many of them so but the idea that just because we're this you know there are many immigrant populations means we have to continue being that way that's not a really a good argument well it's not really an argument I'm just saying that we are essentially founded by immigrants not saying we have to keep doing no but this is what what we became but we were counted here from somewhere else everyone came here from somewhere sure but we were founded by immigrants from like very specific places now whether that's good or bad is a separate issue but the idea that you know the founding fathers some of them were from Syria and some of them were from then as well is not true right they're mostly from Europe mostly specifically from British speaking Europe yeah that's true I mean but there was still plenty of immigrants from Germany plenty immigrants from Czechoslovakia and Poland Poland was a huge immigrant population early in the birth of the United States right right but the and they were thinking of making German the official language because they hated the British so much at one point and there's still huge german-speaking populations but I think this argument is much more complicated than people won't make it out to be and the idea that like you know we're gonna have complete open borders without consequences is crazy and listen my mom still lives in a Russian neighborhood in in Brooklyn and it's a very different place from the rest of New York and I think that's a good thing what's the idea that it's not a thing at all is false yeah well you can't say it's not a thing at all so is the question whether or not the consequences of open borders are worth the the eventual gain by some sort of egalitarian society where everyone has the opportunity to advance well I think a lot of times when people are on the left they don't think of costs they think if this is a good thing we don't have to worry about the cost and it's the right thing to do right and then when you bring up the cost like they're saying well you're a terrible person it's like sometimes the cost is worth it but you have to acknowledge that there is a cost like we're seeing this right now with transgender athletes when people like well what happens when someone who's grown up male is fighting someone who's a female like this is something with the grapple with it's like oh you're making up imaginary scenarios like this is happening now like let's maybe it's the right thing to do but you still have to consider what are the costs yeah and radical inclusive progressivism is there just dude there are no differences there's no difference between gender right there's no biological difference in gender so there so you know fundamentalist believe in creationism that God created you know the world in seven days they have their own creationism which is that everyone was created equal and remain so yeah well it doesn't work when it comes to combat sports for sure that's what like that is the that's where the rubber meets the road right it doesn't work in any aspect I mean if I grow up in again my faith like my dad's and my parents are lawyers not that they are in real life I'm going to certainly have that background and that advantage of other people don't have now that might be a good thing or it might be a bad thing but it's a thing yes it is a thing especially if you want to continue in that business right yeah well there's I mean the idea that we're all that we come from an even position that we're all the same starting line is pretty preposterous correct yeah yeah the idea is just I mean if you wanna like you can't fix that you can't change that that is what it is and you shouldn't want to change it right we should try to do is make the best out of whatever hand you've been given right right I think that I think if you want to look at this country and the real issues that we face they're you know they're multifaceted but one of the biggest ones is that there's some areas of our country that continue to have people that are impoverished and in crime-ridden areas and these areas don't ever change right that's one of our biggest problems I mean we're so concerned with all these different issues in all sorts of invalid issues that are happening all over the world but the issues of our own impoverished communities that continue to be impoverished southside of Chicago you know horrible areas of Texas there's there's some areas that just don't get any better right and they stay that way generation after generation after generation and they don't there's not enough interest in them in terms of like broad mainstream focus where they say look we have to dedicate and allocate a massive amount of resources to fixing these inner cities and maybe just one project one Flint Michigan style project where they say listen let's just dump an X amount of time resources money and engineering figure out some way to fix these areas provide jobs make things more safe you know establish community centers do something and let's see if we can do that and have it one case study one impoverished city see if you could bring it up and then once you do move forward and try this in other places I've always said like the best way to make America stronger is to have less losers like what's the best way to have less losers well one one one way is to give people more of a chance they give people like if you grow up in suburban Los Angeles and you live in some nice neighborhood and you know Studio City or something like that it's fairly safe and you have a much higher likelihood of success than someone who grows up in a crime-ridden drug-filled environment where people are constantly going to jail and those those sort of recurring cycles of poverty and crime they have in generation after generation after generation and some in some cases like in Baltimore there's like clear evidence of systemic racism you know that literally people were stopped from buying houses in certain areas stopped from moving into areas but in other areas it's like it's just or almost like it does it itself because he's right right and and the the I always have this litmus test for people to find out if they're left-wing or right-wing so people like to pretend I'm neither on both you ask them are some people better than others and if your right-wing you're going to yes and if your left-wing you're gonna start babbling a whole speech better and like what's better me whatever you think in any sense of the word better it's sucking dicks some people don't be better and some people are clean that's right here what causes that well people like no they just need to learn how to suck dicks better right right and not everyone I get I don't this is not a road I know enough about to go down how dare you okay let's say play the flute right on the skin flute a regular flu some people are better at it some people are better at math some people and that's gonna be a function the mind you know and that's something that not everyone's gonna be able to equally good at and you have to start with that point that we were born of different gifts or we have different interests and we've got through those that's really focus and denomination yeah I mean there's certain things like guitarists like there's there's no doubt about it that's not like Stevie Ray Vaughan Jimi Hendrix Gary Clark jr. is people that have like an exceptional ability to play incredible music out of a guitar there's that what is that is that I mean where's that coming from well it's also you and I are both self-taught I'm sure you never get a major in podcasting I never took an English course you know and you're you had many different careers over your life so of I and that's just a function of the self it's not a function of the culture it is it's also luck it's also being in the right place at the right time it's also finding a job that exists that fills my very unique personality we're making that job exist no one you know no one made me write this book I did a Kickstarter I raised a 30 grand and I'm like now I'm gonna do it myself so the publishing industry didn't know what to make of it and how's it been house ever smoked its I mean just I got it I was the first one to have a c-span book TV for a Kickstarter book a whole hour I mean I'm on all these different shows talking about it because they didn't know it's and it's been a great success well that is that in in that way it's got parallels I think to podcasting yes in that once you find something that you're really passionate about yes and people realize that you're really passionate about and you put so much effort and focus into it they can see that in your work yes and they appreciate that and I think people are very much and this is another reason I loathe cynicism people are drawn to earnestness they are drawn to passion and they are drawn to sincerity and honesty and like and we're hungry for it and we're desperate for it and especially I think increasingly young male cuz there's so much eye rolling and there's so much snark and all this other stuff which I like but they like I want to be a better guy I want to be a smarter person one of the big lies I was told growing up is that the jocks and the Nerds hate each other and when I was working with Matt Hughes on his book and hanging out with his fighter buddies it was a total mutual admiration society there was no eyebrow raised there was no shit talking it was complete like wow you're a smart dude you know let me learn from you and I'm like wow you guys are athletes let me learn from you and it's totally mutual respect it would totally blew my mind one of the things about martial artists is that there's everybody kind of mean some people start off with like certain physical talents and physical gifts but it's when it comes to like technique and ability you have to learn those yes and it's something that's very humbling along the way and so they have this understanding that hard work and focus and technique and knowledge yes all applied together equals results yeah and and it they're awesome people and obviously this is your world but I mean I've I was blown away by these guys and had such respect for them and I didn't think I would I think it's changing I think perception of who fighters are is changing and I think that's one of the reasons why there's such a big blowback when someone is like a thuggish bully asshole ish sort of fighter and that these people aren't respected nearly as much as someone like a George st. Pierre who's a gentleman right Conor McGregor who's just this wild brilliant trash talk right and these people like you you could recognize that there's some significant mind games going on there's there's some real thinking and they're not macho in the sense of they're not posturing like they don't need to stand up be like I could kick your ass like all the fighters I knew if people go up to the bar be like you know I bet you like to kick your ass they'd be like I'm sure you can you know what I mean it still happens yeah these guys they have to walk away from fights all the time but they do it gladly because they don't have a chip some of them do I'm sure have a chip on the shoulder most the ones I met none of them did and they would just be like okay that's fine I saw it in person one night at a nightclub in Vegas was some guy was talking shit to Chuck Liddell it was so ridiculous I mean I was just like what is this guy doing and then Chuck Liddell just kind of looked at him dead-eyed and you know it said something to him and you see the guy like saw his life pass before his eyes and eventually realized came to his senses and people pulled him away but I was like what is this and guy doing and it's so funny that one of the scariest moments of my life when I was working with Hughes on his book he's such a happy-go-lucky guy and then once I got an argument his face changed I'm like oh yeah that's who you are yeah I completely forgot that he's this killer he's one of the greatest Walter weeks yeah it was is really oh yeah shit I felt stupid - well Matt was the first guy that incorporated great wrestling with real high-level submission right Lucy submitted match Frank Trigg when he submitted George st. Pierre well he submitted George st. Pierre with a very advanced move he hit him with a farsighted armbar George committed to a Kimura but didn't have control of Matt's body and Matt hit the far side armbar and spun around on him I remember watching and I was four it was at 4:59 of the first round I believe he had one second to go and George tapped really quick mmm I don't remember what time what I remember is just a brilliant move yeah he so he when he was starting out it was he was like I know I'm strong and I'm a good wrestler I gotta learn technique or else it's gonna be used against me so he's very very strategic with his approach yeah he really was and a big factor in that whole camp that Miletich fighting system camp was Jeremy Horn yeah who was like really like kind of a nerdy guy and a lot of right he's on a bullied type guy at all not a very strong guy not a freak athlete but had more than 150 professional fights and won a shit ton of them and was really it was the first guy to beat chocolate Dell put him to sleep from the bottom with an arm triangle from the bottom because he was just a brilliant tactician and just very good at staying calm very good at figuring out like he was all technique Jeremy was all technique and still is yeah I never met Jeremy Matt always spoke extremely highly of he's a great guy and all those people and he's a super polite really kind hearted guy who just happens to be a trained killer right a lot of these guys and that's not super polite but he is he's very ploy you don't think you super close so the thing with Matt I mean I can't say enough good things about him like having be friends with him and his family to this day I still go out to Hillsborough to visit them has changed my life so profoundly but he when Matt Hughes meets you he'll be making fun of you and people have him on a pedestal so they won't respond back and he looks like an asshole so when I first got the project this is a great story I was on the phone with his manager and his manager Matt's got a twin brother and when they start messing with you you just got to stand there and take it until they're tired and I thought to myself nigga I'm from Brooklyn we don't play that shit I swear to God as much as Edward not got it I thought it and then I don't you think racist words to yourself Gary I'm thinking one now so I meet Matt and he starts with me and I hit him back hard and he loved it he loves being the butt of a joke because he wants to be a regular guy he hates being on a pedestal he hates being I'm the world champion he's those normal dude and I think it kind of bothers him that people won't make fun of him back well that's sort of a fight gym culture though everybody makes fun of his analogy it's but they're scared to make fun of him because it's oh my god Matt Hughes and I said no don't no no please hit me he's always cackling laughing you know who has the best Instagram page who Derrick Lewis okay Derrick the Beast Louis do you know you know he's got just knocked out Travis brown one of the top heavyweight contenders his fucking Instagram is hilarious but hilarity he just finds the most fucked up shit online it puts him on his Instagram page like one of them was a picture of a girl with like 15 hot dogs in her mouth and it said something like don't worry about it these guys are all just like brothers to me we're just gonna hang out it's like what would Forrest Griffin for Halloween was Supergirl no I don't know Supergirl to crop top and he captioned it does this make me look gay and he's like how about no it was hilarious yeah well that's problematic left yeah I mean these guys look there's a lot of gallows humor and a lot of like really funny guys that are involved in like these fight gyms oh yeah it's because they're dealing with such incredible stress levels that they need some sort of a blow-off valve right you know Derrick Lewis is one of the top heavyweight cage fighting fighters on the planet Earth I mean he's one of the best in the UFC right now he's just knocked out Travis Browne knocked him out cold and recovered from a rough first round got hurt came back and knocked him out so his Instagram it just it's like you would think that he'd be like this crazy psychopath running hills and screaming into the night you know like I remember when I was a kid there was a video of Mostafa hamp show vs Marvin Hagler they were shown this promo clip and they were I lived in Boston and Hagler was a Boston guy who's from Brockton and he used to train in the Cape well because it was freezing cold in the winter and they'd have him running these sand dunes in the renter and while he's running them he was screaming war and Hagler was terrifying because he was just wrapped and muscular and he had a bald head and you know he just was a destroyer and so that was my idea of like what a fighter was like they would like this solemn right you know character a lot of them are clowns in the best possible way yeah a lot of them are very very funny and it just an appreciate even if they're not funny they appreciate a good sense of humor yeah yeah a lot of joking around for a breezy over doom jokes around a lot he's pretty funny yeah there's a lot of them that are like that it's interesting you know and then when people are too serious and they lose that's when the public goes after them right like Ronda Rousey oh yeah yeah like I could beat anyone on earth oh man when the public went after her oh boy yeah dark and Matt always said if you're not losing you're not fighting the right people well it's true yeah I mean unless you're some fucking freak of athleticism and some top of the food chain Roy Jones jr. type character he's always going to be those guys there's always outliers right who essentially they're bar movers like they change expectations like there was expectations for performances inside the UFC and then there was Anderson Silva and then Anderson Silva came along and everybody went okay well that we now we know that's possible were you were you calling the fight when he broke his chin yes what was that like in real life to see the second time I've seen that Oh first time I saw it was Cory Hill broke his shin and I I had to scream at the referee that time because the referee didn't realize that it happened Oh Mike and so because he was in a different position the referee was not in a position to see and then Cory went down and I forget his opponents name I know the dude I'm sorry but when his opponent was attacking him the referee hadn't realized that Cory's leg had snapped in half yet so I'm fucking screaming I took my headphones off and I do it up and I'm screaming stop the fight stop the fight and it was they stopped it they heard you know I think he figured it out I don't know if it helped but I just couldn't help I just had to jump up it means it was I had only seen it on film before I've never seen anybody like snap like that in real life right and I've seen a few times in kickboxing oh you had because I got not live right only on video and it's like I can't believe the human body can do that I knew it could do it I'd seen it happen a few tight happened to one of the best kick boxers in the world Tyrone's bomb just a couple of years ago and it essentially shut his kickboxing career down he was fighting gokon sake he was also one of the best kickbox in the world and cocon checked one of his kicks and Tyrone's like just act like a joint just yeah and spawn is just elite of the elite he's one of the various it was like these two guys Tyrone Spong and gokhan Saki it was like a world-class kickboxing fight where the whole kickboxing community like people that are like myself they're big fans like whoo here we go here we go to see it end like that there one yeah the Anderson one was very unfortunate but you know that if they think he broke his leg actually with a kick earlier in that round oh yeah it was hurting him apparently already and then he threw that and it just snapped in half so it might have been already compromised by a similar situation and then that one maybe I look a hairline fracture and that one just snapped it all the way in half I couldn't that it's rough yeah it's a rough game man Quarry Hill the guy with the first guy that had happened to he's dead now he died no I remember what he died of but he died really young yeah there's quarry he'll deal heart yeah that's who it is yeah that was a rough rough fucking fight to watch man he'd snap in half like that it's only happened twice in the UFC in that way but we've had it you know we've had a significant number of broken bones right like Frank Mir snapped him Sylvia's arm in half that was pretty fucked up yeah I met Tim he was a good guy he's a good guy quiet guy yeah um he's you know he's a guy that just didn't have like a lot of athletic talent right just hard work determination and a little bit of steroids and a great coach yeah and Pat Miletich is like all right let's work with what I have and I'm gonna make you a champion that's who you did back in the day man when he fought Rico Rodriguez and back in the day when Mexican supplements were a lot easier to get away with tim sylvia was a fucking destroyer oh yeah Tim so yeah he missed like that that era like there was visit the era of the guys who fought in Pride the Wild West error where you could just kind of do whatever the fuck you want if Sylvia existed in that era just Jesus Christ man he might have been one of the best the best like if you go back to like go see if you can find Tim Sylvia versus Rico Rodriguez that's when he won the title dude he was a fuckin destroyer he had a cut weight to make 265 he was fuckin seven feet tall jacked yeah and this wasn't in Soviet was like people think of Tim Sylvia they think of Tim Sylvia being like overweight when he fought Ray Mercer he got knocked out with one punch you the early days of tim sylvia when he was on top of his game he was fucking terrifying that's yeah yeah see if he can find like a better photo of it though like he could see like how fuckin huge he was yeah there he is right there wow he was jacked and so big that was when he fought cabbage beat the fuck out of cab there she was I was backstage when he fought Randy and remember Randy got him knocked out within like 20 seconds he had him on the ground went through a crazy punch Randy didn't or that Tim didn't see calm but it was it was insane yeah well Tim was friends with Randy so he was really shocked that Randy wanted to fight him in the first place and that wasn't Randy was a light heavyweight heavyweight and Randy hit him with a fake inside leg kick and a Giant Bomb overhand right right away and Tim didn't even know what the fuck happened he was out on his feet and he came back to that locker room his eye was all swollen it was like holy shit I just saw you two minutes ago it was crazy yeah that's the fight game man yeah that's the fight game yeah Tim Sylvia doesn't get enough love it really doesn't now I see him now like he's just enormous if that him 371 pounds yeah is this a recent one when is this from I don't think he's fighting anymore he does a lot of bow hunting now I think that's what he does when ethically unfit at the 2015 - two years ago ruled medically unfit to compete in reality fighting because it was 371 pounds see that was that's that's crazy that means he gained a hundred ten pounds from the time he was in his prime that's not good not good yeah but when he was at his best he's a very under appreciated heavyweight well III just think I hope I people are being friends with these people has helped me out so much in regular life and they talk about a lot how this carries over and it really really does the way they carry themselves the way they think like Matt always said for every move there's a counter for every counter there's a counter and that's the kind of thing we're like if you're going to move someone your career you're gonna have to leave some flank exposed and you have to become less risk-averse and make that shot and sometimes you're not gonna make that shot but you still have to go for it yeah and just because you see the dangers doesn't mean there's always gonna be dangerous you have to fucking go for it yeah there's definitely some lessons to be learned from all martial arts training and that what I've always said is this something that I learned from my earliest Taekwondo instructor was that Taekwondo and all martial arts are essentially a vehicle for human potential yeah develop developing your human potential and that these difficult things you do if you can overcome them you'll find lessons in those that you could apply to business personal relationships a lot anything life throws at you oh yeah and and also not there's a North Korean story where in 1978 I think there were there in the DMZ the border between North and South Korea the Americans wanted to chop down a tree or to prune it and the North Koreans took their axe and chop them up and killed them that axe is on display now in North Korea I saw it chopped up the American yeah but they both they boast that they use Taekwondo to to conquer these greater numbers of Americans because the Korean martial art all right they did it because they're like you're not chopping down this tree so they killed him because they wanted to chop down a tree yeah and the Americans launched operation Paul Bunyan and came back with like 200 guys and carriers and like we book a chop about his tree is it they let the stump to be like fuck you America yeah yeah I think the real issue with fighters is making sure that they recognize that father time is real and that the expiration date is real and that there is only a certain amount of punishment the physical frame your meat vehicle that you're carrying through this life can endure and then after a while its downhill well you know what that had closed down for me because I always wanted to have abs right and I listened snot laughing Joe Rogan's I work with my coach dick talons and he's like I can get you two abs he got me two abs he got abs zeroes what's yeah I wrote an article about how getting have changed my life you know here's the spoiler zero positive outcome I put I put the app photo on tinder no one fucking cared but now I have to maintain them or else I'm gonna be the man in decline and I'm gonna be scared I'm losing my peak you know so that's something that every guy goes through so now I'm in this fucking trap of having to stick by this fuckin regimen okay well I can help you right there how's that that's the way you're looking at it you're looking at it like it's trap yeah like these expectations that must be maintained right that's just a mind trap well I'm in it just not you know you're not you could instead look only towards always improving and don't ever think of it as a trap think of it as a perpetual life like path oh sure I am improving at the point is I can't be like this body fat can't increase a certain problem that's like what people do like you hear about that when people become famous like when they become famous or whether you come wealthy they get panicky and you want to look clean - oh yeah isolate and insulate themselves oh yeah they lose what got them they become Rick risk-averse they lose what got them to the dance in the first place my abs did not get me to any dance this fucker they should well they should not show them to the right people you're single guy I am missing desperate yes desperately single guy pull up that shirt and right in front of our cannot preach imam must to send you a pussy your way I've already had to start tanning i'm you've had - yeah it's been required of you because i do a lot of TV and my body fat was low enough that I looked Holocaust II on screen oh Jesus I don't it's low enough that I looked sick yeah and like my family who I don't really speak to thought I was literally starting go what are you eating nothing oh look at that dude you bet that's very good it's pretty good dude it's good yeah I think you're gonna get some pussy now I think so he's drinking monster energy drink kind of maintain his fucking metabolites there on the podcast monster in the bedroom was oh you I just mean I like choking that's the sugar stuff sugar freestyle now come on sit low sugar low carb low carb don't scare me Joker there's like there's a little bit of sugar it's 10 calories for the can I mean 10 grams or calories 10 grams of sugar 10 cat 25 calories for the can oh yeah yeah there's no stuffing there's seven grams of carbs those things are tasty they're little too tasty I can't drink those when I eat that's a sponsor of the UFC so though I'm laying around they're so good it's about sometimes I'll drink one during a broadcast but then you have to fucking pee the problem is that stuff runs through you fast thanks for telling me that as I'm sitting here do you see I know I'm a stomach it's four o'clock I'm thinking we're gonna go for another like 15 minutes perfect for already yeah it's for do we just wow got a we're gonna do this this is Sean your Brooklyn guy in New York I love Brooklyn yes how long you gonna be out here for I just flew out for a couple of days Oh beautiful yeah you got any plans what you gonna do when you're out here I'm hanging out with my buddy Maddox who you probably know he's an internet personality I'm just going to do just some work and that's it just experience life on the west coast I'm not an LA fan to be honest it what bothers you about there's a certain corruption about it corruption yeah I feel like there's a veneer of sunshine and civility underneath that there's a lot of fakeness and and nastiness and yeah I New Yorkers were more direct and more surface that's interesting fakeness and nastiness how so meaning like when I meet people in LA and they're like oh you're an author like I'm sorry I haven't heard any of your books it's like why the fuck are you sorry I'm nobody do you know I mean like that kind of thing I said they don't they're scared of offending someone in case I might be important it's like that shit or it's like we should definitely grab lunch meaning good to see you but it doesn't mean literally we should grab lunch it's all these cars hanging out with though that's you could find the losers like that in New York - well I'm not hanging out with them I guess I'm meeting the wrong people in LA how you meeting them then what do you mean in New York well no you're generalizing like you're generalizing these P that you're meeting that they're worried about offending you it's it it's happened enough that it's part of the culture here it's not just one data point you're again and it's just like it's it's jarring to me hmm I'm not used to it from Brooklyn you're a big fan of that data point line yeah I like it one life I mean but you're it's a limited data point how many people have you meet how often are you here 24 million ones here yeah I think the thing about LA is there's pockets of humanity like these oases of interesting people and I I'm a cultivator of interesting people I like to like want to find them I cling to them the problem is yes that's my approach there's always someone who's trying to get into that group that's not right yes yeah entry ism yeah and then you know it's that they bring their crew and it's been it's infected mm-hmm yeah it becomes an issue and especially amongst comedians it becomes an issue oh god they want to work with you and do shows with you and stuff like that you're like hey this ain't happenin I did two books with DL Hughley who's also an amazingly wonderful person and I didn't see that much around him like he hangs with their very group he's too smart very smart yeah he's learned a lot from him he's not suffering any fools no exactly and it's also really fun being the white guy with the group of black people go into a club or something like that and it was raised in word I it's in the book there's a chapter in the first book about it which book I did two books with him the first bro yeah I want you to shut the fuck up Uncle Sam on the cover book yeah I want you fucker that is a hilarious time for a book the second one's called black man white house mmm I came up with both those titles in their present life I want you to shut the fuck up is very good I want you Uncle Sam on the cover liked it yeah he's I learned a lot from him also just a great great guy yeah he's a good dude he's a decent guy like I'm sure you know all the comedians and who were the assholes behind the scenes and who aren't and I don't think anyone thinks badly of him he's very wears his hardness leave yeah I don't know DL that well I've run into him a few times and had good conversations with him he's always been very nice but you're right I don't ever hear bad things yeah he's a Mancha's of interesting I want yeah is that great I have I actually have a blow-up of that when we get a book signing and he signed it to me over my instructions to my nigga Michael Dallas peace pimpin that great there's my name little dance audacity of dopes is ruining America that's hilarious yeah I love how you can say fuck as long as you put in like a pound sign for the you well they wanted a curse because there was a book called go the fuck to sleep which did huge so they're like okay we need a curse in the title I'm like alright you can cover up one letter and everybody's like okay we're good yeah not if my friends new books gonna call fuck Wales whoa like fuck Wales and all these other shit you know an FF has a pound sign it's like oh well this is fine we'll put this on the shelf in the supermarket that's funny yeah you just do that well such child no language has changed because we used to not be able to say fuck and now we can't say the n-word but as when we were kids it was fucked that was the problem you'd never seen writing ever well you could did Archie Bunker say the n-word on all in the family he must have I would imagine he did I know that uh fret red fox did oh yeah red fox did on Sanford and sons cuz I remember I remember him saying it about like I think it was like a jury I think it was like during a trial or something like that I'm trying to remember what the line was but it was he said so the last time I saw this many niggers was in a Tarzan movie and I'm like how fuck did they put that on TV but it was a different world and it was Redd Foxx yeah who was by the way like almost like I mean him and Richard Pryor were like one of two of the most important figures of like black stand-up comedy of any stand-up comedy yeah yeah for sure I mean the comedian's are the ones who're always pushing the envelope and that's their job and it enrages me when people are trying to that's not fun I have my next book I have this whole chapter about that's not funny that's like I knew a North Korean refugee and he would he went to high school here and he'd be hanging out his friends and they'd be like hey remember when were kids there's Pokemon he'd be like yeah except instead of Pokemon I washed my debts starve to death along with most of my village so you have that dark sense of humor you joked around about that yeah because you have to like you come from that culture if you don't laugh not gonna be able to kind of deal with it so you're gonna tell him he can't joke about start his starving family who the fuck are you how'd that guy get out uh you he escaped to China he was basically a slave a woman kind of found him she was a Christian there's a lot a big Christian population in China and then it's a whole process how do you escape the child did he bribe the guard in the middle during the day he just crossed the Tumen River and they just happened not to see him he's a kid how was it I mean he was under 16 and over 11 somewhere in that range so when you when someone from your family escapes your whole family's punished sir so the great leader Kim il-sung said class enemies must be exterminated to three generations so in America when people like Rick Santorum say the families the basic unit of society unit means that which can't be subdivided further they put that into practice so if someone from your family does something wrong three generations are punished so if someone escapes that's gonna be really bad for you so they often get fake but they bribe something to get a fake death certificate Wow yeah so someone escapes your parents and then grandparents or kids or sibling kids or anybody whoever the fuck can be around yes imprisoned or deported to some countryside like if you're in Pyongyang there's something called saengmin they have a caste system right which has three layers which is how loyal you are to the government and that determines where you can live in the country and what your job could be so you're not allowed to step foot in the capital city unless you're loyal to the regime so what happens is if you're from Pyongyang and you defect your family is gonna get sent to likes Bumblefuck you know who knows and now you got to raise rice and anyone from North Korea who's an like ambassador they have family back there so make sure that you don't make any mistakes and try to stay in that country yes they have layers upon layers of control they're brilliant at it it's horrific but brilliant right yes yeah they're I mean these are really the super mind master the super villains of our time horrific in its execution but brilliant in its the the whole master plan of it other things do they tell people don't wear ripped jeans to the DMZ because North Korea takes these photos and shows the citizens go look before the rest the country rest the world dressed in rags wow that's a various brilliant it's absolutely brilliant it is Alerus that we're so wealthy in America that we buy jeans that are already scratched up right all right like acid well like let's just pour acid on your jeans all right that's fine I was watching this video online about how they make those what's the word that they use for distressed distressed yeah well they were taking like a sander right right yeah like blasting she's like what the fuck are we doing I I went into this whole Jean phase I got 30 pairs because I thought I was just I started collecting them and then I and the point is when they're raw you wear them the pink breaks down and they distress in their own they get these cool fades and I wore my best pair to like this fancy denim store in LA and no one praised me and I'm like fuck you in this subculture and I know one praised you he's not upset yeah at the last pair on earth of these persimmon died you know Japanese view the time this is like two years ago they're a khaki Sheba man what is that hockey Cebu it's unripened persimmons I I don't know what that person is a person a person is a fruit right right so they take the unripened juice they soak the clothing in it and it becomes this pinkish orange hue and this company sugar cane made jeans that color they look the pinkish orange hue and they looked sick they look amazing I know why you're single is that right is that orange does not show the ABS first time on fucking stained jeans that you're worried about being praised for okay samurai jeans khaki shoe be die actor see for ounce kakuzu boo sorry I got the sugar King 124 ounce I like how they weigh them fuck how much they work is that the heavier the gene the better the fades Oh interesting yeah huh okay see those kind of genes don't interest me cuz they seem like it's hard to move around them no well that's when you break them down that's the whole point yeah but they're not like like you know what these are these are barbell genes oh yeah yeah I know about those yeah they stretch four big quads dude these are like fucking sweat pants man retro head kicks wearing these right these are I like these and there's another company called motton bow they make them and they're like a little bit of thicker fur they look more expensive pair of jeans but it has the same sort of stretch flexi thing that's well the company I like called Naked and Famous they're Canadian they have like genes that change color I've seen those yeah I didn't yeah they've got a fuck I've got a fuck ton of them but they don't do not salmon colored kaki shoo boo fucking that's sure that looks like sugar those are ridiculous I've got the mud die ones I just love the fact you were bummed out but nobody prays there's no praises no the guy at the denim store should fucking know that's the one guy who should know Jamie would you know Jamie where's Kanye West sneakers that's not that's not the whole that's a whole different vibe that's basic shit it is it is come on I like the hipster stuff I don't have the actual crazy Z's that are like 5,000 eight oh come on they have 5,000 $8,000 yeah I'm not a fan not a fan either you got a real collector gets the stuff that's not that expensive but is really unique and cocky she boos cocky she boo you still wear them or you just got the new praise I cry I was gonna wear today like am I gonna wear today I know I know sir I may be but you don't seem like a fashionista you don't seem like the guys shirt you're wearing you don't like this is for sure it's got epaulets oh it's good for ugly people then you're saying board games are like ages 5 and up so this is ugly end up oh I get it yeah no I mean so terrible shirt but it's you know I mean if you're in there like really being praised for your clothes I wouldn't imagine that would be your best choice well I was gonna wear a suit I wear suits on on Fox all the time and I'm probably the best-dressed people Network do you enjoy being on Fox I love it really oh I love it why because I get to be the same thing that gets me in trouble at parties and I'm rewarded for it what is the thing that gets you in trouble at parties vicious eviscerating denigrating all these things like McNasty it's so fun what will you why do you like doing that because I think there's a lot of horrible people and they need to be called out on their bullshit and I'm position to do it it's like what kind of arguments you have on five never seen you in farce for well I don't watch too much of ours it's fine I just it's just like if I'm talking about politicians I always make it a point to be as denigrating and humiliating to them personally as possible oh when you're talking to them person no not personally but we're talking about them whatever the issue is I'm not usually in panel special politicians I was on with John Bolton once which was weird but I mean I go if I'm out I'm shopping for blood you know with these types someone's got to be Batman and punching these people in the face metaphorically metaphorically yeah yeah so you enjoy because it gives you an opportunity to you mean yeah send a message home it's a well to be mean which I'm good at but it's not culturally socially acceptable this why don't drink because you're afraid you're gonna be more mean I get meaner yeah do you really fight for people just listening you give me like the sideways looking through the eyebrow oh yeah but that's the thing like my not my mouth is very quick so I'll have that good line in the next day I'm like that person is gonna feel like shit and I should have said it oh yeah and they don't deserve that at a party right but you meant it at the time I met the joke it came out yeah I mean the joke landed well that's the thing about hanging out with comedians to like you know you know a lot of comics that I know yeah but you can kind of get away with that like you get shit on a comic and if it's funny they'll laugh with you but if it's a regular person especially a female it's that you don't want to do that that's you they don't deserve it at all and I feel guilty for a long time I should feel guilty no I should feel guilty especially you they're not used to it yeah and especially if they come at you thinking oh my friends tell me I'm funny and it's just like well you started the wrong fucking bar yeah maybe they can make fun of your genes and really hurt you they wouldn't have to Cebu they wouldn't have the language to do so they wouldn't over the language yeah she booth is it well is it that obscure well Ted you heard of it I don't know anything man you know I even know the rules to basketball khaki she was the reason why those jeans are awesome is because they're obscure oh that's are you one of those guys yeah things rare things are good hundred percent ninety percent are you a car guy you're interested I don't know how to drive how because you're in New York City yeah yeah that's weird but at like rare plants where fish are you just in a rare shit I like having stuff that's only your own because when everyone's puts their sticky fingers on it ruins it so like if you really like something but you find that other people like it as well and become popular you get upset hell on earth are you one of those dudes who gets bombed out with a bang gets popular oh my god it's the worst thing ever it's the worst thing it hurts me physically does it really no because then stupid people are liking what you like and then you got to question your choices oh that's like people like all sorts of stuff that's awesome yeah but incorrectly they like it for the wrong reasons what about ice cream with stupid people like chocolate ice cream you can chocolate what the hell I got a crazy person are you you don't like chocolate no my favorite ice cream is pink it's pink bubblegum from Baskin Robbins and I fuckin had to go to every Baskin Robbins in Manhattan trying to find it every year mmm and it drives me crazy I go and I put on my Instagram I
