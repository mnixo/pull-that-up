jealous of in like middle school in high school was when black I've had like designs in their hair yeah like yeah they had like lines she'll be really old to shit yeah and everything I wanna do that like you cannot even look like a fucking ass there's a fighter who cut is a black guy from some k1 guy but he carves like designs like tribal designs in his hair before he fights yeah it looks bad that's the thing you get away with it but do you think a black guy could get away with wearing like a white guy's hair like a black girl does no black dudes if that was the next thing they all started having Bon Jovi hair yeah they just all had Bon Jovi hair weaves or what if it was just like pardon me what if they is part of it like a good boy come yeah like like Ted Ted Haggard yeah yeah just weren't that cool about it like what's going on is it strange though but becomes popular and not popular you know like girls are allowed to have everything can be fake you can have fake tits yeah fake hair nobody gives a shit as long as you look good you look good good okay let's go you know what no guy is like really what me guys are don't get me wrong but it's acceptable for you to be already inauthentic we we are held to such a lower standard know the thing that we get like for most guys like if you if you bait you shower you bathe regularly and you basically you know change clothes that's considered like yeah carry yourself you don't have to wear makeup either isn't it what did you imagine though if you found out a dude was wearing blue contacts girls would be like what the fuck is I almost bought some fake contacts the other day just cuz I was that stone but it wasn't below it was the ones where you can just like one so you can get like cat eyes your eye completely black and I just want to have a pair for note for no reason at all do you remember Michael Jackson's Thriller what do you have oh yeah the cat eyes yeah do they have those and they're I guess they're just they're pretty cheap they're like 89 bucks and you just put them in your home that's not like the end of the movie who looks so let's get the count a thriller yeah yeah he turns back and then the left I was a fuckin jerk what a great music video that was that was resumes a that was an actual event that was like a word oh yeah yeah yeah it was huge that's what we had far less channels to I can't imagine what the numbers were on just that video they must have been they must be an astronomic yeah they must have been through thickets for 13 minutes that was like that was so cool I think him like seeing that yeah hear the unplugged for me it was a werewolf so I was even more excited yes and a cool one oh really that was Rick Baker that did that I believe I believe was the same guy that we monitor go off in London he did the lawyer Star Wars shit the coordinated dancing y'all that dancing was cool it shows that was the message behind that you know what a weird fucking video anything remember people were saying it was satanic I remember that there was a bunch of protests about it oh yeah we're upset what a fucking fascinated is the best thing ever when you get a controversy like that when people when someone says this might be satanic that was when they were like guys fucking yes yeah Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston probably the two most talented people that died and everybody saw it coming yeah you know saying yes we talked about like really uniquely talented people that everybody's like man you know how long is this gonna last yeah how long can you remember that uh the the Bobby Brown show being Bobby Brown yeah when they were on the show screaming yelling each other oh my god I remember when they talked they read they were at a dinner table they're fucked up function so huh not like buzzing like fucking up grass even a check and they were at a hotel and they were they had ordered like a feast and I mean it was it was crazy yeah like how much food was on this table and they were both just fucking completely out of their minds obliterated and laughing and then forget what Africa who said like remember when I was that was taking that shit and you had to come over help me pull it out my ass and it was like yeah yeah I think it was that he was in that one time she had a shit stuck inside of her and he reached up and he's like I pulled that Dookie out

in my ass uh-huh do you remember when they interviewed her there was an interview where the guy was trying to get to what the fuck was up and he's like yeah he's a cocaine is an alcohol and she's like at times at times at pants times all of them like at times all of them and he's like you know if you ever if you ever smoked crack it she was like comes back yeah I think that was to Diane Sawyer that she said that yeah Mac and he also said it's rumored that you spent $750,000 one year on drugs and she said oh I wish she said I wish yeah you kid made shit that'd be a good year it was the strangest interview man to listen to a person who you know when you grew up you know the bodyguard remember her with Kevin Costner she um she was such a talent such a talent such a superstar all amazing if you watch like how will I know yeah like the video I mean you see she's so beautiful have you ever heard when they isolate her lyrics no dude yeah her seat I don't know if you can play that I would think we could play that not like you know like a little sample or something I don't know let's try her range the range and her voice it's just ridiculous it's really stunning to listen to it's just look up how will I know Whitney Houston isolated lyrics love it use two hands your freak type with one hand no not the fuck you doing it's taking forever he's a bunch of chicken scratch on that screen Brian's gonna confuse the fuck out of people it's a way to take that video of your Ustream and put it on mine I don't know I could find out but you definitely be like oh yeah people are mad at you Brian this is another O'Brien moment they get excited people like it when you fuck up do you notice that yeah they love it what is that about makes it seem more real it's not edited and it's raw or yeah people like a little conflict there's a dude who just sent me 19 tell Brian to shut the fuck up in a row okay that guy's blocked oh it kids bitch didn't come wait here's one it's uh it's a strange thing to listen to Matt cuz you know there's not you can give me a million years and all the coaches in the world they listen to that yeah listen to this shirt [Applause] damn she was good yeah she was fuck that's just that's a once in a lifetime voice man that is is a perfect voice yeah to the perfect voice it's like a body guard days uh hottest hottest fuck oh that was the first time ever there was a hot girl that a hot man was falling in love with yeah you know that she's black and they did a major movie about it have you ever done that before was a hot black girl and the man get together if man nobody barely even complained now we're racist the main storyline you know yeah like that would have to be this yeah she was such a fuckin gigantic star as a singer that they were like so in the movie with you I can't act who cares yeah just fucking move all the cameras see whatever you want yeah we'll tie it all together you're working with Kevin Costner he'll carry you along she could act to acting as easy as fuck man acting ain't shit I mean there's this high level acting obviously that none of us can do but the regular acting like The Bodyguard yeah you could do that living so hard man what'd you say yeah yeah yeah eight million my buddy Mike Starr was in that movie too he got beat up by Kevin Costner oh really yeah my buddy Mike Starr did it we did a TV show a long time ago called The Hardball together it was it's stupid baseball show that yeah it's a terrible show but it was uh I made a bunch of good friends Mike Starr was one of them he got beat up in a bunch of movies you got beat up in a Steven Seagal movie haha got real mad at Steven Seagal Steven Seagal was hitting him really hard really yeah yeah he had him wound up actually having to put like a chest protector on because the guy was not really supposed to hit him you know it was supposed to like fake hit him it's very fucking moving you know you're gonna see Steven Seagal which is the lightest chest up I am hit him with that fucking Wing Chun punch and shit Steve really either he just does it man he's known for doing that you know what he's in he's you know he's trying to make a fucking badass movie right and unfortunately when you try to make a badass movie sometimes you gotta sacrifice yeah I'm gonna kick you in the gym and get a fucking stomp dudes on occasions that's what he I mean that was his out to hell which made it so much worse like you get kicked and he's like that's what time it is what how did that happen like the guy that it was in the movie that always has like the witty one-liners after he kicks you in the balls no man that became I mean I it was that I think that became huge through Clint Eastwood I think he'd be the guy I mean you know I mean we're here as like where the bad ass thing happens yeah and then you go in not close you push in on the bad ass face and he's like to ask your mother what she thinks the Clint Eastwood every which way but loose movies were the first time that they really like combined like action and comedy together there with a dude who wasn't a comedy guy right but it worked it works man it works that worked Grail you know that's what Philo Beddoe funny fucking clean dude come on man every which way but loose was awesome and that was back when Clint Eastwood was stuck with that one chick wasn't named Sondra Locke I remember he did a million movies with this freak yeah yeah I guess you know that was just his girl and they did a bunch of movies together but as soon as they broke up man shit got ugly really yeah he got her like some development deal to get her the fuck away from home and and she accused him of blocking every one of her projects nobody wanted to another Elvin fucking Clinton man she was suing the shit out of him it was just gross man it was just when people like divorce and they do it publicly like oh you like lose so much respect for the more vocal member of the - yeah and that was one of the case with the thing with her I automatically assume well this bitch it's crazy we go yeah yeah and she never really worked again you know Sondra Locke disappeared she was in a ton of movies with Clint Eastwood but that was about it after that you know she thought it was because he blackballed her but most people I think a lot of us probably as people thought she was gross like you know yeah what's goin what are you doing a Clint yeah everything Eastwood man you can't you can't fuck over that's movie royalty good the bad and the ugly come on you leave him alone you know did you do you imagine the stories that he had yeah oh my god I remember oh you were the one we played like the old like racist was that Elkin was a no I know what I mean yeah yeah yeah man on account must die recently yeah yeah man yeah to Reno yeah I think that was it yeah I live next door like among family or something right so there's always like he's like it's an old time he's like get your yellow ass off my lawn oh yeah shit and they asked him about like political correctness and he was like I don't know what this shit's all about he was like back in my day like we would shoot a movie and the grip was from China he was the Chinaman and like and he that's just who you are and like and we would just laugh about it like we could tell jokes to people about their race and people wouldn't freak out like his people were giving him you know a lot of shit right yeah people are super sensitive you're not even supposed to joke around well yes unless you are of a nationality a minor or a rather a not minor like a minority or a minority ethnic a minority and they stop at minor that's a tired I am I think that for a lot of people they give minorities like you know whether you're black people can make fun of white people all day long but you you're walking a fine line and make fun of black yeah I've seen you do some great black jokes and I see people who all shit right like a CPA like the clench i'ma go oh shit yeah cuz people worry people worry when a white guy makes fun of black people it gets to be a real but black people can make fun of white people I've seen white people laugh at the lamest shit they laugh it's just like it's like a guilty laugh yeah this weird they do that that fake white guy voice it's like a ripoff of the Richard Pryor white guy voice yeah where Richard Pryor was like it was a really unique thing we'd say you know I'd say you know you can't fuck with white people like hey man your mama my mom's a great old gal you know and he he developed that sort of white guy voice and everybody sort of stole it stole it yeah out of it are terrible yeah it's kind of like come on man white guys don't talk like that that's not how they talk yeah and I get a lot of a horrible example yeah that's it so you're like that's not that's not it's silly maybe it's white people you can tell white people yeah it's weird it's a weird gimme you know so for a lot of black guys like especially when they're first starting out stand up that's the first thing they go to yeah and isn't that one of those things that you see and you go oh he's going there yeah yeah of course yeah unless you see it done like supremely well yeah like there's there has to be like a super good example for you to like yeah and if the observation is really astute and you're like of that like that's some insight yeah dude you're picking apart something new or you're doing it if like you're doing a version of it that I haven't heard but everything else has been done you know so like will there always be minorities do you think it's gonna ever gonna be a point where we're all just gray like a mocha turn that girls you would take that girl a brown color like that's happening like race is becoming more really more mixed across the board you think so oh definitely why why are people attracted to blonde girls done but we talked about this you know what what I'm not attracted to is blonde eyelashes and blonde eyebrows I'm not attracted to blonde girls I'm attracted to blonde girls to do shit with their eyelashes and their eyebrows oh yeah funny though that's a weird or girls who don't do that like girls who have naturally brown eyebrows yeah and that's why they usually I gravitate a lot of them really no I don't like like at all though is like bleached oh yeah that that's not it's got to be like it legged natural I like all kinds of blonde I think a lot of times when you take a girl that's like brown hair or some weird color a brownie make her blow and she's always hotter you know she's like nice bleached blonde you know what's really freaking me out man amount of people that are putting shit in their face a lot of people that are getting like fillers in their face yeah like the implants it's becoming boats they're not even cheek implants that's what I thought they were too I thought that like remember when Mickey walk did that Mickey Rourke lost his fucking marbles remember that yeah he's like in the 90s I guess yeah yeah Kim plants did he get implants yes he did yeah yes he got a face and then he got him removed no yet chick implants he looked bizarre yeah well now I think what happened was that's when he was boxing and when he he had a pretty intense like segment of his life where he just boxed any box professionally he got his fucking brains rattled dude it looks like it - yeah and I think that changed him as a person you know I think it made him you know this wacky eccentric like remember Gary Busey who was a regular dude crashes his motorcycle becomes as wacky totally crazy yeah he used to be this really brilliant actor really talented actor like mr. Joshua remember that and fucking what was that movie he's an exciting guy what movie was that we burned himself yeah I forget Bruce Willis movie I know it was that pulp fiction no no fuck no it wasn't that Gary Busey yeah Gary Busey he's nine pulp fiction is he's not so god damn it I hate when I don't know I think Roark is from I think it's from Liberty City Miami - my point was lethal weapon was that what it was yeah yeah Gary Susan was it lethal weapon I think so one of them yeah it was yeah it was Lethal Weapon the hold on man what's the important break yeah I think someone's would fucking move the grave in there yeah yeah Gary Busey was I believe the weapon yeah that's what it was um what was I saying he was a regular dude and head trauma transformed him you know and I think that that's also what happened to Mickey Rourke you know he's a regular dude and he got so crazy that he decided to be a good idea too put-put like plastic things inside its cheeks to make his cheeks better and like nobody would know you've seen the fate of the photos yeah he Adam removed and now he's just got this weird thing where just any of anyone that fucks with their face it's gonna look weird like look I don't know if pumped Paul McCartney cuz I gonna Grammys his face there was a lot going on there and I think a lot of those dudes are just Botox in it Botox and it'll freeze their face so the kidney can't move like like if you get mad at something you can't move your forehead it's just way better to be able to do that it's so silly it's just you don't look better you just look weird you look weird your face doesn't move why why isn't your face moving these girls on these Beverly Hills housewives shows there's a lot of these women have like fillers in their face and then on top of that they have Botox so they have these shiny faces that are like puffed up and they don't move and they look like masks yeah I was high as fuck once and I was in the the greenroom with Joey Diaz Joey turns on the TV and it was Joan Rivers and I just freaked out yeah I just freaked out because I was like oh so baked and it hit me like I looked at it and like that really hit me what she's done and you know you just want to go just tell her to stop just tell her stop doing that yeah just tell her it's doing it just doesn't make you look better it doesn't make you look better but you look crazy I know it's the weirdest thing ever that frozen's puffy face you know it's like they're they're injecting things into their face because when you get older the first one first things that happens your face starts to lose body fat that's why you get like sort of it's sunk in exactly you lose so they're injecting things in there to puff it up and oh it's crazy-looking miss she looks wild then oh it's a ma it's a monster face it's a it's a month that's why so when I see these women I call the monster faces because you see them all the time and it's like it really is just a mistake you know yeah it's a mistake of you shouldn't do it it's it's out of like such a fear of what would it look like oh yeah they don't want to look old so I'd rather look crazy well it's also you convinced yourself that you could fix something like I got hair transplants and I totally wish I never done it I have this stupid scar in the back of my head now otherwise I would shave my head but I got it because I was convinced that I could fix something like my hair was falling I was like can I fix this yeah sure way to fix this you research ways to fix this you talk to the doctor I can fix it I think oh he can fix it yeah okay I'll just get it fixed it doesn't fix it fixes it temporarily but all the other hair falls out of it the way I described I said it's like you're taking a bunch of healthy people and you're moving them to a neighborhood where everyone's dying yeah so they take care from the back your head they move it to the top of your head and then all of its neighbors just fucking wilt Kalin has the exact same thing he was talking about on it yeah he did two podcasts and he was saying that they can pretty much get rid of a lot of the the scar nowadays yeah yeah they can yeah yeah I'm actually having treatments they shoot things in your scar it makes it smaller I'll call it cortisone or something oh yeah the fuck it is something but it's Botox it's not it's not like the bad like I've seen guys who have bad ones mine's really thin it's a very thin scar but it's long I've seen dudes have big fat wide ones why there's Lincoln stretches out change yeah do you think I should have like a lot of bling you have a giant Jesus on the cross it would be a conversation piece I'd be nice that were made of diamonds and no one will even know they'll go what's going on your head nothing whatever get like get an eagle medallion something big eagle 3d maybe an eagle on the back of my head bro that American Badass now you're thinking with it like like it's claws will have like the American flag in it yeah don't you find it maybe these colors don't run don't you find it where the capes never caught on like it seems like we should have yeah if I did totally here well I mean that'd be fucked up that it never came back like you don't we didn't wear capes in the 50s like I think capes maybe back in the like 1700s in castle times I think we think of that because of Dracula right but it is not what they really wore I think it was cold as fuck back then and they hadn't really figured out jackets yeah yeah it fucks the other clothes and they were giant thing that they would throw over them like a blanket that you run out of the house with if you have a viewer cave now you better be able to back it up what have you had tons of fires for cellphones and money and well it was like a book bag that was a cape I just think you better be cool too very purple knowing if I want to I want to be a really cool dude yeah yeah you gotta be a bad motherfucker for real when you walk away you're like yeah I'll take capes over that stupid shit that I saw today at the store with this guy grown guy probably our age had a fucking wallet chain but on it had like stuffed animals a theater different kinds of peak pokemons and then he had a fucking raccoon tail and if you our hero raccoon tail yeah the stupid fake tails that he saw wears but yeah that's the sad man 35 4 Wow oh my goodness I just wanted it yeah a cape is better than that yeah babe is a more powerful statement definitely the host of Fear Factor in Mexico had a cape real yeah yeah when we were doing Fear Factor they they spun off a bunch of other Fear Factory yeah and one of them they did in Mexico I don't even know if they fucking it's like official this much really I just ganked it yeah but they would copy our ideas and they would do him was like no safety at all like we had one where we had these people were there to get they had a rescue a dummy out of a burning building and we put him in these crazy fire suits with a helmet on and we had dudes standing by with fire extinguishers when they did it on the Mexican show they wore shorts Wow they're just people in shorts under a fucking house it was burning yeah yeah yeah I was ridiculous it was probably a regular house to Arthur a fake house that the fire department uses for training and yes it doesn't burn down this is maverick murder our country again our country and our cultures so like engrossed within in lawsuits and it operates on them and the fear of them that you know that actually makes things way safer yeah you think about it there's countries not necessarily Mexico but there's countries in the world were like that is never an issue we want safety mall down there like that's cool yeah we want safety we want to be able to do things safe we want to build sue people that don't look out for our safety yeah but ultimately somewhere along one we're becoming a bunch of pussies with the lawsuit things that people like yeah they look at it as the lottery it's so ridiculous I mean there's people that have legitimate concerns and rigidity tournament claims but no they definitely are but then there's you read about like in that just these you know it's absolutely insane things that you pin on somebody else for things that you did yeah it's like everything is somebody else's responsibilities you know about the league that spilled the McDonald's coffee that's yeah okay I think they overturned that they had actually overturned that yeah and that's not even that to here some of the ones that are fine pick the ones that people win in the amounts why are you paying this person have you heard about the Monsanto lawsuit speaking of what they're guilty of chemically poisoning people in France oh they chemically poisoned a French farmer Wow yeah that's gonna be a big suit yeah yeah they were found guilty really yeah yeah I don't know the exact story apparently is a first such claim to ever reach French Court and Monsanto apparently they have some fucking pesticide there's another thing they found out that in ninety-three percent of pregnant women they've that they tested they found this pesticide that exists in monsanto genetically modified crops oh yeah uh-huh yeah man you know i politicians sold us down a river they let all this shit go on because this is a giant company that makes a ton of money and the way they make the ton of money is they patent plants they genetically engineered them so that it's uniquely theirs and then they can they decide where they sell it they decide what price they have for it and you can't do anything about it and you have to buy new stuff every year and buy if it crossed pollinates with the neighbor they can sue the neighbor for copyright infringement it's completely crazy they've they've figured out a way to copyright life and they've actually tried to do it with pig parts and Monsanto's crazy I mean they've try to do with a bunch of different shit but this should have never been able to get to this position the all this is the best evidence that the United States needs the best evidence yeah something like Monsanto the best evidence that our political system is completely corrupt yeah because if you were really looking out for people there's no fucking way you would let a company make a bunch of shit take plants patent them then sue people because the fucking the the air carries their pollen they cross pollinate neighbors plants and then this neighbor just even though where the fuck he got that shit from you assholes you know you get you get to get to sue them and you're gonna take it go to court and there's India in India there's a whole bang fucking giant group of farmers that have been killing themselves because they they get indebted to Monsanto and they can't afford to pay their bills they're my shadows like gangsters that's like my own yeah they will they will shut you down if you don't play bald yeah well this is crazy because you got to think about how much political pull that they have and the fact that they still lost in court I mean that that says a lot yeah you know I think people are rising up and they're getting tired of this bullshit it's ridiculous what these people have allowed to take place and it doesn't have to continue along the same lines you know what we really need is healthy food what we don't need is a bunch of fucking crazy shit where companies come along and genetically modify crops and then they take those crops and then they they you know they sell them to people with no evidence whatsoever about the long-term implications of this the exposure to some of these chemicals yeah and what this what is this gonna do to the environment or playing with god man you're doing really crazy shit when you start altering life and then entering that I mean this isn't as simple as you know packaging a new kind of soap yeah you're doing you're doing something pretty fucking crazy yeah that people are gonna it's gonna be in their system there's not that much yeah there's not that much evidence like it's like or not that much for history of genetically modified foods I mean we need like 10 20 30 years to really analyze what the fuck it does the environment yeah people and what's the chain reaction you know what is the wings of the butterfly do from the modified food to the you know how's it affect the ecosystem that all of a sudden it takes over yeah you know it's it's it's weird man it's weird when you start fucking with life you know yeah but you know um I talked to his dude it was talking about uh I was just listening to the Opie and Anthony show and what's-his-face was on um Nicolas Cage and he was talking about the black rhino going extinct this year mm-hmm and I was telling us do this it was like well we can just bring it back you know if we would just fucking bring back the black rhino oh you mean like you can't they do that yeah can't they do that I mean it's art they're talking about painting that right now or lilium amis yeah but then it becomes the question of okay do we need rhinos though no really no wooly mammoths just to have a couple like at zoos I think be awesome did you see there's a video in Siberia of a bear walking across a stream with a fish in his mouth and it's really blurry and so people it's a woolly mammoth in Siberia and then other people are going or a bear with efficiently how come the woolly mammoth has a blue nose right it's stupid fucks like maybe there's a woolly mammoth there's there's a whole industry devoted to falsely seeing stuff you know there's like there's all this shows like full our programmes yeah this is we're going to talk about the shit that we saw yeah it's just people telling you it's awesome shit like that's fucking bullshit man you didn't see anything you know what I really learned that when I did that game showing my head show I did this show for CBS and what the show was was a game show with hidden cameras and the way it worked was we would I I was the host I don't have a dude with a little earpiece out send them out to a place and the cameras were already in place hidden cameras were in place I go alright dude you ready you go yeah I go here's the deal you're a reporter and you are there for the biggest story of your life there was a UFO over Hollywood and all these people saw it but by the time you got your camera there and got it set up all the people went away so what you got to do is you got to find someone to get on camera with you and and talk about their UFO experience and you got to say you got to get them to say that they were abducted and probed and they were like oh and the guys like ok ok ok alright here we go and it was immediate it was a media it was like no one said no he goes listen man I'm a reporter for the sanad here's the deal there was just a UFO sighting do you think I could get you to come on camera and say that you saw it oh yeah yeah and then people would just start talking they would like well it was bright silver and it was spinning over the over the hemisphere and what happened was and they just completely like detailed accounts yeah it's like at this point people been so poisoned like pop culture and by the idea of UFOs like they can just recall they just they just have this like yeah frozen fake idea in their head from a hundred movies and they can just oh yeah I remember what happened in that movie I just yeah it was lights and light detail they've seen it it's seen it a hundred times it was amazing yeah they just they just lied they didn't like it not only did they lie they lied and we're willing to sign a waiver saying that they lied and that we were gonna show it on TV right of all who's that it was nice people love those she had about stories because they'd love to be the one to report yeah everybody there's a fascination with like you wanna know what happened yeah and you get to report and then and because everybody focuses on you and they're like what happened and so if you're willing to give them like the goods people are willing to listen and you get like you know you get a charge out of out of being the one that told everybody yeah they love it anyone like it's amazing that they're willing to just make it up yeah just for that for that feeling I think people there's a lot of people that live lives of such shit yeah their life sucks so bad yeah that they almost believe what they're saying when they tell you some story about seeing Bigfoot sure you know yeah is probably a bear and it was 20 years ago and they were scared and it was dusk and there was like he made eye contact with me I'll tell you this right now yeah did the day I die yeah I swear on my on the eyes of my children yeah that was a sasquatch and they fucking believe it man by the time 20 years have passed yeah they've added all kinds of shit man then there ain't even real any holding I told him you remember you said you have like anything more than like five years ago what what is that really do you really might remember some like really intense shit yeah barely barely yeah but barely I mean you could recall data and information but how much of that memory can you really pull out I remember making up a story as a kid now we were making up a story as a kid and spinning it to people to the point where it was like I would just tell people in detail for like years from like fifth grade on so I like and then one day I was like I'm fucked I've made this shit up like I just completely made this up I told the story to people about it cuz we lived in Minneapolis they're like how cold you get in Minneapolis and I was like December 24th of 1989 it was 74 below zero yeah and I was like it was so cold my teachers ears froze and they fell off and they're like shut up I was like they had a bus stop we're outside Sacred Heart bus came up she didn't have a hat on we never it was like the coolest thing ever she went to touch her left ear and it fell off it was frozen and then when she went to grab her right it fell off in her hand and her ears fell off I saw it fuck yeah that's what happened is real like one day I was just like telling somebody you know that this doesn't snow room like yeah I think I made this shit up God because I made it up for that feeling but I got you know went like when we first discovered the feeling we heard 10 years old and you tell someone some wild shit and they go what you're like how that feels kind of good and so like it was like a ten year old version of that that I told when I was 10 11 12 and then finally when I'm like 14 15 I was like I I don't think I saw this actually I think I was 10 years old and I told you my teachers ears fell off do you think that's what happened with OJ that oh that his story is just became almost like indiscernible like maybe this is real I don't know what I don't know man I think that is such a crazy reality as we have that we had that figure in our lifetime mm-hmm that is a spectacular climb and fault hmm there's almost that's almost unparalleled and you have to think about to be a Heisman trophy-winning like unlike top top-tier world-class athlete and celebrity that parlayed it into this awesome TV movie career unusual it was a rental car that was like do that is that's it like that's basically that's the top of the mountain when it comes to an athlete's career yeah and the contracting it saw Banbury that's that's a model to follow like it had to do it and then for that to be the guy fucking just butchered people isn't it crazy cotton hop over some pussy okay and then stole I wanted to steal back his my shit man let it go son it's just no see and now he's locked up for another like he let he beat the craziest like the crime that we all know that's so crazy he beat that charge and went back for some dumb shit some dumb beyond dumb shit the memorabilia taking his memorabilia backovic alimentation was that what it was the Palestine house station manners on the UFC oh really does what was my first Las Vegas gig really you played the power station power station wow that's locals right those are Latinos yeah that's a locals and people from out of town that don't know any better yeah that's the place to we're like you or people actually don't like the gamble like to go to those places they just like the gamma because they have better odds yeah that's true yeah cuz if you go to like the Bellagio or is one of the big casinos MGM Grand yeah something like that they kind of I think you know they're probably better getting your money yeah that's mostly bullshit it seems like it's just oh here let's go spend some money that she's not a quick man it's weird it's weird I've seen people lose hundreds of thousands of dollars we watched oh yeah yeah well I've been coming to Vegas I've been going to Vegas doing the UFC's since 2001 2002 that's when I started going to watch 2001 I started going right after 9/11 I saw Tito Ortiz take on Vladimir Matyushenko that was right after September 11 you called that I don't know I was a I was in the audience we're watching yeah I didn't didn't work for them back then I uh I was just a fan and so from then you know to 2012 I've seen some people throw some crazy money away and just a weird place when you have one area where all the rules are different yeah one area just one area one area we could fucking drink whenever you want one spot we got this spot and you could just fucking 6 o'clock in the morning and everything you don't ever have to leave your hotel dude we got a giant hotel where you can wander around yeah we have world-class food here and everywhere you can gamble if they had a strip club in the major hotels it would really be the perfect place a strip club and a pool hall I become you never have to you never have to go anywhere the strip club would be that that would be like a hundred million dollar a year like revenue general it probably would if they put it right but you know it would be too much too much too dark to Deccan and make people leave you know make people go somewhere yeah but there's there's places they have in Vegas they're like the biggest trip clubs in the world did you know you're enormous that like you know Macau China do you know I'm talking about it's a place in China yeah no that's theirs they that's their Vegas that's their gambling that that place the China use place does something like three or four times the the money that Vegas does like it blows it away is it because of the volume or because they get one more I would think it's a combination of two Chinese gamble hard dude I didn't know they they build the places in Vegas a lot of them build it to the stand we yack to for the time for Asian for things way yeah and this the numbers of the floors are important yeah it's set up as important and there's things that aren't lucky they they make sure that they they do it in accordance with what what Chinese people think is lucky MGM and damn used to be remember with the entrance of the MGM was when it opened what was the main entrance was a lion's mouth you were walking in time yeah oh and it's bad luck for them or and the Asians were like no thanks and they're like hold on a second we're gonna take that shit down right now I got look at the lines from right that's right that's right I don't wanna walk through a lion's mouth yeah well that's because in their country and get eaten by a fucking tiger right you know they just took that lion out at the MGM you know the lion that was living in there yeah I always thought it's the most depressing things terrifying and they attacked a trainer there once oh right yeah yeah there's this video of it lion attacks trainer at MGM yeah it's pretty fucked up and pull that shit up see we're gonna find it yeah they're the I think my favorite is the shark tank at Mandalay Bay that's amazing traction that's a dope-ass aquarium setup yeah they have a huge tank filled with sharks and they have these cool ass jellyfish and the jellyfish are all like under these psychedelic neon lights and they're floating around mm-hmm that's a badass fish tank yes there's a crazy video dude it's a bizarre video the MGM the guys are in the tank with the LA put your hand down so I can see the MGM guys are in the tank with giant male lions man and for whatever reason the Lions is just like bitch here he gets up I don't know what happens he just finds the guy weak you know he just stay I bet they're just annoyed man they're trapped in this fucking box with these little pink bitches that think that they could survive like why do you think you could stand next to a lion I don't care if you raised that thing with a bottle look at the size that look at he just decides to Jack the dude look at that man just decides to fuck that dude up for no reason and the female jumps in and even if they're playing even if he's playing it's like whatever man look at him he just goes after that guy for for no reason and that guy's like oh shit and the other guy for whatever reason he's listening to the other guy so the other guy gets in between the two of them and they de Lyonne chases him the guy almost gets jacked Wow how scary must have been if people took that shit with her cellphone yeah look at the size of his fucking head and all that crazy hair around him what a nutty animal man that's crazy I did not hear about this yeah well nobody died but it was a freak moment and you know they have that hair around their neck just so that other lions can't kill them it's really bored yeah but it was interesting that the girl lion kind of like was like hey stop what you're biting a human like did you notice that she kind of would have been like can I bite him too shit got crazy if some blood came out and she might have fucked them up too cuz they're the hunters yeah the females the hunters have you been following this whole thing with the judge nappy tanto that got fired yeah Fox Business faster that's crazy and that the whole is I didn't know anything about the Israeli connection that's a little thing that pulled out video up okay so we can listen to it because it's not long right and it's Judge Napolitano he had a show on fox business where he would really be like super honest about stuff and you know really have an astute breakdown of how our political system really functions yeah and how are the American public's been lied to from the beginning and the way he did it is by posing a bunch of questions what if this what if that would in the way he does it man it's it's it's that's a really different video that was time listen to this now that's a different video what you're talking about I'll find that this was the video that got him fired and fired yeah he got fired the other day for this broadcast well no that's that's the other video was on that as well I see the one that you just pulled up but yeah the other video was being touted as something that got him fired as well apparently they were gonna fire him no matter what and this was his his go out right but listen to what he says it's an establishment that never meaningfully changes what if that establishment doesn't want and doesn't have the consent of the governed what if the two-party system was actually a mechanism used to limit so-called public opinion what if there were more than two sides to every issue but the two parties wanted to box you into a corner one of their corners what if there's no such thing as public opinion because every thinking person has opinions that are uniquely his own what if what we call public opinion was just a manufactured narrative that makes it easier to convince people that if their views are different then there's something wrong with that or there's something wrong with them what if the whole purpose of the Democratic and Republican parties was not to expand voters choices but to limit them what if the widely perceived differences between the two parties was just an illusion what if the heart of the government policy remains the same no matter who's in the White House what if the heart of government policy remains the same no matter what the people what what if those wanted differences between Democrat and Republican were actually just minor disagreements what if both parties just want power and are willing to have young people fight meaningless wars in order to enhance that power what if both parties continue to fight the war on drugs just to give bureaucrats and cops bigger budgets and more jobs what if government policies didn't change when government leaders did what if no matter who won an election government stayed the same what if government was really a revolving door for political hacks that's on exploiting the people once they're in charge what if both parties supported welfare war debt bailouts and big government what if the rhetoric that candidates displayed on the campaign trail was jumped after electoral victory what if Barack Obama campaigned as an anti-war prosavana Bertie's candidate and then waged senseless wars while assaulting your rights that the Constitution is supposed to protect boom what if George W Bush campaigned on a platform of non-intervention and small government and then waged a foreign policy of muscular military intervention and a domestic policy of vast government borrowing and growth what if Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over but actually just convinced Republicans like Newt Gingrich that they can get what they want out of big government - what if the Republicans went along with it what if Ronald Reagan spent six years running for president promising to shrink the government but then the government grew while he was in the White House what if notwithstanding Reagan's ideas and cheerfulness and libertarian rhetoric there really was no Riggin revolution at all what if all this is happening again what if Rick Santorum is being embraced by voters who want small government even though senator Santorum voted for the Patriot Act for an expansion of Medicare and for raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars what if Mitt Romney is being embraced by voters who want anyone but Barack Obama but they don't realize that Mitt Romney might as well be Barack Obama on everything from warfare to welfare what if Ron Paul is being ignored by the media not because as it claims he's unappealing or unelectable but because he doesn't fit into the pre manufactured public opinion mold used by the establishment to pigeonhole the electorate and create the so-called narrative that drives media coverage of elections what if the biggest difference between most candidates was not substance but style what if those stylistic differences were packaged as substantive ones to reinforce the illusion of a difference between Democrats and Republicans with mitt want Mitt Romney wins and ends up continuing most of the same policies that Barack Obama promoted what if Barack Obama's policies too are merely extensions of those from george w bush what if a government that manipulated us could be fired what if a government that lacked the through and knowing consent of the governed could be dismissed now as you can cruz what if it were possible to have a real game-changer what if we need a ron paul to preserve and protect our freedoms from the government that's what you have read for what if we can make elections matter again what if we could do something about this from new york defending freedom every night of the week so depressing that we're really in a situation where this is the situation now we're really stuck here we're really this is where we're at 2012 is that the final absolutely right I don't know if that was his final broadcast but it was a very powerful and what is yet the other one that you talks about he makes connections on 9/11 with Israeli at like how it's like it's really weird to actually watch it what was their reason what did they announce was the reason for firing him I don't know man I don't think they did I think you know the look people get fired for all sorts of different things all of you I'm not necessarily sure that he got fired because of that right you know but that's definitely something he went pretty fucked it was this guy getting far - oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's popular it should be even more popular now though the things that he said they're gonna they're gonna take off on the internet you know that videos you take off the internet already is right what is it what's the hits on right now four hundred and forty four thousand yeah and by the way there's a gang of those it's not just that one yeah there's a gang of those are out there that's not just one person put it up on YouTube yeah yeah it's fucking powerful shit man he's absolutely right - I mean how would it how do you fire the government though that's the yeah James something's gonna happen though something's happening you know and I think government's recognizing it as well you know this is gonna be an adjustment there's gonna be something there has to be because otherwise it's a dictatorship you know at a certain point in time when you're really not doing the will of the people at all and you really are suppressing the people and you really are taking away liberties you're really trying to turn us into a fucking crazy dictatorship yeah it's really not much different than that I don't know how anybody views this shit without being cynical after you after Obama after well just after you turn a certain age like I feel like at all I really do feel like it dull doesn't matter like whoever you vote for that nothing is really gonna be different you know what has it ever really like you know you start hearing that when the speeches start coming about with time to change Hollywood I'm not I'm not a I'm a Washington outsider and I'm about to go in there we're gonna change it up now that's the always the one where you're like that's not gonna happen man well yeah after a certain age you realize it's not gonna happen well you realized they're not telling the truth if Obama wanted to say some really radical things he could have really said it you know Chris Rock really did this really fascinating interview recently we said that he thinks that Obama's gonna wait until he's second term then he's gonna do some crazy shit I'm like God you know that sounds like your wishful thinking you know that sounds to me like well you paid attention to what he has done almost irreversible damage that National Defense Authorization Act that treats the United States like a battlefield and allows indefinite suspension or detention of American civilians with no warrant that's insanity you don't need that it's not wooden we're not falling apart we don't have violence in the streets every day we're not in the middle of an Arab Spring situation we don't have nuclear bombs dropping on our city what the fuck are you doing instigating or pushing forward those kinds of laws and legislation the number one thing that we're supposed to be about is the pursuit of Liberty it's supposed to be liberty and justice for all that's like that's how it ends right with liberty and justice for all that's what we want and you're taking away Liberty for what for what are you giving us extra justice is that what you but no that's bullshit yeah it is it's a hundred percent bullshit it's not representative of the people it's it's sad and it's got to change just how how does it change I don't know it scares the shit out of everybody right absolutely yeah that judge is on Twitter under judge Knapp in AP oh really maybe get him on an upcoming podcast too soon so maybe even talk to us sure he'd probably lock us in jail I don't know about that his hair is nap he's just a good pomade what's your full name was his name Napolitano yeah I called nappy tan Oh cuz he has an MP tan I'm following him now he's only got 55,000 followers mmm Freedom Watch yeah yeah cancel that shit hey man Alex Jones we need get Alex Jones on this podcast also sometime yeah alex is gonna do it he'll do it when he's in LA again and Alex is fucked and if you have an Alex on our podcast you'll get a view as to what's up he's right about a lot of shit man I mean he's a soldier he's out there fucking beating the bushes he daily said he's a daily thing right - oh yeah there's a whole studio yeah yeah oh yeah his studio is pretty fucking impressive it shows huge it says it's enormous there's a lot of people listen to it yeah you know it's all doom and gloom though man yeah I've seen I've seen class alone gentlemen gloom the best show we ever had was the time with Joey Diaz took over I remember that I remember that day we've talked about it too many times in the podcast yeah hash it but I remember those glorious things I've ever seen have you ever been the type of person that when you drive around you see like a hot chick like you'll wink at them where you like no give them kissy faces and nothing Oh lately I've been doing it more really just because I realized that because I realized you pretty much can do that and you'll never see that person ever again they'll never know he'll be you putting out a creeper field no but I don't feel weird about it be one side just be like making like silly faces at home where oh god I just even worse like they don't even know you and you're making silly faces it's just funny seeing people's reactions I love it do you how many people there's a lot of fear that you are generating yeah you have some bad mood you up there well there's its lot mostly laughter laughter I got hoes to the laughter they'll laugh yeah yeah oh that's good yeah it's just like they look over like what the fuck's going on over here probably that's what you just decided to be a creep at this age yeah I don't know why it started I think it's because it's I saw somebody do it to somebody else once and I was like that's hilarious see that person just made that person like laughs and then drove off and never to see that person again so have you ever been around the one guy who can't not hit on a chick you know that guy who you're hanging out with them and you you you can't even hang out with them cuz they'll just abandon you yeah sure yeah I remember when I was in an apartment in Hollywood when I was like 21 22 and had some friends come out and it was one of the guys was that guy who just can't stop so when I went to bed I had my bedroom we had like three friends in the living room and one girl we all we had all gotten to school together and I was I offered her I was like you can sleep in my bed like not in a creepy way but like but like I'll fuck you like I'm gonna try but I'm not gonna make it like so anyways she was like now I'm good I'm also got here and I was like all right like you know right fine and then like five minutes later I got like like a knock on the door I was like what's up and she's there and she was like yeah he just tried to lick my neck when I was I went to sleep I was like you want to sleep here now she was like yeah I was like okay that's cool and

comfort and then you just you know I didn't I didn't she cuddled with you at all no I think it was very much like cuz she when somebody just is leaving she was just leaving like that shit was really uncomfortable I was gonna be like alright let me extend that feeling for Ryan no but like you try to settle in to a new level and then creep slowly honestly I could tell you this there's a lot of times when I was single that I didn't pursue that stuff because I was too tired and I would cuz you're too tired I would just go to sleep why is that why are you so tired no I mean like when was late

star and he goes oh you are you guys alright we can do that Brian's office oh you know when you're dating a porn look what he said is he's like what you should be fine because they get tested every 20 days and I'm like yep that's exactly a bit in my act he's like oh you mooch off for the Terra test when I get up exactly he's a funny doctor that just guy's really good in he said tell Tom you know

like everyone the rooms like what them fuck and then I'm like I'm sorry I'm not pretty enough never mind I open at the doctor's that's hilarious everybody in that room probably had no idea what was going on so what did he say about your lungs and cigarettes and stuff like he said everything is perfect I was good I've never gone to the White House I would like to second that evaluation what do they check when they check your lungs they make you answer and that's it they just like make you do huge deep breaths why they like tests eat later they listen like all up and down your chest and your back and then how long does it take for you to die from cigarettes I don't know man it's just it really matters of you I think if you have cancer in your family I really don't have cancer in it some people are genetically just don't get it I think so man yeah stories right oh I know I know a friend's grandparents who lived into their 90's and smoked and drank and ate red meat and whoa they just died they didn't die of cancer is that old age well they had a good time there was some island yep having him in drinking this day there was some thing that I read once I don't know if it's documented but that 100% of all people that live to be over 100 eat red meat really yeah who's never been a documented case of a vegetarian lived to be over 100 there could be total horseshit don't really fucking crazy vegans don't you text me about this eat me up any do it vegans vegans are their quickest to the fucking the tweet the end the angry tweet the angry Dietary tweet yeah hmm they are and the quickest in cilia too it's as quick as the diarrhea I think a lot of fiber involved with that vegan diet I love fucking a good vegan meal though I love I've had a few vegetable meals I drink that kale shake every day that's fantastic have a kale salad a few times a week from a place yeah so hard to get grass-fed meat these days yeah apparently all of its getting consumed up in Northern California all the hippies up there love it it's yeah yeah all natural grass meat yeah it's way better for you and these just go to Whole Foods they don't have it no they're out of it a lot really yeah because up north look there's only a certain amount of people that have grown grass-fed meat and it's become super popular lately so all these you know it's more popular in Berkeley in San Francisco I'm sure then down here in retard Ville so they they can sell all their their cows up there I ship them all the way down to Los Angeles yeah so they're having an issue like last Tuesday though the Whole Foods near me didn't even get a ship in a grass-fed me Wow yeah I have to go there on Tuesday to get the meat it's crazy that's the only time they hates the difference like fuck yeah a hundred percent it's a totally different meat it's a totally different animal because the the cow that is raised on corn their fat fucks there they're marbled and it's really delicious yeah you know it's it's really really fucking yummy cuz all that fat gets like a ribeye from a corn corn raised cow is great because it's so juicy but it's not quite as healthy for you it doesn't taste the same when you get a grass-fed ribeye there's much less marbling and you got to cook it quicker because it'll dry out yeah it's there's much less fat in it so it's a it's you you sort of see a get better piece yeah god damn it's good though whoa it's totally different it's almost like a gamey animal not gamey yes it's it's you know it tastes like Buffalo almost yeah it tastes better it tastes like that you're eating a healthy animal yeah you know yeah there's some steaks I've had where I'm like oh man like you can feel your body kind of slowing down yeah grass-fed beef though is supposed to be way healthier for you two is something about the actual animal being healthy that like a lot of guys I know a lot of fighters have switched to grass-fed meat recently my buddy Einstein he listens to salt thyme is one of Eddie's black belts said his performance really started increasing when he upped his greens and unchanged to all grass-fed meat really said big difference yeah yeah it's just healthier you know just makes sense that your body would respond better if you're eating healthier animals yeah it doesn't make sense we're fuckin up man yeah fuckin up and eat your veggies and fruits fucking up our goddamn Monsanto fruits and vegetables and crazy man fat fuck cows and our farm grown fish cuz all the fish in the ocean yeah man you know they said that the next hundred years is gonna be the last wild fish in the world and within the next hundred years there will be no more wild fish in the oceans what yep well we'll have out fish the entire region leloni company also say that no they think about it from an exponential growth point of view that you know there'll be more people in a hundred years you know I mean think about a hundred years ago there was only like a billion people on the planet now there's seven billion so right it's crazy what's gonna be a hundred years now it's gonna be 30 billion where they gonna get all their protein from a lot of it's gonna be fish it's easy to catch and they're gonna sky once the the you know they're gonna they're gonna fucking just troll everything there is a sock all that fucking fish out of there they're gonna eat whales they're gonna do everything they can eat they're gonna everything that humans can consume and then 100 years now we're gonna have to figure it out you know just be an empty ocean - that would be cranes that would be crazy could you imagine if we actually kill everything in the ocean within a thousand years if people lived to be a thousand years why is that outside the realm of possibility yeah it was something I tweeted earlier today about the Garbage Patch mm-hmm that some lady went to the garbage Patchett's in the middle of Pacific Ocean for function oh no bigger than Texas there's a giant hunk of garbage all plastic that's kind of caught together in like this one swarm it's like caught a bug are guessing them like the way the tides go is one area where it's collected where it's enormous it's bigger than the state of Texas which takes like more than a day to drive through all right so that's how much garbage is out there and it's just getting bigger it's gonna keep getting bigger forever yeah is that a homeless persons heaven you think they all talked about it as if it's like Disney I think the plastic breaks down though I think that's part of the issue is that these salt water breaks it down to like jelly like little particles and it's it's really fucked it's not like just like stuff floating you get scooped up yeah it becomes like almost little yeah it's fucked up man we're so creepy think about what we do we kill all the rhinos we fucked the ocean over we eat all the fish we throw our garbage in it your drive-by um trash well they call it trash plants oh yeah Shore your landfills landfills yeah and you see how like they're like you know they're a higher altitude yeah than like the street level you know that's just gonna keep growing like yeah that's gonna be like a building of God yeah you know it's like mountains like Hills stanhope and I filmed the the finale of the man show in a garbage dump really yeah because the girls are trying to con us into taking them to an island it was two of the girls that were in the old man show and we didn't get along with them so well and they were like Adam and Jimmy used to take us to the Bahamas we should do that still you should take it to the Bahamas will film the final scene there and then we thought about it and Doug and I were like we should do it at a garbage and I was like we think about him and I wanted to do it a garbage dump in New Jersey I wanted to do it like the stingiest grossest dump I I said you know if you're at home and you're watching us these two assholes hang out with girls who never fuck you on you know in a place where you can never afford to go to you know hanging out well how is that fun for you yeah I go be much more fun for you to watch us in a dump sure it's so much funny I do so we yeah that's where I felt like yeah they were so mad it was gross and their defense it's really funny that they asked for it though first they they were like what's up with the Bahamas yeah they wanted to go garbage no well you know it's I don't blame a man that culture of the the hot chick culture of asking for things yeah they would like you know rub the writers shoulders and you're gonna put us in a scene you know that kind of thing yeah that's gross shit yeah well so that was the culture of it yeah yeah who's there's a lot of gross nuts going on but sure not none of those as gross as that garbage dump no for all of it liking foul it's so bad we're getting lunch and it's fucking garbage dust floating in the air yeah it was on Catalina Catalina has a giant garbage do they really yeah enormous I don't have a trip then so it's a bummer man that whole society I think a lot of our garbage goes out there that sucks yeah it does suck Catalina fur dope for folks who don't know is an island outside of the coast of Los Angeles now forty miles off the coast fourteen I'm never gonna do you do dope yeah it's cool man there's no cars driving around just golf carts and shit yeah it's weird it's big enough that you could actually live there you can go on a ferry or a helicopter yeah I'll take the helicopter really maybe that's what we should put our compound the next

see me not me bro tell you what man fuck that hello got that grab their fucking the propeller of my hand and I'll spin it myself yes I got heart I got a lot of heart you can't measure a go you can't fuck with my heart bro the size of the dog in the fight it's decided to fight in the dog there is this and hunt would you live on Catalina but if we got a giant piece of land on Catalina and that's where we set up our compound I'd have to check it out first because I I don't like not having best buys and things like it's totally true we should we should seriously look into a good place where we can all move yeah just everybody outside of La but close enough we'll just get a giant chunk of land get a few hundred acres yeah all of us build houses there do you know how dope that would be if we could have our own like M night shamalamadingdong village that'd be awesome come on the lake I like lace yes how cool would it be for real if we all we got everyone that we know that's cool and we decided we're all gonna be some property and build houses there yeah and all your friends live and like in the neighborhood fucking awesome if you live down the street and Kreischer was there you can

of the things I'm actually thinking of doing it myself do it do it yourself will pump the shit out of it up here that's one folks very old and the Tommies hilarious you know Tom and I met a long time ago when I was doing the maxim tour with Charlie Murphy and John Heffron and what we do is we go to these different places and they would have like a local guy open up for us everyone that opened up for us was really funny it was really good like local talent because it was the maximum Bud Light comedy tour and they really did a good job of casting the local guys but when we did Phoenix Tommy wasn't even local just somehow or another he got involved in this and he was one of those guys where he went up and I went holy shit I go this guy's fucking funny and it was dark and it was really well written and became besties ever since then that was fun and that's actually the thing I was telling you is that every time I've opened for you since then your crowds are always the shit so there are I I'm totally pleading to the Joe Rogan yeah come out if I'm gonna always been you guys are always amazing audience well Colorado's my place and he knows that I fucking love Colorado if I could to convince my fucking crazy wife eventually I will be I can call that place calls me I'll be back and that that Club Wendy is awesome she's my favorite club owner in the history of club owner she's the shit she is awesome she's in she owns and runs both of them she's up just a badass woman coolest fuck real fan of comedy a real friend comedy or you know she has an open mic program that's better than anybody's in the country or anybody's I've ever been involved with ever in my whole time in comedy when you do when you do comedy works they have like you'll work with different people through the weekend right like different people in show and although they're local guys that will open for you are all headliners yeah organize you have just headliners opening for you they're great yeah great then the whole show is fucking she takes care of guys she pays him well food is great especially in South South she has a gourmet restaurant yeah oh yes it's fucking phenomenal goddamn I love Colorado snowing his fuck there though eighty degrees here socket socket yeah but snow is awesome when you don't have to go anywhere remember those those times when you go out your back porch and you just fucking hear nothing yeah knowing that the way sound just gets absorbed and snow yeah I love it some great fucking times if someone I live in it I just but I do like yeah visiting snow I like visiting it too I would like to get a house somewhere where it's cold you know where I could visit on occasion and you know I just have to get some more baller money but now I'm fucked because it looks like Fairfax is gonna fucking bite it what why it's over Darian I thought it was like some of the best ratings he has huge a drop that much down well there's a bunch of issues I think some of the one of the issues is let's be honest it's a bit lowbrow and NBC is trying to have quality programming like the aw are you serious I think so yeah I think there's even if numbers you have a yeah they haven't decided yet look they've got a point man you know I see what you were trying to do you know I know Hayden I love doing it just because I love the guys that I work with I love you David Hurwitz and Mac units and Rupert and all the people at all Ruby Thompson the director to all the people that I worked with were really fuckin awesome people they're really fun to be around it's like a family and I I missed them you know the five years that I didn't work with them and then I'm working with him again for this really short season it was really fun but it's not my favorite thing to do it's I'm good at it I've been doing it for a long time I know how to I know how to host a game show but I preferred doing stand-up and working for the UFC and this yeah they should move that show to HBO have nudity like you're eating fucking fish from girls vaginas and yeah yeah I think it's over and you know the other thing was like I was telling them that the donkey loads were too much I was like you can't do this we can't do this but yeah you see approved it babe you see approve it and I was like just because they approved it doesn't mean you should be doing this like shit is really you could see that when I'm the voice of reason I'm the one who's telling you we're going too far that's it yeah like what is happening here it's just they got a little crazy you want to have an awesome show you know whatever it was it was a fun thing while acid and I honestly believe that these new episodes were better than any of the ones we ever did before I'll enjoyed it I don't see anything wrong with it and I think it's silly that NBC wouldn't do that because they all their other shows are hurt and bad they stuck that with that Whitney show this got horrible reviews or ratings i watch the other day was not good but you know it's hard it's hard to do a good sitcom it's hard to do it right and you know I heard she's a funny stand-up I've never seen her perform before but I heard that Krystal E is a funny comic as well and you know he's buddies with Brian I've never seen him he's funny so you know how is it that they can have two really funny people and not have a funny show a lot of times this is too many cooks in the kitchen a lot of times they're trying to accomplish something and trying to get a vibe going they're trying to find their footing they believe in it though because they renewed it they're gonna for another season did they yeah they're both funny people yeah both are funny people well it takes a while man I really enjoyed my time on Newsradio but I got a real deep respect for the craft of creating a television show yeah you know and that's one of the reasons why I never did it again one of the reasons why I never get it again was first of all I knew that the guys that I was working with were incredibly talented and it's such Paul Sims the executive producer was such an interesting and intelligent guy and his sensibilities were so out there I knew that after like working with him it was gonna be really hard to do another sort of sitcom yeah real mainstream even if it's like a successful one yeah it's hard to do crap yeah you realize that that that how much about writing is everything to everything it so ever you see these shows that are so good you're like oh yeah I shouldn't say it's everything because good writing with shit delivery and let shit comics and shit actors is not good either right it's a huge part of the problem and a part of the equation rather and you need real eccentrics to it too right one of the things that these guys were they're not a force to there's a couple of them that were stand-ups you know that we're on the staff but for the most part they were just really bright silly guys yeah who knew how to put together something funny and so fucking those rare the very Matt Stone and Trey Parker there's there's a hundred pretenders oh no at least four yeah you think anymore you can get caught on one of those sitcoms where you just like you're reading the script I'm like what the fuck am i doing man yeah there's those intangibles too like a show airs and sometimes it just gets legs people are drawn to it you know yeah and then sometimes you feel like everything's right like we got the right yeah scripts are great we've got great actors every now and there's people don't respond to it man that's pop yeah a lot of times it's who's the production company yeah what kind of pull they have with the network yeah they decide to put the show but I would definitely do another acting gig I really enjoyed doing that movie with Kevin James yes zookeeper movie that was a lot of fun but it was mostly fun because Kevin and I have been friends since we were really young and to do a move it even though it's a silly kids movie yeah it's fun it's fun it's fun to act it's fun to do you know the thing with Leslie Bibb and you know the chick from Talladega Nights I was like this is kind of crazy yeah acting with a girl from tell diggin nights I hadn't done any acting in fucking 10 years yeah so was weird that was fun I would I would totally do something like I was totally do a sitcom or something fun act again but for the most part one of the weirdest things about being a comic is that everybody wants to put you into some acting situation where you're gonna do something that's not nearly as funny as your act that's true yeah you know yeah or you can see it like when you audition they ever like like punch it up or you change it you'll add something yeah I'd be like that was really funny like well yeah I kind of had to do this a lot yeah I got a sometimes stuff up sometimes to get man you know I got yelled at one time to would they say the guy laughed and then we did it we did it again and he was like that's just rude man and I was like what he was like that's rude and he meant it was rude that I tagged the the line you know I made up a line whoa he laughed the first time and then he was like it's really rude you need to drop that I was like whoa fuck him he fucked me up so badly then we did the third take and I was like yeah okay I didn't even move my face I was like a weak bitch yeah and I was like you just laughed at it man like everybody laughed at it that's a hundred percent ego right there yeah he's the he wasn't even the he was a casting guy he wasn't a director or the producer on it he was just like well he's trolling camera then yeah you know whatever it was saying it's rude he's an idiot that was one of the coolest things about news radios that Paul Sam's would let us make up entire scenes for scene didn't work Dave Foley was like the secret producer on a set he would you like rewrite a scene really completely do it differently Dave Foley is a genius his his ability to like see scenes and see jokes and see like you know like you know his sketch background from kids in the hall yeah I created a lot of sketches a great writer awesome you know he got off track with his life and you know you had a lot of hard times we had him on the podcast once talked about is a fascinating fascinating story of caution a cautionary tale you know for him to happen if you're involved in terrible relationship and it was wrong you know you have spiteful ex-wife and the poor guy man it's a really horrendous ya know and that led to all sorts of other issues as well but as a writer and as a like a guy who like as a comedian he said gene just talented guy brilliant just a brilliant really interesting funny guy really smart guy get him back on he was yeah I'd love to have him back on the help his comedy because I haven't heard anything about him yeah very room I saw him driving one day and that's yeah that's sad joy well I know that he's he had some setbacks or he's trying I mean he can't go to Canada at all if he goes to Canada bill arrest him now that's crazy yeah he always like some crazy amount of money then he had a show that took off for a little while you know it got like the pilot got picked up but then it got canceled so oh yeah yeah like I saw that I saw a commercial for it's a hard fucking world dude it is dude the world of trying to create a sitcom is not fun no you know and the odds of you being there's so many people out there trying to do it oh I've written a couple have you ever in a couple scripts yeah pilots yeah it's like I don't know it's the other thing is comes naturally something as brain they're just pulling your hair out and then you you rewrite it so many times in some reason they're like yeah you make some more change I've already written it fucking 40 times well not only that by the way they will never let you create your own show right because if you create your own show you own the show if you own the show that's fucking billions yeah they have that thing locked down yeah the only people who can own shows and have be show runners and be executive those people are already deep deep deep in the business it's just very little room for some new new guy who needs his own show you know they have you have to be paired up with some dude dirty the production company they know what's at stake there in everything yeah you can't just come to them independently and say hey NBC my name is Tom Segar my buddy we wrote a sitcom I'm gonna be the creator and executive producer he's gonna be director is that cool with you yeah you guys are creative come on in no way cuz that's a Money Train they're they're giving you a free ticket on the Money Train yeah you know you get like some roseanne style syndication money or Seinfeld syndication money they know what's involved in that in a successful show so they got they got that situation all locked up that's one of the reasons why so many of those shows suck mm-hmm you know they got the same dudes feeding people the same slop you know there's like if you look at like the showrunners of certain like hit shows there's like like the two and a Half Men this eat that dude does like a gang of them the one that Charlie Laurie's brought brawling with yeah that guy does like the band yeah Mike and Molly like that's his - yeah it does yeah it makes ridiculous money God yeah he's got it locked up Wow yeah yeah a dude owns hits television hits when you have loved to see the arguments with him and Charlie Sheen on DVD Oh would it be great if somebody filmed them somebody on the two and a half men said filmed some of the arguments I'm sure they have that fuck we showed the way to fucking yeah egos man you know I think that's the guy who also got do you remember Brett Butler remember her mm-hmm do you remember when she was a big TV star she had a show was a show I'm over her yeah what the fuck was that show yeah god damn it was it Brett Butler show no no no aging Caroline no fuck grace under fire yeah grace under fire well she was like she was you know she was fucking big-time man you know she was the star of a sitcom

it they pulled the plug on that bitch she's homeless yeah now she's vanished off the face of the earth I mean she was an enormous star yeah she was enormous man and she was also an enormous star as a stand-up comedian you know she was really charismatic you seen the homeless picture of her she was on yeah she's real home for real has they interviewed her and she's just she looks like she hit a

of the first time I bought drugs the first time I ever bought drugs tell me what you know do you maybe the first time you buy alright told me that you have story I bet the first time I bought drugs I was in high school and I went to a small high school so I was trying to be like not make a thing to ask about it at first you know because you don't want it to get around and like be oh okay so you were curious yeah I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know who to ask because if you ask like at a small school you like it could blow up real fast right that's how guys were traveled so my friend Steve had just transferred from like the big high school like from a high school with like 5,000 kids and so it was like a weekend I was like let's get a sack and I think we did we just seen menace to society and we were like it was suck but we were trying to tow it be like hardcore guys like pulling the Hat to the side be like he's blue did you wear your hat suicide no but I think you know a lot of like throwing swag in the shit right he's like you know hey let's get a sack you get your blackness on definitely feeling it morning like what's up right I do this shit I got your back right making shit up little too white right yeah and so comfortable with your existence totally and then he's like I hook I know the guy so this is like a Saturday night this like long green like old-school 70s Cadillac pulls up and and it's like he's like that's to do and this guy rolls the window down he's like yo get in the back and I was like all right cool we get in the back after thinking like that's where it goes down and Steve's like yeah this is white Pete I was like what's up white Pete like and then he was called white Pete because they needed to give him a distinction for his name because he was the only white guy that ran with his crew right and he was like we didn't have driver's licenses so he was like exactly what at that moment what we wanted to be in a couple years like he had like the whole unit like the oversize white tee and like you know go train yeah and fucking like fade he was like what's up I'm white people he talked like Snoop Dogg almost oh right and so we're like all right I thought he was like so we're gonna go get it now I was like go get what like I thought were just doing this in the car we wouldn't go get that sack man like oh okay so we started right we'd go 30 minutes in a car we go to the next town over which is Fort Pierce which is definitely a shittier place right so we're driving through Fort Pierce and we go from a Main Street to like single lane highways you know in Florida there's like oh yeah right so we're on a busy then we go to a single lane that has like canals on each side oh yeah and we drive it and then we go from that to a dirt road and then the dirt road off of that dirt road like we're driving down like this is some Forensic Files shit like we're gonna end up on there's a lot of woods yeah la brush groves that kind of shit and I was like fuck man and at this point like I'm thinking about like menace to society and like I want to be in that right now but I'm feeling like feeling really white I'm not like really scared and so and now it's night and it you know it's like because we he came over in the evening already so now it's pitch black outside and we're on a dirt road off of a dirt road like you could scream there's nobody gonna hear shit and on the dirt road up a gravel path I see a light and the light is from a trailer so we pull up to the trailer and we get out and it's me Steve and white Pete and we knock on the door the trailer and this dude opens the door and he has this black guy it has like six dreadlocks you know each dreadlock is like a size of like a king size Snickers bar he's got six snicker bars coming out of the hair and why he's like what's up pat pat he's like what's up white Pete and they give each other hugs I was oh fuck like now this really is like totally menace to society shit right but I'm told so trying to be cool about it like so trying to be cool about it and then he's like these white boys looking for a sack and he's like yeah we could do that so we go in mind you were looking for $20 right and we like with that from our view droven how long is it tell you this is a Travis point it's like we're already 30 miles south why the city we start why would you just say like never mind after 10 miles why does a white peaches sell it to you why does he have to take you on the trip to the guards house I would these are all questions I have don't the balls to ask like I'm in my mind I'm like uh-huh like I'm 14 15 I'm not saying shit to this dude right I'm cool what's up it's gonna sack right so we go into his trailer and he's like right we're gonna get to do that sack we back in 10 minutes I was like who'll be back in 10 minutes he's like we will be you stay here and watch my place and I was like what like what the fuck are you talking about is what I'm thinking but then I just go like yeah cool totally so you're in his trailer and he's like watch it for me I'm like oh no like I'm feeling like that like real fear but I go yeah no problem man like I watch people's houses all the time like it totally fucking right Hera fied right and then he goes like that you walk in the trailer you're in the living room because that's the way trailers right you walk into it there's a bedroom to the right I was like waiting here on the bed he's like there's a 45 and a 12-gauge and he goes anybody comes in my in my house you shoot him and I was like right and then he's like except for my mama my mama comes home don't shoot her and I was like got it and except I kept trying to be cool about it I was like yeah like that's what's up I know I know what you say man go get that SEC totally like trying to be like he was like I they walk out they leave me in his trailer with two guns and a fucking message to not to shoot everybody but his mother and I just sit there and watch the MTV Video Music Awards and the whole time like every show that comes I just I'm rocking I'm actually hoping that it's an intruder versus his mom because I feel like if it's his mom she might accidentally shoot her or how is she gonna react to my explanation like Peppa just told me to wait here well he's getting some weed for me but I'm not but I'm supposed to shoot everybody but you cool with that she's like oh yeah it happens also like how are you gonna react to this so I fucked I mean I'm having a panic attack we finally they come back I get back in with a wee white Pete he drives us back and I'm sitting there because I'm like what the fuck dude that was the worst shit ever like I'm fucking terrified he's like yeah ham and pat pat Stephen Pat became like best friends so they became like like super close like that was like his guy who cooked and I'd be like no dude I don't want to hang out with pat pat at all and like six months later when Steve got his license we went he was like you wanna get some weed today I was like yeah yeah yeah so where we go you know for Pierce pull it to pat pat and I'm like god dammit like so you remember how to get there he did Steve had to started going there all the time oh my god we pull up to his trailer this time he kids out now this time like well they're friends this is probably a much quicker thing he comes out he jumps in the back and he's like I was rolling when I was like ah look for a sack again way up high you just have this shit so this time we went to this buddies the thing pappa scared the shit out of me the first time but that second time he saved our life actually because we went from his trailer the second time where he jumped in the back went to Avenue D which is the fuckin shitty Street in Fort Pierce like if you're going to like every city you know you have like I don't know whatever so you're in there like that's you ever seen have you been in a street where you see open drug dealing where there's not even some type of a sauce Angeles right but but you've been down a street where there's like there's no pretense about it there's yeah like Los Angeles what's with part of it we're film and Fear Factor we're actually filming the Playboy Playmate edition of Fear Factor downtown area and we were watching people sell drugs smoke crack right there you're in a crane yeah well I go look there smoking crack and the girls like oh my god they are smoking crack this is ridiculous yeah yes but no one's protecting us we're here on a crane that was exactly like this where we pulled up in in Steve's car and the windows come down we just get surrounded like the car got surrounded by six guys and they reach in their jackets and they go at this point geysers y'all look familiar and this other guy goes yeah y'all look real familiar y'all have been here before and now when you when somebody says that you look familiar and been here before how would you answer that and you say nope nope all right and exactly at that moment I go No and Steve at the exact same one goes yep yes oh man and then they're like see I told you man y'all look like the white boys they've been snatching bags around here I was like oh fuck like you look like the white boys they haven't taken bags from guys mom I'm like no dude that's not us Steve's like but we have been here before I'm like we you shut the fuck up hat Pat is in the back like hold on he gets out and like walks or talks to all them like a you know like he's the ambassador right like I don't know what the fuck he like I own these guys there was me right like fuckin and they totally let us go but if without without him we would been fucked it was sudden always but is anyway that's not mine that's me pat pat pat pat pat is still I don't know what happened to Pat Pat and white Pete who knows that not good things probably not good things man you should Facebook on your facebook pap-pap that would be the next person that makes up a fake that's a real figure that was I had real fear oh yeah you're like for a good fucking reason whoa like when you feel your stomach dropping you're like what's gonna happen right now oh my god yeah that's terrible shit man you know I was a kid when I was in high school we used to go to Dorchester to eat like late at night I was hanging out with this one kid I lived in Jamaica Plain before I went to high school and Jamaica Plain was like a real shifty neighborhood it's kind of kind of creepy yeah and there was it bordered some really creepy places and I became friends with a couple of those kids and I stayed in touch with them and then when I went to high school I went to visit him a couple of times before I realized it was really fucking dangerous yeah they were going to a bad high school man there their high school situation my high school situation was very different yeah we went to the same middle school together and middle school was kind of okay because kids were young they hadn't gotten a dangerous shit yet and you know this is 1980 you know this is a early it was like when the Sugar Hill Gang would just come out hip hop a hibbity hibbity hip-hop that was the first rap music and it was very friendly in retrospect and things changed radically though when when I left I went to Newton which is like nice suburbs and I lived across the street from a river and it was like woods near me and shit like that yeah and they went to the inner-city high school and they had some fucking tough times man I watched those dudes they were basically involved and just just crime was everywhere around them yeah it was nuts man you know inner-city shit is just no fun at all and I got lucky that you know my parents I'm gonna move to a nicer place and we anyway we would go to these places like late at night when I was hanging out with them you know we'd hang out with some of their friends but you know like we'd go to like Dorchester at like two o'clock in the morning to eat and I first of all couldn't believe what the fuck let me wander around at 14 years old yeah but we were in some place where you there was bulletproof glass they would sell you food but it was through bulletproof glass it was sandwiches yeah and there was like a slot where you would slide the food under yeah and it was like the worst fucking neighborhood you could possibly be in outside of Beirut yeah we're hanging out there and some guy goes don't you like the size I already paid for this shit let him go yeah and I could see the guy like bluffed his way out of a free sandwich and he would walk off and he was eating it like right at the front door like blocking the door like a dog like he got far enough you know for Hugh it was away from danger and he just with no regard for how it looked through just eating it blocking the doorway eating the sandwich yeah then I was like um there's there's people don't know like how bad bad some neighborhoods are in like Hollywood like sunset between like Fairfax and Crescent Heights used to be like yeah and like you know I remember when I worked at a restaurant there and one night man - two weekends in a row first weekend someone got shot in the head on the steps into Denny's which was like blah and then the next weekend somebody came in one into the kitchen took scissors start stabbing people with scissors and stabbing themselves but it was also God but it was also like a criminal hangout because the Denny's on Dennis is a criminal hang out you know if say it's open all night so yeah that's where late-night people people who are up all night could go and hang out so if he can't like it was they just shut it down because they're like everybody who's in here is like pimp hustler a drug dealer and they're murdering people weekend after weekend so they just shut this shit down but that was like there was a dangerous area man Hollywood is so shitty shitty people come to Hollywood who think that they're gonna come we're gonna go I almost killed a guy yesterday coming home from the doctor this is I was probably going 4550 miles an hour and I don't know where the car next to me slams on his brakes I'm a what the fuck so I slammed on my brakes even though I had no idea why he was slamming on his brakes type thing because I couldn't see over his car and slam my brakes and just miss this old man dressed up as a woman and he was just crossing the street like in the middle of the street jaywalking and just screaming at us like like like you could just tell his fucking crazy I'm like lipstick
