watch him Joe anything looking over there bowtie that's classic how old is Pete Rose now ah 50s or 60s 60s I just feel bad that you know there was all the speculation that he had done 75 Wow yeah there was all that speculation that he had gambled on his own team but I don't think that was ever shown ah listen you have to assume I'm gambling he do me a favor Jamie can you put up for Joe Rogan can you put up Petros against Ron Boone in the all-star game this is when you I had to show people at a bar one that I go you youngsters never know Pete Rose's nut let me just show you Pete Rose's Piero's tackles Ron boom but the beauty of this it's an all-star game you never saw this German now oh look at you you beside yourself oh no because I'm hugging Al Jesus shit in the afternoon Oh bowling look at this look Hari this is this guy how he played like this guy was an American Savage oh yeah here's a barbarian Charlie Nestle this is crazy this still occur look at it oh my god he just took him out he tells him don't ever block that fucking base again cocksucker oh shit like he was the last of the real fucking Americans he fucked up yet he bat I'm a gambler but I'm his own shit he wrecked that dude he literally tackled him oh my god full up shelter down now here's the beauty if you put on yelled at him let me tell you something 1973 I was 10 years old I went to see the Mets against the Cincinnati Reds I was in my fucking Haven it was the fucking all-star game it was the National League Eastern Conference and he beat up but hell's in a second I left there look at this I left there so fucking happy I went there with my mom my stepdad we were sitting behind Tony Perez's family and Petros is beating up on bud Harrelson I left there with my fucking dick harder than that Janice and I had the chickenpox I had the chickenpox I went to that game with the fucking chickenpox so here's my question to you good how come this can't happen today okay how come the guy can't run into the guy at home base today that would be a suspension three months especially for Ilias dispenser is nothing right nothing and that was one of the greatest look at that team right there that's plain that's one of the greatest you'll never see anything like that after it yeah that's New York City this is fucking tremendous oh my goodness this is awesome what a fine Oh why'd it cut it up what a terrible time to edit it it was just was just getting good yeah Piero's gotten a bunch of his fights right fistfights he used to tackle you at second but you know you play baseball program he played you know Cincinnati somebody would get hurt on Cincinnati Reds and bench would automatically go to first and plumber would play like a plumber was like fucking God and he sat by you know it was just a mean old me and Goldberg get together we talk about the Cincinnati Reds because I grew up on but at this point I think I don't give a fuck about the Hall of Fame for Pete Rose I know he gambled on his team but if you know any if you know any history of gambling and professional sports guess what Joe Rogan they're all losers they all lose a ton of money tons of money from archly testa to fucking Petros there was another one that used to better you know the arch Leath didn't get caught betting on himself but he's known to fucking lose everything I'm professional gambler these guys all call right from downstairs only think they're the only ones who did it is that what you're trying to tell me I have a brother who's a fucking moron but he's married to my sister and I know he's a dumb fucking loser gambler I can't call him and say to him listen fucking Malik Shah his ankles hurting tonight bet against them you know whatever I can't games and I made a lot of fucking people do it Petros they hate him he used to tell them fuck you when you play like that what do you think you don't think your rest of your life is telling people how fucked themselves who does that in 1973 in an all-star game doesn't mean anything so the players didn't like him like that day he was against the fucking system like since day one then he went he became a player see when he was gamming himself he was a player manager supposedly what's okay a player manager but me and my gambling mind he been gambling the whole time young giant rest I thought to say that it just he just started gambling one day nah he'd been gambling the whole time because in the 70s it was a little less frowned upon who do you like today I got this horse in the third row a limousine yeah and one day that basketball bet that football bet becomes a baseball bet well people had bookies were really common common everybody had a book it's less common tonight yes today because everything's done on computers and people could do stuff like that but thirty years ago August this the skinny guy would lurk at the bar you went mm-hmm that's the book hey what do you want do you give him cash after three or four or five fucking see how weeks he starts letting you bet on credit
