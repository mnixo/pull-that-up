five four three two one TJ yo how are you brother I'm doing good man what is it like now what is this what it but first of all what was it like that night if four people don't know let me just give you the rundown just so you don't have to say it cool you were involved in one of the most high-profile flyweight fights ever the bantamweight champion dropped down the flyweight you went through this extensive training routine to get your body down to a manageable weight where you can cut the last 10 pounds or so and make 125 the fight starts so who Dolan's a good shot early there's a lot a lot of action and the referee stops the fight and I was I was shook by it everybody that I was watching the fight with it was like what the fuck didn't it's almost universal no one thought it was a good stop it's one of those stoppages where no one goes yeah is a good stoppage stoppage no one everybody was like what the fuck you jumped off and you're like dude come on come on man it's been rough man it's a rough one that won't rough one to swallow on multiple reasons you know like you say he thought he landed a good shot everything's being overshadowed by this shot that landing behind my ear you know I was over off-balance I threw a right hand I came in a little too aggressive that's the way I fight right he pushed me over I was off-balance threw a kick I blocked it and he went to throw a right hand and I tried to dip out of the way and was one of those shots to hit you behind they had like right behind the ear not illegal right we're on our feet it's completely illegal but it was an unfortunate situation one of those punches just kind of takes your feet out from underneath you you're a hundred percent there but you're equilibriums off you know and he jumps on me I remember hearing the refs say Dillashaw show me something at home I'm good and I remember talking to him before the fight in the back and he said like if I'm telling you that make sure you're talking to me give me show me something you know but how are you talking I said it I said I'm good I mean but in his you know from from his perspective how does he expect you to talk while you're blocking he even said to in the back before the fight to like you know give me a thumbs up or something if you're in a choke this or that you know so to be honest I think he was if I didn't I didn't know who he was I think he's really inexperienced watching him ref his - jumping around as soon as the commotion kind of had happened he was looking for a reason to stop by almost but you know I think he was amped up yeah I'm it's a big fight for him yeah - you know for him to get a high profile fight first time on ESPN Plus yes big deal 100% huge dude 100% so that's I think that's the part that most bugged me more is that I was there but it was the shot that hit me behind the head and then obviously the controversial stoppage so it's a rough one to swallow you know it's it's definitely been bugging me but I'm good about keeping my mind off of things and staying busy I'm already back in the gym doing business things and trying to stay as busy as possible so I don't think about it and want to punch a hole through a wall every time I walk by one well it's such a different fight because it was such an arduous task for you to get down to flyweight I mean people are looking you look great right now your face is full you like hell but goddamn dude I'm sorry the week of the fight on television yeah I was like look at its face it looks like a Tweaker yeah you did you you looked like you were you know pseudo said it best you look like an ultra marathon runner like you some guy who runs long distances if if I were to decide to lose all the weight at the end I wouldn't look like that right but I got my body down to five to six percent body fat you know so when I start losing anything towards in it's gonna come here and see it out of my face right you know and I'm one of those guys that losses and gains weight out of my face you know after my fights we call myself fat Tyler because that's my my real name's Tyler and I go by TJ and so with Justin buckles gave me that name back at alpha male like I'd always get puffy face after my fight so my alter egos fat Tyler you know I'm going out and eating and being an asshole spaghetti yeah exactly but so when I when I just had like if I did over 12 weeks so my body weight was down I mean my fought my body fat percentage down to five percent that's crazy and so when you lose anymore waterway or anything you're gonna see it come out of your face and it because I was doing it for so long now what was it like being that low on you as far as your body fat goes what was your performance like physically well how'd you feel actually so I felt the best I've ever felt before I walked out before the fight really do that and that's another reason why I'm just so bitter about this thing is because I didn't get a chance to show the work I put in I didn't get a chance to show all the science behind Sam calivita and what he did to my body I was stronger for this fight then it was my last cody fight I walked out two pounds heavier for this fight than I did my last Cody fight what did you walk out to before I started warming up away to 149 what yes and I felt great even feel bloated it was nothing you went from 125 to 149 yeah I was a glycogen battery I was ready to fucking go I couldn't get tired before the fight when I was warming up in the back I seriously like I've never felt better than this before a fight like my mood my energy levels like me hit miss with joy in the back warming up I was feeling smooth I was feeling good memory even walking out in the cage and everything felt too good almost - I remember looking over doing smile on him I felt awesome and that's the even more of an unfortunate situation I didn't get to really show that you know well I mean hats off to Henry because yeah course I mean he did catch you and he is one of the best he's uh I mean there's a the that kind of caliber of athlete was what made this fight so special you being the bantamweight champion going down to flyweight yeah and I think the way you did it is probably the only way to really do it safely yeah for sure yeah I mean I guess you were safe because you were only you were like what 135 ish the day before I made weight the night before the fight the night before weigh-ins so I went to sleep 1.3 pounds over and I floated that actually took a shit the morning Elaine's which is insane that never happens like my body was still working I wanted to make the wait the night before because obviously I hadn't made 125 I didn't want to wake up the morning and see what my body was gonna do and if is gonna give me that extra water but I made I made weight super easy man like if you don't get me wrong the 12 weeks was a motherfucker it was hard it was a lot of work but though the actual weight cut was easy I had no hiccups nothing like Sam would tell me like what to go to bed at he knew what I was in a wake up at he tells me the water loading I'm doing the model electrolytes I'm taking in the the amount of food I'm eating and so he knows exactly what my body's gonna wake up and do he's been tracking it for not two years now that guy sounds brilliant I'd really need to talk to him watched videos of him talking about it and seen the work and just what what a unique individual he is I mean that's why I decided to move back down to Southern California for him for him yeah and everything else kind of came along with it my life is wonderful now the people I got around me I'm lucky that I had Wayne Ludwick this willing to try about travel out and train with me out there but I moved down to Southern California because of Sam calivita and I came down to two weeks with him and started noticing like yeah this guy knows a shit you know you know I really uniquely know I mean there's a lot of people out there who know their shit but he seems like he's on some new level I mean he sent me graphs that I have on my phone of like the like he like to every week we knew exactly what my body weight wanted to be at he was telling me weights that I'd be at before I would even be there my body would just do it you know so you didn't need a separate person so he's here this is what's unusual about this normally if you would hire somebody you would hire like a George Lockhart or someone like that Mike Dolce and then you would you'd hire them almost specifically just for the weight cut and some nutrition advice he's training you physically as well he's told me my low base like so my long-distance running when I or my fasted low base yeah he does everything my strength conditioning my nutrition he they make my meals they do all my meal prep he's telling me like how much low base I need you to do per week I either morning or night he's telling me when I should train it's a everything is completely mapped out I don't there's no guesswork in it there's nothing like he's telling me everything like he's listening to my heart rate when I'm sleeping the heart rate variability he's told me what supplements to take all of it you know like everything I seriously in in in that's that's another reason why is it's just so tough that this fight didn't get to like really let me prove anything not only for myself and who I am but the work that this guy put in you know like I'm gonna stay here and brag about him and tell me how badass he is but then people want to tell me like oh you were malnourished you don't have a chin 125s was a bad cup for you they're giving him crap all over the place and I've almost feel just as bad for him as I do for myself for how much work you put into it how actually how great I felt before the fight I didn't get a chance to show it like I said I walked out at 149 glycogen battery ready to go I've really never felt better I know man it was insane like III really couldn't believe like how my body absorbed everything you know so what are you walking around like now I'm in low 50 I'm in low 50s right now that's because I'm trying to be at low 50s my body instantly wanted to just store everything and I got up to like 60s low 60s and I was like oh shit dude I started doing some hot yoga and going in where I just worked out with Sam yesterday I'm going to his house later after this I know so that's kind of the only way my mind can stay at ease right now with everything going on so I need to get back in the gym what was that night like after it was over I mean going back to your dressing room and going back to your hotel it was rough man it was definitely a motherfucker it was I was pissed you know everyone wants to call me like a sore loser I've never said I wasn't a sore loser I fucking hate losing more than Indian you you show me a champion or a high-level competitor that likes losing and I'll call you a liar you know I think you're a hundred percent correct and Jamie and I have talked about this many times when you know we're talking about LeBron James or Michael Jordan those guys were infamous for being terrible losers I hate losing yeah I mean I just don't think you get to be that elite of the elite unless you're a fucking maniac yeah I really think that I mean I think about it constantly you know I'm one of those OCD guys it's if I'm not in the gym I'm thinking about it about my training and sometimes I need to distract myself you know that's why I distract myself with other businesses or things I got going on because I think about it too much and so especially when it's a controversial thing when people are questioning things and yeah it's gonna piss you off even more I mean I hate losing so you're definitely to see us so that night was rough man I mean the ride back to the hotel and you know I didn't want to go out I didn't really want to eat I just wanted to hang out my son you know like just get me away from fighting let me think about my family so so where is everything at right now in terms of you talked to the UFC what was their take on everything um a Nate Dana said it was a quick stoppage yeah I mean everyone's been saying it's a quick start Big John McCarthy Big John McCarthy is calling out the ref saying that was a quick stop Paige got my tailor on couple nights ago so the same thing yeah I mean so everyone everyone everyone thinks it you know and Dana was saying like hey kid we'll figure it out next couple of days or at least off which I'm obviously pissed about it there's no that nothing I want this to happen you know so my manager Tiki he's been in talks but we haven't really heard nothing yet on the decision what's gonna happen I love Tiki he's the best he's a great guy he's he's a great manager cuz he's been in the fight game yes he's been around he's fine he's been here forever early you have C days he's such a good dude too just got such a great personality it's just a fun guy to be around yeah so he's been he's been um awesome for my career I've only been with him for a short while all the time but he's been awesome for me but he's been in talks with Hunter and Dana and so we're I'm hoping to figure out something soon because I'm Ralph fight tomorrow you know like I'll fight him out whatever way he wants I obviously would prefer 25's because I put in a lot of work I want to show that I know what I'm doing and it wasn't a fluke or that this was a fluke that this wasn't something that well here's the deal even if the fight went longer and he stopped you many legitimately stop yeah look he's Henry so who Tom yeah that's that's a possibility this is the game hunter this is this is what it is that's why I'm amazed so great right it can happen yes yeah I mean like you go out there like no matter if you're the huge favorite anything can happen yes what it just didn't get a chance to happen that's unfortunaly did land some good shots he really was coming on sorry but he came out ready yeah he was a monster yeah he's a bad motherfucker you so are you yeah which is why that fight was so interesting he had some shit to prove he was there to save the flyweight division yeah and look he did it no way I mean until I had the balls enough to drop down in 2025 so it really wasn't any hype on a flyweight fight but Ned there was and now there still is and he wants to save that he once talked about saving the flyweight division then let's do it well I think he wants to go up course he then he gave me champ champ and I understand that but there was no champ champ and for Connor Connor really changed the game in so many ways yeah but I mean one of the ways he changed the game was calling himself champ champ yeah now everybody is champ champ yep you know Riya Bader's champ champ no I mean Amanda Nunez his champion it's a way to market yourself see him out there it is a really big deal you know with the term champ champ oh yeah it's like that is a fucking Carter McGregor that's a Conor McGregor term he's got some he's got some gold behind his touch yeah anything he touches turns into gold I not lucky charm and I understand that I mean I'll fight Henry Souter whatever way he wants to fight I have no I can't I can't dictate where it goes because I just had just happened you know it seems like the correct way to do it would be at 25 because if you guys fought at 35 it's you know it's a different ball of wax in 10% I I just think given the circumstances and the fact that you did make the weight fairly not easy I would never say easy I would say easy I mean like I said it's a lot of work but dude I can't believe how actually easy it was um I mean it was going through the grass that Sam showed me and it was remarkable I got stronger I was putting up more weight so the last week before I left for my fight I was snatching and cleaning more weight than my last Kody fight and I was lighter so my power ratio was insane it almost is unheard of but I think it's because of how strict I had to be for those 12 weeks is maybe why like what was your diet like like what do you eat in and out of I could you can't be in ketosis obviously cuz I train too hard right but no grains you know if I'm eating carbs simple carbs things like that like fruits yeah fruits vegetables sweet potatoes things like that and weighing everything out they do all that I'm not doing it personally myself Sam and his family do it the training lab they make every meal every snack I so I'm eating three meals a day I was actually in pretty good calories too I mean three meals a day two snacks a day but it's also about when I stopped beating my intermittent fasting me doing my low base one and while I'm fasting to get my body to be burnin hundred-percent fats and when you said doing your low base what do you mean by my like long distance so low cardio slow movements yes so it's not hard something won't keep my heart rate at a certain variable depending on what my vo2 max is what my rmr is there's this crossover where your body starts burning carbs or starts burning fats if you're sprinting you're going hard and hard and hard your body is going to start burning car because it needs to burn carbs to go that hard but when you're at a certain level like so for instance when I started camp my crossover was at 145 so I need to keep my heart rate under 145 for maybe four to five minutes or maybe now I'm getting closer to I need to lose more weight I need to go an hour so 145 is is that 80% no 70% of your heart rate must be everyone has different dependent vo2 is right I don't remember what mine was exactly a percentage wise so that 145 is a sweet spot where you're burning fat at the beginning of camp but towards the end of the camp I can go to like 155 because I got in better shape my eye I was just in better shape was a better machine to where I could go harder and still be in a fat-burning substrate mmm and then he would dictate if I need you to do 40 minutes in a minute maybe an hour at night in depending on how we want my body to react and then he's also spiking and take away my insulin levels to get Mike because I don't want to be in ketosis always right because my body will crash but I need to be in it to get my body weight down without losing weight unhealthy if I would have waited to last two weeks to crash my weight I would have been dehydrated but all the way up until wayne's my body was over 60 60 percent hydrated mostly camp out was 66 percent hydrated and that's because you don't only get hydrated from the water you drink you're hydrated from the the supplements you're going to take and the food you're taking in and inside your cells so when you say you're getting into ketosis are you doing it a hundred percent through diet or you take an exogenous ketones are you doing anything else just diet in the way I work out diet the way you work out and then the intermittent fasting is a 16 hour window using we switch it up when I was getting closer to fight yeah but when I was further out maybe like you know 14 hours things like that I wouldn't I didn't I didn't have to intermediate fast the whole camp you know just after a certain point I need to get my body weight even lower than it was that there's this this trend that we were following to continue to get my body weight down and he would implement certain things to force it that direction Wow it's just I've never seen I mean I know some pretty well documented training routines and diet routines and some guys have really gotten into the weeds with this stuff but I don't think I've ever seen it like you man I was always into training and doing everything as well as I can and and find every angle I could possibly be to be the best athlete that's my competitive edge and then when I met Sam I knew that was my next level and I didn't realize that I had low tests and before I met see him until he tested my levels and did my hair analysis and all that stuff I didn't realize what was going with my body I just trained hard and I thought I was training smarter and then I met Sam I took it to a whole nother level well the training hard sometimes the problem is your body just never really gets a chance to catch up never really gets a chance to recover and there's a lot of really good fighters that are doing that to themselves they're just you know especially wrestler yes they have that mentality just they just fucking go they don't care if they're miserable they're mentally tough they keep pushing and your body just is always behind the eight-ball you never really get a chance to recover I was redlining my body yeah I was I was not eating right I was working out as hard as I possibly could pound in the caffeine and my body was just telling me no you know I taught much sauce Ron was crashed and like to see where it's at now is amazing you know what did he do to boost it back up my diet my supplementation which all my supplements are our food based for the most part I mean there'll be supplements but there aminos and all Whole Foods dasyam oh yeah magnesium zinc s-- tryptophan one of the things glycines tyrosines a thrill you know all different ways and different types of taken depending on what I'm doing the certain kind of creatine's I'm taking my proteins are all organic he's this company or gain that's I take a lot of their stuff you know they're they're they're everything's tested or organic so everything I'm doing is all whole whole food based supplements and then the way I'm training is well to like so he's listening to my heart rate variability when I sleep what are you wearing - I wear a heart rate monitor made by suit though okay but it's yeah it's not so much the heart monitor that does it it's his algorithm that does it so every morning I wake up my phones connected to my watch I see my my heart rate - gonna phone phone just a Apple phone but it's just the app is first beat I think it is but your watch it's connected to your watch traverse alphas yeah mines uh yeah it's something like that right connects to your phone through bluetooth and then and so you're wearing the monitor with the watch the watch is just on the nightstand okay I sleep with the monitor on and it'll track me all with to my sleep and you mainly want like you know when you get not REM sleep in it's like three hours and it'll automatically wake up I sync it to my phone it sends it to his program and then he's got an algorithm to tell me like what percentage recovery I am you know so this is his own proprietary program that he's developed himself yeah it's taking him I mean dude this guy's a genius man I'm telling you like me hanging out with him for two years and I'm finally getting it all somewhat down you know I've learned so much from I mean I've learned more from him in the last two years than I ever learned through school and I was a kinesiology major I was clinical exercise science I was gonna be a physician's assistant I was always into the body but just going and working out with him in his garage a little tiny you know garage that it looks you like you'd never think world champions training there ever you know like the Aaron pecos the one Archuleta's myself Cub Swanson like all these badass guys going to training there's just some little garage but I've learned more from him in that garage than I've ever learned through any of my schools and become one to become a physician's assistant that's crazy yeah what did you think of the Pico fight ah man so unfortunate crazier because he's just he's such a killer that he wants to knock everyone out not only does he want to be the best fighter in the world but he wants to be the most entertaining fighter in the world so he's looking to punish you because he's got so many weapons that he doesn't use he's so good man but he lives by the sword and he dies by the sword kind of thing you know he wants to be that that knock you out entertaining fighter he wants to be able to show a highlight reel first-round knockouts you know which is great yeah but you always have to understand that you are just like the guy right in front of you yeah and then one shot especially in MMA one shot can turn it all around and it did mm-hmm it was one of the most shocking knockouts something I've ever seen because it looked like he looked fucking phenomenal he came out there and we knew that he had been trading with you for this ride who was fucking shredded he looked like a world beater you know went out there landing that clean uppercut and then got just way carried away yeah and it's unfortunate because you think I'm shape and I do crazy things this guy's put me to shame like in Sam's garage what he's able to do on the bike and just his workout regimen and like just how competitive he is man he's a he's a world beater he could be by far world champion you know there's some things that he's and he's so young so there's some things we need to get to figure out everyone takes losses and hoping one of these is gonna just spark him to realize what how good he is everywhere you know and it's just so unfortunate situation MMA yeah I mean guys have bounced back from knockouts and become world champions unquestionably it's just he's got to make sure he doesn't have too many of those you know and make sure he fight smart agreed uses use that goddamn wrestling to its insane risk I mean he's so good as a wrestler and when he gets that guy hurt he's collar tighter they're grabbing each other by neck and just swinging shots you've you're flipping a coin you're rolling the dice boys he got six fights or something like that yeah I mean it's one of those inexperienced things and he's only 22 yeah I mean that's the other thing you realize like when he dropped me could've jumped on him he could have swarmed him like he did to me you know like jump on him in in swarm oh yeah and look for that finish but I think the inexperience kind of makes him realize like maybe he's invincible and just I don't know man there's there's things that you kind of figure out when you've been out in the cage longer and longer and you've been around the crew you understand there's ways to finish a fight or or how to auto just be a smart fighter yeah that he'll figure out what was the whole experience like being on this ESPN card because it's a that was a historic moment much like like the Cain Velasquez versus Junior dos Santos which also stopped the same way and that was actual that was not the punch though the punch that landed in the ear yeah same punch you know like Eternals things that you it just takes your feet offerin if you've ever fought or if you've ever been in got hit in the back of the head weird your feet go out from underneath you but you're there yep you're a hundred percent aware of what's going on but your balance isn't there then you have another grown man on top of you you know so of course things are gonna happen but with the ESP and it was really cool the whole lead-up to it they film they came to film and they were around a lot yeah I did a lot of exposure the stuff they put out was really cool and then just seeing like our commercial for a fight on national football on ESPN or for the call it you know because college was going and then you see the Nationals is going on you see me and Henry like three different commercials on ESPN I thought that was pretty cool no it was amazing you know I mean it really it's cool to see it's cool to see that ESPN is embracing the sport and it's getting into it and you know there's a lot of hype behind this and you know I got ESPN plus I was ya know yeah I'm not a sports fan I don't watch support I don't even know what's happening like what people like what are you doing for the Super Bowl I'm like when's that that's exactly what I did I don't have time for it man I'm a I'm a Raiders fan but I don't have time to really watch you know right but yeah I mean it's just when you think of sports you think ESP yeah you really do I mean it's another level of acceptance in the sports world the only thing that kind of bummed me out and I should probably clarify this because I talked about this on the podcast was the hearty fight and not not even because I don't think the guy should be fighting are not even because I think I you know I don't I don't really know what he did in terms of his past I know there's a lot of there's a lot of shit right I mean he was in trouble for something there was an appeal he got off of it somehow I don't know yeah but I'm only talking about it from a fighting perspective you're watching the highest-level fights you're watching the co-main event he's just not ready for a khomeini mouth like technically no no way yeah just he rushed out he gassed out he burned himself out Crowder recovered and it just it's not the way it should be is you should have the early fights are people who are learning the sport and then when you get to the last couple of fights the co-main and the main you're supposed to be seeing assassins like you and Henry so that's what you're supposed to be seeing and just yeah crazy thing about our sport is a lot of entertainment behind it as well too so if you're hyped up you get pushed up the ladder maybe you get title fight sooner than you should and that's crazy it is because now we're on ESP and now we're like we're an official's I mean we've been an official sport but yeah it should be more on the level like you're talking about of the actual skill level and how you're ranked I mean cowboy Cerrone and Alex Kidd should have been a hundred percent main event a hundred percent I was stunned that it wasn't they imagine they were on real they were on ESPN though they wanted to kind of hype up Plus that sense that makes sense for that reason yeah but there's another fight they could have put in place of that I mean there's a hundred percent and again this is not a knock on Crowder or Hardy their guys out there doing it they're trying they did their job did their job they're fighting I mean the ending was super unfortunate yeah again you don't know whether or not he did it on purpose whether he had a mental you're getting punched in the face that stuff happens so fast chaos yeah I mean especially because he is so new right yes he hasn't been fighting for everyone like that stuff just happens like oh I got him hurt yes you know like there's things like I've even done in practice Mike oh shit dude I'm in practice and I did something Mike oh man that was stupid like if happens in a fight where I'm losing a point like I'm so sorry you know like it just bums me out that this rush to commercialization that this this rush to trying to get the the most eyes on it the people that are watching it if you watch something where there's two guys who really aren't ready for co-main event you're seeing sloppiness and guys getting out of gas real quick and you're seeing all the things you're supposed to learn early in your career so they're by the time you get to a coal main event you know you're a fucking assassin you're your lockdown and a hundred percent professional you know you're a real elite pro fighter that's what I want to see when I'm watching ESPN you know that's what I want to see I want to see the best of the best you know I want to see world-class fighters fighting with precision and power and speed and knowing how to pace themselves guys are the experience they've been there before they know how to recover from things they get cracked they know how to lay back they know how to hold on they know how to do what they need to do in order to win or fight their best instead of like just like you're seeing thing and so many people are seeing this at this point and I feel like we're getting fans now that are more knowledgeable like yourself and and and people are seeing the support and understanding technique now tour before maybe it didn't matter right you didn't know what bad technique is now you know but we get more knowledgeable fans to where they are gonna start realizing like what was that right and the last thing you want to see is two heavyweights gassed out yes that is the floor in worse yeah remember when what was Ben Rothwell thought was it Mark Hunt I think was Ben Rothwell and Mark Hunt fought in I'm want to say it's those two guys when it might be wrong if that's in Denver they made him fight at altitude I remember the fight in Denver I don't know if was them either but yeah it was there at altitude yeah and they're so goddamn tired and like fucking and the UFC is like we're never gonna do a heavyweight fight again ever at altitude was it yeah was Ben Rothwell Mark Hunt but then they wanted up doing Cain Velasquez and Purdue for every super Mexico City which is even higher it's 2,000 feet above Denver doom with smart went up there early we did like a killer out there and in and I think from what I remember that Kane went out there two weeks before the fight which actually makes it worse for you if you better off you went up there three days before the fight because your body's still in shock right rather than going up there in two weeks and now your body's screwed yeah you know you need to be there if you're gonna be there early go six weeks no more don't don't go less if you're gonna go less come with Rick a couple days cuz your body's still in shock and you see how a fight like that can literally change the course of a fighter's class yes we had changed Kane's career in many ways you know one one loss like that to a guy like forever breezy over do you know he's fighting real real soon that's Francis and Gahan oh I hope he's healthy that he has to I hope so god damn it yeah I mean if he's not he's in trouble cuz I mean he could be the best heavyweight I mean I think he was the best heavyweight just unfortunate situations where he didn't get into to prove that I mean he's one of the I think his thing was that his body just couldn't deal with his mind like his mind is so strong and his his will and his work ethic is so powerful and that goddamn camp of killers up some truth San Jose aka it's just assassin central and just the years of wrestling yeah I mean wrestling hurt me more than anything really anything for that I still do today right even if I get hurt today it's from wrestling practice its wrestling's the hardest thing on my body your neck your back your shoulders it mean it's it's rough you know I am Calvi just son right AJ he's been on the couch for the last four months it was from wrestling he hurt his back he'd bulging disc in his back or herniated disc from wrestling and he's 16 years old Jesus Christ that's a rough one when you're that young and you hurt your back yeah man yeah Wow yeah so it's a part of his back it's lower yeah lower back yeah what's he god I'm doing for it I would owe him a guy like that knows exactly what to do to try to heal someone yes so he's been doing it we've been uh he's had that we they tried doing everything naturally but he's had to go and get a couple epidurals now the kind of shrink to swelling so that obviously it's not so it's pushing on a nerve and so it's messing with the sciatic nerve and it's hard for him to walk he was having him crawl around the house like a dog like laid on the couch forever now he's starting to walk but Sam's got him out in the garage doing pull-ups cuz that's the only thing he can do because it's a decompression you know he said we'll hold on to the bar at least and get some pull-ups and it started to strengthen his back so that it will hold his spine kind of where it needs to because he's losing insane amounts of muscle mass I mean this kid was 16 years old looking good working out with his data on the garage and then gets hurt now it looks like a different person I feel bad for him being a 16 year old kid you know well I definitely feel bad that he looks bad but I really feel bad that he's got that kind of an injury at 16 that's a that's an injury see which guys in their 20s and 30s and you know you realize it's a lifetime of beating on it that when you get to that when you're 16 that's not good I dealt with it in my neck and college and then also early in my fighting career and it messes with you I had to get a epidural shot my neck throughout the front bulging disc yeah I was pushing on a nerve I lost like 70 percent of the strength in my left to harm it you know it's rough man yeah I was on my way the exact same thing I was getting numbness in the hands and the ulnar nerve which goes from like your pinkie down through your elbow I was getting pain in my elbow but I got real lucky that I found a good doctor got some spinal decompression androgenic een Janicki and really fixed the other thing yeah it's that blood spinning procedure and they heat up your blood and then they they run it through a centrifuge and they pull this yellow serum out of it there was at your plasma right yeah yeah we detailed it what it is we showed a thing from the website that shows the stuff they add to but it was pretty remarkable and a lot of people with back injuries are finding real real powerful relief for that because not only does it reduce the inflammation but it actually really speeds up your healing mm-hmm but for me the spinal decompression was like one of the best things ever there's just that harness that you strap on your neck and hang from the door okay I have fucking things amazing that click click click on that one I have the one that it's it's not as nice as that one my views it worry I keep pump it up it's like that's a good one too it's like a little neck brace you put it on like hardly fizz anything and you pump a pill with it out that's great to try to get taller well you definitely get shorter as you get older that's true and that's what it is I mean Eddie Bravo gained an inch he's he's five nine now because he had a disc replace oh wow yeah well all the years of jiu-jitsu yeah and weightlifting and wrestle every thing is getting squashed pushing him folding himself in half all the time yeah well his lower back was destroyed imagine destroying it and also he's not the guy the guy who balances everything out like he just kind of doesn't and smokes weed eats a burrito so yeah so his lower back was just fuck but it was essentially bone on bone and we're just constant state of inflammation he was always in pain like he'd be standing up like if we were somewhere like say if we went to a bar and had a couple of drinks or something like that he'd be standing up he'd be in pain just standing for too long and there's a world class jiu-jitsu prize yeah so he got his discs replaced and gained an inch mm-hmm yeah they put a well I mean he had nothing and then also he's got an inch of discs Wow and it's a titanium articulating disc so it actually moves around it's not fused okay so it's in the old days they would take your your to these you know the vertebra and lock them together and screw them in place and nightmare because and it puts an artificial load on the upper discs above it in a lower disc because now there's this unusual leverage there but instead of that now they use a disc an actual disc they put it in place and it lasts a long-ass fucking time and it moves around like you and he doesn't have any pain anymore and guys are back to rollin and I know you know some real Chris Weidman actually just got a disc replaced in his neck I saw that as well no but Cana his fused right because he had back prams and his was his fused he's got a bunch of shit going on his back he's had multiple back surgeries I don't know the exact extent of all the different surgeries that he got but he's definitely got a lot of stuff going on his back yeah an interesting team I hope he comes back healthy and looks good look man um a skill for skill ability for ability I think he if he's not the best of all time it's him in phaidor you know and then you always have to mention Werdum because even though steep ain't knocked for Doom out in the first round for Doom has submitted the best of the best in submitted Minotauro he submitted phaidor he submitted Kane I mean what the fuck yeah I mean that that guy is just for doing ver dooms record if you just look at who he's fun he's fine he's the best yeah I in my opinion and for how long he's been around but it's like but when did he beat those guys like when did he beat those guys did he beat those like when you beat fade or fade or was as close to his prime as you can get when you know like it's hard to say like the Brett Rogers fight a lot of people were saying he wasn't his focus for the Brett Rogers fight but he still knocked him out with one punch remember that crazy fucking ko anytime he gotta be ready for fade over - yeah but ver doom handled him you know on the ground and submitted them yeah I would have loved to seen what it was like in Pride if he could fight him when Fedor was at his peak coming back when he beat Minotauro yeah but ver do you know he's overlooked and that argument of who's the best and in terms of like accomplishments as a UFC fighter well it's steep a because steep a is the only guy to defend the title four times and it really kind of bums me out he's out of the conversation right now yeah you don't hear about a steep a fight he's like a two in which I feel like he should get more attention for this he's just a normal guy like he has a full-time job whereas a firefighter like I feel like more people should resonate with him because of that yeah but they don't I don't he's a fucking great yet it's gonna be an asshole to get attention these days I don't know I mean I feel like if he had beaten DC and you know I mean beat Francis that was a big fight because Francis came into that fight with a lot of hype and that's the Overeem knockout yeah steep they fought like a fucking champion if really fought like a champion smart and he showed Francis and look Francis fought after he was not the same thing when he fought after then he fought Derek Lewis you could he was thrown right he was still fucked up from that last fight and he admitted it to his credit you know he bounced back with the Curtis blades fight and looked fantastic which is a big firm cuz blades is an awesome wrestler exactly clay blade blades is a very athletic wrestler he's huge yeah he's big he's fast he's powerful and you know and that's twice Francis is beating him for twice he stopped him that was his first UFC fight so he stopped him then he stopped him in this one as well so coming into this fight with Kane you know there's there's a lot of questions we haven't seen Kane in two years yeah right it's been about two years yeah if it may mean longer let's say when was last time came Velasquez long time yeah I think you might be right it might be three years mm-hmm it's been raised I know but when when he was at the top of the food chain when Kane was at the top he would put a fucking storm on these people that was just like a hundred year storm that would never end he's like how was this guy have this kind of an ABC burden to do with that him to him oh and Mexico City was crazy that doesn't mean other way around yeah it was crazy just you see Kane tired yeah so here we go 2016 yep July 9th so two and a half years yeah yeah and that was Travis Brown which is just a phenomenal beating and that was UFC 200 yeah and they did the Junior dos Santos won and then right before that was a year mm-hmm you know so he's like a breeze like I've been active well he had told us 2013 look at those gaps yep yep dang two-year gaps you know two-year gaps one-year two-year again that's rough yeah it is it is rough especially when this is your job and how you get paid Yeah right yeah Lucky's a heavyweight and they get taken care of a little more but yeah yeah I mean it's just I wonder how how much you could fix all that stuff that's going on in the spine yeah you know I mean it's one thing if a guy gets a knee you know he's got ACL or something like that you know that you can come back from that that's a 100% possible mm-hmm but back stuff is weird once it seems like once things start going it's like you like a car you know once a ball-joint blows out and the axle starts grinding and I got Jesus it's like a bunch of shit's gonna go along something that that's like your core yeah but at his best man he was fucking terrifying yeah because it's just I'd never saw a heavyweight with that kind of endurance man I remember being so scared it came velázquez when I was I think I talked about this last time in your podcast when I was a kid wrestling in college because I was like this tiny ass little white boy wrestler and Kay would walk around with just his singlet straps on in shorts and he had brown Pike Brown pride tattooed across his chest he's just huge heavyweight wrestling do you want for ASU I was like so scared of that guy's like damn look at that guy walking Ehrlich wonder rip my head off has Brown pride tattooed on his chest just wearing just a singlet straps just huge it's funny yeah I remember him forever man well you know him and DC having that kind of a relationship is such an unique situation for the two fighters yeah that they have you know another elite guy that's their size and they just smash each other left and right and work with each other that's what I try to create wherever I go and that's what we're doing in Southern California I know one archuleta and Pecos cub Swanson's we're trying to build a room of smaller guys that we can but we're a lot we don't want to kill each other right that's something we I've always had to control myself I've always gone really hard and something I've had to learn to control but having that room full of killers so that when we go to wrestling practice like you don't know if we're gonna have a good practice you might be getting beat up on that day when you go home and off like shit I had a bad practice I got taken down with this but that's what makes you better for the next practice if you just go to practice and beat up on everyone every day you're never gonna know what you need to change it we need to get better at so I think that's why Cain and and DC you've gotten so good so quick at MMA that each other to build off of you know and so yeah if you can survive it yeah if you survive it yeah and that you know like the knock on aka some people said they train to hard cuz they're always injured but look at the amount of champions they produce yes look at the amount of fucking killers to come out of there Luke Rockhold DC Cain khabib I mean get the fuck out of here that place is a den of assassin if you can survive it right yeah perfect I mean yeah I mean that's the only way man I mean look it's not good to spar a full clip like old-school lion's den days yeah where they used to beat the shit out of each other or the Miletich days I mean nobody knew anything back then they didn't know the consequences they didn't know what it's like it was speaking which there's an article in The New York Times today that I was reading on a guy that we knew Jason Hairston and it just talks about his CTE and how bad it was and you know Jason is a guy who founded this clothing company that we know called kuyou and he had been on the podcast before I knew him oh yeah it's crazy because something you never would have guessed how bad it was either yeah because every time I see me was happy he's awesome when people don't know the story he committed suicide about a year ago or so yeah but that yeah and no one no one outside of it saw it coming it was a judge just a giant crazy blow and you know I was texting back and forth with one of his friends and a you know essentially said he had a broken brain man didn't make sense because you when your brains broken it's like having a broken phone it's like having a broken anything it's just broken it's not it's not working right it's irrational it doesn't make sense I couldn't imagine the thoughts that had been going through his head to have that happen cuz like I was texting him two weeks before it happened like talking about going on a hunt with him and doing this and that and he's like talk about how great the business is doing like you think he's living the American dream like awesome you know so it's tough man I couldn't even I couldn't even put myself like to have that kind of torture well you know he was friends with Donald Jr Donald Trump jr. and you know they hunted together and he was talking to him just a few hours before like everything was fine yeah you know they were going back and forth to each other everybody was blown away like what happened like how how could this possibly happen yeah but you know scary to think more reason for us to be smart as we possibly can with our training yes 100% that's what I was going to get into this that you there is a way to train hard but save your body from especially critical damage like brain damage there is a way to do that and Duane has been a savior to me because of that you know Duane with his experience of fighting and being through the gyms and him pride going too hard himself we've learned a lot of hard drilling and and live drilling through him that is probably gonna prolong my career and hopefully my life and going as hard and just bark because like before before Dwayne when I was at Huff met we sparred like three four times a week we just went you know that's what we were wrestlers and that's how we knew where to get better was just go and then he came into our teaching us like how to drill and how to to really get better and your reaction times everything with with fighting without having to beat yourself up so much my injuries were less I wasn't getting injured as much and I actually got a lot better too yeah I think sparring is critical I think it is important but I think maybe as critical or maybe more is drilling and this is with all martial arts including jiu-jitsu and jiu-jitsu it's you know you know you do jiu-jitsu it's fun so everybody wants to just slap hands punch knuckles and start rolling yes it's fun yeah it's fun it's like a fun game you're doing it's a good release yeah but the best way to get better at it is to constantly drill and then you develop these pathways that are just ingrained in your subconscious and so when you're in that half guard position you immediately go for that under hook you immediately you know the path you know where to go instead of ad-libbing and thinking while you're in the middle of a roll and when you see guys that come from camps where they don't drill they only do like one technique at the beginning of the class you'll notice a technical deficiency as opposed to like someone who comes from Hickson school or someone who comes from a school it's very technical or you know the Mendez brothers or something you know though it's just it's so important to look at this look at the sport whether it's MMA or kickboxing or jiu-jitsu whatever it is but to look at it like a like a puzzle like you're trying to figure out what's the best way to solve this and you know what Dwayne has done for you it's been pretty remarkable as far as like giving you footwork skills and tools to move around and angles and I you know I've watched you guys straight drill and train together and it's really amazing stuff yeah stuff that we think is simple and then we go and teach into the gym and we're in their psyche wait what can you guys do that like 10 more times we need to see that at games like oh right all right some we've just been doing like the footwork I've created with Dwayne he wasn't a footwork guy when he fought he was treated of course or nato's and then like he's the one that's created all these angles with me now we've created a whole new style it's so funny that he saw that kind of while he was fighting and then after he was fighting he's implementing and on new fighters and didn't do it himself yeah he laughs about it yeah he he wishes he probably had someone like himself coach him obviously fucking for sure yeah everybody does yeah yeah he's a fucking wizard and he is because he doesn't stop thinking about it either - he's like a Sam calivita for strike I'm telling you like I have all the best coaches in the world around me like he's like Sam calivita of striking in MMA and I'm trying to convince him to come to Southern California our professional fight team so we can help recreate what we do for everyone because right again we move out here yeah laughs Colorado he does he does but he also loves being the best coach in the world yeah so I'm hoping that I can convince him enough that he'll do that how close you think you are to convinced him I think I'm close I know listen brother I know you want to come to California I've never seen anybody with his detailed an instruction manual like the way he breaks down his system no matter what writing means really remarkable even when he comes in here to talk to you he'll have a system that is how what he wants to talk about what he wants to do like the guy doesn't stop thinking he is he's on top of his stuff he's OCD in a good way yeah and the best way in the best absolutely well it's like you were saying about being competitive I mean I think it's you the idea that you're gonna be this balanced chilled out person and still be a fucking world Smasher yeah good luck with that I'm the farthest thing from relaxed and chill right now but yeah but when you're training and when you look you there's a mindset that's required to beat the best guys and it's not the same mindset that's required to get good to get you could get good and be a chilled out relaxed person let's say you want to be a black belt in jujitsu that's totally possible yeah you could be really good people can go hey look at Mike man Mike is got great triangle watch him roll wow he's really good but if Mike wants to be the motherfucker of motherfuckers you better be crazy you know you better be goddamn crazy you better be like Mike Tyson when he was young yeah Beto's Michael Jordan's you talking about they're always thinking about it Roy Jones jr. yes all those guys you gotta be a fucking crazy person absolutely everyone's Roy Jones jr. played a professional basketball game the day of his fight a basketball game that not competitive dude and he's just an athlete yeah yeah I mean I just don't think there's any other way I mean I think if you're gonna win a race you're gonna have redline the engine is I just don't see how you're gonna beat the best guy everybody is trying their best yeah this is the thing you know there's so much going on there I mean you could have like a really good coach so you have an advantage technically you could have a really good group of guys you train with so you have an advantage in the environment that you're training in and there's a lot of inspiration but if you're not a fucking psychopath good luck yeah good luck I agree with you hundred percent yeah I agree with you because that's how I am that I know that's what I'm saying I just let me people who like wonder why you're so fucking crazy like what that's why he's so good no there's no other way around this game I appreciate it I mean listen I appreciate it too I mean for me as a fan and as a professional commentator you know this is it's important to me if there's not people like you out there that are raising the bar you know people like you and Henry cejudo and you just too can go through the list of Champions the great fighters that are around today this is the best time in the history of the world to see martial arts there's never been better martial arts never well the information so easily accessible to us you know when I was wrestling as a kid yeah you got like we're talking about drilling I remember being a kid and like drilling the same move thousands of times you're bored learn this you know but now I understand it be am a professional important it is and now how easy like information like for instance I created my fit to fight program like my online Academy thing and I'm showing techniques I've learned over my whole entire life and it created me here to create it but I'm giving you a thing if when I was starting up I wish I could learn from other world champions just by going online or when I was a wrestler if I want to learn Sam Cal Vedas a nutrition plan I can just go online and check it out yeah you know Sam has a he has a whole online program yeah he has an app he started called trained champ and it's on his website training lab calm Android and iPhones yeah mm-hmm yeah it's a it'll go through like his workout routines it goes through the supplementation he puts me on it goes it has certain recipes that I've been on throughout my fight camp the first one he created was around Romney first because we put so much work in ago 25 so we created a whole supplementation and diet plan and workout plan of what I did and put out there accessible for people I mean he even has a you can even get a hair analysis on his that you send in like they send you a little kit you cut off on the back your head with your brain stems that you cut off your hair and you see where the brains comes up that's rahl your nutrition comes out up that's where all the nutrients from your nervous system will go through fuck figured that out I know they burn the hair and they get the toxins from it that's how I found out have too much arsenic in my body I thought you eating that gave you that arsenal he thinks maybe the rice or maybe my tattoos tattoos thinks it's a really big in tobacco there's a lot of since nick is big in tobacco really so I'll give you chew ya chewy guy I shoot ice at you in college that wouldn't be still in your system well your body won't get rid of heavy metals and this you make it you're at heavy metals like a detox what do you do so I juice I do a lot of juicing but I juice like a quarter cup of cilantro every day with in all my juices I take a cilantro is effective in getting heavy metals yeah big-time and same with burritos too okay Mathias you get actually to absorb a lot more than nutrients when you cold-pressed juice it compared to just eating it I can eat a whole table of fruits and vegetables and I'll absorb more of the nutrients from if a juice it rather than just eating it raw really mhmmmm cuz your body doesn't break it down the same but then I also take my thigh 9 it's a thiamine I don't oughta pronounce it but it's a immuno the helps push out heavy metals chlorella and spirulina will help push out heavy metals what else do you have me on I tested positive for arsenic back in the day because I was eating too much sardines yeah they're heavy and sardines yeah but I'm all I did is just back off the sardines and it went away he tested it again yeah oh really yeah and you never tried pushing it out on into shit huh interesting yeah how did you test it though blood work blood work so the blood work sauce wanted a difference so when you do your blood it's only right then in there what's in your so we needs like when you do your home loan levels you have to go in the morning and and get your blood drawn before you eat or drink anything right because it's what's in your body right then and there but when you do a hair analysis it's what's in your body like the last like nine months or it's more if it tells you more what's in your actual body overtime you know cuz you might have just pushed arsenic out of your blood rather than out of your out of everything hmm least that's what he told me and he's a mathematician by trade he's a calculus teacher at a private private school the world's best calculus teacher he wants some award as kids that take the placement test as advanced placement test they all got a hundred percent I think there's a I think there's a kid that missed one question that's crazy one kid there's kids that travel all over the world to come to his school because of his accolades of being a calculus teacher Wow yeah I mean numbers never lie you know and I think that's what I was always drawn to like his results in his studies it's always numbers everything comes back to the numbers of your body your hormone levels of my heart variability everything's done by numbers Wow so this is all a system that he devised himself did he I mean does he have a background in combat sports at all he wrestled so he wrestled at Cal State Fullerton he was a big-time wrestler and then he was the World's Strongest Man they did like that at Disneyland needs to do the World's Strongest Man anyone for like the nation's Strongest Man competitions he was huge used to be giant how much did he weigh like 260 280 right now he's probably like a 160 170 pounds that's crazy yeah he was giant like you could stack a couple on his chest his chest was so big you know but I would never guess that look at him he looks like a Marilyn he is now he does Iron Man's Wow so he switched up he once he I keep so I think he had some health issues from getting so big and being so strong he decided to switch things up and you just got into his body because he started doing Iron Man's and you want to get better at being an Iron Man so really got into how to train himself and now he's done 14 Iron Man's he's qualified for Conan izing Dakota in October Wow how old is he I'll say 53 or 54 Wow I think he just turned 54 still getting after it yeah man like he every day I wouldn't work out with him yesterday he did it and then when I got there he'll get in the garage and he'll do like a two hour bike ride and then get on the treadmill and he's always doing power intervals and will he come in and do a podcast I can go talk him to you he's uh he's very he tries to hide everything he does he's the one who's intellectual value getting out there he puts a lot of work into it and I think he'd be really good on your podcast cuz like some of the guys come in here like information goes way over your head but it's nice to be able to listen to it again and listen to it again I'd like to convince him to come on I think it'd be really interesting I don't know if he would he's a real sheltered kind of guy what do you think it'd be easier to do talk to in moving to California I talk Cal Veda to come down here man I think maybe talking to a needing to come to California really I don't know I'm got to get him used to that beach life yeah I mean he so he's been coming down like I said my fight camp was ten weeks long from with him I was longer but with him it was ten weeks and he was flying out three days a week so every Monday he would land he would leave Wednesday night Wow and we would train Monday Tuesday Wednesday and that hard right and make sure take like Thursday off and then do my other stuff while he's gone but every week he was traveling back in Fell's fucking dedication right dude I have a were family now you know yeah he's lived in my house like he's on the meal plans with the Cal Vita is like he's full bore into it like he gives me is all I'm a very fortunate person to have met Dwayne and it's an amazing relationship our relationship yeah I guess it is it really is and I mean that's the ideal when you can get a mentor and a student that have that kind of a bond together and you can learn so much yeah and he won't let like we have such a good bond now too that he won't like let bullshit so I won't be pumping me up for no reason like let me I mean I'm not a lazy guy but if I was he wouldn't let me like miss practice or right you know I mean he almost has to pull me back more than anything but he gives me this true assessment of what needs to be done I obviously lost the psuedo we got home and instant text music ham coming out tomorrow man work out womp but I'd love to get some working with you we just some things we should go over it's like alright so like I was working out with him three days after the fight What did he say about that exchange oh he says like he maybe he needs to change some things on the mitts and maybe I so for since the whole exchange I think I closed the distance too hard Henry shooter switched up who he was as a fighter I think he came out differently which was great by him he's done great things he I expected him to maybe run a little bit more and he came out aggressive and so getting used to the distance control you know not always having a set plan and going for those combos what I think's gonna happen to build adjust on the fly and maybe meet him sometimes we are to set on certain things rather than reaction time stuff you know and I need to react to distance change and he directed things like that it's hard to really change anything on that fight because I didn't get a chance to see it either right you know it was so so quick now do you have you talked to Dana or anyone since I know you said that you guys would talk in the future but it's been about what how many days been about a week or so it's been to uh about a week and a half it's been week and a half now yeah I haven't heard anything since the day after the fight I was texting with him after the fight and he said they had to say don't figure out what the plane is kind of thing you know but obviously everyone knows that we want to run it back in and it sounds like they do as well too so well as far as something that people want to watch whether it's at 35 or 25 I think people absolutely would like to see that I mean at 35 the big selling point would be Henry gets a chance to become champ champ of course they all fight about 25 and put my 35 pound belt on the line I really works that way I know it doesn't but I'm saying like if you beat me like I was like I seriously like I wouldn't even I just seriously don't even care like the other belts are awesome all that stuff and the record recognition law stuff but to me I want that I want that one back I want that opportunity back to even to show how much work in how smart I was and how I didn't get I didn't get hit and I wasn't fragile for me in at 25 I really wasn't like I wasn't like um I didn't get beat because I was a 25 pounder I would felt I have no excuses I got beat because I got beat right I have no excuses that I was too fragile or being hurt 125s I feel better than I've ever felt my entire life I just want the chance to prove that you know what I mean so that's why I say that I would give him my belt at 35 I beats me about twenty fives again but well obviously take to fight wherever I mean I think Ali needed Frazier right your Sugar Ray needed Tommy Hearns this is just this is the nature of the sport and guy like him I mean I think you you and Cody needed each other yeah I think there's something about that kind of intense rivalry yeah that is so important for actualizing who does the motherfucker man he's good even he's a the world he's a Olympic gold medalist he's a competitor he knows what he's doing right and we just arguably from his accomplishments one of the greatest combat sports athletes of all time yeah the guys no first guy ever to be an Olympic gold medalist and a UFC world champion which I the gold medalist thing I even hold even higher for him than even the world like obviously you see champions huge right but I wrestled my whole life I grew up wrestling to be an Olympic gold medalist is a fucking huge thing yeah I still think today wrestling's the hardest sport I've ever done and just to see that achievement especially how young he did it at and that's I almost hold that higher than him being a UFC champion well also the fact that he was beat by DJ he beat by beat by Mighty Mouse in the first round he gets destroyed he gets need to the body taken out beaten up and stopped and humiliated Wright comes back and what was it like two years later and think it was DZ and beats him I mean it becomes the fucking champ and beats the pound-for-pound consensus best fighter on the planet and the guy that had held that title from the very first time it was ever brought to the UFC he's been the only flyweight champion until Henry came along so and that's another reason why I want that fight man like you know what I mean like I know that I'm better than him obviously you're gonna give me some people gonna give me shit for saying that because obviously the fight they failed thing he went down the way it went down but guess what I'm better than that motherfucker and I want to prove it I want the toughest fights I mean that's why I was calling out max Holloway I want to I want to be in resuit I want to call max Holloway with Sam calivita I could be walking around 165 pounds with six percent body fat you know 100 percent like this guy man he can stack the weight on me he can take it off me I can go I have a secret weapon with Sam calivita I'm telling you and I could have a secret you just yeah but but people he won't work with everyone he won't really yeah if you come to him like unless you fit hooey he likes if you fit his image like wasn't like we work out of his garage now that which is so crazy you know like he could have a giant facility with all his hard work in science he does but he likes the the grit of in his house like he gets home from work he's all dressed up in his tie sometimes were already there waiting for him and he doesn't even change he's up there throwing medicine balls at her face in his tie and I'll dressed up from the suit from work you know like he likes that shit you know he could probably not even be a calculus teacher anymore and just be a Strang machine coach but that's not what he wants you know he's not in it for the fame and the money he's in it for the science and the love of doing it I want to see that garage pull up pull up his garage because this doesn't now I'm thinking about how big my fucking gym out here is you couldn't even park two cars in it if it's a small garage we have one one small track we have a spot to do like our cleans and our deadlifts what he really has is he has three for bite our know three bite there it is yeah that's crazy so it's a very small two-car garage yeah that he's got filled with a bunch of murderers yeah he's got like three bikes that we ride walking by if you were a girl dude all the time do people hope you walk by all the time we're in the garage and I'm yelling when I'm in there working out because these pushers likes our workouts are three hours long yeah and we're going there's a park across the street and we're throwing mess and balls at each other and go to that back to that last one with Pico please yeah you get a chance to see what's in the garage so I guess he parks his car in the driveway oh yeah he doesn't that's the sanctuary man he's got these stationary bikes in there that where he kills us on that's like how we push our lactate thresholds so what does he he's doing something with bands right here is it yeah there's a lot of things with bands right yeah cuz you get the e syndrich in concentric contraction you know you have a strain he's like wheeze doing it there's for your shoulder stability you know your rotator cuffs I mean yeah what did you do - and the wrestling your shoulders take a beating yeah I mean so it's kind of really just strengthen it yeah I do a lot of cuff stuff because the other different injuries that I've had I do a lot of band stuff with my you know yet this way external rotation internal rotation stuff yeah bands are great now why bands though as a pro as opposed to cables like cables with stacks wait why does use bands okay just what's what we have I mean if you had a nice Kaiser machine in there maybe we'd use it but I think the resistance coming back really really want support the further you extend a band the harder wants to pull you back and when you have a weight on there it's the exact same weight going in and out right where the further you extend that band the harder you make it on yourself there's nothing there's just more you can do with it and it's just very easy and takes up no space right right we do a lot of Medicine Bowl work for a core and for our shoulders as well - like catching in weird angles with keeping our balance we do like a lot of like kind of like old-school shit but in a certain way in a certain time yeah and so how does he get all that shit into his garage does he have to pull stuff out into the driveway there's stuff on the side of his house he's got like a little chassis stack stuff in - and um man we a lot of its it doesn't need much it really doesn't there's there's a lot of work you can do with just body weight but I mean we have a hundred pound medicine balls we got these big logs he makes it like it's almost like the strongman competitions there's a big there's a big hill next to his house that he makes his carry these like hundred pound logs and we had the farmers carry him up the hill and we're doing with a partner when I get up so far I dropped my run back I get the hundred pound medicine ball I had to sprint up the hill with it things like that where you're pushing your your lactate threshold over time Wow yeah and how does he schedule the training session so how does you know what to have you do and when off of our timeframe of when we want a peak off of my heart rate variability and how my body's reacting to our training because maybe I sparred and I admits to hard with Duane so I wake up the next morning and he realizes oh we got a pullback today like if I push you hard today you're gonna go in such a deep hole that's gonna take you a week to come out of it to where he only wants me to get to that really high peak take a day off so that now I can start coming back up again to where if I just continue for four or five days just crushing it run as hard as I possibly can my body's gonna crash so hard this can take me it's gonna be more of a detriment to come out of that hole than if I would have taken a break in between those days so he'll schedule that our schedules will change we have we have a schedule from the beginning so say I'm 12 weeks out like alright this is our planets what we're gonna do but then maybe I get sick or maybe I trained too hard with Duane the day before and so he'll realize all right this next day was a little bit easier even if it's my jujitsu he knows I'm gonna do to practice he's like maybe just drill you know go just make sure it's a like a low base drill like don't get your heart rate over such and such which I don't roll the heart rate monitor on but I can can kind of just guess you know how hard I need to go yeah I've never could you I guess you could yeah you buddy do you know anybody it does mm-hmm no it seems like it would get knocked off or something yeah I mean maybe for drilling yeah so when he's got you doing all this crazy stuff like deadlifts and plyos and medicine ball work does is there like a logic to what exercises are done when mm-hmm and like how does he like cuz it seems like you're doing all this old school stuff like badass stuff but my question is always like when do you do that yes when is that when is that done like once a week is that done early in the training camp is it done late like when are you doing strength work and your because you were saying you were doing cleans like the week out only us so when I'm doing those like a week how I'm doing only a certain amount of reps you know I'm not maybe not taxing my body for as long as I would in earlier camp and even though I'm going heavy maybe I'm only doing two sets you know just to keep my central nervous system strong well other than just taxing yourself you know or there's certain times I'll like there's certain days he knows I need to get the explosive power work or some days I needed you cadence fast fast feet um cardio work and he has that all mapped out on what days are what what weeks or what depending on where I'm at my fight camp or if I'm going 25 and if I'm going to stay as strong as it was at 35 things like that or if I ain't going 45 to be able to keep my my my cardio up cuz the thing was if I were if I would go 45 I wanted to put so much more muscle and the worry is that I'm gonna lose cardio right nobody wants to be able to keep that lactate threshold and me keep my cardio if I'm able to walk around at 165 pounds now what other stuff does he have you doing for recovery you're doing any sauna work are you doing ice baths like what kind of stuff I have an infrared sauna I do do red light therapy I do what do you mean by red light therapy there's a machine that I have in my house is called a juve it's a big red light it's a 680 to 808 nanometer light that I stand in front of it for a certain amount of time to not only increase my testosterone but to help recovery and my mitochondria my cells and flush my body out was that thing oh yeah dude you're in the future yeah is that you know looks like it mm-hmm dudes jacked yeah but yeah I have one of those in my garage I have an infrared sauna in my garage I do how big is that thing uh well so there's new ones now that are huge I get to the big as my body I'm to have ones that go in the backyard or they have travel ones you can take with you that's really small really the reason why I got into it was for increasing my testosterone them and the motility of my sperm holla yeah because I was I was I was having my session was low and I wanted to increase it and I saw this through Matt Brown actually Matt Browns alone they kind of got me this when I was up come on shout out that he's got some awesome training equipment yeah he's in he's a very knowledgeable very well-read guy very and you wouldn't like pure wouldn't guess that why when I had him on the podcast that's one things a lot of people said they I thought that the guy was a caveman kind of is he's also kind of brilliant he wants to be the caveman like manly man yeah he's very smart about it yeah so he's the one that turned me on to that so I got into it and I wanted to increase my testosterone but also read about increasing motility and my sperm us trying to have a kid we're having trouble and this and that and it could be that could have been my diet I switched so much up that I can't tell you which one it was you know cuz Sam helped me out this helped me out I mean so I'm I'm doing that I'll do a hyperbaric chamber I'll do cryotherapy often do you do the hyperbaric chamber um only when I need it because it can mess with your uh your hematocrit you know if I'm gonna do a lot of altitude training as well - mm-hmm I'm trying to increase my red blood cell count and my hematocrit and then when you go and you get into a hyperbaric chamber you're breathing a hundred percent oxygen so if I'm in it too much right I'll lower my hematocrit right but I do a lot of his altitude miss same as an altitude machine he has me used it's called alto lab I breathe into it for a certain amount of time this again another program he created the company was around but he created the program that I'm supposed to do to put my body in a hypoxic state for only a certain amount of time because you can over train yourself that way as well - to increase my capillaries increase the date of vasodilation in my veins as well as increase red increase increase red blood cells that's amazing because you know one of the things that's a big well I don't know if it's a misconception but it's one of the things that people always talk about is that you should train at altitude and you did that you went to Denver and a lot of people do that and they find benefits in that but the thought process now seems to be that you get more work done at sea-level exact so I thought the same thing and then I met Sam and I and I actually felt this but I didn't understand it you already can't recover the same or you can't push as hard right at altitude and your body actually get some more dance at sea level when you're working out you have to push harder and your recoveries better and same reason why I think sleeping an altitude wouldn't help either because your body won't recover completely so I feel better training at sea level but I use this Aalto lab for only a certain amount of time on and off with breathing techniques and I felt the best the best benefits with that so so what is this thing look like it's yeah although it's just a mask and it's got a bunch of cylinders on it and the more cylinders you stack on it the more its emulating the altitude so it's like breathing at 40,000 feet when you stack a lot of them on there and so you're you're hooked up to this thing how much free gas masks on it yeah you could use that where it's just like a snorkel right where it could be a gas mask kind of thing and you're doing it while you're training no no not doing a while I'm training I'm doing it while I'm resting on certain days like a certain schedule I can't do it all the time this thing without training this thing jacks up your your cardio yes it'll help with your what do I buy one of these all - laughs so you just you just breathe yeah but I'd have to give you the technique because you can overdo it as you know and you're gonna end up hurting yourself as well - and how long do you do it for it says here ten minutes or 60 minutes and then there's a program initial 15 day program and our breathing session will produce performance effects that lasts up to three weeks Jesus Wow so for a 60 minute session six 10-minute sessions ten-minute what's wrong with my voice six 10-minute sessions six myself four minutes off so six six per hour and so you're basically doing these intervals where you're just breathing yeah it's one of those things so you have a you have an oxygen reader on your finger tells your oxygen levels because you want to put yourself in a hypoxic state Ryan and there's certain levels up that Sam wants me to keep my body I just want me to go too low either because your body will start producing a hormone that tells you you're dying oh geez yeah and I'm so it's one archuleta when I first met him I was coaching Ultimate Fighter came out and told me it's okay man I've been breathing this thing Sam tells me to do it Mike all right what do I do is like just get your levels as low as you can oh cool I ended up passing out because you yeah so you know me I'm very competitive right and I was like I was looking at it you're supposed to do for six minutes I'm like oh I got like 30 seconds left but it's getting hard like I can make it the rest 30 seconds next thing I remember I'm like seizuring on the couch I fling this oxygen monitor off my finger and then I wake up a couple minutes later I'm like oh shit I passed out you know how you could yeah you don't want to do too much yeah 40,000 feet seems a little excessive yeah yeah but it seems like it would be amazing for hikers to or someone who does want to climb Everest or something and acclimate yourself to the person that started I think they started it for some sort of disease and obviously everyone runs with it for getting better results to it I'm by one of those motherfuckers if I'd get better endurance just sitting here but it's work though you'd like you're going up oh yeah you'll sweat when I strum it - yeah so it's just because it's hard to breathe with the thing yeah so you want to get yeah I mean you're not getting and sometimes I'll have to like pull off and get some fresh air and get back on to it like you want to keep your levels at it cuz you want to go too low again you'll pass out and is it a breathing exercise like are you doing anything are you pushing or you learn yeah you learn how to breath a fire-type stuff learn how to get the carbon dioxide out of your body as well - like you really learn a lot about breathing when you're doing this because you have the oxygen monitor on your finger and when you want to increase your oxygen levels I'll let more air out right but if I want to decrease my oxygen levels faster I'll take shallow breaths and I can learn that I can get my body in a hypoxic state faster by doing it but then when I need to get more oxygen to my body I'll make sure to excel more the carbon dioxide and then breathing more air so you kinda it does teach you how to breathe better as well too and then you create more capillaries more lung strength a lot of stuff huh no he's gonna be mad at me for talking about that ya know are you breathing in through your nose you breathe in through mouth Oh what I have my nose my nose closed is your pinched off is your nose functional not so good right my left is good yeah my wrists most fighters yeah yeah my right sides I'm a mouth breather have you ever thought about getting an opened up I have but I was told that for me to get it done it's just gonna happen again like it'll it'll it'll weaken the structural integrity of my nose and because I gotta like carve out the come on nose insides just crooked he's led him to carve it out and so they say that'll just rehabbing and I'll to get it done again so yeah I had it done it was one of the best things I've ever done I've seen but it's one of the best things I've ever done ready hear it sounds so good like I'll be in yoga I've been doing yoga the last like four days cuz I've been trying to keep my weight down and then I make you breathe in through your nose and I'm just in the back classic you trying to breathe in it's the worst when I used to do yoga for how to fix the guy would tell me breathe he knows I'm like I don't my basically don't have a nose you get fart my face I barely smell like this thing's useless yes exactly man I hate being a mouth breather at night too I wake up in the morning with like the driest yeah worst well I mean it's just part of the part of the struggle right yeah I'm so cryotherapy how often you doing that um when I have the time I mean Sam's all Sam stuff and the training I do is a full-time job more than a full-time job and so it takes a lot I'm depending on how much recovery I need we're looking to open up our own gym and put our own crowd therapy in it so I can use it more often hmmm we're looking to team up with a company that wants to join forces with us and come into our gym and where they have hyperbaric chambers on hand which I own my own but I haven't been using it because I haven't hooked up but do you what company are you going with right now because if you have you gone to cryo healthcare mmm-hmm they have the best fucking crowd is there's like a room or like the little room is it the room one is the one you want because the little room one is cold air okay you know the woman who died in Vegas no she worked at a cryo place and she did it herself unfortunately and she had it adjusted wrong and so it was like below her nose and she was breathing in this stuff and she blacked out and froze to death she was working there by herself unsupervised you're never supposed to do that you're never supposed to climb into one of those things unsupervised I would have never guessed the one they have in cryo health care it's not liquid nitrogen that you that's on your body it's cold air so they're freezing the air with liquid nitrogen and this is it right here I took David Sinclair who's he's a professor at Harvard and one of the leading guys in the longevity movement and I took him there the other day it's you walk in that chamber and you know you you take you put a little mask on your face and earmuffs on just to stop frost by 240 degrees I'll take you there right now if you want yeah good yeah we'll do it right whatever get out of here man yeah it's the shit okay it's the shit you're in there for three minutes and it's so I've done the below the neck and it's hard yeah it's like god it's cold but it's nothing like this thing is your fucking head is frozen I don't feel like those are the ones I have stand in like three minutes when your time are very hard yeah yes okay nice okay I'm there yeah there's a there's a company called Oh two that wants to team up with us like I said they have red light therapy they do of crowd therapy where do float tanks I'm sorry lifting since I was listening to your podcast yeah beautiful and you that seriously for me it's like the only form of meditation I can get because otherwise I have too much stuff going on my bones I got people asking me to do this people ask me to do that like I have it's awesome because you go in there and you have to like get rid of everything yeah I usually fall asleep I usually go in there for the most part I cup maybe like 30 minutes I'll be there and relax I'll be like meditating thinking about stuff and then eventually I alway cup a coat am I if you're ever around this area I got one right there you can climb in any time loves you text me okay I'll open it up the adage in here ma'am this is this one right here the float lab version have you seen this one have you seen the one I have no fucking huge okay it's giant if you can't touch the 9 feet long no wow okay its enormous okay and the guy who in credit who made it this guy crash he's the reason why they're high level tanks today he's a mad scientist and he's the guy who's behind the float lab when you see how extensive the purification system this guy has he's got like water purification systems that you would use for commercial purposes like for a fucking like a block like a city block and it's just for this one tank okay it's crazy no it's probably yeah it's very expensive he's a mania okay and so he makes these insanely overdeveloped tanks and when I first got into Tanks was around 2000 you had these like kind of thin plastic ones which were fine they worked I had one in my basement but then it busted and the water spilled out I had a fucking get my basement drained it was a nightmare and the guy who was fixing the tank told me about the float lab which is they have a place in Venice and a place in Westwood and they were fucking the the whole spa the whole industry was dying it was going away and I didn't understand it I was like how is this so awesome but no one no one knows it's too much huh so well it wasn't that it was just nobody tried it nobody knew about I didn't try until I heard you on a podcast do I can't shut the fuck up about it I said I loved it it's amazing and still I mean my life is crazy I'm sure everyone's life is crazy mine's insane I've too much shit going on all the time so it's like seriously one of the only ways I can shut my brain off it's the only time you're alone with just your thoughts well your body isn't even there sometimes that's the reason why I like to take a shit my shits have been like three times longer because I do uh say my time like ah yes no you know what the key to taking a good shit is though what's that don't bring your phone I know it's like you bring your phone you start scrolling to Instagram looking at girls butts and fucking explosion forwarding I think you shake Oh where's my phone again sing a shit exactly my kids know that that phone I start walking into the bathroom go there for a while then to man it's the worst yeah I bet cellphones have created the him triple the hemorrhoids oh I'm sure yeah right first shoe thing on long you sit on the toilet now comparable you used to Eddie Bravo has very extensive theories on creating hemorrhoids on the toilet like about what is happening to your ass ask him oh he goes into great detail about the pressure the bowl that it's an unnatural pressure like squeezing part of your ass and this created pussy did music created zone toilet seat to get rid of hemorrhoids really the move is those squatty potty all dude I have one of those those it's like whoa I didn't know how much in there yeah it just wouldn't come flying out yeah I seen you had a is it a toe toe in here yeah dude I think what is it brondell brought down I think those are the shit I built the house outright oh and I put one of those in my I don't want to shit anywhere else yes exactly psyche I just only want to go home take a shake is that so it seats way better and it's got the bidet in it it's awesome so do you rent your house out in Colorado no no just go out there and visit when you can yeah kind of like a little vacation house now I mean I live in I live in Orange County but I love Orange County I do man ice out there I went to school down there I went to school Cal State Fullerton so all my close friends I wrestle with or in the same part of their life that all of young kids I they're all they're all in the same area so it's not only that my family's close I love Orange County it's definitely been a great a change for me but Colorado's beautiful how far are you from the beach Oh probably a half hour that's not too bad no about a half hour from Huntington Newport mm-hmm so yeah it's it's nice it's a suit I mean you're Berlin is like a family area too yeah it's like such a nice little cool area it's very nice yeah yeah yeah that whole area is nice and Calvados out in that area calivita lasagna Linda Vaughn lives in Yorba Linda KUB lives in Yorba Linda oh nice so we got a good little like a little family started there all the guys that wrestle with in college live in the area well it's nice to see guys from both organizations with the UFC and Bellator joining together to you know I mean I've seen that with you guys I mean Bellator really now is like it's a major player yeah and they have like major major talent absolutely very interesting yeah I mean they don't get as much credit obviously they're not this big a promotion but they have some of the best fighters yeah I mean look they've got Gegard Mousasi I got Rory MacDonald MacDonald yeah you can go down the list it's how about fucking Ryan Bader ko in favor with that crazy I thought Bader was gonna win I thought he's gonna use his pressure and just wear on him and out wrestling yeah but yeah that's crazy ten seconds well he clipped him with that crazy it's like a level champ yeah level change half hook half jab I think he was getting fader to think that he was in drop for a shot and right it seemed like he wanted to get fade or to do that isn't that how I got to knock out the fight before that - right exactly I'm fine I've took yeah yeah yeah I think was a level change left hook people are thinking like oh she's coming for a takedown well as a heavyweight man he's a motherfucker yeah it looks good he looks fantastic body looks good yeah I mean he looks like a heavyweight yeah and you know he's weighing 235 ish somewhere around there you know which is a great weight for a heavyweight anything it's the best way for that weight class yeah there's that point of diminishing returns right we get to like 260 unless you're in Ghana well see the in Ghana doesn't know how to wrestle so that's part of the problem but but if he did holy fuck but as agile as you need to be addressed I don't know if he can move that fast he can move fast moves like a cat damn he scares the shit out of it if he knew like what everybody else knew I just think he's so physically gifted yeah I mean when you see him punch people it's like it's a different thing it's different yeah just a lunchbox coming at your head the power is just preposterous yes doesn't even make any sense yeah if that guy could get with a guy like Dwayne and start moving and just you know not just rely on throwing hammers but setting stuff up and switching stances and I don't know if you can do that with that kind of weight you know like how long can a guy like that move you know Mehmet Sam can get him to move that long I guarantee you'd you'd Sam like I'm telling you like if I'm going like for my body mass if I'm able to walk around 165 on the lactate threshold he's telling me I can have I guarantee you kiddie with the big guy like that Wow that would be insane well there's not a lot of big guys like that that's the thing - it's like who does he have to train with it's gonna push him yeah you know that is a giant problem with heavy weights whether it's in wrestling or jiu-jitsu or anything it's finding someone that they could train with it's that heavy mm-hmm that's that big I mean he's he's a legit natural 265 pound man yeah I mean well I feel like if you're getting hit by another Turner see five pound man - it's gonna take more out of you even if you're 265 yeah and you're getting hit by another guys 265 I still feel like your head can only take so much oh yeah yeah yeah I mean how much more can you take right yeah I mean this is that's the football thing that we were talking about we're talking about Jason Harrison and he was a lineman for UC Davis and you know played a little bit in the NFL was a benchwarmer but you know was training with those guys it's just that that when you're dealing with gigantic huge dudes slamming into each other like that the force yeah I guess you got to do more of like the drill what we're talking about live like live drilling you know or you're good with like partners you can trust that you're gonna do 50% sparring you know crush each other but you're gonna get that reaction time kind of stuff but then you can wrestle hard you could usually do too hard and get that the hard training that way but then drill the right ways striking you know yeah yeah now as far as your recovery stuff did you detail everything here you got the red light you have your infrared sauna using like one of those fit spas which would kind of I think it is a fit spa is that the kind of house like a TV in it no it's got it's got bluetooth for listening to your podcast it's got its infrared so it's it's it's got the red light only gets to 140 degrees right but the infrared makes you sweat from this cells inside out mmm which I feels better for the recovery I do like the super hot ones like they do something to you that like it's hard to describe when you get out of it like when it's really hot and you feel great I feel like I get more recovery out of the infrared throw up my body same reason why I used the Juve red light therapy ice baths no I don't do ice pass they're torture I've done the cryo and again - I don't do that much of it I think mainly I need yeah I get my recovery from taking the days off I need to most my recovery like I take I take more days off now working with sand than I've ever taken in my past when I was working with Dwayne out in Colorado or at alpha-male I would just go go go go go go go I thought working more was gonna be there better and that's probably why your testosterone was dropping a hundred percent I was redlining myself and so I take more days off and I was Sam but the days that I'm not taking off for a lot harder just knowing when to cycle those days off like you have to rest and I hate my sleep I have a one-year-old so I created a guestroom that I'll sleep in during camp because I gotta get my nine hours of sleep and knowing what days I got to take off and those days will be off from training completely I'll try to like go take my son on a walk go hang out my family obviously I got less of that this camp because I'm going 25 you took a lot more work but it's making sure to take those days off what about massage yes yeah absolutely how often you do that as much as I can I mean I'll do it I don't think you can do too much of it as long as you get someone that's knowledgeable um but massage big time somewhere you connect and I said another way to really relax and shut the brain off - yeah yeah anything to get Mike really your recovery needs to be dropping their cortisol levels if you could drop your cortisol levels everything else is gonna go the way it should go which is another thing I test throughout my camp is my cortisol levels you know maybe I'm doing too much outside of training like too much sponsorship stuff for my fit to fight program or all my other businesses my flavor Republic which by the way is excellent tell people about this stuff this stuff is really good you see this a while back you've got some great rubs this is a honey garlic it's all healthy stuff about flavor republic this is not me this is a plug folks but I just love I love it yeah great stuff man when I got into it because I met a jiu-jitsu guy he's really his name's Kenny tinny he's really big in jiu-jitsu he was taking propecia and it messed up his testosterone level we were talking about this before the show did the same thing to me yeah I messed up his social levels so he had to get into his diet to kind of recurve what he had going on because he was taking insane some insane amounts of therapeutic level of testosterone back and so he want to get his diet on point too so we wouldn't have to take as much test I mean as well as I teamed up with just an average Joe he's just a guy that wants to get into fitness and wants to be healthy but us three we created this because I got into my diet so much because I'm not eating any sugars I don't go complex I'm pretty much going like paleo keto and so and every time I wanted to do meal prep or Sam wanted a new meal prep we couldn't use spices and seasonings because if you look on the shelf they have like 14 grams of sugar and a bunch of tables that we were talking about Trager I love triggers grills and I love the rubs and the barbecue sauce is never good but there's some fucking sugar in that shit'll are they're so delicious exactly and so we created this so that we could do our meal prep and still be healthy you know an espresso rug that's really good on your wall game yeah yeah it's really it's it's like it's like a peppery egg that one doesn't sell very well because I think it's called espresso rub people don't really understand it yeah espresso blend so one thing to change like Columbian something you know coffee people don't know I mean we're talking about with Ben Greenfield yesterday coffee rubs are fantastic awesome he was saying that coffee actually really reduces the amount of carcinogens on cooked meat oh really yeah like having it on the outside that it acts as an antioxidant and reduces the amount of Christian age the first time I tried it was a piece of meat I got Whole Foods and had an espresso rub on it amazing yeah we need to make that like I'm telling you like all the wild game I have like it takes away any of the gamey flavor let's get that it doesn't sell as well cause people don't understand but it's right good do you are you getting any hunting in do you have any time I did this year nothing successful after my Cody fight in August I went out in the middle of nowhere in Colorado BIOSes Park and hunted by myself I did lots a nice getaway duty but my phone didn't work no one can text me no me I slept out in the middle of the wilderness by myself under the stars like kind of freaky I've never done that before you know but I mean Dorian was telling me about that that was like you got to do it it's the best things I've ever done I like hunting with people because you get to get like really to know them right like you go sit on the camp for everyone that splits up to go hunt you talk about your day you get back to the campfire and you you really get to know each other and I go with my brothers and my dad all the time one of my favorite things about hunting it's the best it really is new really get to tell stories and get to know each other it's awesome but I went myself for the first time this year and that was an experience as well too like you got like just hunting on and doing like the wilderness by yourself making sure you don't go out for three days so did your backpack end yeah well no I got to drive in it wasn't sent to a trailhead yep and how much you carrying on your back ah probably like 40 50 pounds okay so you got like a day pack yeah I got that and then I'll just hike back in and you have a bow my bow yeah yeah I I really only like to help my bow yeah I will do some rifle just when the opportunity comes I have time to practice with my bow I do yeah it's kind of another escape for me as well too like another way like maybe my off day like my Daisy coach tells me to take a day off maybe I'll go shoot my bow or if I'm gonna Colorado I'll take my bow down or go fishing yeah things like that so yeah it's one of my hobbies like even if I'm not getting ready for hunting season I'll just shoot just to shoot next time you come here you got to play techno hunt is this someone out here you guys out front but you haven't seen that yet huh I've played it I've played it at an archery shop in Colorado it's like a 3d honey it's a video game pretty much an you shoot like these magnets at the screen well it's not a magnet it's just a the instead of the broad head it's flat like a head of a nail yeah it's cool and it's a Kevlar screen it's very realistic too gives you a score if you get like a vital shot or if you wound the animal exactly yeah yeah for sure off to bring my bow next time it's super addictive I mean you got the fantasy factory here you know like I don't even know if I'd go home if I had this place oh now I got a bunch of stuff here for my kids oh really so yeah it's like you see that inflatable thing out there my gymnastics I figured I was just a judge how far you're shooting no that's bouncy okay things all filled up with air my ten-year-old comes in here and does fucking back flips and shit without concrete around a she's a fucking freak really doesn't care I'd be scared of shit it's like it's like not very why you gotta let him you gotta let him do wild shit I guess well there's the mats out there to the jumpy to math she does him on that too okay it shows gymnastics yeah that's hard on your body it is yeah when I wrestled to be at a gymnastics team and they were always in the physical therapy there always hurt their backs they're English so I think ten-year-olds it's like first of all just see the shit she does like she could stand here and take her hands and touch the back of her ankles yeah she just bends all the way back and it's like what how the fuck you bought even worked that way yeah I look at this 51 year old fucked up body of mine from all the years of beatin on it that's like but although all the weight lifts new duties I make you stiff for two years the door not knowing what I was doing just lifted me head style yes get like like right now I'm training with Sam and we're going heavy just to keep my way we don't know what I don't know from 135 oh no from 125 so or 45 or fear I'm just keep my weight where it needs to be and getting a lot stronger so he's told me like we're adding all this muscle make sure you're doing your yoga and that's that's why I thing I want to talk to you about outside of yoga are you doing stretching yes yes Anthony go stretch why stretch before every I do a dynamic stretch before every practice before practice is interesting because most people don't don't note that it will static that don't do stat I don't like doing static stretching before I workout just a dynamic you're constantly moving while you're stretching yes it's an something I've learned from Lauren lindau out in Colorado and something I've added to my fit to fight program as I go through like a whole dynamic warm-up that I do before every practice it's like a walking series you know like a walking knee hug a walking quad pull inchworms like things like that and like quadrupeds series of a keep my hips loose things like that I'll do that before every practice but then at the end of practice you do a little bit of us I don't do as much static stretching I do more dynamic kind of like in movement stretching you know same things like I mean I get more flexible I got so much more flexible when I started kickboxing just from that throwing like a head kick throwing a head kick and just opening your hips all the time yeah but before I throw a bunch of head kicks I need to do my quadrupeds series to not mess my hip flexors up or my my so eyes will get tight as shit one of those so writes what I heard Chandler talking about one for you did you yeah I got a really the sponsor so they gave me a bunch of them that I think is this shit and you lay on it right yeah you could do all kinds of things it's sorry that fuck yeah that's but it works because I had to so as messed up for my fights before my Joe Soto fight I couldn't throw a kick so two weeks for the fight I couldn't throw kicks I was like fuck man like my bet I thought was my back my little back was toast I was like I had a massage therapist working on my back work on my back and then finally I got was like no dude it's you're so ass and they started digging in my size and it was so freakin pixel Chandler brought it up I didn't even know it was a muscle I didn't know what the fuck that was dude it's a motherfucker to get that work done David Goggins had an issue with it as well okay keeping him from running okay yeah yeah I mean it messes up your whole core yeah but this is a simple plastic device you know you lay on it they sent me a box of a man I see I see it on my Instagram now all the time it's the sponsor dad and I always he's Chandler talking about yeah so I was curious Chandler's really into his body and working out he's got his own workout program and stuff too so yeah he's an Instagram page is good to follow it is these are fucking freak I mean look like a bodybuilder yeah it's a freak athlete - I mean it's does these medicine ball backflips oh yeah have you seen those yes yeah he's a backflip slam the medicine ball backflip slam the medicine ball Jesus Christ yeah he's a killer man there's another one at Bellator yeah fucking stud you know I mean he's one of the best 155 pounders on the planet no doubt about it hundred percent I agree with that just they gotta change the name yeah Scott Coker I love you the name is wack yeah that wait or what is it a ballot or I have no idea I have no idea but I feel like you can kind of feel the difference in their promotion when you go they're getting bigger and bigger right but you can feel a difference when you're there of course but you see the talent that's a technical shit you know they got gold over there now I miss gold Goldie's my man I saw him when I was there he's always always puts a smile on my face his energy I miss him yeah I love John Anik too though you know I and and um you know I just think they just don't have the funds that the UFC has yeah let's just they don't have the the deep pockets the UFC he's just ended UFC he's been around for so long there's no baby has made the right moves I mean look there with the ESPN man that's so crazy amazing I'm so so awesome when that was signed I was so pumped just to see think what it's gonna be in five years when they're good fighters with ESPN like how much we're gonna be on TV and yeah the shows they're doing they're doing this thing to that it's like not only they're gonna fall the winter around after their fight they're also gonna fall the loser around whoa to get into your life like I mean yeah it's gonna fucking suck you think about it's like I don't want a camera follow me around on photos but they want to see how it affects your life like like me I've been I mean obviously I've been pretty pissed off about it you know write it like me if I wasn't staying busy with my businesses in my family like I would lose my mind like I would like to see that like say Brian Ortega after he fought max all the way yeah he goes into that fight looking unbeatable and gets just just touched up you know max Holloway just touched him up man we really got to see who the fuck max Holloway is after that fight in his distance control space his output everything he's just a champion man he's just a fucking champion his mindset yeah he's just a champion gangster these gangsters they can't I love it and Ortega is as tough as they come too many just wasn't ready for that yet I think he will be man like he's like you saying like that like I have a camera phone around after loss like I think he's looking for new things now - okay that's what I mean if you're a for a guy that takes a loss and you don't branch out to do new things Brian you're never gonna get better well his jujitsu is off the charts when he grabbed a hold of Cubs neck when he got the Darce at the end of the first round was like holy shit it's over yeah but the the bell rang and he got out of it but then the second round when he jumped on him and grabbed that guillotine he went over the top of him like oh they're a standing up and clinched and got it and then came down on it and then had it in the air it's nasty his technique is so fucking sharp and he could do that with everything any arm bars he's got like a good squeeze cardio - oh yeah well you know what he's he's real legacy jiu-jitsu he comes from you know that Henner and here on camp and you know from that's hoary in school and we're hoist was from that's the Torrance crew I mean that's that's right from the fucking motherland and that is and you know there's a term that some people get offended by that term is basic jujitsu I'm not offended by that at all because that some of the very best guys of all time whether it's hogr Gracie or Hicks and you don't see them doing like weird stuff it's all very standard it's not I mean there's basic striking yes look at max Holloway beat or take whose basic striking to beat him control one twos yeah yeah you know I mean basics win national titles and wrestling 100 percent high crotch 100 percent you know a sprawling behind but it's the level of the basics and this is what I was gonna say about max hallways jiu-jitsu it's like the level of his basics he's just it's so fuckin polished it's like as a as a person who loves martial arts for me when I see someone whose technique is that sharp my whoa that's what I want to tell people this is why I get frustrated when I see people that are on their back and they're in the open guard and they aren't their legs are just kind of sitting there flailing away and the guy's got his arms on the ground I'm like Jesus Christ he's giving it to him bars he's giving you all my pilates he's giving you a sweep he's setting himself up yeah and people don't know what to do that's one thing I've added a lot to my game lately is being at Gracie ball of Liberty Monica is my jiu-jitsu and I haven't got a chance to show you I've been talking about it like my Cody fights but obviously those wounded on their feet this one I didn't get a chance to show it I was hoping we were gonna go to the ground like I wanted out wrestle pseudo you know yeah I felt strong it felt good my I was working with Darryl Christian on my wrestling my my jujitsu has been on point with Felipe and I've been adding a lot of like crazy stuff to it because like Dwayne's only been out three days a week right and we kill it while doings out here but then when he's gone I work on all my other stuff so it's forced me to get into my digits a little bit more as well and I've been doing so good man I wanted to show it off but haven't got that chance does he have you ranked he give you both I don't do any gives me a blue black is that cute you a blue belt but really you black he calls me a blue black don't you want to wear the key just to get a belt I do I was just out of camp I always figure out how we're not at I'm like yeah to get in there like only time I feel like I can go and do key training is when I'm not in camp which I want to do it until I get a fight lined up I'm actually just thinking that I'm gonna go and keep my weight down a good way I'm doing yoga but why not go and do some key jujitsu I'm just to do it at for fun yeah I mean and show that I can do ghee it's fun it's a whole nother game but when I'm in camp training I need those fast scramble especially being on a lighter weight class I need them wrestling scrambles and especially find a guy likes to hoot Oh like we're not going to do jujitsu we're gonna do grappling we're gonna do MMA jiu-jitsu right of course yeah so I needed that kind of like fast motion especially with smaller guys well especially sweaty and slippery and you really need gable grips and / hooks you know yeah yeah the problem with GG Jitsu there's great things to it one you have to be very tactical with your defense you can't just muscle a lot of things and that that's a big shock for a lot of people a wrestler in particular that used to just exploding and not everything and then we engaging and when you get you you get your collars grabbed yeah you're like oh shit yeah someone has your sleeve and they have your collar and you're like oh fuck I'm locked up here but it's funny it's like more realistic for a street fight oh yeah you know like well that was gonna say like the last thing you ever want to do is get like in a street fight with like sometimes a judo practitioner you know like you just getting like John hakumen had he had a thing on his Instagram yesterday about that where it's like he's pointed to the to the floor of the cage it's like now imagine this is a fight this is concrete and this is you and someone getting hoist in the air it's like take down defend which is so fucking true yeah yeah so true I mean you if you got in a like Hector Lombard or something like that as a judo yeah there it is imagine this is you and this is concrete fuck yeah yeah yeah especially if somebody really fucking throws their legs up in the air and comes down with you fighting in the street is so dangerous man oh Jesus so dangerous just hitting your head on the concrete oh man someone getting knocked out and hitting their head on the concrete you're so dangerous yeah and it happens every goddamn day people who don't know how to fight which because they watch this shit I think they can go and do it you know that got fucking do that got a couple shots of tequila and yeah yeah the best YouTube videos ever is watching that stuff but it's always like oh man I got might be dead well if he's not dead he's fucked up for a long time yeah yeah I don't think people understand I think I'll do more jets once I'm done fighting like a jujitsu just to try to get ranked you know I'd like to be a black belt one day for sure I just like to make it to just just to have that would you like to compete I don't know I don't know when I'm done fighting I don't want to compete ever again I've competed my whole life I'm competing since I was eight years old I've never had a like I've had side jobs and stuff you know but I've never had a career yeah yeah I mean I thought I was going to until I dropped out of school and decided become a MMA fighter I'm parents like you're crazy I don't know do you you're obviously crazy but the most crazy things that you had this thing in your mind that you wanted out Russell so who'd oh yeah I can't it's different man MMA rez different it really is me I mean he's trust me I would have been a feeder in its own right he's a great wrestler but it's different man but the fact that you wanted to do it yeah I want the I want the toughest tough man like I'm I live by the sword die by I go out there I sling leather I bra I want to fight like I don't have boring fights I want to that's why I wanted challenge max Holloway that so I want to beat Henry cejudo I want to be the best and do that I feel like you really need to challenge your name I'm not just talking the talk I'm not just doing it to talk shit I really want to do it now where does the 135 pound belt sit right now because you're the champion and if you do decide to pursue the flyweight title again yeah for everyone else in that bantamweight division this is kind of a clusterfuck yeah I agree we had a big fight on Saturday with since seven more than Mariah's yes huge fight and they they've already fought before too so yes um we'll see what happens with that fight you know and Cody Garr Brants fighting pedro muñoz if that's what's coming up soon as well right yeah that's coming up in March I believe is that that that's that the Vega at 2:35 yeah so there's a bunch of big fights in that division yeah but I'd say the one that really kind of plays a factor would be a since 7:00 tomorrow is yes right yeah which I have beaten to uh since I'll write monomer eyes have been looking good as well too but since I was got a big win streak so yeah I will see man I mean it depends if I fight so who do out 35s to like I don't know what's what I mean obviously I wanted that 25s he's talking about saving the flyweight division let's pump this thing up let's get it done like I wanna she don't want to relinquish your 35 pound crowns so what if they come around and they say you've got to defend I want to be active - that's also some I want to say when I was getting on yours I'm calling out 45s I'm calling out this but I also don't want to be the guy that's just gonna walk away from my belt either like I want to be the cowboy Cerrone and be more active I haven't been active enough lately I've been too long at gaps if I but because these fights have been built up hyped up people get hurt this and that you know I want to be a little more active I'm always in shape I'm always in the gym must be a little bit more of the I mean but one of my training partners Warren shelita he fights he fought for fights for boat tour in ten months you know like I want to be a little more active that's how I get paid I'm sure turning 33 on February 7th so my career is not gonna last forever I want to start clicking them paychecks you know when do you think you're gonna do you have a game plan or when you're gonna write off to the sunset oh not necessarily I guess when the opportunities it doesn't seem doesn't seem like it makes sense as well as maybe my health as long as everything's going well I feel healthy which the way I've been treating my body is the healthiest I've ever been which is crazy so as long as I have the right people around me like my wife and my coaches will tell me like look man you need to hang it up and I feel like I have those people around me like I don't want to be the don't want talk shit I don't wanna be like two chocolate L fighting because I need it right right another reason why I've created other businesses too I don't have to fight I don't know I don't want to fight because I have to you know so I've been I've been really smart with my money I've been really smart with my investments to where I could walk away you know but I have too much to prove right now you know I have too much to get back and first and foremost this fight against Henry cejudo well I'm glad to hear that you are like thinking about that that you're planning for the future yeah there's a lot of guys that have done like Mike Bisping has planned very well for the future and you know there's you know Brenda jobs like the fucking gold standard and
