the girag and experience Oh Freddy Lockhart by the way used to be on the Frank Caliendo shown is in my opinion one of the best Impressionists out there you you do impressions that are very weird man you do some impressions that no one else does that's that I guess that's what you should do I always figure it's like why I get in and do something the Nicholson the ones like that it's like I try to find a strange one and I do it like iced tea man don't nobody do iced tea bunch of bitches I do iced tea better than iced tea man I do his voiceover work and whatnot I love to say whatnot you know at the Lisp and everything I tried lights a little Lisp there yeah he fights a little list but it's kind of gangster and it works his room you know what I'm saying pitch it's dig it I used to do that at the Comedy Store I used to call The Comedy Store is ice-t and this poor guy can eat any this guy used to work the phones there do you remember this guy he was Mitzi's pool guy and there was something something was off with him definitely say I mean I don't want to say what he had but he definitely was one of us you know he wasn't thinking right but he was like he got he made money he he had a pool company he cleaned pools and he did it well but he'd function like an eight-year-old and I would call him every time he would pick up the phone I would call him and I would be ice-t and he would fall for it every time but like yo man I'm bringing 30 people in tonight man what you got on my booth situation like you better build one for me well I'll see if we can that's how I would brush up on the impression is if I could fool can eat any I felt like it was golden yeah how do you work impressions do you practice them at home and then eventually bring in this stage or do you know when you hear somebody well you know you can do it you know I there's a lot of people if you hear them right away I know I could do if somebody has tends to have a deeper voice or something like that or there's a weird thing about them I I know I could do it but I always more so than the way it sounds it's the way somebody looks when they talk because people move their mouth a certain way that'll reveal half the right you know you know I just realized talking to you about impressions though you know I don't I've never practiced any of the impressions that I've done I just do them like what Joey Diaz just like that I just know I could do it let's do it yeah are you that way too like you hear someone talk yeah I think it's like you got to get out of your own way you just let it filter in and come out come out like you know cuz it's like like you'll hear if you subtract scrutinize it you'll really start to fuck it out but how do you dress it you know I'll listen to them on headphones and if I don't hear my voice anymore that means I've matched it whoa yeah it means I've matched it like like the Morgan Freeman I started working on an eighth grader when I hold on Joe Rogan let me get to that let's see him there's a fella named Morgan Freeman and I started working on the impression when I was in the eighth grade yes I was about 14 years old jerked off seven times a day and it took me forever what happens creep and the way I finally perfected it when I was like 22 I saw Ben Affleck on Dave Letterman and he was doing a Morgan Freeman impression but it was horrible but he was doing one thing I wasn't doing right second thing it's on here he was adding everything else was wrong and I married the two and I was talking like Morgan Freeman all day I was calling restaurants but like I'd like to get a table for two please okay mr. Freeman I was testing it out I was like oh my god Oh amazing so when I nail one I've been working on a Tom Hanks for years and I still can't get it there's something but he's one of those like ice-t like Morgan Freeman everybody knows who he is but nobody doesn't you know yeah and it's somewhere in here I found that I can't go back and forth with it but it's it's you're missing a little yeah I'm game show host II with it right now but it's like there's World War Two Tom Hanks who's very solemn and talks about World War two you know I'm on Conan O'Brien said is wrong thank you making that noise microwave it I think that is I think that has a lot to do with impressions there's certain impressions that I can do that other people can't do right I think it's the shape of my face there's men there's ways you let your throat and I can show this so definitely you know you can Moo contort your mouth look Biggie Smalls I started working on that impression one time too and I found out how could sound like a fat lie it's like you can contort your mouth much love Rafi if you listen you know we love you he's like Cartman on this I don't know what happens when you get an office but clearly someone sits you down and just your agenda drama before he was in office you know your sign hailed oh you could say it because it was the point you doing Obama well it's uh it's time for weed I like
