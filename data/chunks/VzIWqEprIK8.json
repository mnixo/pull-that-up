how much time did you spend in North Korea about a week I was in Pyongyang and the areas around Pyongyang and then I went there via Beijing and then from there up to Mongolia then over to Bhutan what was North Korea like just sad you know this poor people who are scared of their government and my tour guides since I went there alone they were very suspicious of me so I put to tour spies on me the nice one who talked to me and the mean one who just scowled and took notes and every day the guy would ask me basically the same question is like when a detective is trying to peel the layers of onion skin off so you said you're a businessman I'm like yeah and like so what do you do like you know I edit books which is true mine and is really what are the books about I said well you know often they're not that good and so I'm you're all put in one hotel you and the Dutch tourists and the Australians everyone's in the one hotel across the bridge that's with men with rifles you're not going anywhere and so every day they go on their buses and I get in the car and the Australians recognize me the Brits recognize me and they all want photos and they're walking to the whatever that that room is the the room with the North and South meet where they come in through the northern door in the southern doors that Blue Room of the dsj I'll come up with the the joint the JSA the joint security area something like that I pulled one of the Australians to the side I said can you please call your friends off me because my tour Spy is starting to ask me weird questions about why people want their photo with me and if I'm caught being in movies writing books rock and roll I'm going downtown for a meeting that I might not get out of and so he cooled out all his Australian friends but then there's this one British guy who just kept getting in my face with the camera because you're all getting taken to the same places and I'll never forget this my tour guide who for the previous three days was like his English was from school like Henry he went from that to how does this guy know you and Olson his English was as good as mine I'm like oh no and I'm not good at lying so I said I met him in the breakfast room I don't know maybe he's hot for me I have no I just explained it away and I just had to kind of go I don't know and I had to try and avoid this guy and I I was getting a really nervous the last day I was there when they finally took me back to the airport in Beijing I'm like damn man am I really getting on this plane and when the plane took off man I just like okay I did that but why wouldn't you just say I'm a musician I'm gonna let you in for my I went on a tourist visa and if you claim any of that you're gonna get tons of scrutiny and they're not gonna let you in they won't let you in if you're an artist absolutely absolutely not because they're just they fear it they fear what you'll go back to the mainland with something you know so because you're a public person they don't but they let the basketball player what the fuck Robin yeah how cuz he told the party line and just told Obama you don't just call your pal Kim sure that'll work out great and same thing when I was in I was I went to Tehran via Dubai and the guy who met me at the airport after the airport people got done grilling me he said look I got your visa I know who you are I'm not your tour guide he's a government guy don't tell him what you do for a living we'll never get you out of here so the last days Christ yeah the last time in that country I'm eating dinner with this guy and his amazing wife they're both like rocket scientists and they you know they get by with a website that gets visas done so his cousin her cousin Anusha the woman her cousin calls her and says your friend Henry's on TV and Achmed dropped his fork and said we've got go we have to get you to your your hotel you got to pack up right now we just go to the airport check-in check your luggage find a corner put your face in it and wait for the flight and I got to the I got to the airport like four hours early because he said you just you got to go whoa and so I just sat there in the airport with my face down and then eventually got on like you know that the three a.m. to Dubai and I was out of there holy shit yeah what would happen if you got caught questions which leads to more questions and you just don't know it turns into like well he's been interrogated for the last three months and we don't know and since I'm not a hot-looking girl President Clinton's not coming to rescue me and and so those are the two countries I've been to where don't tell them what you do was what I was instructed before I left Wow yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
