the girag and experience do you think the people create that I mean that's like the big big hippie new-age argument about lives that you create these possibilities in life that you you're responsible for all these different events that are happening too they're not random events these are invent events that are sort of created by your own intentions yes do you feel that sometimes absolutely one thing I learned was that until you take responsibility you in a mofo hmm there's motherfuckers that get off the stage bro the audience sucks the sound yeah I was a guy eejit the iphone yet invented that was never quite fucking bomb yeah and that's it and everything else and until you come through that you can't really and that was big for me that I believe that yeah a listen I go to bed now I go home I put my feet up i watch the news and i go to bed like nothing you know 20 years ago i didn't go to bed late man i had to shut my window a certain way closed my door some way and i couldn't leave the light on at night because i owed money to a drug deal i rob somebody i created all those scenarios I didn't I didn't make that kidnapping up I went there with a gun I knew what I was doing but it's funny that how quick the turnaround was between like 99 you know like it's it all just sort of stopped it all star luggage and it kept stopping you know it kept stopping kept getting what you're telling me is that I never did blow get after 2006 that's you're trying to tell me who me that's what you're trying to tell me why I say that don't you say what do you think it's crazy that's a weirdest way to phrase that sentence that saying we haven't done bosses so once that was so one day I saw one day I went like arguing the chick so one day I went home and just stop doing blow that you try to tell mean everything together Wes I want exam I'm saying about being a crow no I'm busting your balls I can't believe what I'm fucking telling you that's night 2006 one day I went home Brian one day I went home and just stop doing cocaine no rehab no hug I didn't call nobody I didn't pierce my ear I didn't give my life to our game channel oba game there was nothing shit hope okay whatever the fuck that shit is he never get was nothing whatever the furrow began when I fucking shit so my point is that was I dropped I kept dropping the pain that I had and that luggage that I had I forced it out I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs I overcame whatever was making me do those for any drugs society wasn't making me do drugs Obamacare funny that they found heroin in the Bronx with Obamacare below Boston master Shinsei busted a hysteric it said Obamacare on it without heroin Obamacare like people would just think we got everything in a lot of ways you know this is random things happen is all raised eyebrow is sometimes people wake up on the wrong side of fucking bed they come at you and you understand your fucking ground and you gotta say no bitch and people get their feelings hurt yes but no I created a lot of shit that happened in my life there's no fucking way sink into what you are right now just be that thing stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect and that's a hard truth to grasp because you think right away you think yeah what about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer is he perfect well what about the leopard when you're seeing a leopard rip apart of a creature is that thing / is that a perfect moment I don't think the leopard fucks them and then kills them but you know what ducks do ducks or necrophiliacs are they fucking evil creatures yes well I think they are well made that Phil Robertson got a very famous person he invented a call for them grant ramp and now poor gay people have to hear that a man's anus is not as good as a woman's vagina he imagine if you may the choice for a man's anus and you hear this fucking big bearded fashionista with his camel on a bandana is an absolute fashion so weird I never thought of that big bearded Christian Bible sling and fashionista and he tells you that your choice was incorrect that in fact the woman's vagina is the better choice the man's anus I mean come on guys but how did you say that if you have an experience to maybe yeah I think he has again the balance theory I think he's so outspoken on that issue like most of these homophobes are because they're home jerking off to gay porn that you know otherwise you just don't give a shit it just doesn't actually matter right you know it doesn't come up in a GQ interview it's a Duffing right it's like da ready oh yeah you really care people are gay duh you really care the two guys love each other and that you are you against love you only like love if it's a man and a woman like it's a fuck man really yeah it's a dog thank God it's duh are you talking about men's anuses in GQ I'm gonna maybe you've got some issues to think don't shouldn't we just be talking about ducks ducks annesley isn't that your whole shows a bugs donis why you shoot ducks all the time right that's your thing talk about murdering ducks yeah why you got to talk about men's blood talking about a swing while adding this in the bud sac sucks penis cover and that is why that you know the duck dynasty guy or any of these weirdos who are who are just ultimately just angry people that's why they seem so fucking crazy or they play angry people on TV right cuz I think a lot of these people aren't even you know like that doesn't work with a duck dynasty guy the duck dynasty has been giving speeches like that for years at these biblical retreats and stuff he's been doing that for this video so that's his real stick he's not he's a fire and brimstone god-fearing Christian man who was living on the wrong side of the law and Jesus at one point time and then turned it all around wants to let everybody know about the evils of sin he's an old dummy that's what he is he's an old dummy that love is a scientific name for em hey he's an old dummy that probably just one time suck the dick and liked it way too much or someone sucked his dick and it's his favorite moment looks back as childhood and he's turned into you know career I bet he was honey that's when it happened I believe in that duck blind they're all liquored up my moonshine it wasn't hunting ducks at that right when he came into like some guy's mouth years ago out in the out in the bucket swamps he saw it with a call of the duck boy inside duh combined pleasure and shame mixed inside of me like I'm just gonna kill dust from now on and never think about this you ducks you didn't see shit go to manage your mother entity shit your father didn't see shit nobody son shit Jimmy could you could you could you if you manage if that's really what it was all it was just a duck song get his dick sucked by a guy and he's like fuck that didn't happen didn't happen hate to kill ducks I think that's something like that happen man it's something like that happen yeah no man you
