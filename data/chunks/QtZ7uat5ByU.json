all right I just have this dense thick heel skin that curls over on each side yeah like a human flip-flop you could hide a q-tip from where the ankles the calves go into the ankles you can just tuck one there and not even see it we were talking about that too that's the thing that you least have sympathy for someone who's overweight you know I thought the people of granular problems sure know but if you're just a fat fuck just glutton izing all day if you're a fucking fat chick sit again have you ever fucked a fat chick I'm gonna give you a second chance I'm sure have that blocked it out you know actually it's a little bit like hey it's more chick and it actually you know you get sweaty and greasy it's like you're fucking more woman in act I kind of enjoyed it was different do you feel more comfortable with your body - because you look listen bitch you know you're good you know I didn't think it was kind of like their skin and boobs everywhere and uncomfortable fuck any one of these folds in her stomach right it was just weird like I don't want to do it again but it was definitely interesting who was it the toast that only fucks with shirt on was it Ari Duncan I don't remember whatever I guess if you were if you were banging I don't think it's all right I think I think I'm incorrect if you're banging up it might have been louis c.k oh I can see that no well I think he actually has a bid on it actually I'm pretty sure that's it yeah I think Louie has a bid on it um you know if you're if you're fucking a fat check look you feel like loosen up you know if you're banging like something super hot alpha female with perfect shape like why'd she even lend me fucker this is ridiculous right like I'm not even worthy but if it's a faculty like bitch I mean culturally you know there's some there's some cultures that still there's a lot of dudes who like him fat so a friend likes thick girls and there was jokes throughout Sam Tripoli he jokes about he likes him thick yeah you like some thing goes I like a thick girl just like say it out loud like a big I like a big you know and he's hilarious about it that's what he likes man that's his type of woman always has been and he's not faking it that's what he likes nobody's got their own thing mm-hmm so that's a that's a fucking a weird thing like when someone's got a little will twist yeah a little twist and what they're attracted to is good with the fucking I like a long foot I don't want a big foot I don't want a wide foot but I like a girl with a long foot I have friends who will look at a girl's feet almost first Wow and they'll be like oh no no she's got like a size 10 you know and I'll just be out what so the building big feet bigger badder like weird toes I'm like that I'm with weak chins and weak eyebrows if a girl's a weak chin or a we got really small chins our disturbia disturbia I don't like it there's something something wrong with you genetically right like if you're really missing a check because you look like a frog or something it's odd it's an oddity like why is your lower jaw so small yeah do you not have to chew things are you more evolved than me are you in the next stage where we're gonna be eating liquid room can you blow that out and do a bubble and make a nice song from your is that evolution and they more evolved than us I don't know I browse Buchman and the chicks have like really like drawn on eyebrows or like just you know no eyebrow at all it's just that bugs you why did chicks trim their eyebrows we don't give a fuck they don't even know if a girl has big bushy eyebrows we don't give a fuck just make a little in the middle but you know what if a girl's really hot she's got a unibrow who gives a fuck I can tolerate you yeah you just pretend she's some crazy Israeli bitch that just got out of the secret service over there okay so we here spying on you but she falls in love when you're banging her you I don't think any brown would bother me at all man hairy legs are a trip without facial hair I dated a girl when I was really young who was she was going to an all-girls school she's going to an all-girls College and her and her friends wouldn't shave their legs yeah they were like super feminist hippie chicks and just did not work out the conversations that we had were it was like they they went to this completely all-girls school that was like super like you know super ultra liberal ultra socialist ideals and the view of the world was very strange and they wouldn't shave why should women have to shave a minute shave like how about we both shave it's the only way to get you shaves and I have the show I'll fucking shave I don't mind having shaved legs I think it's weird but I'll do it if you'll do it I can't fuck you Hobbit lady you got hair on your feet you know that's just a trip man girls don't be having hair on your feet please stop that but that's been I mean this females shaving has been going on for thousands of years right but what is the reason for that is there an evolutionary reason why are we so much more attracted to less hair and why is hair disgusting to us is it a hygiene thing for pussy right it must be a hygiene thing right like you got all that crazy hair I don't know you don't even know what the fuck is in there you don't know what's going on or visual creatures too so it's right but some guys like hairy pussies hairy pussies on the comeback these girls in there they're rocking it they got the bush but they cut it off right at the top I mean they don't go all the way through to the so they little top Bush but they don't let hair but whole bush go yeah so what do they do they wax around all that wax they're laser and just keep landing patch is that like a defiance thing like I'm getting ready to find my sexuality I think it's just that people get so accustomed to one thing that the new is hot probably it'll go in ten years Sasha Grey fascinates me and one of the reasons why she fascinates me is because she's like the the girl that like somehow or another is free of the porn and more into more like of mainstream people's you know people's thoughts you know I'm saying like she's not just thought it she's like she's like elevated she's like left that just a total porn world and she's permeated regular pop culture you know and it's strange when something like that happens like how does one do that you know there's always like there's people that are like super successful at something like Lance Armstrong boom there's there's the guy he's the guy rides the bike yeah you know and jenna jameson there's this super porn star you know she's the one and then it was a few that get through the traci lords that get through and then of other people know about him you know but sasha grey is one she's a unique one it's interesting because she's on the very hardcore side of the business yes he's no-holds-barred I mean she yeah whatever whatever she's down with and she but she kind of does it in a way where she's like I want to explore all the sides of sexuality including the dark side so she kind of has owned it from the beginning yeah I think that's that's made it better it you don't feel like Sasha you know like oh poor Sasha you're like Sasha you know is doing what she wants to do and she's doing it on camera so that I think has helped her out a lot and then you know she got a big break with that uh Steven Soderbergh film I think I didn't see that did you see that as a little tough to watch the whole thing but it's cool I would sighs yeah oh my god is the short movie you know like she reluctant to say it sucks she's an awesome actor but look what you had to work with well it was a cool feeling you know but you can't drag that on for an hour and a half what's the cool feeling what is the movie about it's kind of this very dark kind of artistic you know analysis of a call girl you know and how that interaction is but it could have been done with one scene like you get it you get this line you get the feeling you get how this interaction goes so in the girlfriend experience is she providing like an intimate call-girl experience but it's like having a girl friends over promise exactly I saw like two minutes of it was about right really I saw two minutes I saw was the last two yeah like talking this guy and hugging him and then they cut to black and yeah it's kind of a snippet a little bit too long that's a fucking strange thing man you ever have a buddy that's in love with the prostitute I've had guys fall in love with the stripper like the t-pain song I had a friend who was in love the prostitute he was the guy used to play pool with very nice guy but he was unfortunate looking and he did not do very well with the ladies and he would go to this massage get jerked off by this one prostitute and it was like one of those creepy massage parlors you know like it wasn't really a massage parlor like you know they like rub you back and then just go what's up pull your dick out let's do it and he wanted to ask her out to dinner outside and she wouldn't go out with them and he was trying to figure out like asking me what I should do what the magic words what should I do to get her to come out with me I really would like to see her outside of the club yeah I was like translate that there's so many things wrong with what you trying to do I mean yeah okay well how okay what happens then you become boyfriend and girlfriend and she agrees looks and no more in the mouth only hand jobs from now on like do you guys do you come to an agreement or just accept the fact that this is what she does at work that's work for her that's tough strange right it's strange that we're so it's so genetically attached we're so genetically attached to control in each other sexuality you know you could have a wife that was a massage therapist and she could be ice cubes great deep tissues you let her let her rub you Bob oh really your wife's gonna rub me just gonna rub me with oil all over my back and am I gonna groan while she's rubbing me I'm gonna go oh so good and you you're gonna be cool with that yeah it's okay because it's just rubbing your back but if she rubbed your dick and you make those same noises I mean basically she's doing the same thing she's just massaging you but it just feels way better but it feels too good too much too much yeah I'm gonna get psychologically attached to her rubbin on your dick yeah you can't do that we draw the line it's a funny it's a funny paradigm and it certainly always been one-sided I mean I wouldn't even want to check who does massages yeah I feel creeped yeah get a bunch of my buddies come over and massage I'm like what yeah did you imagine if you had a chick that was doing massages and you were really into her and then one of your buddies started getting massages from her okay bro what the fuck what are you doing and they have a nice there's like eight ladies I give massage thank you so much for the big tip oh please you're the best they're not the best you the best you kill me I can't wait for the next one when's our next one when's our next what we're doing this again yeah oh stop like hey what are you guys fucking like what's going on over here god damn it you're causing pleasure with your hands and the rubbing his ass cheeks what's up what's up that's do you have those those conversations like would you tell me if Mark got a hard-on while you were massage them what are you saying stop it yeah there's a real distinction for me I mean and there's some people who won't let their girls get a massage max I have yeah for sure you know I mean that's a they won't let him get a massage from another male masseuse you know I had some Taliban type shit but you know and then it just is a whole variety of different you know different levels of what people are comfortable with you know that's like I see that no dudes fucking seen you naked and rubbing your way right but yeah it's gonna look at your pussy yeah for sure for sure I mean it's it's an interesting paradigm I mean for me I think I wouldn't we have a you know me and my girl have a very like very open honest you know relationship and she cue the music yeah should we respect each other's ability to just you know want to go out and experience things but this signal yeah Chris Marcus's pan-pan is brought to you by the fleshlight please continue there's there's a real hard line between like yeah like I could you know I'm totally cool with her getting massaged and even in like some perfect circumstance where there was some eunuch you know who needed to manually get her off at some point I think I would be cool with that but if you don't well you know whatever they don't they don't exist him you'll be cool with but did you the castrati spoke just they said chop their balls off I think it's in some situation where I was very mechanical she goes in for a service he mechanically get right but at the point where it's like he's lusting and she's busting there that's women that's when the board that's where the fucking hard line is you know I'm and no lust just physical yeah no love physical it's it for me well I can make the connection it's the same as rubbing the back right or doing something like that it's the same as you go into the jerk-off salon right let's go there just some girl just rubbed your balls hot oil and jerk show off and that says nothing I think going on it's gotta feel really mechanical ah thank you that was great that was awesome I got rid of that not like you go out and talk about your childhood and I don't even know my dad oh my god I don't know my dad either right they've seen that your hands laying in the field looking up with the Stars fuck all that man that's just bullshit the real question is gonna be what happens when we create artificial people and fuck them and are people even gonna bother with relationships that's the real question you are on the brink of this with this fleshlight thing because now you guys are the first people that have created an effective artificial vagina right all those other ones are bullshit all those blowup dolls those are for bachelor party gag gift bags all right those are silly nobody really fucks blow-up dolls if you do it's not good you're better off jerking off you might fuck one once yeah but cannot good yeah you guys have engineered a true artificial vagina yeah but this is just step one remember when TVs well you go over your grandfather's house and the TV was this big giant ass fucking cabinet and the TV itself was only like 11 inches across and you need this fucking monstrous piece of furniture with big tubes shit the bag of wires and remember would sometimes Sparks would come out the back and you'd have to open up that there was like a particle board back to it you'd unscrew it and pull it back and look inside the bowels of this fucking beast now look at it you can watch your little iPhone slips in your pocket man and it's way higher resolution so much better much better experience watching a movie on your iPhone than it is one of those stupid TVs or an iPad Jesus Christ yeah the iPad of the fake pussies coming hopefully uh hopefully flashlights will be the ones to do you think saw you guys working with genetic engineers are you on the cusp of nanotechnology well you know I mean all of them that's kind of the Golden Goose like the more realistic you can get it interactive you know like fully if people have tried to do it but no one's done it well yet so obviously we're looking into it I mean things have to evolve I mean the fleshly I'm looking into robotics yeah well too if you have one one eye on robotics like hmm just sort of just leave it yeah I mean I don't want to get too much into it but we've certainly explored all those different things even making it so that they could register your performance so you could almost you know login and slash your performances completely outside like in courts live scores like high score you are devaluing the personal experience ooh you're taking it too far man mm strokes shouldn't be like three this is a you're not fucking a person who you're trying to make feel good you're trying to shoot a load if I do this 10 times I'm like why is it taking so long you know you should have you should have like fleshlight pants for gay guys that like the there's like the thing like the the end of the fleshlight so it goes on their assholes when other guys fuck the other guy it feels better you know like it like it feels like a pussy adaptor for another guy's asshole how do you know that they don't like the feeling of guys assholes I don't know I'm just saying mix it up a little bit they only have one tight listen dude is fucking you in the buddies fucking you in the butt all right this is yeah you can't have a filter for that that actually happened except the guy just put the fleshlight straight in his butt I didn't see that but our flesh jack team informed me okay there was a video was this so there's a video the video guy stuff the flesh lineup is but another guy fuck the flesh side was that make would that make you gay about that if you do fish in the butt it's gay listen if you yeah but I'm saying if a guy fucks you your fleshlight okay see if you stuff a flush shut up your ass right that's gay right if the guy fucks your fleshlight it's not touching is he get what you're saying he's just fucking a rubber vagina it's Gator if you're somehow touching a guy getting off okay what if you don't touch them what if you just assume like a high-mileage that guy he's a gradual ex part keeps legs closed no for you gay was it queer is that queer you know one of our most popular selling units it's called the stamina training unit though I have one really explain this well the concept is basically that you know your hand doesn't feel anything like pussy so it doesn't prepare you to have sex you know so there's a lot of anxiety performance anxiety people who don't last long right want to last longer so you know we've been able to give them a product that's very like highly sensitive inner Canal so they can use it and get a little bit more prepared and sensitize and people love it like we get feedback like man thank you so much you know like I've always had problems with this but now I've gotten a lot better yeah the first time you're all stick your dick inside a vagina oh yeah I know the first time I had sex I came in one second I came in one second I stuck it huh I pulled it out and there was loads everywhere oh my god I barely made yeah you barely made have no idea what that's gonna feel like the first time I blew a load I was in shock I didn't even know that you know you I wasn't nobody told me shit all right no my parents didn't tell me anything and when I was a kid I was like 14 or 15 15 my girlfriend blew me and I busted one in her mouth and my ears rang and I was like what the hell was that like I couldn't believe that like stuff comes out of you like you could feel it coming out of you like whoa oh that's what I've been building up to yeah I didn't know that there was even an orgasm thing I recall it being like a 30 second orgasm no the fell yeah crowd Abbas did a ridiculous amount my fucking ears rang the first time I came my ears rang they haven't ranks since Wow cuz I never give myself a day off okay I'm giving like one day off since no I did one time for my website no I was like 30 days or something like that I tried to do but yeah you you you know you never recapture it's like they say with heroin addicts the first time they shoot heroin it's just insanely beautiful experience and from then on you're chasing the dragon yeah you know that expression yeah what is that the first load you blow it's like as good as it gets kids love it enjoy it but the experience is so rough that it's terribly I mean you're just nervous I remember man I remember the first time I'm trying to figure out how to use this condom and I'm going into the bathroom and I'm just like it's not working right and she's in the bed and she's ready and I was like literally like face was hot and I just came out and just gave up I was like I'm sorry we gotta come up with a different paradigm to make this happen like you know and eventually you figure it out and work but that first time it's fucking brutal top top what do you think about these fighters that hold off for that's ridiculous they're crazy they're distracting the shit of them yeah that seems like a really bad that's so silly I don't there's no no writing no no tests no studies done ever that show a decrease in performance due to the fact that you're having sex I think the distraction that you would get from not having sex would be way more problematic yeah and that would fuck you up more would fuck up your train of thought you wouldn't want to fight you want to get some pussy gotten laid in eight weeks when going through training camp that's crazy but it I mean it Steve they seem to say that it builds aggression you know they just want to conquer I'm sure it does but you know just read each aggression do you need chances are you aggressive yeah you know need to be more fucked up are there better ground game no because they always want to get on the ground I'll tell you who used to fight and used to fuck right before you find Tyson that should be the end discussion yeah I didn't I didn't understand from sexual intercourse it's a natural feel for me I just have to make sure make sure I was relaxed before my big fight those old Tyson training videos are beautiful the best was his early fights man like more nervous Frazier you ever watch the Maher was Frazier fight that was a salt he just ran up to that regular dude and beat the fuck I think it was a super alpha body yeah that shit didn't even make any sense he came out of nowhere and got everybody excited about fighting again for the longest time after Muhammad Ali nobody gave a fuck about boxing it's like the Larry Holmes era everybody's like what Larry Holmes was fighting Pinklon Thomas I don't even know if they ever fought but you know my point is like you know easy shit Oh Tony Tubbs who gives a shit yeah Michael Doakes whatever you know that all sudden this crazy motherfucker moving a hundred times faster than everybody else and just smashing people in the face at will that's what we wanted to see we didn't want to see that let's fight through our levels fights want to see assaults two minutes your it was worth it not really no people get pissed off I'm soft you have a bunch of friends over for pay-per-view cuz nobody gives a fuck about the prelims in boxing that's one of the beautiful things about the UFC yeah you get a UFC card you're not just getting the main event you're getting a fuckload of other fights and they're all well matched and they're all people you give a shit about or all they're all exciting fronts especially the ones that actually make the air so there's a bunch of shit to watch so if the Len fight is only like 15 seconds you know like Anderson Silva and and you know James Irvin or something like BAM it's over you don't feel ripped off I feel like well we saw a lot of shit before we saw you know those Tyson fights man you'd have friends Sammy I even buy it the last one was 34 could circuits the one I miss was the one where he lost because I was like dad who fucking he's gonna be the share this guy like Buster Douglas was like sixty to one underdog or something crazy crazy what was done he was something nutty right wasn't like 31 or something yeah he got then I remember I watched it I watch the tape and I was convinced while I was watching the tape that he was gonna win I'll be like Tyson's gonna win this I was like I know he's know what I know he got knocked out but I was watching a fucking replay of it and I was like to win this big fucking joke man you can't be losing twice it doesn't it's important that when you're a kid to realize that there are human beings that everyone is just a human being because there's a few people that just pass that human beings mark in your brain you know like Mike Tyson or meeting somebody meeting some famous dude I met Ace Frehley when I was a little kid and all the sudden II was just as dude you know Ace Frehley was the lead guitarist of kiss for people don't know and my uncle used to work in an advertising agency and we're in his office I'm hanging out my and all sudden this dude walks in and it's ace frehley and I was a huge kiss fan I didn't even have his makeup on this is back when kiss wore makeup look you know who they are that's ace frehley I was like what the fuck today I couldn't believe that dude was right there and as you get older you go oh that's just another dude yeah same with like Kenny Loggins what's up bro there's people like Kenny Loggins that people think that way about I met Kenny Loggins dude you're pretty cool he's the one who plays the flute right was it that's AG Oh not kidding log with Kenny G yeah Kenny G I didn't meet Footloose I met the flute dude does he play the flute what is Kenny Loggins or clarinet or some gear Izzy though and they do to ever get that famous from playing that instrument right he must be a bad motherfucker Kenny G's like the Lance Armstrong of the flute or whatever the fuck you call a Pied Piper was pretty popular what does Kenny G play saxophone super white guy saxophone the horrible chorus super white super white got clarinet it was Kenny G was giant for a wild man and giant with anger people get angry at Kenny G music you know like dudes like comics always use Kenny G was an awesome punchline if you want to shit on somebody you know yeah why is it was the amount I think it's the emasculation than he represented he represents dudes married women they don't want to be married to out on dates having to go to a Kenny fucking G concert I'm just sitting there in shit in a world of shit and you can be with your friends at the bar drinking and throwing darts talking shit watching sports and having fun no no no no no no no you're at a Kenny G concert stupid and you have a jacket on she likes the way you look with jackets I like a sport jacket and you got your fucking sport that that's what raised the ire yeah you're eating shit that's it that's the end of the show actually the romantic ending it with Kenny G before we go I brought a gift for uh what are you go Brian here so you know people people kind of overlook a lot of very legal and very cool substances that are available and so I brought you guys some Blue Lotus oil now as you know Lotus lotus oil was historically prize from the land of the Lotus Eaters kind of gives you this euphoric poppy feeling and it's just a lot of Hindu or weird lotus flower so it's uh it's actually you know quite they takes like a ton of Lotus oil to make this one little vial here and this might be it might be loud as I then do it so well what is it so it's a little vial here let me open this up here do they extract like out of thousands and thousands a ton it's an actual ton of petals to make mm petals mm yeah to make that little vial that seemed to make a little VAT and then they think like a little bat so then they make this vow which is to only dropped it yeah so large is two thousand petals it must be an event well two thousand pounds yeah I mean I mean 1,000 pound believe petals so it makes it makes my gorgeous like an ounce of the oil what does it look like in a room like there's so light mm fucking time so it's very prized all right I actually review it on my blog warrior-poet us and you can cheat us and I took it yeah you have about a half of a mile it kind of comes out tough so I give it a stiff shake is that what you you this was full and you know no this is brand-new this is brand-new is brand-new so this is how it comes it comes out for I took maybe maybe about half of that I maybe took about half of that and you feel cut you feel very euphoric and you know you you're everything all your sensations feel good and it's not overpowering you know it's not something that like takes you and hit you with a hammer but when you say I love you to your girlfriend you really mean it you know like listen everything all the time Joe like you really mean it but it's like you really feel it you know what I'm saying like you feel the emotion I really feel it all the time dude but it's not like you men are probably women some crazy dreams I dreamed I was like uh like I've never dreamed a dream that I was a vampire playing basketball just throwing shots back like I steamed out from underneath the basket and just reject some dude and Shaq dunk on you were very relaxing you for it like very kind of authority I feel like you could still function totally like totally it's very lucid and stuff do you feel intoxicated or not really you just feel like in a bad ass mood and it's almost like the stuff that troubles you they go away what about you are you comfortable that your reaction time would be this I am yeah yeah it doesn't have that kind of artificial feeling that some of the other opiates and sedatives and stuff kind of do find out if you're allergic Aloha do you like Kenny G and on that note that's a pretty way to end this thank you very much Chris that was a lot of fun coming out thanks for answering the podcast flashlight go-to
