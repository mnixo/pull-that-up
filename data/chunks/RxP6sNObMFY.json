the Joe Rogan experience it I mean obviously it seemed way worse over on your side but I was more worried when they made us leave because the further up you got in the bleachers and once you got out into the concession area and in the bathrooms that's where stuff was going down like just people from the crowd you know guys with Irish flags all obviously we're getting trash talk to them and there was a big brawl right yeah right next to me on the other side from where they were sitting oh that's right there was one just to our right I was looking left to leave it was the guy that jumped in and the register on Cubs team when they were trying to leave when they're getting them out hmm people in crowd were like ah they start throwing shit at them first that's how the that's where the first shit was getting thrown down and some of the people know that it was them we all saw it was like that's the guy that's the guy right there right now I'm like I don't know and he went and tried to do something you know there's a price to be paid for all this shit like all the all the drama and the trash-talking that makes it so fun it also you know it has the potential for blowing up in your face ultimately like a couple people got punched but it was in an event where a bunch of people got punched you know I mean it's like way more than that it was awesome yeah but you don't I'm saying it's like we made it see it seemed like it was way worse than it really was because in any other situation it would be way worse than it really was like if it was a rock concert and some dudes just from you know like you know if one band was the opening band and then there was another band that was in a brawl with them and they were they were the main event and then the fans of one band threw down with the fans the other band beat the shit out of each other that would for whatever reason be way worse than when it's at a fight because if it's out of fight it's just fighters oh I saw this insane clown this was going on this insane clown posse guy tried to dropkick Fred Durst he printer's wasn't even looking at him running head start and misses look at her he turns her eyes like what and he just kept going I haven't seen for a Cruz off I mean that is maybe the worst public dropkick in the history of the world I think they meant he dropped when he tried to kick even after that and you know we were working very hard for this fight and a limit you know somewhat limited a period of time so we did didn't taper off quite the way we would normally do but roughly two weeks if you want to do a rematch and the UFC did grant agreement this is obviously dependent upon how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handles the legal ramifications of him jumping out the cage attacking Dylan Danis a subsequent brawl the chaos that ensued visas I mean you're dealing with a lot of legal shit yeah this fight that that could hold things up I mean they held both guys purses correct well he held hippy was kind of got his yeah okay Connor goes first and could be between who the fuck knows what's gonna happen with him you know and yeah I hope they're they're lenient on them and I'm not just so we can get a rematch I mean I love watching a fight first night and and I can I can stretch myself to understand his reaction yeah I can stretch myself I can't stretch myself to understand the order guys reactions and what on what they did yes I believe he jumped over the cage and he jumps I it's it's not the end of the who was the guy that jumped in there was wearing red who punched Connor yeah I'm not sure I think that's his boxing coach but I'm guessing he's a fighter he fights for the UFC in the red [Music] okay there you go I don't think it was either well like I know is a different guy he was you know he hit yeah yeah and a guy in a suit that I heard his Russian manager and yet Dylan either way um actually in the cage when your mind went in and hit him from behind yeah you know I can't I can't understand that like I said for her babe I didn't think it was you know it was it's just it's almost it's such a foolish thing to do because I think today they already won yeah I know that Dylan was talking shit he was angry but like she didn't say anything because I heard a few people saying that now I was standing beside Dylan I didn't see what he did but I could hear so he didn't say anything no and I watched back I see any kind of beckon the mom yeah you know just stupid and the fight stuff put it I didn't think it justified that level response and maybe there was something else in the lead-up you know Dylan is a bit of a troll online so there's probably a bit of a buildup of voter stuff but um yeah like I said it wasn't that big a deal to me what happy did yeah just really wasn't there's something I like love about a man so deeply out of touch I mean that's the thing is like you know fucking thumbs fucking up me and my wife's dressed as Sarah Palin I love this fucking city by the the sexual chemistry between them is palpable probably real super you were time out at the beginning of like like cults and I'm like I'm thinking about I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Tom Cruise and Scientology there's a man using every ounce of what Scientology's offering to make himself the best available man that he's capable of being yeah then you've got Travolta you've got two versions of like like a man who's becoming slightly out of touch with what he you know no look at my fucking wig it's a good way how amazing our wigs eased a he's got great wigs I mean that's a fucking incredible wig like thinning just a little bit up front you would think that's his hair he's living the dream it's incredible he's living the goddamn dream are you okay with time we could wrap this up whatever yeah I'm 33 third yeah where was that oh yeah that was I saw him amazing that little that little chin is that his he wore a little chin thing yeah like a little chin yarmulke there it's unbelievable I remember seeing him in an award ceremony that and then that when he had that little chin thing did he put that on after the thing I met him when his wife was on fear factor really yeah Kelly Preston was on fear she was on fear factor hmm yeah celebrity fear factor David Hasselhoff Kelly Preston how were they she was really nice yeah super friendly yeah but but I felt like I felt like they recruited people yes for Scientology was sort of stigmatized mm-hmm it was there was a lot of people that were joining it what is going on there though she has a black yeah I love it that here's so crazy fake looking that's like that magnetic man that you could like move the magnets around the create hair that's crazy man that's I mean that the color everything is wrong that's madness like when someone says Stephen Hawking's identified as a British he's identifies a dead guys now when he was alive yeah brilliant British physicist slash heterosexual atheist a heterosexual atheist and who by the way was riddled reek riddled with infidelity I've never met a guy so not capable of cheating and found a way to cheat on his wife well apparently he could still get it up oh well apparently even though his body didn't move his cock could feel things that was his sight the scientists he used to go to was Eric Weinstein told me about this I was like what he's like Kerry's a freak and I was like wait what he's like yeah he used to go to strip clubs and there's like videos of him like rolling into his trip covered in the wheelchair like he would god that was his thing do you where'd you get littered with infidelity where'd you hear that yeah he cheated on his wife all the time in that fucking movie the whole reason that he well I mean the whole reason that he left his wife was because he fell in love with somebody else but wasn't it like a nurse there was - yeah but the truth was that he was this morning if you google uh if you google Stephen Hawking he was affiliative that he was always fucking around you know come on man he was always fucking around yeah that's once he got takes to the good life yeah once he had that cosmology cache yeah you know what also the sound like am I not gonna play by the rules the world dealt me the shittiest goddamn I'm a super genius pleased and you know what I fucking agree do whatever the fuck you want to do now you want to leave me listen you should leave me yeah why would you only fuck me yeah I'm I'm barely here oh yeah I'm a machine now I used this finger to talk know if some part it was his eyes in his fucking and his mouth at Subway could he use his hands it was nice right yeah wasn't it a kind of thing where he could kind of click he would do he would he would look at something too he had a thing where he would look at shit and it was meant to see your asshole can you sit on my face face face don't kill me though now figure out the universe don't smother me with your pussy I need to figure out how stars work our black holes real or is it just a brown star please I don't want to drown in your pussy I'm still on the subject of dark matter I'm trying to figure out the universe before I not in my pants that's what that's one of the strippers that he hooked up with was called dark matter I'm trying to figure out dark matter dark matter I could see her with big ol fur coat hell yes a big old fur bush with a with a pencil because but that was one that got brought up as well that was also a huge conversation about you know Benghazi and the Iran deal those are the two things are two of the three things that I like to do on Twitter although I'm no longer on there you got off yeah bad for you yeah I was glad to see Kanye West got off to doing yeah what deleted all his accounts last week and I was glad to cuz you're just like once you're a target it's just too painful yeah well definitely shouldn't be reading that shit no I don't read it yeah but well when you become a target how do you know if you don't read it well I'd know what I'd lived through when first happened and that's been like four or so months ago so I just know how I've reacted in my love real life since that happened to me how long since died off to die off slow down where they weren't just coming after you constantly like I told you that news crews when they found out that you were gonna come on the podcast the first time they were trying to show up at my house they were trying to show up at the studio they were trying to find me at The Comedy Store yeah I mean
