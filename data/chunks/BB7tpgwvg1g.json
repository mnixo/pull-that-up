you let me know oh cool and so yes sir okay yeah all right and then we leave it there they get you beat you nervous yeah like you say no boom and we're live UFC motherfucker by the way champion TJ Dillashaw Duane Ludwig Master Splinter what's up buddy good to see you man I see golf shirts now - looking respectable motherfucker of 40 now my game yeah people walk to my dojo he's got to look dressed to the nines you know looking like it's a job but there's a warning sign on the walls as explicit language oh so you you let people know people just are swearing up in this bitch yes sir line up motherfuckers you say that when you teach classes do so actually I'm passionate yeah no you are yeah oh you can fire it up yes that's why I don't teach the kids we have a separate room for the kids classes yeah that's so you have a children's program yes sir yeah nice dude I'd love the fact that you take regular classes and I watch you on the Instagram yeah ban way champ in the world oh yeah regular regular classes regular people see them in there with you like holy shit yes go man drills I love it I love I mean obviously none of his classes are regular though you know even if you're an average Joe coming off the street like Duane's teaching you the same shit that I'm doing right you know but yeah working out with a guy that's never had a real fight before you know I mean he'll always remember that you know guys get the work out of me so it's it's uh it's cool man I like doing it especially at Duane's Jam - it kind of shows like the true love that I have for the system and being in there yeah I mean what kind of fucking sport other than MMA is that even possible good point Yeah right it's controlled yeah - you could do that but the people - most people don't know who the jujitsu guys are I mean you're fighting on fucking television oh yeah and it's almost it's almost too easy to have that happen in this point yeah it's more like you there's people you shouldn't be sparring with it it happens you know that's why a controlled environment is awesome that's why I like that I feel like the small kind of training camps and teams have been so beneficial because you know exactly who you're working out with and who you're getting better with but there are times to work out with the average guys you know not when I'm getting ready for a fight or don't want to get hurt you know kind of thing and then this is a very controlled system and we're doing Dutch drills that uh it's it's not gonna go crazy you know there's so many different approaches to training fighters yes sir and you obviously have hit would you guys have like the best fighter trainer relationship that I know about because you guys are so tight it's like you guys are really a team whereas there's always some weird animosity with fighters and trainers and the blow ups are just like men and women like when when men and women break up and you fucking bitch that happens that makes me so sad when I see like fighter trainer blow outs when they separate and talk shit about each other like god that's so that's such a bummer I think it's both of them too big of an ego who wants to be like the coach maybe coaching the fighter wants to be more popular or whatever it may be you know and it just uh I don't know whenever whenever I came into the gym and as soon as he was there from the first practice I knew we were gonna get along he's a crazy motherfucker he likes to go hard competitive and I was kind of like everything I do you know but you're also you have a very very well thought out system yes sir like I've been I was very impressed with like just your documentation of your system how you have all these different things worked out like these aren't like just happen there's obviously creating creativity involved when an actual fight is happening but your system is so well thought out and and so comprehensive I feel that's that's what I'm supposed to be doing is organizing the chaos of a fight so that the regular person can understand what's happening when I was fighting and training fighting was scary and I was very scared of it so I want to make sure I understood what was going on so I just started mapping it out and a lot of that came from Cynthia Rudin because he had the number system of you know three was jab cross hook rather than three just being the left hook so he sparked the initial interest to just start categorizing everything put things into a system and it helped out and never you know he did about it non-stop he doesn't sleep how good text message in the middle of the night when we come up to a fight and like it'd be like 12:00 1:00 o'clock and even if he's in Colorado it's 2 o'clock for him and getting a random text message or what I should be doing for this fight or what he's watching sparring tape so what I was doing when he changed his knee changed that I mean this guy cares about my career just as much as I do and that's why it works you know true I want him I want him so his system changes coming it's a great thought-out system but like I've never had the same train camp and I don't ever have the same colony we have like your system base is the same but it always veers off like I don't even know what the TJ combo is anyway I think it's changed changed about eight times as I can add on or change well I remember the first time you fought hand in brow when you won the title and Dwayne and I had lunch together and there was a bunch of people at the table but Dwayne didn't even know they were alive telling me exactly what was gonna go down and he was just talking about all the things a bit and his hands are moving and shoulders are twitching trying to because I'm moving around back and forth and he was going a hundred miles an hour with his voice I was like wow dude you're geared up because he's gonna fuck him up he's gonna fuck I mean if you see the emotion that he shows inside gun a few nights you know so that's how much she cares going into that's how nervous he is you know and like I said if you have a coach that cares that much about you and your career then you don't let it go yeah when you were when you were in Sacramento and then you move to Colorado you have basically kind of had to start from scratch you a lot of people obviously know you are you're well sought out trainer but you were opening up your own place from scratch and now that place is fucking mobbed in your landing yeah yes sir yeah it's a we're expanding and just continuing to grow and have a good positive outlet for people to explore their soul right that's why I'm here is to teach martial arts so it's I'm glad everyone else's is realizing that as well and I can cross paths with the ninjas like TJ Dillashaw and help them become better martial artists and it's just a good I'm you know 100 percent living living vicariously through T Jane all my athletes and everybody under the BMT umbrella and it's a good way to give back and basically relive another career for the most part right so hmm and that's what we should be doing anyways pain that positive list is forward and on to the next generation and that's uh that's the definition of sensei actually meaning history teacher teacher you know from those who have come before you so and to have somebody like TJ is dedicated as he is it's it's a true blessing and that's why I'm all in he's all in I'm all in let's go yeah well it's just rare that you find all in coach and all in fighter and they get together and you guys have such unique working I'm why more than all in same with you addicted you know like like if I'm not completely like full-blown into it I mentally am fucked when I get home you know now coming off of this second victory over Cody and then being able to stop them even quicker this time and in just all the crazy shit talking that led up to that fight and the results of the first fight I mean that's got to be very satisfying to you that everything is going according to plan absolutely man it is especially was the whole build-up you know it was like two years of just bullshit nothing to deal with that man that's not the kind of person I am you know I'd really be in the mountains you'd not be able to get a hold of me hunting or just camping like if I if I could disappear I take the advantage to do it you know so that crazy attention and just like the shit talk and the TV show them accusing me of everything like you know that took a lot you know and so for all that to be like taking off my shoulders feels great for you though there's God that's got to be a real feeling of like retribution too like no matter what they said yeah you you had the right idea they might not have been happy that you decided to do it for yourself and the right move for yourself was to go and go to Colorado and be with Dwayne but obviously you were right yeah 100% I was right I mean that's why I made the decision I'm definitely you know you gotta be selfish in this this sport you got to do what's best for yourself in some ways without fucking people over you have to be self of course I mean we have to know what's best for you and so the ultimate decision for me was when I got an ultimatum you know like your I I knew how much I liked training with Dwayne he knew how great it was for my mentality and we justified right away you know and they didn't it and so when he gave me the ultimatum like look man you're either doing your camp of Dwayne you're doing with us I was like well then you don't have my best interest at heart I'm out of here you know like I sold my house but moving out to Colorado like I dropped everything and went you that was tough it was a tough situation to go through and yeah I made the right choice well your your decision the way you approached it was very similar to what you were doing to because when I talk to you you like I'm gonna open up my own gym in Colorado and I remember thinking whenever it someone thinks they're gonna start from scratch with a new gym by themselves my rule I mean I wish you well but damn that's a lot of work you know as well as anybody yes sir I've known since I was a kid I was gonna be a world champion and have my own Academy in Colorado check check Wow starting a gym is tough man we're doing it now while we've been going through it for the last year year and a half down here in Southern California yeah and the new place is called the training lab the training lab it's bill 23 I end with rain yeah because mark muñoz had rain mm-hmm down in Lake Forest and Sam calivita the guy that I moved down for for her strength conditioning just his crazy mind he's beyond smart like heal everything he talks about like I have to be at his house for hours pretty much doing a podcast with him to figure out what he's talking about and usually always goes over your head you know I've gone like I said I'm always full-blown I made a hundred percent and so as soon as he started to show me the science behind what my body needs to do if it were for my diet my recovery the days I'm working out my the way I'm doing my string conditioning what if I'm gonna go bigger or how far I am from camp like everything has a rhyme and reason like every calorie ie every macronutrient I eat he's got it down written down he's like this guy stays up late and works and he doesn't do it for the money or the pride like he doesn't want anything like we do it out of his garage you know it's like old Rocky style training with Drago science I saw that on the UFC countdown video yeah man we're out in the park you know we're doing crazy like yesterday I was out in the park with him doing a bunch of crazy stuff and a lot of reaction time stuff and just the way he trains is very very scientific and I've seen the gains insanely you know for as old as I am I'm the strongest and fastest I've ever been well you know 32 I've been trained since I was eight you know I never gotten to die I'd never gotten any of this until I started picking Sam's brain and I think the real so I mean everything's it's not bro science either we're not like oh I think I feel better right I'm testing myself you know I hid my hormones I wasn't able to get my wife pregnant for three years and it happened in three months after meeting Sam like I went full-blown I went so full-blown that I created my own like spice company around his diet you know like I know what's what what does he got you doing differently what how are you eating before and what were you doing before for strength and conditioning before you met him so was I didn't care about what I was I don't cut much weight you know third prize isn't very big for me so I walk around I'm like right now probably called 150 this morning that's a little bit lighter than normal I'd have him a new mic I have two I bulk up to go 35 I put on another like good 5 pounds of muscle before I start to even worry about my weight at 35 but I was just eating whatever you know and I used to make fun of Danny for being gluten free if I give me more gluten I don't care I'll you whatever I want I'm the best you know I'll just train hard train harder than everyone but not only my age but just learning the science behind it now I'm not eating grains you know no sugars unless it's as simple as like from fruits and stuff like that yeah man I mean it's it's a special diet I'd say like the clock you like almost go like paleo keto kinda but obviously our bodies can't do that because I need the simple carbs in your carbs around yeah but I don't want to give away all the secrets but yeah man he's changed up a lot with me you don't want to give away all the secrets but when it comes to nutrition like what is it what is different like what kind of proteins you have you eating what portions of protein how much of it is fat what are you getting your fat from avocado coconut oil what do you get it from oh yeah a lot a lot of not a nuts lot of coconut oils they even pre make my meals so I don't really I don't even think about what meals I'm eating so Jesus Christ he does all three my meals into my snacks every day I need you live in that area when you're in training camp yes yeah so I just bought a house in Yorba Linda area yeah I love it it's amazing it's a real good family area good school district so that's how you know your life has changed when you look at houses for school districts lucky change of the whole shifting of your world it's everything yeah I mean it's everything that's all you think about you know takes a while to be realized you're a different person oh I'm a different person I used to it I remember you made a comment before saying that those a an old banana or fresh bananas there's a bit for my act I thought it was I doesn't realize how there was two bananas and one of them was like yellow and perfect and the other one was brown and fucked up but my daughter loves bananas so I took that Brown fucked up banana ate it because I realized that I was I was putting her above me and that does I'd never thought about that before and then I said because I love my wife she's an awesome person but if it's just me and her that bitch is getting a shitty banana frickin Subaru car because it's got five-star crash rating and goodness yeah so yeah think of the kids first they've owned Denver time to say own Colorado just get a Tesla I'll support in the podcast well kinda like I just I guess drop 50 grand you know you you go on the website you punch in the information you put in $1,000 deposit and then you gotta wait for a while for it to be built right it's not like I dropped 50 grand and I'm gonna lease it through the business anyway but yeah I haven't wanted to go in for a while it's funny man how Subarus like they've proven themselves in Colorado Jaffer reliably awesome yep they're you know turn to hold one still floating around they were literally if you go through Boulder it's like 50% subaru's I would say that yeah they just they just said let's just cut the shit yeah this one is the best and snow yeah let's stop fucking around they never break fucking Japanese cars man they never I've had three Lexuses never had a single problem with any of them that's good for like 15 20 years of Alexis's they never fuck up perfect they just start mmm every time no fuck-ups 300,000 miles on it it's still gonna run yeah other cars you get in the windows roll halfway down what the fuck's going on ding ding ding lights go off the dashboard what is this black tape over it you anymore yeah oh yeah well you know if I don't know it's gotta be difficult to build cars speaking of cars does everybody know you have that fucking thing outside you've talked about oh yeah I'm gonna talk about it yeah you got one of my favorite cars ever yeah I know NSX it's amazing car things a spaceship spaceship it's a real fun car doesn't it what are we talking about it has four engines three of them are electric I mean it is a crazy got that tweeter maybe six I mean it's only got high five hundreds in horsepower there it is look at that fuck yeah but it only got high five hundred but the tour Kona is insane because it's a it's a two electric motors so I have to start it so fast zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds J that's it's faster so good-looking too yeah I love the way they look they look like a car that's supposed to be built in 2018 yeah I mean it's like that shit's from the future it took him a long time to create that car man they stopped making the the second generation and sex like what 2005 I had one oh did you yeah yeah yeah I had one in the early 90s and then I had one in 2003 okay yeah well would you like the early nineties no I like the headlights better than the newer one okay but they're all awesome yeah they're just it's not a fast car like if you buy I think it at 270 horsepower okay but it's all aluminum its mid-engine it sounds amazing when it gets high like hot in the high revs but it doesn't sound like it's it's not like a like an old Mustang it's like full like metals at travela Street it's like a sophisticated sound yeah but a cool sound the VTEC engine that was my one problem with the new NSX was that how quiet it was because it's a hybrid so I'm like the like I said it's a one of three cars in the United States right now that have a custom exhaust for it and make it sound a lot better this guy on Chicago Abbey Road I think it is has designed a an exhaust for it you know that car is also even though it's an accurate their car is made in design the United States yeah a factories in Ohio right yeah yeah it's a total American car it's under the Acura it means like what is American anymore yeah I don't even understand the order stuff is always from China or Pakistan or something so but it's also like the parks like or all the parts made here everything you know like assembled that's an issue with harley-davidson right Trump wants us to ban Harley Davidsons now I didn't boycott boycott Harley Davidsons really yeah because Harley Davidson is gonna shift their factories to somewhere to make some part of it or maybe I'll maybe talk about the Elon Musk and saving the world I don't know I don't I don't think anybody could do Trump's job I don't think anybody I think it's stupid there's no way to ask one person have that much responsibility yes yeah that's that person then these big 10 15 people to handle that job maybe 30 there's no way I'd ever want the pressure that fuck that job fuck that what how much he's actually doing though I don't want it how much pussy's good I really want to know stop getting pussy he's like Trump you know on the roll it's gotta be I mean whether him Melania still hook up she seems upset with him it's interesting as a drama has watch it all go down like coz is the investigation closing in on him are they gonna put him in jail or is he gonna be like fuck you I'm getting my suppression well if he doesn't he's trying to find out if he can get one oh and a gold one that says truffle on musk again yeah Elan quick bailed on them when they got out of the Paris Accord you know the climate Accord yeah I don't know enough about this I don't know how you hold on to even that much information I remember too much problem I don't remember shit but like my wife will tell me from Tuesday what you told me that it's like we're standing right here she like go over all the details because she remembers all of it okay yes you're right but I'll tell you in 1852 some facts and stats some stupid stats that's how I am like when it comes to martial arts I feel like I understand have a good grasp on what's happening but the outside of martial arts I don't know that much yeah but that's probably good man you know I think there's something there's some real power in that having a singular focus I think in order to be great at something you have to be that way singular but I would say very dominantly focused yeah I think you're right because I would if I was only thinking about MMA I would not be here yeah that's a good point right look you need some other things that interest you to relieve the pressure have to yeah otherwise it's too much in you snap I mean what is the best one for you they scape wise yeah jumping on my Malibu boat in my backyard in Colorado and wake surfing and just getting or or hunting both those I getting out I just went and hiked around in the mountains of Colorado for how long I got to do to nap date because I'm too busy but by myself no one else first time ever hunted the area I scouted it like three days before a camp but just went out by myself could didn't have a cell phone reception nothing just to your own thoughts for two and a half days so this type of year this time of year archery mule deer was oh it was yeah so I tried getting a elk tag in Colorado but I didn't draw I did draw a mule deer tag for the same area but it's so it's heavily dominated elk so it's harming a mule deer there yeah it's hard to get those two to coincide with each other but that's that's hard hunting that's a mountain hunting that's the real deal yeah man I mean you're going from eight thousand ten eleven twelve thousand feet you know hike two or three of those mountains and you're toast when you get back hey man when you do that bring that shroom tech sport that's on a trim to export or any cordyceps mushroom supplement anything along those lines that's literally how it came about they realize these high-altitude cattle herders we're realizing that their cows were more active when they were eating these certain mushrooms and that's the cordyceps mushroom we actually grow we don't grow but you know we advise inform grow they grow it off caterpillars oh no way they don't off the caterpillars yeah it's fucking weird shit man all quarter-sawed mushrooms are grown that way I don't know about all but a lot of them that's crazy yeah they grow them on caterpillars so they're definitely not vegan I take stream Tekin oh is that a forest is that a plant-based like its fungal based okay yeah mushroom yeah mushrooms um they take in air and they breathe out carbon dioxide like we do they're closer to animals and they are to plants mmm that's a whole different category listen to Paul Stamets no oh my god I did a podcast with him strap yourself in take three hits hold on tight buckle down and listen to that guy's podcast he's a real mycologist I'll have an actual scientist who studies mushrooms and he's amazing so that's how cordyceps mushrooms are grown okay where's the caterpillar underneath that now you can just buy us a culture oh that's a culture of them yeah okay so this is a free year for your home that's probably even better right you get it fresh a lot of dudes gross shrooms though it's pretty easy apparently yeah but just it's a phenomenal supplement and if you're doing anything high-altitude it will absolutely increase your endurance that is one of the only supplements that I'll tell people look if you're skeptical about any of this shit please i want you to before you workout an hour before you take 4 shroom tech sports and get ready because you're gonna have an extra gear you got one extra gear in training it's like one I notice hush yeah like I was saying earlier I take them before every a session with DJ it's from tech and alpha brain it's with b12 it's cordyceps mushrooms b12 and adaptogen sand those are all really important things for energy so is this calivita have you doing all kinds of supplementation and what does he got you taking so everyone's got a different supplement plan because he does a hair analysis from us and decide you know you really everything's got numbers man everything analysis yeah and so so my supplement base would be different than Duane's I mean a lot of us have that we have the same aminos we have the same creatine obviously depending where you're going for fight you know that kind of stuff but when it comes down to what's in your body mineral wise like I might have more magnesium or more this and more that gets our body back to homeostasis so take out we have too much of I might need more vitamin B the most examples things you didn't you have too much of I have well I have too much arsenic in my body Oh what were you eating I think it's rice I think the rice is given a lot of because rice is at least because grown in water so the yeah yes I think it's right it could be for my tattoos as well let me tattoo you like it yeah the ink has arsenic in it I'm fucked yeah man the only person that have more arsenic in my body than me in our camp was Cub Swanson Wow and he's all covered and his whole back and stuff yeah yeah that is crazy now did what did they find a way to eliminate it can you eliminate yeah so I'm taking that well I'm taking a lot of different stuff for her but I'm taking chlorella I'm juiced every day I juice cilantro cilantro is are good for heavy metals getting detox I'm taking math iodine which is a Camino to pull it out of your body and then he's got some drops on me I'm on to I don't even know what they are now have you got a second test yeah and come down by over 50% oh wow yeah I had also if it's still in your system and it's not you not even rice anymore so it's got to be from you tattoos yeah it could be I mean or just slowly you know it you can't so you can do a collation where they do it by IV but that stuff's like it's hot it's hard on you know how fast it comes out so it comes out and like pimples it'll come out like when I am is it started coming out of my arm I could mainly I'd get pimples throughout my arm and that's kind of your body pushing it you also push it through your urine and things like that but it'll come out of your skin arsenic sits on yeah yeah I tested for arsenic once Chris but I was eating sardines I was eating a lot of sardines and apparently they live around the bottom of the ocean and they get a lot of the heavy metal poisoning from that way that's crazy but it makes sense with rice that totally makes sense yeah but everyone's got different supplements like it just depends on what's in your body like how like what you need to get back to perfect homeostasis right and then he adds like you know the certain amino body but our muscle building and and ubiquinol and the krill oils and things like that for building red new red blood cells and things like that what is his scientific background so I don't know all of that I know he worked for NASA he was like working with the nuclear anti-deficit defense system and then he missed a Christmas or something and decided to move home and be a schoolteacher and he became a calculus teacher whoa and he goes like a private high school and people travel all over the world to do his class to take his class he won some award to be in the best calculus teacher in the world like all of his kids on his placement test score I don't know if it's perfect or very high and it was so yeah he's he's just uh like math math will tell you everything and the numbers it's not like I said it's not bro science it's to the exact you know exactly for getting better yeah well he must apply that science to his understanding of energy and of intensity because like the way you guys train it's very intense very explosive it reminds me a lot of what I'm seeing at least of like Marv arena bitches type training that like a lot of plyometrics a lot of things along those lines would that be fair to say absolutely but then we also do we're also doing deadlifts and cleans and we're doing a lot of stuff man and he mixes it up a lot yeah depending where you're at in your camp how your body also the recovery so the recovery is huge he listens to our our body while we're sleeping so he gets a report every morning of how much next to you in the bed it's pretty much like if you had a couple glasses of wine you know like why you why you're not Rico he just like knows or if he knows you're too stressed out he knows like he'll tell me when I'm gonna get sick yeah like he's caught on to me getting sick before I got sick real it's like Oh your body's about to crash like you need to like take the next day next two days off like really rest I mean oh he helped keep TJ in that last fight yeah helped repair some injuries right we have to talk about him but he keep without Sam yeah that fight may have been different by my last two fights yeah yeah you're right yes yeah I've been dealing with some serious stuff last couple fights but I've been able to keep my body very very strong you know well I know you also spent some time with dr. Neil Riordan Panama and did that was that for the same type of injuries same thing yeah yeah so a company combination of the science of stem cell and dr. Neil Roden as well as more I hear I got I mean I got stem cells in the states I got in Panama like I've had to do a lot to hold myself together kind of thing you know I'm feel great because of the way I'm training and yeah I don't think people understand the the kind of strain on your body of fight camp puts it's fucking crazy I mean if I worked out the way you guys did once I'm wrecked for a week that's two days every day constantly going at it and then there's ice passes Sam what does he have you doing sauna ice bath was you have you got um for our recovery I mean mainly it's just a lot of the most time taking the time off but we have it's always changing it's always evolving too he's got like this I'm I'll Pro we do for like some sort of stem on our muscles I do light Sam like electricals Tim I do I do a light therapy there's this new place he's starting to work with down in Mission Viejo called like oh - Recovery Center where we'll do blue cryo will do hyperbaric chamber will do was a sivak or something like that mhm yeah bunch of different stuff we're gonna add two seat back is the machine we were talking about really recently where you jacks you up and all in altitude and brings you down and like changes the pressure inside that little tube and that's supposed to be pretty amazing did you have good results with that I actually haven't done yet so something he's told me now that like we're gonna add this now like oh he's like every time I come back to camp it's like we're adding the next step he doesn't do it all at once as it should life's always changing me of all the time she'd be like you teaching me the BMT black belt system right away right without throwing any of it you know so he like gets my body like slowly adapted to certain things and he adds to it what about massage a lot yeah yeah what kind of massage he doesn't have me do it I just do it because I love it yeah but I always do deep tissue for the most part and then a lot of that like mat like the stretching kind of kind of like a Thai massage type stuff yeah a lot of Thai massage and then also yeah exactly yeah that's amazing they stand on your back and pull your arms up I have a student Brett Thomas see me he is by far the best massage therapist I could ever come across really he's badass there's ones out there man he he's got a black belt in massage therapy that's for sure like a good massage shouldn't feel that great to the average person like it's gonna hurt supposed to hurt yeah that's how you're gonna feel afterwards and I actually now have learned to enjoy the pain kind of thing mmm well yeah actually so I mean I worked this whole last camp to a guy that really helped me get to my camp was right now it's gonna blink but uh Javier he did a lot of bodywork on me that hold me in place as well to body work as opposed to like what's like what is body work he's opposed to regular massage so he's more of like the nerve like the nervous system of all your pathways and really find out what's weak like he'll tell me like something it's like weak before I even let him know before the massage how would they how can you tell that I don't know how I can tell that I'm not really sure I'd have to have him tell you so there's something weird about people that touch people's bodies all the time and you go this is all horse shit and then they put their arms shoulder what's going on with your shoulder yeah what what do you mean like it's very very tense up here you have an injury you nursing how'd you know you know there's a sixth sense for sure just get used to like the difference between your left side and your right side like are something's going on here they just it's like everything else right like your understanding of what an athlete is capable of is so different than a person who doesn't train just and I think it's gotta be yeah you know we don't we can't imagine something be able to touch your pack and go oh you've got a tear you got a muscle tear what mm-hmm but there's also those massage therapists it'll do something like how does I feel you feel better it's like oh yeah I guess I feel better you know but this guy will find my weaknesses be without me even telling him he'll know like things that I need to get worked on he knows my hipster lined like kind of like almost like a chiropractor as well but he doesn't do chiropractic work good yeah yeah don't like chiropractors huh I just don't think it's real I love him I love to get lying back up good I've had Negus tweaked and not be able to do anything and then get lying back up and be ready to go yeah it's definitely ho sighs I think works better than anything but it just too much about what what chiropractic medicine was how it started it started by a guy who was a magnetic healer learned about it in a seance and then his son murdered him and took over the business turned out something good but they didn't people are crazy yes the good thing about it mean it's interesting what's good and what's not you know what's provable is it's very interesting what's they just people always say that it's a part of the National Institute of Health Care is that what it is a part of their recommended program but it's not anymore they were removed it there's not there's no real evidence that shows it works the thing about it is though it's like I just suggested myself like I adjusted my knuckles that's literally what they're doing what they're doing to your back I've had for whatever it you know over 100 fights whenever inhale my neck jacked up and wrestling in shots and I've had pretty significant injury where I couldn't like change lanes and turn and drive and then go get adjusted and be back to square one I think it has done the same thing with massage I think there's something to people touching you and working on stuff and loose and loosening you up in a way that you can't do and I'm not saying that there's not good chiropractors out there that really understand all the other things like cold laser therapy and different kinds of manipulation in terms of like you know muscle stretching and what is that type of Rolfing Rolfing legit massage just a brutal brutal massage but it's one of those things where it breaks everything down and then after it's over everything's very loose okay and there's there's a lot of chiropractors at a really good physical therapists too but just the the underlying principles of what okay the chiropractic medical practice is it started off with nonsense the guy thought he could fix everything by adjusting you owe something on your eyesight let me fix yeah definitely limits make sure I'm a cocky neck and you're not gonna have bad breath anymore oh yeah that's stupid but if you believe it people are like oh the power believe 2-series that's part of what it's one of the things they prey on one of the things that they use is and not necessarily to this whole you know thing it's not just regular chiropractors there's you know there's different kinds of air-quote healers yes sir that have like different systems that they think they can push down the middle your back and cure your pancreas so much horseshit yeah it's not real you know what the but there are a bunch of things you can do that are real and massage is one of them massage is it's absolutely a fact that it's helped loosen people up and relax people and do something about being manipulated like that like you've so many really digging their elbow into your tissue and you know loosening everything up we got this fucking yeah I have I have a Tim Tam and I have their gun thing is the shit yeah that thing is amazing Ross thank you you have anything that's like knotted up and really bother you a hammer it with that fucking thing and afterwards it's like what am i students made one of those out of a little drill or a gun yeah yeah put a tennis ball or sometimes essentially with this yes I mean it's just the same kind of motive it's going I don't buy that make this thing for $30 so when you guys are doing camp do you move down to California for the will you do six or eight weeks how many weeks are you doing I do a lot about do more than I probably should but I mean I'd almost do camp before I get into camp kind of thing really I like to get yourself in shape yeah I like to be in shape when camp starts you know always developing savings this camp Dewayne came out like started coming out nine weeks before the fight maybe Tim yeah it was a lecture in more than two months yeah and he would do three days he'd come out flower Monday Wednesday Friday or no I started I'm sorry Monday Tuesday Wednesday so be out here three days back home four days splitting time yeah but it worked away with that I was able to find a which was already aware of slow down talk slower today yeah but talk so people who's complaining talk too fast yeah i'ma talk slower but you get a lot of information in that one minute corner this is why I'm why why I talk fast I got about 30 seconds to talk and really information which is also why I have the actual system and encode all the the drills and combinations so I can condense it right I don't want to say jab cross hook cross three the corner for my see tomorrow fight tell me what to do and I walk out there and thirty seconds later I'd not be there there's there's routines and there's patterns of success you know there are Harbor sentence drills and combinations that I've been proven to be successful well how about we just keep practicing those obviously it's up to the athlete to find the timing distance and accuracy to pull them off I have to believe there they are yeah the part right and yet we have to believe in the system too I can't be like like if I didn't believe exactly what doing was telling me are that he can see it that I know he can see it cuz he's good at it like are why are you really gonna go out there and do what he says that's one thing I had with boss too whenever he gave me information I did not doubt it at all as I know he's been there and done that and it wasn't stuff that he felt he would do his stuff that he knew that I should do right and and I feel I understand TJ and I could give him the proper information for the proper time but also I know when to sit back and let him flow as well right and and win a I'm gonna type in and give him information and he's really good about you know receiving information as a case in point the first fight with Cody between the rounds we hadn't drastically changed things and what we needed to change was just the timing of our attack is pretty simple to me fighting is now I I don't I don't think I know it all I know I don't know it all but it's all I know and I know a lot that's for sure mmm but I was going back to earlier traveling out here three days a week and back home four days again I found a really good for what was a good rhythm I bus as far as pulling off information as far as the path the class sparring and this was like we're layering it up we're practicing it in class now we're sparring with it and then going back to it we need to work on so I found a really good pyramid to for TJ to retainer for anyone to retain the information kind of condensing into three days it's it was it was really fun it was I look at it as like as an experiment what's the most optimal way for someone to perform and fight safe and effectively I see it's fun I love this shit there's a lot of people that want to go to these big giant super camps and I know you know with alpha male you were in a big giant super camp you're doing now is very different and that's this is something that obviously steep MeOH was doing there's a lot of other fighters that were doing that are doing where a lot of it is based around them Mighty Mouse in particular that's he's another one I mean there are unquestionably professional fighters around them but it's not like they're in a building with six other world champions and there's a bunch of you know savages that are coming up that you know and everybody's trying to kill each other it's a it's a different it's a different setup like it's a lot of it is geared towards you it is and it's just the natural way it kind of have happened this time is this better what is better is it better to be in the doghouse with all the alpha male guys where it's all just animals trying to kill each other wanted yes if it's if it's not for money you know I mean when these big James turn into someone wants to make money then the real martial arts comes out of it when you have coaches and people running it that are really going to not want it like I have a gym the training lab so I'm very fortunate that I have Steve Martin a guys'll spin he's put his heart and soul into this thing to keep this building open cuz we're not making money we're not we're not gonna hope we don't have a it's pretty much private I teach you kids class and we do adult boot boot camp kind of things just to turn the lights on just so the bills are paid and then some sponsors here and there to pay the coaches like we're losing money and thank God that we have a guy like Steve Martin that's one to see our dream that we want to build a team that is not based around money that it's a whatever money we end up making from the gym is going every dollar to the coaches you know like I don't want to I don't want to make money I don't want that awkward relationship between me and watch Letta that I'm making money off him you know then you get that weird business relationship rather than us just having a real relationship like me wanting him to get better him wanted me to get better which I felt like maybe used to kind of be that way alpha male but it's turned into a money thing to where it I don't know man it wasn't like there wasn't like before we knew before we got we had no coach it was just us coaching each other kind of thing you know yeah that's not usually the best thing no we were just beating each other we were sparring four or five days yeah I mean I picked up so fast because of it you know like you had to learn how to fight right I mean I'm aggressive and I like that stuff but it's not smart you know in terms of like your overall welfare longevity in support yeah yeah so I I've control I've turned into a real professional athlete sport instead of it just going to the gym and going ham like I got everywhere from my diet everywhere from the way I what are the times I work out my schedule my recovery have luckily I'm having doing this able to travel out with me I built I built an awesome facility right now with Mark Munoz Circle and background being a coach Darrell christian felipe de monica and all these guys like it's not money driven so it's it's doing great right now we're we're we're awesome well we're doing awesome yeah he really does have a really good crew of people around him in offices and it's not your we're in Anaheim and all beautiful yeah that's great yeah so when the UFC's in Anaheim your hop skip and a jump away oh yeah we're right there I mean even fighting in LA was nice I mean you know yeah they had to fly anywhere it was confined your backyard Dan Lambert did did all this before anybody I mean Dan Lambert in terms of like throwing money at things and and putting America I mean that guy he he spent a fuckload of money but he put fighters on salary and and then recently built a giant place with dormitories and everything no that guy at all the people he's a probably the pioneer of digging deep into his wallet and putting together a crazy gym setup like that yeah different kind of crew you know you go down there then there are a ton of world champions there's a ton of professional athletes and you know it's and you're not necessarily gonna get the singular specified training that you're getting right now yeah for sure and then but we're also really so yeah you could be really good and we want you in our gym but if you have the right personality as well too it's not only about your skill to become and train with our gym and be a pro athlete there we also got a vibe with us right if we don't have the vibe then this all egos are gonna get involved in the gyms gonna split up this guy's gonna go here this guy's gonna go there how do you determine that do you get to know them first and then let them in the gym we always let everyone in to see how they're going if they don't work out then we tell them like a man this isn't spot for you you know we don't we don't have an open spot for you you can see it though that with the drills and the Dutch drills and just the drilling in general how caring somebody is right and Brian there's there's four rules ask my guys to follow and there are rules that revolve around accountability it's show up on time get better get tired take care of your partner you do those four simple things and we're good it's pretty simple mmm those are very good rules yeah it's it's it's that sport that attracts people who are troubled yeah agreed yeah yeah and then we happen that have been abused they want to get people back yeah there's a lot of that you remember a lot of when when I was younger the more aggressive meaner people when you would find out more about them he'd find out there's child abuse dad used to beat him up stepdad beat him up there was always something that they were trying to get back at people for hmm I feel like the sport is changing enough now that it's a very common thing that kids want to do and so now you have mm-hmm you know yeah kids with the good route brings want to do it yeah it's a challenging possible career now and a fighter you know a young kid coming up see someone like you and they go okay look at this guy he's two-time world champion super respectful articulate real friendly doesn't have a chip on his shoulder likes you know shaking hands and taking pictures and being around people oh you don't have to be an asshole I don't have to be some brooding asshole for sure yeah I mean you'll get paid for it more these days but yeah that's interesting you get paid more for being a complete asshole you know I make if you don't mind making a fool of yourself you know like Colby yeah yeah to the extreme to where like what come on Colby's hilarious I don't know I think it's funny man when I actually went to the fucking White House and put the thing of Donald Trump's desk getting the belt I was like that is hilarious he actually did it yeah you know what really really be funny if attorney I was this whole time he was a Democrat and this was all just a big act really super Pro gay rights and women's office well he's just doing it only specifically just for promotion yeah him and tyron woodley is gonna be crazy that's gonna be crazy I so you know the the videos on the internet the one black dude this is I'm Tyrone and fuck this or fuck that whatever you know the internet guy oh they're hilarious can you flip one of those videos of Tyrone this so funny wait a minute right you gotta explain what you fuck you're talking about right watch it you're pulling up with that I know no do you know what I'm talking about Jamie you do okay so watch this first give me sit for the beginning this is a compilation of it he just like walks around and bullies people sort of [Music] that's not the regular tyrona this is another one different yeah this is different the other ones is a different guy he'll go how many years typing tyrone black dude in the internet I mean you're gonna get a lot of funny cuz if that's not the best clip cuz if he would have won the belt oh no he won the bonus I'm Tyrone and this is my motherfucking bill so if you watch these videos in an actual good video of the Tyrone and the Tyrone would do that in the cage almost I've been thinking about this for a while I should have been so fucking funny but it's not funny Journal the damn videos shit Jaime pull that up he was almost after he won like like nothing happened yeah well he just team doing right by UFC wants me to fight yeah this is weird you know is there's another one that's him is it the same guy yeah this one ever gets beat up [Music] just like terrible editing is this funny shit right but it seems like he's just mean and stealing I don't think that's funny no he's a mean or another oh shit okay let's kill this I'm not as funny as I thought I'm sorry guys shit this seems like a bad sketch someone anyway maybe their family is not that guy no he's not oh it would probably sell more tickets probably yeah see that's where I hide in for like the core beer pill just like super calm and respectful life yeah it's hard to believe he was just in a cage fight yeah dude he shut all that dere until hype up quick I knew who's gonna win I would like to talk to her own or do can see if sorry to interrupt and because how we caught him because Darren toe I made a video about this how dare until typically likes to faint and pump and get the guy backing up get them onto position and then land the cross if you know from open stance from southpaw and there is a slight delay between those two two three punches that he throws and I'm wondering if Tyrone did is researched and seen Marin Tyron is he say Tywin not tear us down mr. Woodley right this Tyron will tyrunt tyrunt tyrunt there's no that now the joke went a minutes funny Kyra no that's now I'm wondering if you can read that from watching the videos previously and seen that little gap in his combination of able to beat him to the punch or if he just duck and chucked I'm curious to see if that was a something if they trained inside out or because that takes balls right he's coming in with his strongest punches cross that he's knocked many people out with and he just stepped into it and beat him to the punch that takes balls Tyron that's his he always was that strategy of standing against the fence or close to the fence and then when guys move any counters yes I mean he did that with Josh Koscheck he's done there with a lot of guys and Rory MacDonald was the only guy to shut that down he figured out the way to shut it down he stayed long stayed long he's a lot of front kicks Bob jabs keep kept his left hand up high to block the right hand you know right hand but man guitar was just faster than him yeah it's like lightning landed that right hand beat the shit out of him on the ground it was just shocking to me that Darren didn't know what to do when he was on his back like in terms of like that's how that's how I thought the fight was gonna go like him just be on top in the whole thing I thought I was just gonna be on top well I thought maybe that was part of the strategy too especially when you saw them warming up because Tyron was doing like a lot of like exchanges and then shoots for a double or closes the distance level changes like they did that when he was working with boxing coaches as well he would hit the hit the Mets and then move in level to blend it together but I was just like till didn't understand the Darce was coming or didn't know but then you got to wonder how battered was he took that big shot took a lot of hard elbows on the ground how much was he really there yeah that is a beauty I'm sorry no she's gonna say because that Darce was left mile away I mean it was there and then it was there and then he cinched it up deep it was never like there was never any separation never pulling the hands back to think Tyrone's a lot stronger than him to able to hold him in that crunch he's a freak yeah he's abusing why he's the champion but I think that's the well the way I choose to look at anyway is having a checklist right if you were to build up a mixed martial artist how much information should they know standing wrestling and then on the ground and this is check check check and know all these basics should be covered before you go fight yeah as a beauty beauty of having a curriculum and again a checklist no I absolutely agree with you I think you know understand I mean the days of just like being able to just fight someone and not know anything about them that seems kind of foolish you know like it seems like a massive advantage to study like when cowboy fought Dare until he decided to not watch any tape on him he's like you know here's the Stryker good I love the strike okay my want to watch this Stryker yeah yeah I'll watch tape in the beginning with Dwayne but then I kind of let him continue from there you know and I trust his driving on everything right and then when I'm out of fight camp since it because sometimes when you watch a tape in fight camp like you can mess with people's heads you know like maybe maybe Kyle was getting too nervous and then when he's white gives him anxiety to watch the fight you know so you need to have it if that's the case have a coach that's willing to the you trust to do that for you that's good point now let me do it's a mental this fucking sports a mental mind fuck man yeah you know whatever works the best reviews that we got to figure out is it better for you to fight someone like Cody that you have all this animosity and beef towards and all the shit talking cuz you get super hyped up and motivated every day or is it better to fight someone who you have a lot of respect for was just a good challenge I think you got to learn to like to be the same person for every fight you know I think it's like control those emotions you know there was all that coming in like I'm nervous to fight you know like forget all the bullshit you know and I had to learn that through my career I had to learn to take emotion out of it I'm even in sparring still you know like Johnny's always told me control my emotion controlled aggression you know because you hit me I want to hit you back I'm very competitive right so it's something you have to learn how to control enough how to do that throughout my career and I think everyone else learn to control either to let go or to pull back you know like really control that emotion to be the same person every fight you know mentally mentally not the same person every fight but mentally like in your own head the same person but technically need to be able switch it up that the mental aspect of it is probably the thing that holds more people back than anything like we all know of guys that are just monsters in the gym and for whatever it was when they would go to compete they just could never be their full self yeah TJ does better in the cage yeah he does in the gym yeah yeah I was always what I did better in the in the gym than in the cage what do you think it is that makes you do better I love it I don't know and I've just taught myself to love this shit like I am I don't know when I get out there it's just like I want to be there you know I know everyone's nervous and like there's like it's the highest highs but I used to be so nervous that I forget like what happened in the fight you know but throughout my career I think after the Mike Eastern fights when I really started to like hone in are during the Mike eastern fight is when I really started to hone in and have fun and just realize like fuck this shit man like what's the worst is gonna happen you knocked out go for it you know house is blank Easton I don't know hasn't been around for a while yeah we're not really sure there's a possible super fight with you and Henry sir who the hell you ain't talked about hell yeah would you fight him at 125 25s yeah yeah absolutely I don't want no excuses that I'm the bigger man and he probably is bigger than you quite honestly yeah that's what I'm saying like I struggled to get to 34 from 2 down 25 25 over 30 especially with the coach I have now Sam Cal Vidya it's like when I was told I was gonna fight domitius Johnson the summer before I fought Kody the first time because Kody had a pool because of his back within three weeks of time I got down to wakin up to 140 pounds by changing my the way I'm working out changing my calories changing my macronutrients and myself like just going full-bore like I was able to start waking up in the morning 140 pounds in three weeks and so right now you're about 10 plus pounds heavier than that mm-hmm and how much time would you need like if they said hey December 31st New Year's Eve super 5 yeah my coach my coach always wants like the like actual like he told me like before after my last fight I mean he's 16 weeks but I mean obviously we could do it a lot of fat I could have made 25 this last fight with how much water I had in me the the hydration that he's got me going on when I get close to a fight too is it's the easiest I don't do so I don't do baths anymore like I will make weight I walked on the treadmill with plastics for how long mmm the day of I'd say 30 minutes I setting us on a little bit and so you're only losing like 4 or 5 pounds most right yeah in the morning yeah probably 3 or 4 or 5 pounds yeah that's that's a massive benefit to you in terms of your conditioning Oh huge you ain't have note on your brain your cardio yeah your muscular contraction and endurance I mean everything I mean when you deplete yourself like that like you're talking about there until maybe cut too much weight I could definitely be a possibility you're sure he's huge tells a big guy yeah to get down to 170 yeah yeah I mean that is the it's they're trying to find the right balance where you're big for the weight class but you're not diminishing yourself really drastically to get down to your weight class in the Henner's hooter thing also entertains me so much cuz he's a gold medalist you know he wants to he wants to claim himself as the greatest combat athlete ever I'm a UFC champion I'm a gold medalist like I'll go out there and Beach and wrestling MMA wrestling is completely different I'm the better athlete I could beat him anywhere I know I can watch it in fight so I'm very excited about I think it's the greatest thing for my name right now I I'm very excited to me a lot excites me a lot to to be able to show the science behind not only myself and my coach and and Dwayne in the system like everything I'm I'm all-in did whatever we're doing I'm 100% in it I don't take any shortcuts and I want to show that I'm gonna show that I can make twenty fives and be my best ever as well now Demetrius is injured yeah he's out for a little while yeah so this is one of the reasons why the talk of this super fight is coming up yeah like it is but Dimitri's gonna need a few months we can't have an immediate rematch so perfect have they talked to you about it and proposed you know there's been so there's nothing been like serious but there's been like hints and like we did our media tour together and they put us on camera together and how does talking shit to each other nice I mean they didn't like they didn't say that you know it means everything's real everything we do is real but it's like oh sure this is what you guys want right you know and like you really think you can beat me then fuck you man let's do this shit you know like that's where I get my motivation from from fighting is is not the anger not let's it's the competition and does he want to go 235 is that he told me face to face he's willing to do at 25 25 yeah mmm yeah that's what he first set up to the face that he wanted he wanted the super fight right that's what his idea is so he's take him to 35 so I told me like look for doing this I'm coming to 25 so I have no problem with that he's got more Street credit to drop a Division Street Division well it's no excuses of the bigger man I don't want to become 35 me whip his ass like oh he's at 35 pounder he's a 35-pound - Oh whoop your ass between he's a huge 125 or he really is we take out the weight cutting there's not much difference between you two guys yeah and when you slow then how much better I am but that's true Henry hang on but when you saw him and Demetrius together I mean he's a much bigger person yeah yeah yeah Heello how much weight does he lose pseudo yes oh no I don't know a good question he's got to be in the 50s when he shows up to fight week he looks like he's cutting weight already you know mm-hmm when I show up to fight week I haven't even really started yet Wow yeah yeah I mean for yours your pace and your endurance that's got to be a big benefit to know that your body is a hundred percent healthy going in there in terms of like not being dehydrated and there's so many guys you see them on the day of the way and you go I don't know how the fuck you're gonna fight in 24 hours I think head traumas a lot more prevalent when you're dehydrated going through camp like I've known some guys that have cut a lot of weight and it's already have hindered their careers you know because you're having those all-out spars I mean you're going you have to go as hard as you can in sparring Maneri for a fight like you're going for your timing you're going for your fighting right I mean you don't do it all the time there's there's times it's so that when you're sparring you're sparring like a fight for the most part I mean I'm not your gloves or yeah I know what we've been doing smaller girl sparring too but those those puppies that I have they are I feel like as padded as my 1600s work it depends where they put the padding padding on the knuckles I mean think you're not thicker than 16 which companies gloves to use for Santa ball Santa ball oh it's in a bowl yeah 71 yeah where's that from well they're offices in New York but the guy the owners are living out here in California sout a new company oh it's been around it's fresh somewhat new it's not brand new I think they've been around since 14 14 oh yeah I make great stuff I mean they have the puffy sparring gloves are awesome to Billy get to get real rounding cuz when I grapple I can't I can't form any rounds with a big puffy clothes on with boxing gloves yeah those they're puffy around the knuckles but you still grip with them yeah you can still grip with them you got everything I mean the only things different is like the padding on your I feel I can't you don't throw them but I came back I saw your thumb you gotta be careful with your thumb so you really have to be accurate with your punches right and with does it fuck with you if you're working submissions with the extra padding on the knuckles yeah absolutely I mean we're naked chokes are harder to get the hand behind the head and guys guys can get out of submissions easier because they can grab more of the glove right they're not supposed to can I say something real quick TJ oh Santa you know as far as hard sometimes right so I try to have my guys Jonas Hinton so uh sparring hogs you do have to spar hard but we would have him do that once a week but we do a whole bunch of sparring drills throughout the week as well to get better technically understand the distance in the timing but you you need a spar hard but it's not like you're hurting the guy if he's rocked or whatever you're not going to knock him out but you're throwing with good forced to because you do have to experience that for sure rock to the body know for sure yeah if you rock them in you know I heard him to the body and this one thing I'll say get hit her to the body you know work out of that as well don't don't take a knee yeah want to make sure that was clear because that's one of the things I feel I've been able to do is dissect the chaos of a fight and slowly manipulative so we can actually understand the layers and get better at it and that helped a lot with the actual drilling and sparring drilling and sparring and then the fight itself so I understand that latter process have you ever found any core drills or ab drills that allow you to absorb punches or kicks better is there anything that you've shown that if you ever figured out I don't know if we do it I mean we have coach throws medicine balls again so we're like we're doing motion movements are doing on a bouncing on a tire or doing almost like a burpee motion or something getting back to your feet and slamming like a big medicine ball and your stomach I mean I think I just think the impact without hurting yourself is is gonna help ultimately then just having a stronger core in general I think I think cortisol but by far the most important in MMA and jiu-jitsu and grappling is your core strength is how strong your core is is like because I can go in lift weights and this guy's gonna be way stronger than me doing bench or doing deadlifts whatever maybe but we get on the mat and he's like - how the fuck you so strong I think it's all core it certainly has a lot to do with kicking power yes yeah so it's so much of it it's not just the legs it's the ability to whip this to hips into it all this that's all your core and your cardio it controls your breathing I think it's like I really believe cores everything what kind of exercises and you're doing for that this is endless I mean a lot of medicine ball stuff are you doing different things with mr. Carl Vito yeah you're doing before yes yeah completely actually this shit's crazy yeah it's straight-up crazy man like Ivan like the first time I showed up I can new who's gonna be hard I give always told me like oh he's like you go hard Mac I've never gone to heart as hard as this guy pushes me ever in my life from that all the years of me practicing or competing but it you can only do it so many times mm-hm you can't do it all the time he knows when when the next practice should be easier or when we're gonna have those days where I'm for sure gonna throw up right you know or like what days I'm pushing the sled up the hill we do a lot of cycling now I'm on the bike constantly but it's not only for low bass it's certain power intervals you doing distance like actual bike on the road or yeah I do that too so if I if I fight 25 I'll be doing a lot of road work running swimming I'm pretty much to try it to make 25 I'll be a triathlete as well I'll be doing some Cameron Haynes shit I was running that far but I'll be trying to act like Cameron Haynes to get smaller but yeah so like I think the bike work does a lot for our cores well too cuz your cores not only your stomach you know of course from your hamstrings up to your back throughout your quote throughout your stomach and it controls a lot you know so even even doing the bike work is a lot of core work as well too yeah people don't realize it sometimes when you have lower back pain it's because your hamstrings are too tight yo you tell him that I'm like what yeah and then they learn how to stretch out their hamstrings too like yeah my back feels better huh yeah so Yoga is all about man hell yeah we do we do yoga me everything I mean there's there's so much behind what we have to do and how long has this guy been doing this so Mark Munoz was his first project in MMA he wrestled so he was a wrestler wrestled always been around wrestling always helped mark with his wrestling camps his kids bred so he's got that wrestling mentality but then he's just a genius as well and so his first project was more cuneus when he was making weight and looking shredded the Tim Bochy I think that was when he first started helping out so that's why it's called the training lab as well spelled with rain in the middle it's because he was attached to mark lanuza gym and helping him out and Mark Muse Jam for people don't know was called brain yes rain yeah yeah and so not as funnies come full circle I mean mark muñoz is the one that talked me into fighting he's my coach at Cal State in wrestling and he was in the UFC at the time is my assistant coach after I graduated college like all bummed out it and do like what I should have and so I didn't feel like I was done competing and sort of fallen mark around and doing jujitsu and all this shit now I was actually enrolled in grad school at the same time to become a physician's assistant he pretty much talked me into dropping out of school and give him fighting a chance cuz he thought I'd be good at it and now it's come full circle and now he's our coach again Wow yeah he's got some awesome MMA flow drills welcoming us yeah he's been wrestling for MMA yeah you can't just be like a nice awesome wrestler and come in and teach him and everything you know you got to know how to punch you got to know the jujitsu aspects of it MMA wrestling is its own sport yeah well it certainly there's certainly rules that you have to follow that you don't have to follow in regular wrestling new things you know there that's the case would you Jitsu as well it's certain that helps to learn jujitsu one of the things I don't know if you guys are paying attention to but Eddie Bravo came up with thing called combat jujitsu which is sort of an intermediary step between regular jiu-jitsu and MMA and it's basically jiu-jitsu with bitchslaps Pancrase yeah with the palm you figured out how to pull his hands way back and he was basically punching you with his palm where you could hit anybody anywhere you can hit him in the forehead you never have to worry about your knuckles I feel like that's harder than my MMA glove yeah I think so too yeah I mean you could really put a beating on somebody with blossoms is an innovator for sure he's always thinking he taught me how to think how to be open-minded and figure stuff out mm-hmm yeah so here it is this is combat this is combat jujitsu that's a guy on the ground I think I hope see now that's one things to like how I Donohue is saying that's attacking the lake situations james's that's an actual fight and you have punches right yeah watch attacking those legs I mean you you open up things yep the same way you would open up things with punches you know there it is BAM is that one of my affiliate students from Montana with the blond hair wiring the road she has stopped quite a few people well he stopped at least one person with just two slaps but he's used those slaps you know and Wagner has uh he's got a big advantage in being a high-level MMA fighter as well heading into this but there the idea behind it was created by Eddie because he wanted to make it just a little bit more realistic on the ground just add this other element to it because there's times where guys are going four leglock yes and you know your your face is wide open you're committing both your arms to the person's leg and that person's exactly they can just smash your face and if you're used to that in Jitsu gym where a guy can't punch you and you just think you're safe and you always practice yes way thank you combats she just is a real wake-up call and just getting fucking and it's like instructor at our Academy Sam Koontz he teaches jiu-jitsu for self-defense and then he asks you if you want to compete in jiu-jitsu they teach you different jiu-jitsu he wants to find out why did you come here like what you're you want to get better you want self-defense you want to compete because there's a different way you have to approach things for sure which is why TJ can be on the same mat with regular students in my gym because he's doing slightly of a different drill in combination with more contact than the average person you know so you'll get out what you put in and in your academy do you have everything there do you have submission instructions but wrestling or do you go different places for you Jitsu how do you do it the only thing I do not at my gym is my jujitsu I go to Gracie Baja in Irvine with flipper Demonica great spot yeah man he's a stranger he knows jujitsu for MMA just like you're saying Mark Munoz wrestling for MMA and I probably have striking for anybody I mean TJ has a really good camp around him I would have liked to be in his position now to understand me of martial arts I'm not gonna hijack the podcast sorry I told them the other day we were texting about like Tammy room in for this shitty music ass video it's like dudes is our journey though you know this is I'm not doing this shit alone if I was doing it alone it'd be a lot harder I'm not saying I couldn't do it but I don't I wouldn't be to this level I wouldn't be Who I am I told mrs. our journey you know I mean that's why this shit works yeah I don't have a bigger ego I'm not like whatever you know that mean doing really see eye to eye I was family the best family but it's it's so critical to relationship that you guys have because I think it's there's there's he can add so much in terms of what he understands and your acceptance of him and your appreciation of him allows you guys so like fully integrate to this one project of TJ Dillashaw world champion making you the best you could be if there was any sort of conflict or you got to be number one or you don't want to listen to him I'm gonna do what I want to do today like that shit happens all the time with coach and fighters and fighters and then sometimes you don't hear about until after the fight and you're like what happened I got to tell you man II wouldn't show up for training he was this and that he's got this new girlfriend she's pregnant that's why I'm all name is TJ's all-in yeah I don't have a stable the fighters I have a few guys that float through my place right I work with them a little bit here and there but TJ's all-in so I'm I'm all-in now one of the benefits of being in Colorado was the altitude are you you don't think so mm-hmm no it depends where you fight what do you think because you can train a lot harder at sea level your body gets a little more dance like the oxygen and your recovery at sea level is way better I mean when I first started going up to Colorado and training at altitude I felt like my body wasn't recovering I was I felt older man the lack of air up there yeah I think the lack of of rebuilding myself you know we do altitude training we do altitude it's called Auto lab something I breathe into at certain times certain time lengths like different intervals throughout the throughout training camp instead of living and breathing altitude and I'd rather get to recovery and the hard training from sea level and then use the altitude to get in that hypoxic state so the reason why less oxygen in the air you create more red blood cells and the more red blood cells you have the more oxygen you transport and so they're thinking if you go down to sea level you're gonna have more oxygen to transport but your body has been able to train as hard and recover as you can at sea level and then use the hypoxic state by breathing in this machine to get the red blood cell production okay so you can get the benefit of altitude without having to live there what I had heard is that the best move was to train at sea level but live at altitude I don't think theory I mean I don't think your recovery is good enough what about those on what my coaches told me you know that makes sense and this is making sense yeah what do you think about those tents where like people sleep in those tents I've tried one if it's hard to sleep yeah so if you cuz you're pumping it up so it gets hot in there for one plus you start thinking like that scene in psycho with a fucking nightmare every day but no it is when you're when you're not reading the much oxygen it's it's just you don't feel recovered and you don't get a restful night's sleep all right so you know I say I see what you said now that totally makes sense yeah you definitely feel the difference um and totally makes sense that you would be able to train harder at sea level and you can push your body to that super far extreme that you wouldn't be able to get there at altitude but if you live it out to suit for a few years doesn't your body totally normalize that yeah but then I'm but I'll be fighting at sea level right you know I don't yeah I don't know enough it's just what I was told I know I need no matter where I'd fight sorry ninja yeah yeah good I knew no matter where I fought that I would always be ready to go because born and raised in Colorado so I didn't care where I was and one of my goals was to get tired because I know if I was tired that that motherfucker was dead tired so let's go mmm guys like Colavito make my head hurt dude he's awesome about but I thinking about all these different things that he's got you going and thinking about all his the planning that must be involved it's a full-time job that's a straight-up full-time job like even like the juicing I do every day look I mean if I if you didn't do my meal prep it'd be impossible unless obviously my wife was doing it all but he'd be impossible to get all that done you know they're doing it so much and how many athletes is he working with it's a pretty small group I mean and it's growing now cuz obviously the name is growing and more athletes that we're still doing those garage yeah it's called the garage we do it at the gym as well too but there's a small group of guys that still go to his garage and do it there it's kind of like our our varsity team I guess he would say you know once you once you've proved yourself enough in the gym you can get with that's which has happened guys have come to our gym they've worked out with us we've got along with them they become like you know family and then we bring him into the garage so I'd say he's got sea cub one Aaron Pico sad spike I don't know I would say we're probably got like 8 9 guys will come to his garage and work out that's a great group right there have an arrant Pico with you that's gotta help that future world champion without a doubt versus a savage not only like how good he is technically but mentally too like delightful's I'm competitive I go hard and he's to another extreme like no way dude it's great we do this like ham peddler for distance at the garage we're on a down a decline or downhill and we're doing his hand peddlers for distance and how far we know who gets it who gets to a mile first wins and I thought he won the World title when you beat me yeah I pretty much I did - Cody yo it in my face after the fight you know like or after the ham peddler that he won is he's just he's very competitive he's very good technically he's hungry he takes no shortcuts 21 years 21 years old and wasn't taking any shortcuts and I didn't learn all this shit till I was 30 and he's already doing it now and he's a world-class wrestler great boxers working with Freddie Roach a lot he's good man he's really good yeah and you know I think there's a there's an actual real gift in losing his first fight yeah leave there's a gift in that you see these are much hype behind him and he got cracked and submitted quick he first got finished is the worst you possibly get worst yeah yeah and it's very first bite and a head kick what I don't really recover not only did you get knocked out but you got submitted as well yeah and you did it in front of Madison Square Garden on the main card for your first fight ever so he experienced experience like the lowest lows for his first fight so now it's like there's no going lower like everything's everything's skyrocketing now and everybody was so hyped up about him there was so much hype about him which is deserved yeah it just shows you that everybody can get caught anybody can get finished and oh yeah that experience I think it's so valuable for him you know I really do and that that left hook that he landed in his last fight holy shit two fights huh yeah he'll find that body shot every time I spar I'm sure he's like obviously you gotta get ready for and you can feel it but he finds it every time yeah and then like he started worrying about the body shot and you're opening yourself up you know yeah yeah he's good man he's really good that's one thing I feel mr. Coker of Bellator does pretty well is gives people the proper fights that help build them up right mm-hmm I don't think Pecos first fight was a bad matchup he just got caught you got caught by a tough guy yeah you know I love Coker yeah I'd like to I like what he's doing and you know I'm supposed to be somehow or another in competin with Bellator I said it's horseshit I mean I'm the one who got Jimmy Smith hired I was trying to get him hard years ago I and I love the fact that Big John's over there now and that you know and they Goldie's over there too yeah and more oh I love morale and I just there's a lot of great fighters over there man I mean I love the fact that Rory McDonald's over there that he's a champ I mean he's one of if he's not the best welterweight in the world it's him and tyrant hmm you know I really think that everything I got a practice that name sorry tires just don't have any onion yes sir but if it's not I mean he's most certainly one of the best Mousasi one of the best 85 errs in the world if not the best I mean they have like legit claim to world-class fighters now and at least two weight classes they got the the banners the fighter walk out it's like old-school UFC I like it I like it I like you know that the fighters are having a good time over there they getting paid well I don't hear any complaints yeah I wanted to grow man I really want it to be a I wanted to be like right up there with the UFC I would love it if it was a full rival like pride boys ah yes miss pride I left Brian Paul I didn't figure out a way to do that crossover fight so you stay here bill belt rope as far as you see is and then have like this like oh yeah we're fucking better look man those are big fights Aiken now on triple G yes look if they had a Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor MMA style if there was like literally a guys we talked about that right well they were talks about that for Floyd and Conor but I don't think it was real what I mean is a guy who gets as big as Mayweather has gotten in the UFC and a guy who gets as big as he got in MMA with Bellator and then they have some giant ass fucking super fight there's enough for everybody yeah I just think for the athletes it's better if his choices you know and it's good for you it's not just choices it's more competitive and when it's more competitive they try harder to do a good job for the athletes make it attractive to the athletes like if you're a football player you can get you can go to a bunch of different places to play right but if you're a fighter you got like two spots you got Bellator and you got the UFC it's it's like there's two teams out there you know and I think that's unfortunate I think it'd be way better for fighters I don't think that boxing is a clean system and I think boxing definitely has its flaws in terms of like promotion and like what is that why this fights happen trouble gene Canelo when it should already been over like triple G won that fight yeah but that could happen in the UFC and judging happens all the time there's some fucking terrible judges out there yeah I mean experience that fuck it's crazy man it's crazy that no one's doing anything to fix it there's people that have passed bad calls that should just be removed now see you don't understand professional high-level fighting there's be like a grading system if if you see these judges and they can be late they've made like look this person's made like four bad choices or bad decisions right you're out I think they should go through a training course and be tested on it just like I test my students for their ranking in the system right they should be able to go to its information and get better and then pass the test or not judge to the fight or let a fight go through and let some quality edges judge it and then test those results versus their results right how do they judge it and compare those notes to see because we're dealing with people's careers and their livelihood and lots on the line with these people aren't making the correct decisions from their lack of education they could definitely get better at it so they start boom sorry oh no please go when they start pulling some old fighters and old em maybe x-fighters retired fighters as far as being the judges but then maybe there's some some hold back on that from what would you think that's possible but I think you're better off with those fighters and their bias then someone who really doesn't understand this or because they'll be a pretty being called out to if you forget usually like see their decisions they're making like yeah you know just don't have someone who they have a close relationship with her right if like Frankie Edgar is fighting you don't have her car oh I made as a joke oh yeah so yeah cuz he's a part of the Commission that's right yeah even though I think yeah here's hello team you need people that understand martial arts and there's a lot of the people that are judges that just have no background which to me is crazy agreed it just doesn't make any sense when it's not like there's a shortage of martial arts practitioners out there there's millions of them yeah yep yeah we're out there yep you could find us and you could get us to be judges I'll judge from fights yeah there you go man I mean and and I think also we've said this before I'll say it again it should be more than three judges there's no reason to limit it to three all you need is two dummies and they ruin a fighter's career you could you get bad luck and have two dummies out of three that's not hard to do yeah - people really don't understand the fight you you need at least five and I think we'd be fine with ten I don't think there'd be anything wrong with having ten judges that way if you really got a 5/5 that's a real draw I think real draws are real - like there's fights where like you go Jesus I don't know who won that fight I got I'd have to go over that fight with a fine-tooth comb and the difference the distance between winning and losing is so close I think you're better off arguing for a draw in some fights I don't think there's any shame in that yeah I actually was that close like why not it'd be you know yeah because there's some fights where the guy gets a decision and the girl gets a decision you're like how by who it's that they both won I mean it's a fucking incredible fight one person goes home a loser the other person goes home a winner and it's almost like flipping a coin over time when I said lose face it's a draw over time glory does that still I would just say I came in second place okay well in fucking wild if you got there ready and now it's like whoo I fucking won this one you know like split decision oh Jesus yeah we have a majority draw like oh no when these go audience would go nuts oh hell yeah have you had that one only four championships yeah only four championships one more round yeah and she'd be like a 10-minute round it should be a 10-minute round - Oh fried style yeah pride style tamanna round was awesome for grapplers the gloves - yeah yeah yeah you think that's a big factor right the curve of the gloves yeah and now my boxing coach Trevor Wittman is working on some kind of gloves that are eliminating the eye poke situation I'm not quite sure exactly what he's thinking but he's there's anybody to do that job it's him I love that dude he's he is he is why I'm as technical as I am is from Trevor Whitman he's very detailed one of the things that a lot of people were like almost like wandering or down on him or trying to looking for something to criticize wasn't just engaging knocked out James Vick Aksum yep drop some smashes him stops him everyone is going crazy and look at Trevor Trevor just sitting there like this no he knows yeah maybe what he didn't jump up and scream yeah he's had his arms crossed and he's what you see if you find that it's kind of not I didn't not only did expect it he was like quietly satisfied I was like look at that say is I got Tyron after his title just like sorta yeah totally cried when he got his black belt that was cool that was crazy Thomas to a fellow fighter like that that's Austin's cool that's lineage that's like that felt more to him than wit that's so crazy that would feel more to him than then defending his title he's been world champion knows he's watching he's confident you know without a doubt one of the best Walter words of all time he's not a doubt he's I feel like there's three guys in the running it's Matt Hughes George st. Pierre in him he's an athletic man so good it's crazy athletic ease and with din with Dean in his corner and with Duke Rufus and just he's just coming into his own man you know he mean and people criticized him for the Demian Maia fight and the Wonder Boy Thompson fight but because those fights boring that's the way you have to fight those guys period if you want to fight wonder boy you think you're gonna go crazy and charge a damn good luck yeah a good idea yeah yeah you're gonna eat some knuckles so going back to the training method you know and that's one thing I wonder how much time Duke is spending with him and and Dean is spending with him din-din Thomas Dennis spending with him and then taking that skill and testing it against all the other ATT guys so I'm just wondering how much class work he's doing versus one-on-one work and then how much live work he's getting with the crew does that be a question I don't think they're doing too much work at ATT because a TTS where Colby is right now oh so where's he's training that doesn't seem a lot of it at Duke Rufus been a lot of time with Duke but I don't know exactly where he trained his whole camp you know good well he looks fucking phenomenal Duke's figured out a way to get him to really conserve his energy and manage it properly too because we all know that when someone's that big and that fast it's so hard to maintain endurance but he hurt Wonder Boy in the fourth round of their fight you know and hurt him like he carries that knockout power deep deep into the fight so he's figured it out he's figured out a way to manage his energy correctly and if you see the countdown shows too he's doing a bunch of crazy cranky conditioning shit too which I kind of think everybody has to do now so it's a real gonna ESPN it's a real fucking sport you know yeah you can't take shortcuts man this is a profession like I told you my training schedule is a full-time job it's hard for me to get anything else done when I'm in training camp now when you're not training camp like now you're out of camp how many days a week you working out lately I've only been doing like my string condition with Sam so when I'm back in town a couple times a week I'm gonna go back out to Colorado and all spinning every day at Duane's doing kickboxing I'll probably start going to Gracie Baja Sanju this is all fun like I'm doing I do normal I'll go to do normal class right now at Sam's it's not like I'm peaking for a fight so it's just maintaining my body and keep them certain things strong to prevent injury and then I'll go to Gracie Baja and I'll probably roll some ghee just to do it you know just to kind of stay active when you roll ki do you grab the ghee or do you trust just try to do nogi techniques I need to get better at learning I grab the key I still do know ghee technique experience that's what I've always do you know I never did I would never really use a ghee I hardly ever use it's not my favorite but I wear it yeah but I don't use it yeah I just dunno ghee with the ghee on they can grab me yeah but I just dunno ghee stuff yeah that's why I gotta go in there for fun you can't go in there like expecting to be great cuz there's so much shit if you don't know it they're grabbing your belt pulling you in certain colleges some crazy shit that they do they pull your your thing out your lapels out yeah try to choke you with it I'll pull the back of your guy out and wrap it on your neck yeah all right settle down but it mean for the geek competition as long as that's all legal that's great but I mean for someone learning martial arts whether it's for self-defense or for me what I found about doing ghee is it really improved my nogi submission defense because it was so easy to control me with the gate because if someone's grabbing your collar and grabbing your sleeve and they bang either hold you down you have to get out of things technically look if you get locked up in an armbar you can't just explode a lot of things you have to figure out a way to like slowly increment release yourself the right way and defend everything the right way because if you get too deep with all that friction with the you know that heavy canvas fee they can lock you up you know we have to be technical as you're deep I still don't really it makes you much more meticulous about your submissions yeah it does make you that hold yeah absolutely especially defense yeah I mean if you're gonna compete in jiu-jitsu then we're a guy but it's for self-defense then I would actually trim a noogie I say that but if you're in New York and you wearing a leather coat yeah winter talk shit to her with a jean jacket on bitch you're flying on your head hell yeah hell yeah let's do that rolling with the typical clothes though right yeah it's gonna be different than a nice even close enough but it's enough to grab yep see you know like if you're graph you could choke somebody out with a regular collared shirt yeah oh yeah you know you grab ahold of like a regular dress shirt and you get a hand in lapel that's a dead man oh yeah you know he doesn't even know it just get a hold that collar and pull that fucker in I mean kind of like you're saying like changing Who I am because of where I'm at my life and my family now like I wish I could train more outside of fight camp I wish I had more time to get in the gym and train but I'm like going everywhere getting pulled in every direction creating businesses to try to set up my future I know you're you've got your seasoning business I've used your seasoning yeah flavor flavor Republic yeah did you come up with this on your own so yes I started it because of my new diet with Sam calivita you know I had to eat super clean I wanted low sugar and I wanted something that was low sodium or no sodium so that when I'm cutting weight I can still use it but we make our own sea salt organic sea salt as well so that we can add it to when we want to you know so that I need sodium you need good sodium yeah but when I'm wanting to flush the water I don't I don't now you sent me over a bunch of stuff it's great mom thank you i used a lot of it yeah things and meet with it all the time yeah yeah why just used it last night I mean it's not like I'm actually used I'm actually into the company and like it you know that's cool especially for a wild game and things like that it's cool man it's really really fun do you do you have a pellet grill do you cook with I do I have a trigger those things that shit yes they send me one of those those bad with those badass ones I have a 71 to Timberline yes you got the thermometer everything with it tasting the best - well it's all wood it's natural wood for people don't know what a pellet grill is and there's a bunch of companies to make real good ones we have out back we have a Yoder that's really good I had a Green Mountain grill that's a really good company the Green Mountain grills are very affordable - and they come also with a built-in thermometer just like the trigger yeah what you do is you you pour wood pellets and these pellets are made like if someone makes a table like this the natural the sawdust from the an actual table is they just compress it and the natural sugars and the sawdust force it to form into these little pellets these like little tubular pellets and you can snap them with your fingers you know but they they go through this worm drive onto a heating element and it's just fire and wood that's all it is your your cooking your food with fire and wood I mean it's all complicated and electronic and shit and it's all sophisticated and engineered but at the end of the day the result is fire and wood and the food tastes like fire and wood yeah that's great that's why they like they have different pellets for different tastes and you can taste the difference absolutely I love pellet such a big fan it's just an easy way to cook - and that that timber line just maintains its temperature perfectly you could start it with your phone connected to your phone so if you want to heat it up before you get home you can start heating it up Tracy Letts analogy they have an app like I was gonna cook lobster tails like I don't cook she tells me trigger go to the fucking app told you tells you what to have what ingredients how to do it all of it on your phone it's fucking incredible yeah oh that's cute you went for the house I'll take it I have room thank you sir so you didn't get it you didn't get an elk tag this year oh man well I I have a going with Chad Mendes for rifle but where he was going Oh Colorado all right I don't know exactly the area we're going to something set up through fins and feathers this company's a guide service he's living the life man he is like even told after his loss phase like I'm not fighting them until next year you know it's hunting season my business like he loves it and he's he's awesome he's a good dude see him come back and come back with a beautiful knockout yeah good yeah yeah I mean that's still one of my very close friends and so we're doing a hunt here in end of October 2 for rifle but my love's archery so yeah I didn't get our tree tag this year for for for elk can you hunt with your bow in during rifle season I think you can yeah yeah think about rifle season as though you're dealing with they're not run not run like right now we had a video of being up in Colorado like just 20 yards from two big elk fighting they didn't even know I was standing up there least your was standing I didn't even know they were there yeah you know just 20 yards away that's why that's why you get to do archery during the rut season you know yeah dude I'm like just that's I live for it I love it so much it's to me to me it's like it makes me so happy that I have my meat for a year yeah you know you shoot an elk basically have meat for you and for all my friends now I've gotten all my friends it's like Bryan Callen and all these guys addicted to elk Tom papa I give them pounds of it now I'm just constantly giving them elk sausage and elk steaks and it's like once you taste that natural wild meat you go oh man I'm just learning how much healthier it is for your tail you know do you feel different when you eat it I thought it ever eaten I grew up that way so I grew up hunting because my dad my dad's been archery hunter has a wild man I met your dad yeah he's out right away okay I'll come meet you mr. dosoo yeah he's I just I mean he's always been the baddest dude have ever known he's always just his game he's taking them on crazy hunts where we'll hike her ass off go hike 20 miles and and work work really hard hunt public land like it's never been the easy thing it's always been as hard as we can make it alright um it's made me really like fall in love with hunting even more those backcountry Huntsman people are starting to catch on to what an adventure that is yeah and you know these guys like my friend Aaron Schneider who runs Cafaro so one of the best backpack companies in the world they make hunting backpacks and wilderness backpacks and it's like you used to be able to go eight miles down the trailhead and there would be nobody it was now you go there there's three tents yeah you know it's because other guys are learning how to do this too and they're realizing this especially high country mule deer which is insanely difficult animal to hunt they're so switched on because everyday they're running for mountain lions every day is like that mountain lion is that amount line bulls that brain you're super smart sketched out there so sketched out when you get to five year old deer you know which is what everybody wants to shoot what they want to shoot is a four five and older deer you're getting this giant deer they're probably 300 pounds they have enormous antlers I mean do mule deer have these crazy racks all knotted up yeah knotted up crazy and they they've been hunted since day one yeah Oh five years it's like a fighter who's been fighting at a championship level five years like you ain't getting away with no sloppy I'll shit with him you can't snap on branches and they don't notice you're there they fucking turn on Colonel as well yeah yeah I've days before opening day and saw through two three-pointers and a big four pointer right in the area I'm gonna go hunt and then ten days later I go out cuz I missed opening day but uh ten shows like I know ten days ago after they're gone yeah they're nocturnal they hide and they just realize that people are after them they've they've been doing it so long that hunting season is literally like factored into their journals like their DNA ligase realize oh well there's the people I know what this is you know they go I know what this is time to get the fuck out of here I'll eat at 2:30 I'm sick of it yeah yeah they'll get they'll just especially during full moons and things like that it's really interesting man it's once you experience these I mean even if you're not into hunting but if you always advise people just please just go hiking deep into the backcountry just take take off six seven mile hike deep it in the backcountry and just it'll put it in perspective for you like those two nap days I spent in Colorado I hiked probably 20 miles by myself with no one and I didn't get anything I don't even seen any well I found one drop horn of an elk I didn't see shit you know and I still loved it I still came I was like I'm glad I did it you know yeah hike my ass off was out there my cell phone didn't work it's just when you go out there do you bring a spotting scope yeah she brings back oh yeah spotting scope by nose the whole dish finder yeah you know you looking at Google Earth in advance or I'm looking at I was tapping onyx hunt yes haze onyx hunt yes kind of like download area rats you showed your where's public where you can even download the app to when you don't have service you can still yes it knows where you're at right you know like if you're on private property if you're on public land it like maps everything out for you that way yeah that thing that's an amazing app but just being able to see the territory and know where the basins are and the ridges are holes yeah and get a sense like okay what time of year is it I mean it's it's there's it's not just going out to get food there's a there's really like a science to mule deer hunter and what the weather's been like it's been hot they're gonna be high country they're really high if it's been hot yeah you want it to be like overcast and cool so it'll come out one during the day cuz they'll bed down when it's hot they bed down all day long and that's why they come a nocturnal as well as it it's cool enough for them to expend energy to go get food yeah where if you go in the middle they at 12 o'clock you you have to spot them with your by nose laying down and hopefully sneak up on them and know let him see you or wait for them to get up and start feeding and then sneak up on you now when you go out there are you do you have the creeks mapped out or you hauling in water how you getting water um I always take those pills with me to build a purify water purified the wine tablet yes iodine tablets see you're not supposed to drink too much of that though I'm sure you're not but I don't hunt right me for seven you know I mean worst-case scenario at least I'm not going to go out there and get Giardia and get lost like I'm gonna be liquor if I some water and I have a lighter well I don't have a I don't have I have a canteen so I would melt but anyways to heat it up yeah really heat it up but yeah I know where the water holes are I always know that and I bring enough water for me to to drink and I pack it into camp - I'm luckily this pot and Colorado wasn't very far from where I'd to park my truck so I was able to drive in a bunch of water mmm oh that's cool yeah yeah it's my dad though we hike back in the Rubies like 20 miles and then hunt back there hopefully not finding anybody like he said you still find people yeah but yeah we have to bring the iodine pills or we have a pump and then we pumps are great obviously we packed in pots and we boil it mm-hmm drink usually we use usually boil it back at camp but if you're out and about your life or canteen on it you'll fill it out throw it iodine pill in it and shake around and ten minutes later you got clean water yeah you don't want any that beaver fever no especially being 20 my rough 20 miles out they go mad that would suck yeah it's um it's beautiful country though man I mean to be able to go out there into that backcountry or Colorado Colorado where there's no people yeah just realize it doesn't even look real looks like you know you find like a mountain lake up there beautiful pictures you take don't look like you I can just come off the internet yeah yeah that's on you man I mean these are you pick I don't ever hunt though yeah yeah I need to I'm sure I have as to some mistakes at his house for the last camp actually so yeah we got this from the Kingston coffee Gary Martin also yeah okay so yeah do you fall I have actually when I'm in California with him Sam's family makes me the same meals why not the same exact same but I ate the same notes as him and I usually pretty clean - when I did my hair analysis with Sam all my levels the stuff came back pretty good I was pretty pretty baseline or healthy for the most part are you training or just training people do you train yourself yeah I so trying to stay sharp you know I got lead by example and I love it so that's where I've done since I was eight you know sorry with the kyoko-chan karate and just been honest and since and when he comes of the training lab and throws the gear on a holes mitts for me come on like he just did like three hours of holding mitts you know like he's getting a workout doing that shit just the impact and I don't just stand there either right guy I've got to give him the feel and the reactions and throw back and I get to play UFC a little bit without getting beat up so it's fun to still again live vicariously through these guys but I still definitely do train and again lead by example and stay sharp have you ever thought about one day I mean you you're in a weird situation where you could potentially go to 45 and you could potentially go to 25 mm-hmm when you could be champ champ champ my coach already liked it when I first started working out with Sam and I was fighting Cody the first time he's like I'm gonna make you a three division champ it's like that's our goal won't you be the first one ever to do it he's always like reaching for that you know everything and the way I know I could do it too is is because I can pack the weight on with him too you know I've gotten up to 158 pretty solid before I went under 35 is the first time max Holloway who's the UFC 145 pound champion is a fucking big guy I I don't think so eventually he's probably 355 er yeah I don't know how he does it when when they had a medically stopped him from cutting weight to make 55 when he's a 45 pound champion oh wow he started in around 85 pounds oh Jesus how crazy is that take it big to man big he's a baby as well yeah these 45 pounders right now look I wish there was a way to stop all this nonsense I wish everybody did it the way you're doing it where you're just a little bit overweight you know have you ever been heavier before we had a cot never sit has always been your weight yeah now and I good thing too is that I always train at the weight I'm gonna be in the nighttime I fight so if I weigh in at 135 s I'm gonna be 150 when I walk in the cage so I train at 150 when I'm gonna fight 25 s I'll probably walk in the cage weighing like 140 or low low 40s I'm gonna train at low 40s you know and that's why my camps are longer I get in shape before I start my camp cuz I want to be I want to know exactly what that feeling is of what the night's gonna be of being in the cage I don't want to be in shape all my weight to be where it's supposed to be and so it's like the same exact feeling for my whole camp it's got to be satisfying for you to have all these changes take all these chances go through all this emotional shit with leaving alpha male but the results prove themselves that you were making the right choices for your career very satisfying I'm building my own my own everything you know it's all kind of fun in place and it's cuz I've surrounded myself with the right people I fall doing because I believed in him I came back to Southern California because I believe in Sam you know and there's guys like Steve Martin like I was talking about before that made that possible you know and there's just like these for whatever reason this group of guys that I've just gotten around it's just very synergistic and it works you know and so that's why I've been really focused on cuz I've been to a lot of gems that are money driven or you go driven and to make sure that's not the case so you might be an awesome fighter but if you don't have the right mentality you're not part of the trained lab you know you might be the best fighter in the world but if you're a cancer we're not gonna let you work out there and kind of really treat me like we're professional athletes you know I mean we I am treating like were professional athletes instead of before it was just a fighter well you have you seen that really across the board there's much more of an attitude of a professional athlete versus just some badass guy who wants to fight and kick ass and you're seeing people approach it much more scientifically now how much does that change since you were on The Ultimate Fighter a lot a lot of when I first like I said when I first got an Ultimate Fighter I was alpha male and we sparred four or five days a week and was that 2012 11 11 yeah 2011 and then it can't aired I think 2012 so you think about that that's not that long ago we're talking about six seven years so in seven years the sports radically changed big time Wow I mean I mean it's also because of how big the and how mainstream the UFC is getting you know we're gonna be on ESPN we're on Fox we you know we're from spike like the more and more mainstream gets the more like legit makes it and the more legit 'it is the more science behind it the more that like why wouldn't guys that are smarter same calivita go for football because there's money and there's like exposure behind it when his fighting was so raw and just like whatever I feel like since it's so legitimized those smart trainers and now the guys that were then fighting forever now coaches it just makes it more legit and you have more science and the ways to train behind it ya know it's it's really exciting but it's still growing and I feel like we're on the cutting edge of everything we don't we don't miss everything we don't miss anything like we're in the this is by far if any place I've ever trained the most scientific and smart way to train that's so exciting man it really is TJ's got a a bump in the martial art evolutionary chain as far as how many people were switching stances and having that fluid flow before TJ step in the cage not that many not that many leading the pack when we Tom switched his legs back and forth by attacks yeah it didn't he didn't fight the same way right E as he did left either way you do kind of like you've seen it now in boxing too like turns off returns Crawford who no hello come on Orthodox cuz he's right-handed but he's like I'm gonna do better against this guy southpaw and stay stop all the rest of the fight because he sees that advantage and being able to do that I mean boxers used to say like never switch your stance your defense won't be as good but now make it like this Marvin Hagler used to switch all the time you know he's in the greatest of all time and then the you know there's orthodoxes softball but then there's a whole world of things that you can do offensive and defensively during the change of the stance as well that's one thing to switch your stance into a fight better that stance but then what about the strikes while switching your stance yeah or in those crazy motions where I'm coming this way but you're over there I could fight it's almost like fighting two people at once mm-hm yeah create those angles and take advantage of them and they have to do the slow turn just they understand it's kind of thing you know ya know there's there's a fantastic advantage to fucking the matrix mapping out the killer shot MMA series and get a bunch of MMA flow drills going oh yeah I'm really excited about the switch down to espn2 yeah really excited about getting the UFC on ESPN I think it's a big deal ESPN is such a huge venue for sports and there's so many like just a sports fan I think sports it's ESPN sure and you think of like sports bars that have fights on I mean if they have they're gonna have ESPN on you know and this just this it means so many people just they just turn their TV on they put on ESPN and that's like all day long real sports fans they're gonna get a chance to see guys like you you know real high level fighters and ESPN has also been putting on real world championship boxing events which is very exciting there if they're gonna do that and then they're gonna start putting on real high-level championship UFC fights as well people gonna get a chance to compare and contrast and see like wow I think that's gonna open up a whole new world I think Fox was great yeah and all the but there's like what is it like 80 Fox Sports channels and no one knows which one the fuck it's on yeah there are a lot of fuck's channels right that's crazy yeah everywhere the four years ago when my Japan can win trips we went to a restaurant and they were showing some fights on TV and we lost her shit like holy shit they're showing fights on TV Japan so cool now it's out here all the time so you know Thank You Dana White 42 brothers you know the UFC for making it mainstream you know they're they and you as well mr. Rogan for having bringing martial arts to being so popular it is now it's like you guys have helped the evolution of martial arts come to come to life and it's fun it is fun and it's you know people are getting a chance to see where it's at right now which I don't think you know if someone hadn't seen a fight like you're by with Cody or your fight your first fight with Henan Bharat was a great example now your second fight was really like a blowout I fell like in the second fight he just he knew you were gonna fuck him up before the fight even started to evolve yeah he didn't evolve but if you see these high level you know world-class fights I think if people just got a look and what's what's going on right now at the top level they get hooked mm-hmm you know real quick well I mean you do a great job of teaching people you know the commentators as well as people involved in journalists of MMA need to teach the average fan what to look for ya know and I feel like you've done a great job you've helped our sport grow because of that of not only hyping the fights up but making people knowledgeable of MMA you know I need to teach the judges yeah the best job they're out there still yeah I mean I just don't understand what Commission's are waiting for I really don't I don't I don't get what's the hold up just these people are incompetent fire them get new people and it's not hard to do yeah I don't believe it's hard to do I think I think a motivated person could fix the entire system inside of me I don't feel like they're worried about their job if I made a bad decision like if I ruin your career if I still millions of dollars out of your pocket yeah understand that aspect you know that they doing people's career I don't think they care they're just doing their job and they think they're insulated Shaughnessy you know I don't have a job they have to be accountable because they serve a name you know their name gets you know you know a delay bird scored the fight but about and you hear that so they're accountable somewhat and then people hear certain names and they're like oh not this fucking guy because you know that that guy's given some shitty ass decisions in the past but yeah it's not enough and if you just left it off to if you ran it through a computer and looked at all the bad decisions and all the the judges that call these bad decisions and create them like an uber driver hey just get rid of them does anyone who just gets a deer below just get rid of them you really know anyone who gets below an a you know I mean people are gonna make some questionable subjective decisions some people like a submission game some people like a striking game some people big some people think that guy takes you down no matter what he's on top you win yes well I feel like well they said it sooner matter as much now but if you take down you have no damage like take down need even count yeah which I believe in because it's really whose win in the fight not like the position we're in right then even maybe in a wrestler like I could take people down just waiting for me on top but that's not how any anime should be scored no I agree and I think that if a guy does some damage standing up and then you take him down and hold him down for a full minute but nothing happens he did more damage standing up and there's a lot of judges to think if you take someone down you're on top you win and they can't think that way it's just it's not wise especially when guys are battling off submissions off their back and or getting busted up with elbows from their back I mean there's just did you see Nico prices fight where he won from his back oh yeah with the chocolate the foot and yeah hammer fished him that was to them okay knocked him out it was one of the who who did he fight I don't remember who that was yeah I get excited soon yeah fought off off his back won by hammer fist okay it's like we're realizing there's you're not really safe and there's there's things that people can figure out what to do and weird different places you find a way to be successful yeah I just as much enthusiasm as you have about the sport and of you and myself and a lot of other fans I want the judges to have that kind of enthusiasm as well yeah I want them to go into these fights knowing what they're looking at here it is right here oh like right before that does it show it look please oh wow from his back hammer fist some unconscious Wow fucking crazy yeah I've never seen that before in my life me neither and that's something that I don't know if you would see that in the curriculum or not but the opportunity in that position it's a good place to be when guys start seeing it happen they're gonna go for it yeah you're gonna see fighters go for that well the Travis brown you know that elbow oh yeah from defending the takedown Travis started kalyan people he killed Josh Barnett Kayode Gabriel Gonzaga same way yep he flatlines people from that position those long-ass crazy okay different alpha brain than I do what do you mean you're sharp I think you might have some stronger alpha this is his job job his job is it the stuff alpha bring turbo that we're working really yeah is he here now no I have it in my house was it just just a stronger version yeah it's got some extra shit in it that's not about that a couple years ago yeah week our original alpha brain was giving people headaches we have adjusted along the way some people well it's it's a dose-dependent thing and it's also there's people that get headaches and a drink caffeine and see but they can't drink milk you know there's a lot of biological variability but what this is is a more potent version of alpha brain we're pushing the boundaries a little bit so we're gonna run some tests on it and so we've got some trials and I've been taking it send me a couple I'll test it for you yeah it works it's got some deemed a little bit alpha brain you know what I really like to I've talked about this before is neuro one it's bill Romanowski company he's got a great nootropic supplement I'd like it to taste good too I drink the chocolate I feel like building one when asking out the way I walk around with all my supplements and stuff he's got like a tackle box of them I do man like when I travel now it's like I have a whole suitcase full of supplements do you really yeah like no matter where you go yeah so even if you're on like a couple day road trip somewhere you're bringing all yourself once with you yeah I have those divider packs you don't have to have like three of them right you don't fuck around even though I'm a hunting trip really oh yeah man Wow eat clean yeah I do busted in those mountain house fucking fettuccine alfredo here drink those fries drive the like farts are so bad though but once you once you've been like so clean you know how it feels and then after your fight you eat like a fucking asshole for a week yeah it's like dude I gotta stop I gotta stop this shit like I feel I feel depressed I feel horrible I got to get back into eating clean you know it's like much time did you take off after the Kody fight the second one food nutrition wise like a week maybe maybe like one hard but even then it's just like not the whole day it's just like I'll have one bad meal I'm like like wanting a pizza cuz you know you shouldn't have it like looking at that pizza go fuck it we're going in yeah well now it's I never used to be a sweet tooth but now it's sugar it's desserts like I used to be more like eat more pizza like whatever it could be but now since I haven't been eating sugar I want to drink a soda I want a donut regular so regular soda when I drink a regular soda the first thing I think I can't believe people drink this Oh people drinking this shit all day long I know because I don't drink it so when I drink it my body's like what the fuck are you doing stupid like I had a mountain Dew after the fight right I feel like hungover the next day it's weird that your tolerance drops too yeah if you don't eat sugar anymore and then you take it in the first thing that happens to me like I'll have an ice cream sundae I just have to sit down oh dude the sugar is the root of all evil man yeah it's so bad yeah body high doses yeah like you know people that walk around with 2-liter Pepsi and just chug on I mean how many fucking servings are in a two-liter Pepsi and some people drink that whole thing in a day easy like you see the truck drivers on them just just filling their arteries was black lacking all that fat gut fat just the lower abdominal fat pushes into your balls so does that all right like the stupid busy BS noticed those ones taste good those are sea views are great yes I drink those all the time I feel free yes the difference between them and a Diet Coke in terms of flavor I actually like them better yeah but I drink diet coke down like it's kind of fucking taste like chemicals yeah yeah whereas Eva it just tastes like a good flavor but it doesn't make you feel like shit you don't there's no glycemic index there's no change in your sugar levels you just taste good it almost feels like there's no way it's there's no sugar in it you know yeah yeah this stuff stevia is an interesting thing because too much of it it tastes like shit yeah it's got a weird aftertaste right yeah you got a it's so potent you just need like a touch yes but when you put it in your coffee like I'll put it in there like sugar you know ruff what other stuff does he have you eating that you weren't eating before is there any like concentration on like different kinds of greens or do i juice like crazy now and you're juicing mostly green stuff a lot of it I mean there's a do you blend or you know I juice I do a masticating juicer a cold-pressed juicer yeah you gotta because if it's something fast like a blender it kills a lot of the nutrients really you absorb more that so even if you were just to eat this giant table of raw food mm-hmm you would absorb less of it than if you juiced it really why is that because it goes running your bloodstream something about how your body breaks it down yeah so some about the cold-pressed juice is is your body's absorbing it more so I mean that's that's like a half - even when I'm traveling AMA juice trying to buying in which room is good but I have to drink some sort of green juice every day mmm and are you taking it with any kind of fat because what I heard about especially with vegetable juice that your body absorbs it better with fat yeah like with coconut oil or avocado oil or something like that yeah we that we do yes we have to do a certain certain kindness MCT oil i take they have tablespoons in the day and i to help absorb not only that but then the ubiquinol goes with it to help me rebuild red blood cells and do a bunch what does ubiquinol it's also some sort of oil I take him in a pill but some sort of like oil that helps with the transport chain of couldn't even tell he's good I don't think it's salmon here he'd be he'd probably try to hold back I would get him in here dude you should be very interesting but I almost don't want you to cuz that's where all my secrets man there's people that just wouldn't listen anyway yeah that's true there's so many people that would they would listen oh it wouldn't really follow it but it's a full-time fucking job though you know I mean like you can't be lazy and you do Sam shit I can't imagine how you could be it seems like you have to be on top of all the time I don't have time in the day to do all this shit that he has been doing as well as training so do you take the MCT oil with the green juice oh you can or just take it and for people don't know what that is a medium change right this triglyceride oil is derived from coconut oil so it's a the more nutritious form of coconut oil so you you can take it what it was explained to me was that you're better off when you're taking something that's neutral dance as juice cold-pressed juice that you really should take it with a fat and then it'll help your body absorb the nutrients better and I don't know yeah you never told us that okay but maybe I'm wrong I don't know I mean he didn't matter he doesn't know everything when I take kale shakes I always add either coconut oil or why I usually at both coconut oil and MCT oil - I mean I think that's not bad for you so why not you know yeah I don't know if it's better or not but I know it's not bad for you yeah now um what is your ratio like fats to protein do you know what that is or does he map all that stuff maps all that out and depending where I'm at and how my body's recovering but yeah I'm high fat high protein diet you know load a no carb obviously different kinds of carbs I I have to have carbs but just the like I won't be ketogenic but I'll get my brother into ketosis certain times throughout my camp right make me insulin like sensitivity high right so I'll eat like simple carbs that break down faster you know they found that people even on this carnivore diet which a lot of people are doing now they still reach ketosis and still reach ketosis because they're not taking any grain they're not taking in any carbohydrates and even though your body converts protein through gluco Genesis they couldn't converts it into sugars into glucose it's it's doing it in a very efficient way and processing in a way that a lot of these people are in ketosis all the day most of times it's not not the same like high levels if you were going like a regular ketogenic diet I think it's supposed to be 70% fat or something crazy or 60 something percent fat and then the rest protein well did you tell Jordan Peter's than that isn't eat no meat yeah G no meat I don't I think and I had his daughter on recently as well and it's very controversial particularly for his daughter because his daughter is giving paid nutritional consultants --all tation which doesn't really have a background in nutrition but she's just showing people what really has worked for her and her her experience in her background I think her and her father Jordan I think he has a serious autoimmune issue like serious and I think it's very possible there are some people amongst us that are allergic to almost everything well they have allergic reactions to all kinds of different foods I think it's really really rare I think for most people like you are you're really better off eating rich dark green leafy vegetables and and nuts and and fish and chicken and wild game and you know I think if you get some wild turkey or some you know wild pheasants and you should eat really good lean healthy real food I think most people can eat apples and oranges and watermelon and there's no problem but I think there are a few people amongst us and I think Jordans one of them where his body just fucking rejects things I think he gets his body has terrible reactions to all these different things and going on an all meat diet has cured his depression got him off on antidepressants for the first time in more than two decades oh wow it reduced his weight back to the weight it was when he was 25 years old I just don't think it's a viable or intelligent diet for everyone masses yeah yeah I just think it's it's a good diet for people that are very extreme and in their their nutritional requirements because they have some serious autoimmune issues if you have autoimmune issues you should definitely go towards keto yeah you know Sam's got rid of my psoriasis I didn't even know you could get rid of it but got rid of my psoriasis with my diet I mean they say it could be from the stem cells too but I believe it's from I mean I did so much stuff but yeah well I know several people that have got rid of their psoriasis through that I think Jordan is actually one of them as well okay he had psoriasis and this right he also had some serious gum disease that he was having for his whole life gone as soon as he got in this carnivore diet and it's just I mean he's he just eating beef that's it yeah I mean literally he drinks drinks water he needs beef that is it like you would think should I help Brock lesner got hurt right well as the savior's Brock got diverticulitis anthony bourdain told me that sometimes people get diverticulitis from all sorts of reasons from like eating you could have a seed like a fucking some seed from some plant that you ate gets stuck somewhere in your lining it gets infected and you can get diverticulitis from that he said diverticulitis can come from a lot of different things I think Brock probably wasn't even chewing I think he was probably swallowing animals my dog out in the wild we're having fucking Gophers and shit and just Chuck screaming naked oh yeah I'm really bummed out that the WWE ever had him I really feel like if Brock Lesnar had just gone from andressa wrestling dude he was a beast I'm conscious he's a beast and if he just completely dedicated himself to mixed martial arts from the jump I mean he's already look he knocked out Randy Couture he battered Frank Mir I mean he submitted Shane Carwin he already has an incredible resume for a guy that was a WWE star a multi-millionaire star before he ever fought his first MMA fight yeah just such a savage it was just beating inside of his heart so bad that he wanted to do it but came in and did it really did it lost to Cain lost to fucking Overeem I mean beat mark hunt even though Mark Hunt says he was cheating seems he might been correct [Laughter] went on a rant today about about Brock Lesnar oh really call him a cheat and piece of shit yeah it's mad that he's coming back to the UFC he's got he's got like a legit claim yeah for sure he does I mean Brock's only fought the top of the top he's never fought like a warm-up fight he's never came in had a woman won't fight you know I don't watch WWE but they say shrinking oh you saw it is about to commence oh they're gonna testing pool take me knocking on your door he already is that's why he's getting smaller they're not gonna in your door six o'clock in the morning that's the problem when you fight hunt right here there was the sensation we wasn't gonna be tested or something yeah there was some weird loophole also he retired and when you come back you're supposed to be go through like a four-month testing before even allowed to accept a fight and they waived that for month of testing and they started like so he was getting tested once he came back but he didn't have to have that four month of testing without having a fight mm-hmm from what I heard and you saw her yeah yeah well you saw it was changed the game kids changed the game yeah and I look better than I did back then yeah looking better like it's awesome man I'm the the professionalism and that's going around like over on our spots just it just made me continue I'm I've always been hungry but I just can't like the science behind it and being able to go three different weight classes and being real and just me being the baddest man on the planet has got me in like ready to go you know like that's the only photos they have before and after and I find a better one I try that pull that one up again I didn't see much difference there anybody pull that up Jamie anybody who stands or sits the way Brock is sitting on the one of the linear the ways arms are spread wide no matter what he's gonna be big yeah he's still gonna be 265 fucking pounds yeah okay well there you kind of get it yeah yeah sighs definitely but he's gonna keep a lot he's definitely gonna lose a lot the thing that's gonna fuck with his head if anything does is when you are on steroids for a long time or anything that jacks up your endocrine system the way Worth and we're assuming he did when it's old he's already gotten caught a lawyer you're assuming he did his endocrine systems got to be struggling and he's 40 years old now I mean it seems only 40 yeah nothing he must not even be 40 he might be 39 how old is Brock Lesnar but he's 49 or 39 in Viking years age different yeah 41 41 41 yeah close enough he's got to get in now I can yeah yeah so what do you think you did that elevated your testosterone I think my recovery so not redlining my body all the freaking time I try to train too hard like I always went too hard I always wanted a new more I'm my old-school wrestler like more is better more is better try not know so my recovery big time listening to my body this nutso by your heart rate variability when you're sleeping it'll tell you when you wake up how recovers you are and how hard you should push it that day so being the CEO of TJ Dillashaw and deciding say if I even if it's on the schedule I'm gonna go hard the next day but I wake I'm not recovered call everyone like hey man I'm not coming in today I gotta go walk around with the family I'm not training taking it off so they do know how many heartbeats difference but it's not it's not the heartbeat it's how variability so sometimes your heart your heart shouldn't just beat everyone every second it should be like point eight one point four seconds like all like so like so you're said it will tell you that your central nervous system is not worn out mm-hm so when you're getting sick or you're overworked your body will tell you from your rate that you're that it's about to happen you know if you can catch it if you don't listen to it you just keep going like you go down this deep hole you'll never come out of you know but if you catch it right away you no matter what your body is always gonna do peaks and valleys mhm but you want your Valley to be lower and your peace to keep getting higher but I would belly low keep getting higher I'm the way to do that is through your recovery which is gonna help your testosterone production your growth hormone production when you're sleeping as well as my supplementation what aminos I'm taking and why and when I'm taking them you know the Arjun is at 21 blend aminos like I'll take them all different times and when you take them usually three times a day sometimes I'll take certain things at nights and things in the morning depending on what it's supposed to do for me like my ornithine my glycine in my tryptophan I take a knife or I go to beg help my just on my growth hormone boost things I'll take during the day because it's better for my energy system ITB production yeah so he's just got all this mapped out for you yeah man that's amazing yeah he's how many people could he possibly do that for though he would have to teach other coaches to do it you know he does like a mentorship where coaches would come in and they would train underneath them you know I'm right then hopefully stay with us yes that's the thing like if you teach them on too much they can go do whatever they want and they can have this the science eventually it'll get out to where you know you're gonna see the tests you know you're gonna see what he's doing and people are gonna want to come and learn how to do it and for heart rate variability do you sleep with a chest strap and a wristwatch that registers it you don't have to have the wristwatch on but as long as it's close enough to register your heart strap what are you using which which one I'm using tone or suit was it Suunto son don't oh yeah okay that's they make hunting watches as well yeah oh yeah they make awesome honey watch the best yeah GPS track news everything I use one of those yeah those are great and then so what do you do do you take data from that and you put it on a PC like he's got an algorithm it's why yeah what went from that I can't say my watch is connected to my phone okay and then Sam is logged in you watch is physically connected to your phone or it's through an absolute tooth through boot that's an app yeah so that so the app shows you yeah the app I can put my information and it sends it straight to Sam's computer so every morning he checks in the morning he logs in gets your data mine he's got a list of people that he checks you know in depending where they're at right now I'm not doing it obviously I don't need to track my recovery but when I'm in camp he's tracking my recovery and he'll let me in the note in the morning like look man you're 84% recovered this was pick it up or you're 20% you need a chill you know right you'll decide so Mike my week-to-week you have an idea what its gonna be but it always changes how many times do you think on these days where you looked at the results and said okay I'm taking the day off would you have just said don't be a pussy and push through this shit oh yeah I would've easily I mean I don't feel that bad right then the next my next training practice like damn I fucking feel good I'm primed ready to go you know and so is it hard to do that too let's take your foot off the gas even in the past when I've read lend my body and didn't know the science I've been had to pull back but now that I know it it's it makes it easier for me to do it but it's still very hard it's still very hard to not do more not do more yeah my dad's taught me work your fucking ass off we're gonna work hard work harder than the next guy you know but work hard when you're working no one did not work yes I think that's applies to life too I really do I think you just burn it out all the time just like I was saying if like it was your sole focus was fighting I'd burn myself out I have to have these escapes yeah I have to be able to do other things out to enjoy family time I have to go golfing I have to go hunting I have to get on the lake yeah and even during fight camp so I have I used to be like fight camp was fight camp that's all I did right but now going with Sam and having these days off I get to spend more family time I get to actually do shit I like on certain days like I have two days off a week and we spread them out at different times sometimes I might have three sometimes I might have more to pay if I'm getting sick or if I'm overworked but I guess I get to go do shit I get to go wakeboard you know that's nice yeah now is there anything else that he's got you doing this weird that we haven't liked doing any Eastham are you doing anything I mean it's always changing we're getting really big into like the extra recovery stuff the kryos the the light therapy the sivak machines the excuse me hyperbaric chambers when to do them and how to test everything everyone was always known they're good for you but I don't feel like there's been the exact numbers behind it and now he's gonna track it kind of things we're getting more into that realm of it I use an all-too lab that helps with me getting my hypoxic state to do altitude training to where I'm breathing in that for an hour a day and that's you know I'm going anywhere like 40,000 feet you know but there's always like certain like blanks you could do it for you have to take like it's like for instance like doing like six minutes on four minutes off or three minutes on three like in tracking what my body is doing the next day what else we're doing obviously my diet supplementation we talked about I mean just a crazy workout stuff he's got us doing - you know like I said it's kind of like rocky training but it's a shit ton a core work and his warmup is not a warm-up his one of his usually everyone else's workout he's pushing us to our lactate threshold to where like you want to throw up you're done and then we're doing muscular endurance you know so we're not doing any kind of strengthening until I've pushed that limit so maybe I've hit hard ground pound you know when you stand up you have muscle pump and you can't go mm-hmm you don't have that anymore because you're used to your lactate threshold is higher now so if my lactate threshold is higher then I'm not going to be able to push myself to where I have that that pump you know and so get to that point so you know what it feels like right so mentally if I ever get to that point to fight I'll be okay because I've been there as well as when you get there and you work out past it a smart way then it's gonna increase your lactate threshold and you're locked it took you longer to get to that point so when you're doing strength and conditioning work you're you're exhausting yourself before you're doing strength work not always but yes yeah some summer workouts aren't as hard as others but yeah the ones that work I couldn't say but the hardest I've ever worked out my entire life was the that kind of shit Wow yeah to where you think like even specially like when I first started doing it but I nice does good work out yeah good job all right well mo silver let's hit that what's hit the garage were lifting you know we're hitting the worst so damn he's rough dude now my girl just called me I need to go coach Sam yeah I know a strangling day and I always pull up and like I see the stop sign right before I turn left to get to his house my fuck I could just keep going I don't have to turn left I don't have to go but if you're in the garage and you continue to come back your sick' you like this shit now how do you organize that strengthing auditioning days and what precedent like how what importance is strengthened conditioning take over skill work like an how do you organize that that's something that still is always gonna have to be developed depending on person to person who needs more skill right and who's obviously you never have it completely but some people need more skill training than others and if you're getting in there like when I first started MMA I pression and done string conditioning for a year and a half I should only done skill because I needed to catch up I'm to the point now where each camp changes with technique and obviously gonna continue to grow and that's why my camps are so long called do more skill outside of camp time and more getting my body ready I don't know if I'm answering your question but you are just it always changes you don't want to burn yourself out that hard and then spar that's something I feel like we're even even learning with Sam still too like he obviously is a wrestler and he knows training and you know strain conditioning and that's why was this know our heart rate and that's why every coach is and that's nothing to is it and our team every coach is gonna talk to each other they're all on the same page we know like they know what days are gonna be off like no one's gonna show up to the gym today if they do we're gonna go light because we pushed it yesterday it's never gonna be like the stringers and coach's job is to kill you now you're gonna in wrestling he's gonna kill you too like we're all in the same schedule so we know that may win days are our active recovery so if you're gonna go into practice you're just drilling you're moving like you're not going hard because you got killed the day before mmm so when you're at your peak as hard as days your neck stays either off or an active rest day do yoga go do some yoga get your mind off inner and does he have your weeks planned out in advance or does he doing it day to day like how is he when do you know what you're going to be doing I don't know but you know he plans out everything in advance and obviously whole camp my whole life does it dude he's like my life coach man like even after this phase ik all right what's not changed a diet I don't want just rice to come back I don't want to work from Ground Zero I want to like stay this we can keep building so he's like my life coach you know like I feel like I'm cheating on him when I'm eating a cheeseburger he's got the whole camp planned out my whole just continuing to grow and obviously it'll vary depending on my recovery yeah now with this ESPN deal I know they're planning on some pretty big events right did they have they talked to you about fighting on ESPN not yet no no I mean obviously being a champion wanna be pay-per-view though yeah right that's what yeah yeah yeah I mean that's where it comes down to you actually you're you're betting on yourself you know when you fight live TV it's it's it's you get a lot of viewers you build your name right but when you have these paper reviews you're you're betting on that people want to watch you because you're you you know and I've just continue to fight my fucking ass off and and go ham you know it's gonna be my style I'm always gonna go pedal-to-the-metal when I fight looking for knockouts because that's my entertain that's how I'm entertaining like yeah sure I'll maybe talk confidence and talk trash I'm gonna fuck you up you know but I'm not gonna go out and be the colbys you know I'm not even go crazy personality I want to be a little I mean I know it's fun it's awesome we like those guys but I want to be look back on my career and like show my kid like look that's who I was like I fucking stay myself I stay my true color I'm an open fucking book i telled whatever it is you know but I wanted to be like the chocolate ldaes you step out there and fucking knock someone out you get love for it you know like the real kind of gladiator shit well it's definitely building for you now you know I mean there was a lot of negative energy that was coming your way when you left alpha male and when you there on the Ultimate Fighter there was some negative shit that was coming your way but it seems like with every victory like all that stuff is going behind you and now now it's really obvious you made the right choice I don't know I can Cody out twice in a row yeah I didn't want to do the Ultimate Fighter they asked me he's like hey uh so I was like I'm on my fucking title fight like I'm gonna needing it for a while you know I've been begging for it and then obviously they're gonna give me Cody but okay we want you to coach told to my fighter first I was like fuck of course I gotta go coach against alpha males like the last thing I wanted to do I knew all this shit was gonna be fucking crazy and so I didn't want to do it but I wasn't gonna say no cuz that's my shot at the title you know and I'm fuckin so glad I did it because I got to show my true colors I got to show how much I care about the sport how much I got to be a martial artist teach the way that me and Dwayne kind of do things very professional let them be fucking assholes and then come around and have it bite him in the ass you know like it worked out perfect for me because we got to show what really is is what it was like it was a good opportunity it was a good opportunity to showcase how to handle those situations you get to be your own judge the more evidence you have in front of you get to be your own judge of what actually happened rather than Uriah and Cody running their fucking mouth of of me leaving me being a trader me doing this me taking peds compared to what's actually going down you know what I mean like you get to be the judge yourself on who I am you know so the more you get to know I mean that's why she look at the more you get to find out about me the more you get to know me did you and Cody talk after the fight at all no no I mean I shouldn't show respect to him and like I never had a problem with Cody when we are not familiar ever like I feel like kind of feel bad for the guy cuz this wasn't any of his drama you know like he was coming to the team when I was kind of on my way out you know he just started I was holding it for me just got in the UFC because we didn't have a coach because Dwayne left right so I'm I'm running the kickboxing classes Dwayne left I'm the only one left there to coach practices so I'm holding mitts for him and stuff like that and then I get the ultimatum and I leave and then he becomes champ and now it's like all this pressure from Uriah and team alpha-male to talk shit must be the rivals to him was weight on his shoulders and that fucking sucks I mean I feel like that's a big flag to have to carry rather than just carry your own flag you know carry carry what you care about carry your own fucking flag instead of like damn I got all my team that are on my back like that's a lot of pressure you know yeah I think for him like he really felt like that team and that family environment is what he needed yeah that really I mean he said alpha-male saved his life it meant a lot to him yeah and well he should have thought that martial arts saved your life you know what I mean like yeah the team it's awesome other teams have like even like we have a team now I say be individualized but it's really good to have a team because you you guys - the same shit together it's good to have friends that are doing the same shit like I can't only have average Joe friends because they don't know what it is to be me they don't know what that what should I have to do to be the world champion so it's good to have those guys around you but really you got to know that martial arts is what's gonna steer you in the right direction if I wouldn't had wrestling if I want to went to college with wrestling I would have fucking fucked shit up you know I just had that personality like I'm really glad that wrestling kept me grounded and then getting into martial arts and I'm a very addictive person I mean who knows what I'd be addicted to if it wasn't martial arts I'm exactly the same way at least I've found the right things to be addicted to I think that's important for so many kids I think there's so many young kids that are growing up and they have all this angst and you know they just they their bodies are anxious and they're filled with fuckin testosterone and they just yeah the kids want to break things I think if you could focus that into wrestling instead of giving them Ritalin yeah but in wrestle any kind of martial art you something it's just so good for their self-esteem and for just relieving that excess energy allow some seed more clearly think things through better it's just so good for them and unfortunately this you're seeing less and less of that with people today there's less and less martial arts in people's lives that's why I make a bunch of free videos and just lead by example you know like you asked me if I still train hell yeah I do like I love this and and again you can find you can find more like it's easier access of martial arts right now like doing Zane's online Academy for instance like you can get technique 24/7 go do it in your garage with your buddy you know hit a punching bag alright learn jujitsu online like you know I'm starting about even like the physical fitness part of training I'm starting my own my own Academy is well online tomorrow teach you not only the techniques behind it but how I get stronger at doing them how I get in better shape like a physical fitness part of it as well is there gonna be available probably it's less than a month hopefully beautiful yeah it'll be I mean you can get more information on now just on TJ Dillashaw com but yeah I'm gonna start an online kind of I'm actually meeting Duane not only coach me in the technique of martial arts but you know the way he's organized everything you know he's learn from boss I don't organize how to create a system I've kind of done the same thing you know I've not only legit the technique but the lifestyle you know I'm kind of running with that I'm running with that and I want to show be I'm not gonna because eventually I'm not gonna hold back and have any secrets I'm gonna tell everyone everything you know yeah and I want to start a champ camp I want to do like a very exclusive champ camp where it's like only ten people can come and you come and stay with me live at my house and Colorado go wakeboarding but then we also learn like the mental aspect of how I be how I think to be a champion how I eat how the technique I'm like what great and I want to pee because like what we need to do is lead by example right help out because that I can really feel like I can like let loose I can like tell you everything to where I I don't want to sit to tell everyone everything because I'm giving away my secrets that's who I am on so why I'm the best in the world but I love to teach and I love to do it and I feel like by giving them small like small groups and giving some intimate time doing a real champ camp is something I want to do as well and I want to start creating as a North Korea my places where we can have some fun too because I think fighting you got to have fun in this thing like you talking to Dolph Cerrone not too long ago and that guy has to have fun yeah if he's too much into them like the professionals of I'm just fighting then he's gonna fall apart you know yeah and so I want to teach you that I do that shit are my recovery serious like my nutrition serious like teach you how I Rick everything no secrets you know beautiful yeah but listen man the sport is exploding and one of the reasons was exploding is the guys the very top like you that are constantly
