come down had a hunting sometimes yeah man come down a lot of wild pigs out here Alexander Gustafsson ladies and gentlemen we're live good to see you buddy what's happening I'm good I'm good you are you just recovering from shoulder surgery yeah would you have done I was wrestling i wrestling practice I I got taken down believe it or not I got slammed and and I landed them I was I was like trying to post my arm and I was lamb so just felt something in my shoulder basically and didn't hurt at first I was trying to stand up and I thought it was just a mess in there and after that I went through spittle and from there I've been I've been I've been rehabbing a plate inside oh wow plate yeah I took it out now in like ended last year but I had a place for a couple of months yeah what was the extent of the injury nothing was broken what's more like the collarbone just just dislocated this look at ripped apart my shoulder so you had to put it back in put the plate on three screws down that's the first real injury I had for my whole career I had bruises they chase and all that but this is the first real as I'm probably not back but pull this thing right from my face they're so sorry yes under your Viking beards getting muffled so with their tendons torn or ligaments or ligaments and everything just torn apart Wow so they just stitched it all back together again put your weight in there yeah and now I just been I've been rehabbing I feel fine I'm hundred percent now so I'll be I'm training so how many months was it well this happened in August and took away the plate and the last last year and I've been rehabbing for a couple of months so yeah I have six months totally maybe oh yes I was when you grab the bow and you're pulling it back I'm like maybe I shouldn't have and do that that's like you know that that kind of movement is like about sign now I'm good I'm good I'm it's all good that bow was powerful long expect oh yeah it's no joke it's good that's great oh yeah yeah it's definitely good like back training if you wanted to work on those muscles there specific hundred percent yeah but so when you do that do you go through are you doing like platelet-rich plasma and all sorts of different therapies to try to accelerate the healing well not I had done I done I done my I done my physical rehab I've done a lot of like I don't know the in they were in English but a lot of action punctual a coupon yeah a lot of a lot of massage a lot of rehab and lived in small weights mm-hmm really boring stuff I hate that stuff I I had it so much but you just have to do it it's just tiny weights I started with that and then I just been increasing and not that's it well holding ask rehabbing you know obviously I'm a big fan of yours and I was very worried when after the clover Teixeira fight which I thought was like your masterpiece so fortunate thank you well it's just you've always been a very very good fighter but when you see a guy hit this new level and that's what I felt like you were in the glow over fight I was like Jesus Christ like that combination that you finished him off with was that was some video game shit it was just standing there it was just standing there I just yeah sure here's my uppercuts yeah epic I worked all night it was crazy but so then when I heard that you were injured after I'm like oh shit like you were just catching your stride it was this that's what I felt like like you said I had I had everything's go as such a flow in in training in in life generally everything felt really good and I'm angry I was motivated I'm very motivated but that at that time of threat that win and angler is a tough opponent and everything went so well and with the fight and everything and I felt really good and then this happened so so it was a big setback but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger I just kept working on it and and I just I just like I'm just I just look forward and I got a goal in my sight that's it well the one thing that is good about something like that is it really gives you time to pause and reflect and pay attention to all the other aspects of your game you're such a footwork heavy movement heavy guy as much as yeah well that's sir it's so unusual for a guy as tall and as big as you to be so agile and have so much footwork in movement I mean it must be a giant asset for you in fighting it is and for the Glover fight I could do that for ten rounds uh you know I wasn't tired at all I would just I did my thing and I was out of there I wasn't in sparkle I wasn't in his range right I did my thing again and I was out of there I could do that all night all night long and that's also a thing like you always had it but after if I really felt that this this is working this is my thing and this is what I'm gonna use and I'm gonna get better at it I'm gonna get better than everything the whole game but this is my this is my key thing this is it and I know movement in footwork if I fought DC like I fought like a follower I'll beat him I'll beam all day long I'm telling I'll beat him well it's a very close fight the first time you guys fought yeah but I still didn't I didn't do it enough I was I was in his pocket too much one of the things that I really liked about you Alex is that when you talk about yourself you're very hard on yourself you know like I'd like that one of the things that you said Z you're never satisfied this is the life of a high level athlete never satisfied never never I just I just wanted to improve all the time and I always been the guy always been that that person always had to take the hard way in stuff learning learning new stuff I've told it all the time take the new the hard way you know - I always had to take a beating first before a win and that that's that's husband and and that just make me stronger and and I got the firing menu scrolls yeah well you're still young I mean how old you know 31 not there that's young though I mean we sit consider how long you been fighting in the UFC I mean how old were you when you had your first fight in the UFC 21 20,000 cranes ten years no that's crazy ten years do you think about yourself as 21 fighting in the UFC like what well now its first like but I think it's it's 10 years 10 years it's always 10 years but it feels like it was yesterday I'm sure time runs and especially I'm taking this business because your life is it's all about the next fight it's always about planning for the next fight the next fight so Jays are just passing me right well you also have constant growth and improvement but it gets tested in these big jumps like every three times a year two times a year whatever it is your schedule that you're fighting on there you get these big tests and you get to find out how applicable everything the eve work done is yeah yeah that's that's how it is and you fit you feel after that test you just feel like what's next yeah what should I do next what's the what's the next improvement was that bust what's the next opponent where's the belt but stuff like that you know when you get off of like you had like one of the most spectacular fights with John Jones I mean down to the wire like as close as it gets and when you get out of a fight like that will you almost won the title against the greatest of all time like what is what is that feeling like and where do you go from there you know it was tough it was really tough because you know everybody was saying are you winning this fight winning this fight you had three rounds against him are you winning this fight like if it felt like like you said it was something it was just it was just right there at the goal line I you know I didn't really pass that go on line at all I just felt like that it was tough it was tough but but like now I'm sitting here now talking to you so big it's a really good experience for me and and you know our relay it's a good time for me the fight was well it's a highlight in my career for sure in my life for sure it was such a close fight when when the score cards are being tabbed and you you know you're just sitting there waiting for the decision did you think you had it you know I didn't know right I didn't know I did so much chaos could you even remember what had happened over the last five rounds I remember I remember I remember the I remember the fight and I got I remember almost at the whole fight but it was just john jones is such a beast he's he you know I'm telling you just for me John Jones winning over the John Jones is bigger than taking the belt I'm telling that guy's the guy is such a beast and and yeah what was the question no it's okay be express yourself that's fine I mean I agree with you he is a beast you know I'm very disappointed with all the stuff that's happened to him obviously and especially the most recent one which I really I really believe based on the evidence is a mistake I think I think he got a hold of something tainted because if they they tested him before that he was negative they tested him after that he was negative and what he tested for was such a minuscule amount there's no way it was yeah there's no way like according to Nowitzki and according to you sada according to like how they test people what whatever he consumed must have been an extremely small amount it wasn't an amount that would have had any benefit whatsoever in terms of performance performance-enhancing well they know the things so you know you know if just let you know expert handle that I don't know what to say I know for a fact that he's been in that same situation a couple of times this is not the first time so yeah you know it's well it definitely is a wild motherfucker haze he definitely does some shit he probably shouldn't do by a hundred percent man but I mean but the thing is it's so stupid because he's what it is he's he's the best guy pound-for-pound out there he's done things nobody else has done he's he's just a beast and still shit just comes up all the time he doesn't even need that steroids he doesn't even need that shit in him he's still the best guy out there I don't think he took anything I really don't but I agree with you on that and I think you need a guy like that you need a guy like that out there like to bring you to your full potential do you agree yeah I agree with you agree with you yeah no like I said you fighting him and beating him that's bigger than taking the belt right now that's how I film because he's look what it did to DC man yeah this is tough he's really finished DC yes that's just insane it is just insane yeah and he finished him with a kick that DC said he's never gonna hit him with yeah oh wow yeah just look for the opportunity takes it yeah tendencies are crazy it's just some of them just get so engrained in the way your body moves yeah no he's he's an expert of course what he's doing and he's studying his opponent very well everything is just such planet in details for the fights and he just he knows exactly when he should go for that or that or that and staying creative and using his fantasy and it's amazing to see yeah that Jackson Winkeljohn team is a truly exceptional team I mean they really did do phenomenal with him now where you're at now is a very interesting situation because John is in exile no one knows what's going to happen in terms of how long he's gonna be suspended DC is now fighting steep a Miocic for the heavyweight title and who knows what's happening there I mean that does that bother you because it seems like it kind of like puts the 205 title in limbo it does yeah he does I didn't see that coming at all this is typified at all you know it's it's it's a great fight for for them and for the fans and for the sport but you know for us standing in standing in line we just you know we just sit in their honor when I mean I was just sitting there and waiting for for an opportunity and it's not gonna come it's not gonna be there so you know and and and you know that's also a thing that's been motivating me a lot because after if I would love I got injured and all that and I was really looking forward to come back and and make a really strong performing that you know a very strong next performance I just really wanted to I had my eyes on that gold and and then the they may actually count and almost you know fighting DC but then then it was all gone by him going up the step is so so it's it's a crazy situation that the whole deviation is which is Christ right now yeah it really is because that fight is not even gonna take place until July so here we are in April May June July we have three months till that fight takes place so that fight and then obviously at least three months more slightly more before the title could be challenged again so that's we don't even know if it's coming if it comes back right he might notice what happens in that fight once once he gets used to eating again DC wins I see it in pictures now you're not gonna meet him a couple of days well he was on TV the other day eating potato chips I love that yeah he loves food doesn't sure I mean and I you know you look back at his performance in Strikeforce as a heavyweight it was phenomenal good good phenomenal you didn't lose no I didn't lose that heavyweight and he's good tossed around gorillas like Josh Barnett yeah you left him up like nothing crazy I mean you know this fight against a pace you know if it would be another it gets another heavyweight I'll probably 60p was gonna win this fight but this is like you said he's he's a really good heavyweight so who knows what happens well his wrestling is just so next level yeah it's such a it's an interesting position could steep a is a very good wrestler but Boise sees world-class he's well class and he he doesn't think one step back may just comes out yeah he's being he's just in your face you know but it's tough to count out steep a - because steep a is the pound-for-pound consensus best heavyweight ever I mean the guys defend the title more than anybody could his resume its impeccable he knocks out Junior dos Santos knocks out Overeem beats Francis in Ghana who's everybody scared of I mean he's about us yeah so you know but these seeds he's such a competitive guy you know he does he doesn't want he doesn't take a step back and he just goes for it even if even in tough situation he's just it just eats it and comes back can do what it do always and therefore being a fat guy okay that get works he's screaming at you right now hey man settle down but that guy is doing five rounds like nothing yeah so the conditioning is on top yeah he just eats the wrong food that's all I mean I mean maybe some of its genetic I just think you eating the wrong food I mean this evidence I mean there's evidence it's not like I'm just talking out of my ass I've seen him eat the wrong food at me too yeah look yeah nothing but respect for that guy he's an awesome human being - yeah he's a fantastic guy have you ever thought about fighting heavyweight crossed my mind from time to time but I feel I'm not done with you not done in light heavyweight yet I have still things to do what do you walk around that I'm heavy for two days again directly ten pounds so like what when you normally are getting down to 205 what do you walk around that to you know maybe I'll sell my camps in 235 really yeah Wow yeah I'll go up to 240 sometimes no kidding Wow are you healthy at 240 or you just like I move like never before it's crazy really yeah I do I got some speed in my footwork I just do you feel good at 240 I feel pretty good being heavy I do and I feel strong I feel strong spoiling big guys as pulling heavy guys and I feel really strong in being a heavyweight but but like that's all you man I'm not finishing right yet I understand I understand but how much of you gets diminished in that cut to 205 not that bad no it's like you know when I started because of season I do maybe offseason I do I do eight to ten sessions a week I don't stress you know I don't eat shit food I of course I've sometimes I drink a couple of beers have a pizza whatever you know actually I have to live sometimes you know but it's a good you know good good regular meals do a little bit lifting some some some some weights and and I don't when I start when I stopped my camps it's like my body feels like okay it's time now to start working here and I start doing my sprints and my miles on the treadmill I'm you know from one week to another I may be loose like ten pounds it's crazy it's it's like my body just knows okay it's time to work and then I just drops like nothing Wow so you bought it just to custom to your job and I feel it's because you know I've done it too many times so it's just like you know the routines now I know you do a lot of hunting and you were showing me some photos before podcast do you incorporate wild game into your diet that's all I do yeah that's all I do I I won't say never but I barely buy anything from the store when it comes to meat or all that I just hunt I just hunt everything I eat I tried to put my family with with the with what I'm hunting you know we got our I'm hunting a lot of wild boars we have a lot of wild boars in Sweden I'm hunting days we are red deer fallow there's we got moose and you can compare the meat it's so easy so as long as it's it's a it's a science just to cook it right but if you cook it right and and you know what you're doing is the best thing ever yeah I agree and I've always wondered like as a professional athlete what it would be like like whether or not you see the benefit in eating such protein rich nutrient-dense meat as opposed to pasture raised or far yeah yeah I can compare it yeah you can't compare it and and and and everything around it to you know it they've suffering it like it's not a good it's not a good business you know I don't like that business I don't want to support it all so I write it to my hunting now I agree and I mean there's to me that's the best way if you're going to eat meat it's absolutely the best way but what I'm thinking is like I don't know a lot of pro athletes that only eat wild game and only hunt wild game but I would think to do it'd be a great benefit in that 100% 100% you you can get better nutrition to your body then eating eating that mean it's the best thing there is you know I feel either like just how do you feel after eating like like four four four four four hundred gram at stake all through eating like a four hundred gram whatever they're reduced you've been hunting you don't feel the same it off you don't feel tired you don't feel like you're getting this food coma and stuff like that I feel fresh yes it's weird right it's a wild game has almost an invigorating sensation to it yeah you feel strong you feel good about doing it long have you been hunting have been hunting since a kid how I grew up on a farm and my dad was something a lot as when I was a kid and then I didn't hunt for a long time and I get back to 2012 actually I took my license and and and just enough that I've been hunting if I don't train I'm outdoors if I don't train I'm outdoors and we have seasons in Sweden so it's not like you're hunting all year round right but but I'll make sure I fill the freezer under those seasons so yeah hunting that's awesome man well you don't use both there though it's not it's not a lot of uses I know in Spain it's legal oh yeah yeah in Spain where you said you hunted those red deer yeah yeah can I have a friend of mine who lives in Spain he's a big boner okay yeah no it's only rifles in Sweden yeah but that works too man it works I mean it's the most effective way for sure and obviously they'd shoot them at a hard distance and there's a lot of people think it's more humane to if you're not good with a boat there right yeah yeah you know but it comes to the feeling of being outdoors being close to the today being close to the animal and stuff like that I don't even think you can compare to it to actually the bow hunting no it's a whole nother technique it's all way to to hunt well God like you who loves challenges who thrives off of that you would do it I've done it but if I if I try to probably love it this man I'll hook you up I appreciate the back everybody my friend John Dudley is tall like you too so he'd be the perfect guy to coach you sounds great to you and take you out on a hunt yeah now I can't wait man I love that was especially wild pigs there's a place that he has in Oklahoma that they they hunt a lot of wild pigs I mean they just have to eradicate them there's so many of them I heard about it yeah this to me it's too many it's I heard it's and how they hunt them too is kind of crazy all the ones in Texas whether you have YouTube channels and stuff like that's crazy down there they just have to this mean Texas is so big and there's so many pigs there's millions and millions of pigs there and they're constantly breeding yeah yeah they'll have like three four little J year and each litter they'll have four six piglets and they just keep going and going and go on and go on and they're just no end well and they don't have very many predators a few mountain lions take them out occasionally yeah for the most part they're just running and gunning and they keep breeding did it get big in here yeah they do big several rounds yeah yeah this is common to see three four hundred pound pigs Wow since we in Sweden there we have a couple of them but they don't get that big dome the thing is how we hunting in Sweden is when the farmers when they you know that they had all their acres and all they you know the lands they actually call us in because the pigs yeah yeah to help them out and we just out there all night the Sun never goes down in Sweden in summer times Oh real now we had like a Midnight Sun so it's so cozy being out there it's it's kind of warm it's nice you going around you checking the lands and it's pretty good man you you would like to I'm sure I would I've only been in Sweden once for the UFC whatever but I loved it stockings beautiful city fantastic really really enjoyed it there thank you very nice people too oh they are they are they are so so how did you get aligned with Alliance how did that how'd that wind up happening where you started coming to America to train and how far into your career was that right off the field fight really yeah right off to fill fight and back then we didn't we didn't have those resources in in Stockholm I don't you say Phil Davis we're talking about yeah it was yeah yeah yes on the fool is also an alliance fighter yeah which is pretty cool man that you guys fought and then you went to train with them yeah well how'd that work out it went good no he he just kicked my ass the first couple of times but first our learning the whole wrestling part and yeah how you me to defend a tank town and after that I just become good right and I really enjoy enjoying coming coming down here meeting the guys and training it's a whole nother type of life well it's so cool that he you know accepted you after you were opponent to and had you come and learn with them yeah you know I we just talked off to the fight right away and and you know I just just swallowed my pride and I just talked to him talked enough to the fight and right now he invited me over and and and I key just came meaning my culture just came over and we had no idea what to expect them I remember we just we just landed now we landed at nighttime so we went to the gym to sleep I woke up the day after and I was hitting someone hitting the bags down there like in the in the math area like early now super early on like Christus I went down it was Phil it was hitting the bags and I felt so like oh then I have to do this to after that we started to like you know train together so it was a really good time and then he came actually down to us to help me with with love to share too so he went to Sweden yeah yeah for a couple of weeks so any Falk love it too and that and you know it's means so much to me to have these guys training with me you know would feel a lil a TV where Jimmy Manawa and all those guys yeah such a great guys and love training with them and I mean it makes my training just I just steps up you know steps up even more we have we have a bunch of guys we have like Russian common names we established a really good place now in at all-star since in Sweden and Europe around around Europe and and getting so much good guys and my level of firing just rises through the top now I'm telling you if I if I spoke with Phil Jimmy or or earlier I just feel like every day every day is a fight you know you can't be relaxed you can't just throw a jab and don't care about the counter you have to such amazing training well it's so fantastic - over the last decade the level of talent that's coming out of Europe has just escalated it's been so different they're so big and the wrestling - which is a big part of it so much more wrestling so much more talent I exactly know we you know we have we have we have guys coming from from from s Pakistan we have different Russian countries down there - coming in and those guys are beast beast and they're there that drive in there they're the double legs to take down stay and each shot star they each chose they take it like nothing and it just comes at you so they make them a they make me work a lot and yeah it's that's exactly what I need exactly what I need yeah that's been one of the more interesting things over the last five or six years is the rise of the Russians yeah and so many from the Soviet former Soviet yeah yeah yeah now they're there and they have such such a working capacity then they work a lot we have a couple of guys down at the gym now and you know they're at the gym when I come to gym that the gym when I leave the gym I never leave basically but but in the back so they actually do yeah we have a facility that we so people can stay and and and you know train oh that's excellent yeah yeah so but they they just work man all day long that's a great asset to have a facility where people can train and live there I know American Top Team put something like that in Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson put something like that in yeah that that's got to help so much we're young guys who don't have much money but you know 1% trained 100 percent it's a really good way to also to you know give something back man it's you know they had that they they have their rooms to sleep in we managed so they they have really good foods in you know to bring lunches and stuff so and we also got we've also got it from here because we at the beginning when we came to San Diego like I saw you it was it was another type of training another lifestyle and we saw that me my coach Andres Michael so we just after doing this years and years and years we now manage to do it at home and I just love it you know I'll be I'll be traveling I've been traveling on my on my career to America to Train and around the place so I now establish a good a good training system that works and we establish it good and I feel great to be home a you know when you're getting a family and stuff from 31 years old and it works man it works I never been a that shape of my life that I've been like training at home and feeling good that's fantastic when you don't have to train yourself by flying over across the country getting somewhere you don't know exactly yeah you are a real pioneer in terms of like European mixed martial arts what is it like now seeing all this sort of explode around you I mean it's become so popular all over the world now I mean MMA from when you started 10 years ago to now it's barely recognizable no you're gangster back then yeah or you were Psychopaths either one or two of those who are you training like and but nowadays it's amazing you know you have a walk around in Stockholm and and people are junkies to normal they know even more than I know about techniques about about the sport we have all ladies and gentlemen's coming in one area for a picture it's it's grown so much it's it's like you said it's been exploded all over the world now what I was getting at was that when you first started out how much of a structure was in place like in terms of like how much strength and conditioning you should do how much sparring you should do how much drilling you should do you know just let undress Michael's to handle that to me he's a mastermind of coaching he he puts me in situations I you know I hate him it's the worst ever after we've been such a we always been firing sometimes you know it would be like by it has this old mentality of training he doesn't do we don't do too much of the scientific thing like with you know you watch the polls you you measure you think we just do the hardcore things and of course we did that to the scientific a little bit but not too much so we turned to balancing out but just we yeah he plans everything you know he's a mastermind of coaching and he knows me in and out and I know him that's another very important part in the development of young fighters is having someone that they can entrust it has knowledge where it's an Eric del Fierro or Andreas or you know Jackson Winkeljohn like whoever it is like having someone who really understands the sport who can guide you yeah and that's just such a giant resource for a guy yeah it is it is and you know as this port explodes and get bigger you have those fake ones coming in and think they know everything you know and they wanted to be up they want to have a piece of the cake basic yeah well you have like these guys that gave it to fear and then Andres Michael and they're they're masterminds man what is this what is his background like boxing he was a professional boxer like they like he's like 19 or 20 now his boxing record so and then he broke his arm and yet finished by have to finish career because he's he's armed but now he's he does his does his background and that's where I got my footwork from because you know that's what I got my my foundation in firing from and then then I also one thing about Barbara coach like foreign dress for example he or Eric trophy over there they don't they don't care about the glory they don't care about the attention you know they they don't care about they are the head cultures but they they take in if they are honest to me and to themselves you know I don't know these things I don't know it grab the baguette them things I don't know the restaurant things they learn as they learn to as it as it grows and they learn with me but they taking people that you know so the we cover the whole thing because we covered the whole dose though there are all the aspects of the game basically so yeah Eric is one of the most important but yet the most humble guys yeah his super humbles very in the background there's a few guys like that I really respect John crouch from the MMA lab he's very similar to they're not looking for attention just laying back there and there's a lot of guys that get that aren't looking for attention to just get it because they're so good aha because you keep going on and on there's a lot of them but those guys are so important I mean it's so critical like finding a big camp with great fighters and a fantastic coaching staff is what they're the difference between you realizing your full potential and not then that sometimes is the difference yeah that's that's just having the right coaches to keep basically yes the key coaches and training partners yeah 100% yeah yeah so you you give him like full rein in terms of everything you do I would discuss it all the time we argue sometimes we hugging sometimes you know it's it's like a relationship it's my it's my family too so that's how you know we that's all it is I remember we had we had a really good we were in Vegas actually for a camp I thought I was fighting kilo Silva and he was putting me in there in the cage with some big-ass registers I wasn't and I was like I wasn't to 42:35 back then I was like to 20 to 19 walking around with these guys was heavy big American heavy weights good wrestling guy and they were just taking me down taking me down like submitting me and I was like I stay I stand up in the cage I throw him I think I'm nice enough I can't take it away yeah left me out of the cage so I was hitting the door I wanted a 3k and the gym was full of people now so everybody just froze look at me like and the case was like on a pedestal so everybody could see me so I was hitting the door and I see andreas he's outside though he's talking this nope you stand in there one more round meanwhile when you took John Jones down you had to be thinking god am I glad I didn't open up that door I was surprised when I ended up in that position on top of like you - oh shit did this really happen I didn't think you're gonna go for it so when you went for it and then took him down we were like oh shit no I was Chuck I was I was laying on top and I'm like wow I'm actually on top and I'm a top of this guy I didn't think that was possible but it wasn't that too hard to take take down you caught him by surprise yeah I did I was it's pretty I think you were surprised too yeah yeah well it was pretty fucking awesome now what is a typical day in your your camp like do you do you break up conditioning days with skill work days do you do conditioning in the morning do you do it and after you're done with your skill work how do you work that I do I do I did from 10 to 12 sessions a week I'm when I'm in camp I tried to we have we have actually there the group we had the group workouts with the whole group the holly wreath group in the mornings and then we do offer everything from sparring to to good kickboxing drills to yeah whatever it's that's when the group is training and that's that's it's all the time it's the same group at the same time every morning and then the night time is more like individual okay what I'm doing today yeah you'd maybe do five rounds of pads needed experience or it could be either one or strength or yeah it could be the one so that's how we that's how we how we do it basically so do you have a separate jiu-jitsu coach to separate more Thai coach like how do you how do you work all that stuff out yeah the guy that was with me now mmm Bo Kim Karlsen he's actually the the national national coast of Thai boxing and he's coaching me in my in my kicks and my knees and my in my in my kick box and then I Alan Nascimento it's a Brazilian but basically listen I didn't even a Sweden how many years is a famine everything so he's having he has my digits and my grappling and he is such a competitive guy he still he still competes he beats me up in he spars with me basically like his sports with me and it just makes me learn the hard way so you've got just an amazing staff over there amazing stuff it's amazing stuff that's fantastic I love it and so when you say you do these 10 to 12 per week do you have like a board up on the wall will you outline the week ahead or do you do it day by day how do you do that now get effects from undress this is the way I just waiting from that text map but the silence of my phone like I don't want to see it so that's how it works they give me a text if we do it could be on the board to have a big what board on the on the on the on the wall it could be on the world - he puts down the session if it's something particular we are maybe sparring common name we have to adapt this schedule a little bit it difference it's a different one every week so yeah I can imagine I would imagine it gets while you still training yes I'll train yeah yeah I've got some serious injuries and I'm trying to heal up right now what was things you is two problems one big one is I got tendinitis in my elbow I've never had tendonitis before and I don't know what that is though it's fucking strain in the tendon that does if he tendons have low blood supply huh so the problem with tendinitis is it takes forever to heal and I did over stretch though um it was from pulling from cleans and from chin-ups oh this one on the inside this this muscle right here or this tab right here okay man I fucked it up I just I kept training with it like a bit of information in it I'm real bad to the point where it wasn't healing and I didn't stem cells and PRP I finally got a hold of it but this thing right here I keep it with me all the time this helped me more than anything it's a thing called the thera-band and what you do is you hold it because it's um this is the elbow that's injured so I hold it out like this I twist it and then I slowly untwist it with this side and that therapy just doing this I do this like five six times a day I'll do like ten reps that's been like the best thing that's helped me more than anything by eBay but the Train now or just not yes pretty soon I think I'm good in about two weeks I'm gonna give myself two more weeks have some badass kicks well thank you that's what I heard I'll show you I can still kick I have no problem with my connect simple yeah I'm very pleased cool I did Taekwondo when I was a little kid I started out with that and then you know got into Muay Thai later but yeah now I have to I have to I have to stretch for an hour before the workouts really yeah I think is I don't know I think it's from my genetics or something I'm just a stiff Vikings I'm telling Aaron Swartz swinging swore that if I kick over your knees yeah but I guarantee you you could improve that flexibility that's the thing I have to that's the thing I have in you know through my whole career I'm just working on my flexibility and and when I when I'm when I'm stepping in that octagon I'm flexible as hell but that's just two times a year ago so full peak in the full peak of cases are you doing a lot of weight lifting is that what it is and you're doing a lot of squats or deadly it's just it's it's in my genetics I think I just saw I'm super state the past if every where he's just my hamstrings are stiff when did you start martial arts for real when I was starting him in May 2000 end of 2006 really okay so it's fairly late in life it was I've been boxing and stuff but that's just been amateur level I don't even count that as a as a series doing sporting aged it was just fucking around yeah so you were basically like 1819 when you really got into it around there yeah so your body already matured see one of the things that you see about kicking in particulars when you get young fighters before their body is matured then their flexibility usually stays yeah you know like if you start karate or something like a Phil Davis for example that guy's massive but still he's flexible as he's great fucking superhero I know his waist to shoulder ratio I know it sang with Jimmy me though Jimmy ma no I don't put off much easier when I'm training with him I don't want to let's get let's get my hoodie on me let skip my roadie on say with Phil yeah the guys are jacked yeah I know even if their offseason ugly that's the thing I just getting a chubby on like a big big ass the former body this guy's like it looks like athletes all around that frustrating sometimes but is that just good though when I'm winning the wrong some fat guys all over the world yeah so do you do you like do you watch your diet at all outside of camp I do I do actually I do I try to I try to stay away from sugar sugar I don't I don't it's like when I do sugar if I do like sawdust and stuff like that i can do whatever i gain a lot of weight but as soon as i quit it i just crazy dropping weight sugars the devil it is I hate sugar that's worse yeah it's the work when you realize what it's actually doing your body and you realize it's everywhere and that most people that you run into or just eating sugar all day long and this crash it doesn't taste that good if you don't do it right that's the weird thing right once your gut bacteria that's acclimated to even food you start craving salads and shit yeah yeah so now when you talk about flexibility do you ever do yoga I don't you don't know I don't like that no Vikings in yoga mix no I I think it's just because I'm so bad at it I'm you know and you need patient a lot of patients doing and I wish I I wish I liked it I wish that because I would probably need it more than ever but it's there don't get me wrong I'm you know I stretch I do my flexible things in my training and all that but I put a whole workout in just to just to stretch your body um I don't know I don't I don't have the patience for it it's not just that though that's what's interesting about it it's a strengthening thing to just strengthens your body in an unusual way I've seen a lot more fighters getting involved in it and really seen benefits one of them was Nathan Corbett you know Nathan Corbett the muy Thai champion yeah her mama yes he's doing some interview recently talking about how much yoga he does and how much he'll his power and helped his movement no I believe it does I believe it does based on I interested I probably have to think about it what I was thinking guy like you who's so driven yeah they're trying to succeed you know at all costs like you're trying to figure what's the best way to succeed yeah you might want to investigate that I should I should actually do it I should do it I think it will I think I will you know let people tell him in you know they telling me like my cakes I have to work on my case more I have to use my cakes more in the fights and they all right I need to start doing my kicks more and the thing I kick butt I kick with a certain maybe and security I don't know I I love I think it is from from back in the days when I was getting taken down all the time doing my things but nowadays people taking me down but I'm you know they can't hold me down nobody if they take me down nobody can hold me down so that's something I need to like start doing even more not just kicking today to the legs or you know more powerful kicks to the body my knees are good I working on my knees all the time and I'm putting in more in my fights and I love my knees I'm getting really high with my nice things about MMA and martial arts in general is that there's always room for improvement there's always things to work on no one is the best at everything even if you're 31 years old yeah you're doing this for 10 years you still have so much to learn yeah that's that that's the good thing with the sport no it's it's such a comprehensive sport I mean I really don't think people appreciate how much thought is involved in the preparation ya know it's it's a lot it's a lot it's a lot so how long do you think you'll be doing it you say 31 like you're old but it seems like you've been doing it a long time right yeah how many years you think you have left I feel I feel really hungry motivated I don't think the age is gonna be I don't I don't think my age in terms of you know have pain in your body or injuries or anything like that's gonna stop me it's more like as long as I having fun as long as I'm enjoying what I'm doing I'll do it I'll do it I mean you have you have guys that are like doing it laid in forests to him that's that's also a good thing with the sport it's such a guys it's such an old age job of peeking if you compare it to other sports so I have a I have a lot more to gain I can give you a number but I have a lot more to give Kelly you've had moments in your career though that you were kind of down right yeah yes of course do this exactly now after Anthony Johnson lost that was a tough one you know but but I always told myself like you know either either you know I just put my either just get a fuck out of there I just learned from it and keep going doing it and I just loved my life as it is you know I had I had my my I'm so flexible in my schedule my you know in my time with the family and I gained everything from the sport so so I have to do it more and I'm gonna do it more that's that's what i if I probably gonna like if I would like for example say you know fuck it I don't after a loss against something for example I will grade myself like a lot like in the late forties maybe right so well because you had your finest performance after that yeah I mean the Glover Teixeira fire and I just feel like that that's the thing you know I just feel like I'm just keep going like this right for every fight then I have I had a couple of setbacks but I'm still seeing those marginals I see the numbers going up I see I see myself doing better so I I believe in myself 100% and I believe I have that what it takes to take that belt I believe I have what it takes and I believe I can beat John Jones I believe 200% I have what it takes to beat John Jones and I have what it takes to be DC so I'm just looking for an opportunity I want to you know step in there people say I'm not active enough I don't say enough but that's never been my thing I never been like economic Kroger and if I should start doing what he's doing people are gonna tell me like shut the fuck up you know I see right through you not that guy just like silly myself so so I just you know doing what I do I'm always going to do what I do and and I show what I have when I wanna fight and I've been a little bit inactive because of because of my injury now and because of all that but you know whatever people say I'm I'm down and I'm just waiting for the next opportunity basically I can't wait the Rumble Johnson fight was a tough one for you to swallow too because it was in Stockholm it was this enormous event everybody was there to see you and in that fight we didn't pick it up while the fight was going on but you guys collided heads yeah yeah it was a head but yeah it was I'm not I'm not taking anything away from Anthony Johnson hit that guy is a beast and he hits a hot he's one of the hardest hitter in the no-docking sport no I mean no one's taking anything away know him he's truly exceptional but the thing is I was throwing my mom I kicked there and he just came in there and he's forehead hit my my chin yeah and from and I just I just blacked out I didn't I went down I went up again I was in the mat I was in the match again mmm bunny he just you know when he gets a taste of blood he just goes for it and and I should just keep my guard up I'm very like this right you know they're lengthy and he just caught me as I'm doing all that but isn't that one of those situations where until you've been there and you you've been that hurt in a big fight like that and it's like the experience is it's it's an alien experience it is it is it's it's you don't recognize any of it it's like you can't nothing controls your mind trying to control your legs your arms like this and that but it's just I was just disorientated man yeah it was 4:00 in the morning you know in one of the big stadium in Sweden 4:00 in the morning we filled it up we filled it up and that's huge play it was it was huge man and and and like I said 4:00 in the morning I you know when the people told me like how we're gonna do this I'm like know how it's not gonna it's not gonna happen how should we manage to fill this place up right but still people went there to see it and it was just amazing feelings happen out there well for people who don't understand why they did it to coordinate it with American pay-per-view yeah exactly exactly so yeah that was it yeah it was rough man it was a rough loss and now Ron just decided he doesn't want to fight anymore which is kind of crazy yeah every now and then he thinks about it he says once come back as a heavyweight yeah yeah I don't think he's even gonna make it to light heavy anymore no I've seen it's so crazy to think that that guy fought at 170 at one point in his career I can't even I can't even yeah I can't even see that not even his neck is like the size of his head he has no small head he's like at this big round head yeah make is the size of his head sighs now he's a big guy a really big guy I ran into him once while he was fighting 170 he was in the lobby of a hotel I came downstairs and I go Anthony how much do you weigh he's laughing he's like dude 30 I was like 230 you wait 230 years makes my wake a DC man telling that my makes my way cut my that makes my way cut easy his way cut was horrific he his his cheek she's just sucking he has prominent cheekbones right it's like when his weight cut was fully dehydrated when his body was like really it was like horrible it's like looking a skeleton oh sure it's like man that's my girl for you it all missed weight a bunch times - no no I'm going up to like takeaways he's probably the best thing he's ever done in his career I agree yeah yeah yeah I was kind of stunned when he decided to retire but what he said was interesting he said I'm not a fighter he goes I'm an athlete he goes I'm just really good at fighting I don't know if that's correct though I would see more like I like it like a fighter you know he's a great athlete but but I see him more like a like a hawk or fighter I don't you know he all we are all athletes doing this but but he's more like the fighter you know Phil Davis it's an athlete he's an athlete but this guy he's just like it's a fighter man I mean gotta tell him man if you watch his fight with Glover Teixeira you watch his fight with the nagas a destroyer he does he's a destroyer I don't want to you don't want to be in front of them and that shows you how fucking tough DC is yeah I throat everything I had him everything I had i kneed him in the face kicked him in his body something I hit him and I saw his eyes goes like this I just put just kept going he sees an animal yeah before we drive just and he just same pay same pace yeah yeah you know if I fight him again I will outstanding this book I want to stand in front of him so you think that was the critical error right in front of hundreds just reach advantage yeah I respect his wrestling too much so yeah if I fought him again I would do it way different way yeah I'm sure he'd do something different to that right he probably do one thing like all the time just keeps moving forward that's what he must dude you got to catch him when he's coming down from a heavyweight yeah you remember the towel he was pushing down on us I want him to come down I hope he's coming down yeah he can't he can't just like you know take the fight now you know even if he wins he has to come come down and defend the man and fasten if he beats deeper he might freak Francis again who knows they might fight Volkov who you know you could good fight no he has to fight him it doesn't want to fight me but it has to fight him he has to in your mind he has to fight that scene here that's what I need yeah that's mine it's him or John so John that's first you would like to be the first guy to fight John I walk coming back right away yeah I mean I mean I'm trying I mean camping I'm letting camp sorry I'm training right I'm feeling great my shoulder is good and I'm just waiting for my opportunity the light heavyweight is pretty wide open right now basically with this decision for DC to fight against a so we you have you know it's interesting like you have hosed Amir who just lost right you got your friend Jimmy Manoir you have a few guys who are at the top of the heap you know but you're the standout right now when John being in his limbo yeah he's gone no nobody knows what's happening with him you know it stands out to you in that division earlier yeah yeah you know you know I wouldn't find my teammates right I don't find my teammates early I've been training with him since I was I started my career so Jimmy Jimmy and an ileus you know we've been saying to each other that whatever happens we're not fighting each other you know but yeah the only the only the only fight that makes sense for me right now it's is fighting if fighting the top guys in our rank number one right now so I can't look back I can't look down I have to look up right what's the next up here and if we take it from there we take it from there and and like you said with John Johnson Limbo I hope he comes back if it doesn't come back maybe I fight him in boxing I'll fight him in boxing - why does he want a box he's been boxing on his Instagram that's all he did his box not enough really yeah I've been paying attention to since now he's boxing all the time yeah yeah I don't see him coming back as a boxer though I mean sees that gun I'm a great good money we could we could yeah that's that's another thing but we can take it like no no maybe a sideshow here we can boss you just want to get in there with them somehow or no yes somehow somehow or another your competitive drive once you get in there with them that's my that's my like I told you it's bigger than winning the belt that's your Mount Everest John shown it is John's out there going yeah you still got that Corvette yo sell that thing get a minivan drive slow it looks good man looks real good yeah it's got to be so frustrating for him to be in a situation that he's in yeah I can imagine yeah I can imagine either it's it's fucked up it's a crazy situation to be in yeah you know did you see the article called the Covington know what he said about John Jones I don't even want to hear it no okay we should I mean you could bring it up if you want to but Co he was talking it was a it was a like a text like this just about John John how piece of shit is now I will see the surprise when I saw it myself you know I was like this is right or wrong I don't know John John's gonna be in front of you one day gotta be careful watch your fucking words yeah you gonna get slapped in the face yeah like I can kill you with his hands that's a that's a bad move III get what Colby's doing I mean he's making a lot of noise and trying to do business you know and if you fight him you're gonna make a lot of money because a lot of people gonna come to see him get his ass kicked you know you know he's not probably on their own they're the Popper littlest is probably on the I wanted to see I want to see get knocked out list he's in a dangerous situation right now he's gonna fight dos Anjos yeah how phil dos Anjos is Brazilian he talked crazy shit about Brazil they were gonna fight in Brazil here's cargo which Kobe close to Brazilian you know I want to be close to him no I would not go if I was him he'd probably go anyway man he doesn't give a fuck no if the money's right I'm sure he would but dos Santos right now at welterweight I think is a murderer he's a fucking killer at welterweight because for him that cut down the 55 was just too big big and now you see a guy he's big I mean she's too much of a cot to draining on his body and then you see the way he beat Robbie Lawler in his last fight you holy shit there goes through Neil Magny Robbie Lawler and you look at how good he looks at 170 let's go for it it's a good fight it's a good fight very good for that it's a really good fight particularly stand up here's a big advantage I think over Colby yeah standing what does he do Colby but it's a rest he's a wrestler yeah okay yeah his stand-up is good I mean he beat Damien my I beat him up but I feel like my ax is you know I mean my I was coming off of that very very hard fight against Tyrone Woodley five hard rounds got beat up and then he's gonna go five I think he went three rounds with Colby but I just don't think he's the same guy anymore I think he's 41 I think mine we're doing for a very long time long he's been in the game for a very long time yeah and I think those long hard five round wars a toll on you yeah takes a toll and not taking anything away from Colby but think also think Colby style is probably tailor married for a guy like Maya yeah you know wrestling that's what you usually see you like to Brussels and guns Brazilian Jujitsu guys yeah you know yeah now you're a fucking decent guy you don't get in any bullshit you're not involved in any brawls you don't get involved in a stupidity you're an excellent representative of a professional athlete Thanks what do you think about all this Conor McGregor bullshit like you see someone throwing a Dahlia Tomas and shattering a window no I don't even have words for it man I'm the worst Fred what did you think of when you heard that I heard the news when I landed I was in the plane when it was all happening flying to New York and when I landed my phone was like all these text messages coming in going what the fuck is wrong with Conor what the I'm like what happened you know and then I check the news and I was like oh Christ and then I hear that two fights were pulled from the card then three fights report card not what Conor McGregor he he's just he's just losing it right now it feels like he's lost it I feel like yeah you know I never really been you know I respect all these things these does he's he's ISA is a great business man he'd do what it takes to make money he knows what it takes to get money and he does he did really good he's easy he's a mastermind when it comes to trash document whether he takes it to another level but like this thing he did now it's just it's it's just crazy you don't do that you don't do it at all I don't I don't know water is why he's doing it yeah I don't know either he's drunk as fuck or AC is it just bruised I wouldn't think that's a booze moved that seemed more like a coke it could be I don't know it just could be part of his act yeah thing like do you really take it that far you didn't take it that far to just make some noise I don't know what if my thing is like what if that that Dali hit the car where Rose was sitting and cut roses face up no that was just be like crazy michael Chiesa I'm sad that he got cut but yes is a tough bastard he'll be fine he's probably pissed off and he's gonna sue Connor and probably make a shitload of money soon yeah yeah but what if it hit Rose no that would be bad really bad no Tara had the fucking world would hate him oh yeah like well yeah Rose was blinded to one eye because it might not what the fuck they're denied Ray Bourque got cuts in his eyes yeah yeah it's it's entirely Plessis glass glass cuts in his own yeah he got glass shards he got a scratched cornea or they also know it should be I don't find out how many lawsuits I know chiesa filed chiesa definitely filed a lawsuit or filed a complaint which will lead to a lawsuit I imagine look I've matched if I was Connor I would settle the fucking every single thing outside a court because if he loses if he loses and he gets a felony he's fucked he probably won't even be able to come into the country no exactly no here's my thing imagine switch it around imaginative reborg threw that dolly at the bus and Connor yeah he will smoke be gone he will be gone for sure that's this is one of the more fucked up things about the yeah yeah he will be gone is that you know Connors getting special treatment except of course he is yeah of course of course that's not good for anybody no it's not it's not and like I told you he's just he's just losing his mind right now it's yeah you do it to a certain certain level and then you just like you just chill you don't take it further than that then what it just did yeah I don't I don't have any word for it man I just feel like it's terrible it's terrible for for everybody in the sport man no it's terrible it's terrible for Connor even position he's making money I don't know what it makes what it made for that may with the fight I'm telling you if you keep doing what he's doing that that that money is not gonna be enough no to pay all she has to pay no no he'll burn right through that way he's probably burning through that money anyway every time you see me got a new Bentley yeah probably lives in a mansion now oh yeah he does he's a percent yeah yes it's private jet I don't know how many bounces I don't know you have many look good what you call it their bodyguard she had when I hit that guy in Ireland they the gangster guy he Island you had a bunch of like bodyguards I heard around it but the day cost every day they're not cheap tough yeah that money piles up yeah but when you're 29 years old like Connor you don't even think about it no you don't he's thinking about now not the future and he probably thinks he's done hundreds Millicent's up part of it as I said because do what he's doing whatever it's a billion or whatever it is it's not a lot of money it's gonna run through you well there's that but then there's the thing that really gets me is that what Connor is is an exceptional world championship fighter I mean that's what he really is all this other stuff is that the bullshit is gonna get in the way of his legacy I mean he his legacy shouldn't be a boxing match where he's TKO'd by the greatest boxer ever that's fucking stupid yeah and his legacy should be the next fight after Kenny I know what you mean man that was a man he's been smashing beasts yeah it's been taking two belts yeah he's a he's a he's just a regular guy from Ireland it comes to this it comes to America and he just lives the American dream you know it don't think nobody's done before so you know it's it's terrible - it's terrible - to see all this shit happen yeah cuz I'm saying that all these things that are happening it's bad for him yeah of course it's not just bad for the sport to let him get away with it so with all this happening you don't even like think of what he's been doing in Octagon right exactly exactly I mean just think about setting him up with khabib you know having that fight like jesus fucking christ that would be a giant fight that might be one of the biggest MMA fights ever to make him versus kabhi kabhi B's what's his record 25 oh no 2696 no 26,000 and he's barely tested yeah he barely gets tested yeah that's amazing you see one little flaw in him you get all excited yeah cuz like whoo look he's keeping win that fight what's up who do you think we in the fight it's a good question it's well if the question is can Conor catch him can kind of catch him always coming in yeah and if Connor can catch him what Connor can knock anybody out yeah I mean you see what he did to Eddie Alvarez you see what he did to Aldo nobody had ever done that although before does well that that's the best strikers ended in the division yeah and what Connor has is incredible precision man dia busy he's but his face he's so fast so fast he speed his angles he moves he moves create an angle and he just counter the shit out of the guys and yeah that's that's all you need she also moves unusual he moves almost like a karate guy yeah he does you know wide stance but then knocks you out like a like a real moral boxer like the only thing I'm doubting its own corner yeah you know he's East best striker and all of that but does he had the condition if you covered that's a good question she just he just keeps going in just for an animal yeah and it's also the wrestling yeah but Kobe was wrestling is not just a level above everybody else but multiple levels yeah he just I heard I heard like heavy guys I'm talking about heavyweights talking about cabbies pressure on the ground be on top yeah yeah taking that that cyber that seat belt around taking his hands moon that leg did you trust the guy totally so Luke Rockhold said he never loses around training oh he said he said he doesn't lose around yeah he doesn't lose around he just smashes everybody that's insane everybody who wrestles time to go through the grinder those fucking guys in dagestan man New York Times had an article about Dagestan wrestling and about how these guys they they have very few options and so a lot of them you know they go towards the dark side and get involved in terrorism all those other things and this is the way to go towards the light side yeah tegus lords yeah yeah and they have a different mindset there too if you're doing good if you are if you are alike if you win the world games or whatever they take care of you they really support the whole govern the whole country is carrying you out from the map they carry into your King there yeah just that it's a great motivation and that's their just yeah they're animals did you seize a beat fight ooh is a beat Mohammed sharp off he fought on the undercard of no I don't think so holy shit he's another one from Dagestan another one but he's totally different he's like six foot one fights at 145 yeah that guy yeah they got yeah I think his background is actually like I'm gonna say it's wushu or something like that yeah I think he started out as a kung fu guy but who did it go he won that fight Bogdan yeah great fight it's crazy three-round fight bak neck just kept coming at him kept coming at him and then at the end of the third round bak niak finally has them cornered up against the cage and he's teeing off on him phenomenal fight I mean phenomenal fight for the toughest and this skill of zabi but I'm a fucking phenomenal just was ridiculous to this guy it's not even a wrestler he's a striker he's a striker but he's got wrestling to his wrestling's good too and his takedown defense is very good and his judge is very good too but well his fucking striking crazy shit wheel kicks front leg roundhouse kicks to the face switch kicks just everything everything lightning-fast perfect technique and here's a big thing too is his footwork when he lands he's always in perfect position everything he does when he comes down he's never talked word he's never like his legs are never problems yeah for nothing but phenomenal technique as impressive to see it's impressive to see when well when guys are like good strike guys with good kicks for example John Jones for example they kick hide they kick from different angles the kick and they just land like doctor haven't kicked yeah they learn like really good good base they're ready for another you ready for counter they're ready for this it's impressive to see so for you as a guy who if you had to say you have a one error in your game that needs the most work you'd say that's your kicking Wow I think I you know I don't know yeah of course kicking is one of the Obon of the things I think I have to work on a lot mana that's I'm I'm far from I would probably never become a complete fighter I have to work on everything you know I need to keep my keep working on my boxing I have to keep working on my footwork I have to keep working on my kicks my knees my elbows my grab my my wrestling keep my chin down guard up all that shit just keeps going just keeps going who do you like to watch fight I like to watch to my teammates fight I like I like I like seeing guys him in my division I should be honest - yeah um I'm not really I'm not another guy that really watch fights I don't watch all the fights I don't know about Bernie watched any fights I just fight if I know uh into my teammate my teammates or competition fights my competition is firing I fight I look at the fights but oh good title defenses and stuff like that but I don't I don't better watch fights details videos is just too much a part of your life I think it's important that you have some distance - you have some distance to t work it is a work even if you're having a lifestyle and your passion is it's it's a work and you need some distance and my distance like I told you it's been outdoor my distance is you know being outdoors hunting family in France no I so it doesn't interest me to watch the fights it's getting too much of it's particularly my name in camp I'm I don't watch fight at all again it gets too much I would imagine yeah I mean you're probably spending five hours a day just training yeah yeah no it gets too much man but it's like I thought if I know John John's is firing DC's 5-volt cannons firing watching those fights right do you have a guy that's like your favorite guy to watch like a Mighty Mouse or someone or Anderson Silva or someone he had those guys I watched those guys yeah I watched I watched my Tomas that guy's incredible yeah he's he's hands-down he's the best guy I know competing wonder what it would be like if you were that light wonder would it be like 25 I'll be so fast how fast am I happy to see my shadow either running around like this I know crazy right I mean Mighty Mouse is so fast one time I've told the story before but one time like I grabbed him just playing around from behind I'm like what's up I grabbed him he turned and kneed me in the body for two times before I even knew he did anything dude that was ridiculous like how the fuck did you move that quick like you know his fights is amazing to see and the way he he finished his fights the one he he's like throwing the guy taking that armbar in the air yeah yeah it was now it was just amazing to suplex him and took the armbar you there's fucking video game shit it is it is he said he drills that night since a drills video games a lot a public gets it from the video I have to try this do something to try this and that he doesn't do it yeah that's crazy now do you watch a lot of boxing well yeah I watch the big fights i watch the big fights I do but I'm not really a guy that watched a lot of fights and overall he it's just because like you said you need distance distance yeah starting my interest you know I'm you know I got guys in my team they're like such a nurse day they only they are on the body they know everything about everyone mmm they don't even train themselves they just knows everything about everyone and that's enough for me they just tell me who's this asked don't you know I'm no good listen yes the skills different okay good so yeah so like when you're in camp do you what do you do to try to relax and like for downtime do you try to read books do you watch TV do you play video games like what do you do I'm actually I'm actually spending time outdoors during camp during camp that's what I do that's my way to to get away from everything you know what's a Syrian hanging out with with my family and stuff but but for me the real distance I get when I'm when I'm outdoors hunting or dogs or you know I usually I don't even have to hunt I should I just go out and hike yeah a hike I got some lands not far from Stockholm I go out there and just hanging out you know sometimes I'm just tracking oh what's this oh that's a wild boar you know and I just follow it where it goes or could it could be it could be anything just out I like to be outdoors even if it's like 10 - degrees or if it's summertime I'm out all the time that's awesome that's a great way to put things in perspective - right yeah and the guys - telling me they're like if you put that much time like you're doing in hunting you do that in training or be not time but just having that interest yeah you know they they they all the time telling me that so don't you think that those interests things like hunting are a relief for your mind but it is it I always I wish everybody could see that yes it's a healthy way of living I think yeah I think I think especially to a guy who has such an intense pursuit it's probably good to have another thing that you're interested in so that it gives you like a relief from not always thinking about fighting all the time there's a break you know because it's obviously hunting's not competitive so what you're doing when you're hunting is it's more primal and natural but also very difficult and time-consuming yeah yeah because it's like you train you you compete at the gym you compete in the game the Octagon you're competing in business you're competing and everything it's just a competitive way of as you live a competitive whale way no it's a comparable of living basically and and it gets a toll on you after a while and when I was when I was young when I started this part I was just I was you know I was just like I wanted to smash everybody the gym all bomb you know but now you know nowadays I'm like I know my body better I know what my body needs I know okay this is I found a way where I even if even if I was doing what I was doing six seven years ago I wouldn't I wouldn't even if I if I do that in training wise being such a nerd in training and just training training seven days a week 24 hours a day I wouldn't be a better competitor I wouldn't do better in fights now I found a way of I basically found a way of okay this is what I need to make my life better and make my competition better I perform much better doing this I perform I perform much better having that distance from from from all that competitive things and and so yeah I need it now I know so where are you saying right now you're healed up you're ready to go you just sit and wait for a call your manager informs the UFC that you're ready to go into camp I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to I'm ready to go in camp I'm training right now I'm healed up I'm a hundred percent so but how does that work do you do you contact the UFC and try to negotiate something to try to get something going you wait for them to contact you or do you wait for this deep a Miocic DC fight basically I just waiting for them to come with something that makes sense for me and so there's been no discussion so far no no not really and not really no there's gotta be kind of frustrating yeah you know it's been some discussions but but nothing that really Noth nothing that really nothing that will account on or anything like that it's just been just been up in there and I'm just waiting for something on the table that makes sense I'm ready to go man so what would make sense other than Jon Jones other than DC what would make sense you as the number one contender right now John's unranked because right now he's currently suspended but as soon as they put him back in he's likely to be right up there with you and then you have DC I mean who else in your division makes any sense now they were to offer you a fight now if Jon Jones is gonna be suspended still for another six months or whatever it's gonna be who makes sense in your division for you other than DC well I wish had an answer to that right now but I really don't I just you know I just feel like it has to be it has to be a meaningful offer it has to be something that I feel this is right this is this is what I want I feel like man in my position in my career right now every fight every fight has to mean something with you at the top really the fight to make is one of two DC or John yes those are the two fights yeah or it could be something else to Joe but it has to be it has to be has to feel right though has to feel right and and has to be has to be something meaningful like a big main event on Fox or something like that yeah something where it's a big fight to show something good and you know everybody knows I want to step it up in that of their own I'm gonna perform and I'm gonna make a show and and I'm looking for that goal that's all I'm seeing well listen man I'm a fan it's been a pleasure to be able to commentate your fights I really enjoy watching fight I really enjoy watch you develop the whole process and I really appreciate you coming on here man pretty much having good luck to you appreciate that the mauler ladies and gentlemen [Music]
