hmm so Jamie pointed out this this congressman is that who it is the Jamie pointed this out that there's a congressman and he released a series of tweets and the first letter of all these tweets if you put them all together it says Epstein didn't kill himself or did not kill so notice it didn't he did how do you do the posture should have gone with did not darting here with that evidence of a link wrapped Paul gaw sir what are the odds this guy did this accidentally really small right that's kind of like one of those monkeys typing Shakespeare say yeah yeah I don't think I could it could work and the thing is he did it backwards right so you didn't see what the puzzle was until the last tweet because the last time he does in E I got a tweet from someone about 35 minutes ago that I don't know if there's a bunch of people online paying attention to it or what but someone alerted me and a few other people what it is yeah does he have an image of that fucking that crazy mask is that in his shit too okay he's a agent he's got the I was November first V mask yes yeah what is that mask for Vendetta was a representative of something it's the Guy Fawkes mask yes that's right right yeah so this guy's uh he's he's thinking along alternative lines of thought but that is really an interesting way of saying it alphabet tree that's yeah just making a bunch of tweets don't ever address it just leave it there walk away you know Lewis Carroll was famous for that was he yeah that was one of uh he did a lot of sort of tricks with words you read the book g√∂del Escher Bach No yeah there's a whole bunch of stuff in there about people who used who put puzzles in text mmm you know that's kind of a thing that people did I guess back more in the 18th century in before well this Epstein case is probably the most blatant example of a public murder of a crucial witness I've ever seen in my entire life or anybody's ever seen and the the the minimal amount of outrage about this the no minimal amount of cover it's fuckin fascinating I mean I what's amazing to me just as a you know somebody works in the media is that this was shaping up to be the biggest like news story in history yes and the instant he you know he died or was died or however you want to call it it this story just fell off the face of the earth it's like nobody's doing anything about it and I I don't 100% understand that I mean I get it why that's happening but it's it's just amazing well when the woman from ABC what was her name Amy that lady the the one who wrote Roebuck you who had the frustrated moment that she called it a frustrating private moment right what she was talking about having the scoop and having that story and them squashing it right like this this is all stuff that everybody used to think was conspiracy everybody's think this was stoner talk this was you know you don't I mean like this is stuff where people just a delusional they believe all kinds of wacky conspiracies sure but the reality is much less complicated well this is not possible this is one of those things it's so obvious it's so in everyone's face well there's a couple of things going on because there there are many different ways than this can play out I mean you could have a news director who just sort of instinctively decides well we can't do that story because I might want to have well and quedan later or I might want to have this politician on later and it's it's not like anybody tells them necessarily that we can't do this but sighs too hot you if you grow up in this system and you've been in the the business for a long time you just you have all these things that are drilled into you and almost like the cellular level about what you can and cannot get into and I think there but there were some explicit things that happen with Epstein to I mean they keep there there were a lot of news agencies that killed stories about him that you know and we're hearing what some of them in Vanity Fair this thing you know so yeah it's it's bit stay it's bad it's terrible yeah yeah when when I found out that Clinton flew no less than 26 times on a plane with Epstein I was like dude I haven't flown that many times with my mom long did he know Epstein yeah I don't know but I mean they have that many flights to have the Secret Service people involved I mean that's incredibly bold what was he dealing with just girls was Clinton that much of a hound that he would go that deep into the well that many times 26 times well that's the thing about the Epson story that makes no sense to me like I I thought that the percentage of people who were out and out like perverts who had a serious problem like with petty ophelia or whatever it was was pretty small you know yeah but your but they had a lot of people coming in and out of this compound and and it just seems like it's a it's a very strange story what were they really up to I have I have no idea and was was it all a blackmail scheme it's just it's just so strange well seems like the pedophilia aspect of it might be directly connected to Epstein himself like he might be the one that has a problem with girls that are like 16 and he likes them very or he did like them but with the other guys it could just be girls it could be yeah yeah I mean that's why it's so crazy like how could it be that these but maybe it's not but they must but they knew who he was yeah but they probably didn't know the extent of it probably not yeah up until a point up until he was arrested right and then they're like oh well then that's when everybody backed off of him right yes yeah I mean I'm not a hundred percent yeah I haven't covered this story in depth I've only I only really got into it a little bit we made you cuz it mixes a lot of things that are are very tough to cover yes you know the intelligence world is very tough to cover mm-hm you know it's it's hard to get stories out of there that they don't want you to have yeah and this is this is like the mother of all stories and you know in terms of that and they're just little little bread crumbs here and there that whole thing about Acosta you know the vanity vanity fair-- quote from him is that when he said that when he looked at the case he didn't do it because I was told he belonged to intelligence yes what does that mean right now whose intelligence you know what I mean like what agency but what for you and then you pair that with things like you know I have friends on Wall Street who told me I've never heard a single instance of this guy actually having a trade right you know so what was his hedge fund doing you know I mean if you think about it hedge funds a perfect way to do blackmail well because you can just have people putting money in and out all the time and it would look like investment yeah so very strange story well Eric Weinstein had a conversation with him you know Eric Weinstein with Peter Thiel capital right yeah he's like this guy does know what the fuck he's talking about oh yeah he's an actor right this is nonsense right right that was initial almost instantaneous response yeah yeah and and and what real clients did he ever have what any jewelry trade and what has he got a billion dollars or whatever he had yeah no it's half a billion under management yeah it's ridiculous why the guy who owns Victoria Secrets give him a seventy million dollar home right in New York City like why I mean these are all things that would have been really interesting to get into you know try to kill himself the suicide didn't happen to him like in the wire all right oh yeah yeah so unfortunate so unfortunately the cameras died so unfortunately sustained an injury that's uh that you usually only get through strangulation right yeah murders you he fell on the ground and accidentally broke his hyoid bone yeah big deal I mean it's so bizarre I can't stand consider conspiracy theories I'm one of these people who who doesn't like reading but I can't I can't make this story work in a way that isn't you know yes pure toriel's well that's the thing it's like it gets to a point where you like okay even Michael Shermer who runs skeptic magazine wait a minute the cameras we're not working seems like a conspiracy fucking when Michael Shermer says he that guy doesn't believe in anything right right he is fucking he's down the line on virtually every single thing that's ever happened he doesn't believe in any conspiracies well well how do you what's the innocent explanation for any has none that doesn't make any sense you can't you can't spin it in any way to make it not a crazy conspiracies especially when the the brother as a doctor to do an autopsy oh yeah it says date I was fucking murdered right yeah Michael Baden the famous guy from the HBO autopsy show right yep absolutely Oh craziness complete craziness and you know it's an example of you know the FG star it's interesting because it's because it's about villains on both sides of the aisle right this is a classic is something I've written about before is that the press does not like to do stories where the problem is bipartisan yeah right so when you have an institutional problem when Democrats and Republicans both share responsibility for it when you know or or if it's an institution that kind of exists in perpetuity no matter what the administration is we don't really like to do those stories we like if Fox likes to do stories about Democrats MSNBC likes to do stories about Republicans but the thing that's kind of you know all over the place they don't like to do that story Epstein is you know he's friends with Trump and and with Clinton I mean yeah obviously has more friends on the Clinton side but still and I think that's this is one of the reasons why this story doesn't have a lot of traction in the media because neither side really likes the idea of going too deeply on it feels like to me well it's but the the blatant aspect of it they don't mean the closest that we have to that is the absolute murder the Jamal Khashoggi murder that's the closest thing we have to or is absolute murder right this one but but it's also so insanely blatant but now you have foreign actors that are involved in it and they all disperse and then there's left with this confusion of to who's responsible for it well Saudi Arabia that's another example where you can't really say it's you know one side of the both parties have been incredibly complicit in their cooperation with the Saudi regime and in you know the massacres that are going on Yemen it's a classic example of what Noam Chomsky used to talk about with worthy and unworthy victims right like if the Soviet communists did it they were that was bad but if death squads in El Salvador killed a priest or a Catholic priest you know then that that was something we didn't write about because they were our client state Yemen is a story we don't write about Syria is a story we do write about but they're really equivalent stories and yeah the but you're absolutely right the khashoggi thing I don't think either party and or either sides media really wants to get into that all that deeply how much is media shifting now like you've obviously been a journalist for a long time but come how much are things changing in the light of the Internet well a lot and this is what I mean I have a new book out now that's really about this right what why the business has changed what's it called hey dink yeah it's out its out now and it's it's really about how the press the business model the press has changed I mean it's something that you talk about a lot you hear you on your show all the time talking about how news agencies are always trying to push narratives on people trying to get people wound up and upset and that is a conscious business strategy that we didn't have maybe 30 years ago you know you think about Walter Cronkite or what the news was like back in the day you had the whole family sitting around the table and everybody watched it was sort of a unifying experience to watch the news hmm now you have news for the crazy right-wing uncle and then you have news for the kid in the che shirt and their different channels and they're trying to wind these these people up you know to get them upset constantly and stay there and a lot of that has to do with the Internet because before the internet news companies had like a basically free way of making money they dominated distribution the newspaper was the only thing in town that had a you know if you wanted to get a wan ad it had to be through the local newspaper now with the internet the internet is the distribution system anybody has access to it not just the local newspaper and so there the easy money is gone and we have to chase clicks more than we ever had had to before we have to chase eyeballs more than we have to so we've had to build new money-making strategies and and a lot of it has to do with just sort of monetizing anger and division and all these things and we just didn't do that before and it's a had a profound difference on the on the media as a writer if you personally experienced this sort of the influence where people have tried to lean you in the direction of clickbait or perhaps maybe alter titles that make them a little bit disingenuous in order to get people excited about the I mean you know I my editors at Rolling Stone are pretty good in it and they give me a lot of weight leeway to kind of explore whatever I want to explore but I definitely feel a lot of pressure that I didn't feel before in the business because especially in the Trump era and and you know I've written a lot about the Russia story right but you know that's an example of one size media does has one take on it and another size media has another take on it and if you are just the journalist and you and you want to just sort of report the facts you feel a lot of pressure to fit the facts into a narrative that your audience is gonna like and I had a lot of problem with the Russia story because I thought you know I don't like Donald Trump but I'm like I don't I don't think this guy's James Bond consorting with Russian spies I think he's corrupt in other ways and there was a lot of blowback on my side of the business because you know people in sort of liberal quote-unquote liberal media you just have all there's a lot of pressure to have everybody fit into a certain narrative and I think that's really unhealthy for the business yeah very unhealthy right it's you know because as soon as people can be manipulated to conform it to that narrative then all sorts of stories can be shifted oh yeah yeah absolutely and and you the the job used to be about challenging your audience every now and then right like if you think a certain thing is true well it's our job to give you the bad news and say that you're wrong about that that used to be what the job was to be journalists now it's the opposite now we have an audience we're gonna tell you exactly what you want to hear and what you and we're gonna reinforce what you think and that's very unhealthy a great example of this was in the summer of 2016 I was covering the campaign I started to hear reporters talking about how they didn't want to report poll numbers that showed the race was closed they thought that that was gonna hurt Hillary all right like we said in other words we had information that the race was closed and we're not telling this to audiences because they wanted to hear that it was gonna be a blowout for Hillary right on and that didn't help Hillary it didn't help the Democrats do not warn people about this right but it was just because if you turned on MSNBC or CNN and you heard that Trump was within five points or whatever it was that was gonna be a bummer for that audience so we stayed away from it and you know this is the kind of thing it's it's not politically beneficial to anybody it's just we're just trying to keep people glued to the set by telling them what they want to hear and that's not the news that's not that's not our job you know and it drives me crazy yeah it should drive you crazy that what you said about journalism being it used to be something that you're challenging your reader you're you're giving them this reality that may be uncomfortable but it's it's educational and expands their view of the world this where do they get that now they don't that's the whole problem like you get you can predict exactly what the each news organization what their take is going to be on any issue by going oh just did you take an example when when the business about the Isis leader al Baghdadi being killed hit the news instantaneously you knew that the New York Times CNN and the Washington Post that they were going to write a whole bunch of stories about how Trump was overplaying the significance of it that he you know that he was telling lies about it they were they mate they you knew they were gonna make the entire thing about Trump and then meanwhile Fox had a completely different spin on about how heroic it was but but news audiences didn't have anywhere to go to just simply hear who was this person why was he important what were the growth of the people in the region think you know what kind of what is this gonna mean going forward is they actually gonna have any impact you know is are we gonna have to continually you know is there gonna be a new person like this every every time are we actually accomplishing it you don't get that anywhere all you get is Trump is a shithead on one side and Trump is a hero on the other side that's that's not the news you know yeah and but the thing is it's like the business aspect of it is so weird like you have your guys like Hannity or you can absolutely predict what that guy's gonna say every single time you know what side he's on and he's blatant about it mhm and when you see someone like that you go okay well this is okay where this is this is peak bullshit right so where where do we go where I see both sides where's the where's the where's the middle ground where someone goes well this is true but you gotta say this is honest too and this is this is what's going on over on this side and the Republicans have a point here and you don't you don't there's no mainstream media place where you can go for that right now no there isn't and that's I mean I mean one of this is one of things already but this is one of the reasons why shows like yours are so popular I mean I think there's a complete loss of trust that they feel like people are not being honest with them all right and they're not being straight and you know they they come to people like you and and a lot of other people of independent folks who aren't like the quote-unquote mainstream media because they it's not really thought it's not reporting it's not anything if you can predict a hundred percent what a person's going to say that's not thinking that's not reporting that's not it's just marketing someone like me that's so disturbing I'm a fuckin comedian and a Cagefighting commentator when people are coming to me like this is this is the source where you go for unbiased representations of what's going on the world that's crazy well I mean I started interview with Barry Weiss right and you just you did a simple base you didn't go to journalism school right no no so she said something about how you know oh she's an Assad toady and you said what does that mean you just ask the simple basic questions right what does that mean where is that coming from how do you know that you know yeah like journalism isn't brain surgery that's all it is is to asking the simple questions that sort of pop to mind when you when you're in a situation like where did this happen how do we know that that's true and but there's a whole generation of people in the press now who just simply do not do that go through the process of just asking simple questions like how do I know that's true like after each story your report you're supposed to kind of like wipe your memory clean and start over so just because somebody was banned the last time you covered them doesn't mean that they're necessarily going to be the bad guy this time you cover them all right you have to continually test your assumptions and ask yourself is this true is that true is this true how do we know this and we've just stopped doing that like the it's just the maratha of like pre-written takes on things and it's it's really really bad and you can see why audiences are fleeing from this stuff they just don't have the impact they used to well it's really interesting this a lot of this is this unpredicted consequence of having these open platforms like Facebook and like where people are getting their news and then the algorithm sort of directs them towards things that are going to piss them off which I don't even think necessarily was initially the plan I think the plan is to accelerate engagement right so they find out what what what you're engaging with what stories you're engaging with and then they give you more of that like re my friend Ari Shaffir actually tried this out and what he did was he went on YouTube and only looked puppy videos and that's all he looked at for like weeks and then YouTube only started recommending puppy videos to him so it's not necessarily that Facebook wants you to be outraged but that when you are outraged whether it's over abortion or war whatever the subject is you're going to engage more and their algorithm favors you engaging more so if you're engaging more about something very positive you know if you're all about yoga and meditation your algorithm would probably favor yoga and meditation because those are the things that you engage with but it's natural for people to be pissed off sure to look for things that are annoying especially if you're done working and you're like kind this world sucks what's going on that sucks worse and then you go to your Facebook and oh Jesus look at this goddamn border crisis right oh Jesus look at this while fucking here's the problem with these goddamn liberal they don't know sure and you engage and then that's your life and then it's it's saying oh I know how to get mad all fired up I'm gonna fucking send them some abortion stories whoa right and then that's your feed right yeah exactly but the but there's so many economic incentives that go in there right they know the more that you engage the longer that you're on right the more ads yes you can you're gonna see yeah right so that same dynamic that Facebook and and the social media companies figure it out which is that if you keep feeding something somebody something that you know has been proven to spin that person up and get them wound up that they're gonna they're gonna come back for more of it and they're gonna keep coming back and actually you can expand their desire just to see that stuff by by making them sort of more angry overall and they will they will come back and they will spend more and more and more time well the news companies figured out the same thing and they're just they're just funneling stuff at you that they know you're gonna you're gonna just be in an endless cycle of sort of an impotent mute rage all the time but it's kind of addicting you know and they know that and in there and it's it's sort of like the tobacco companies they know it's a bet it's a product that's bad for you and they just keep giving it to you because you know it makes money for them yeah and it's just the thing about it is all of it is about ads told how many clicks they get in ads if they just said you can have a social media company but you can't have ads there's a new federal law no more ads on Facebook no more ads on YouTube no our ads on Twitter no more ads on Instagram good luck right yeah we're all collapse yo yeah but that seems to be what it is it's like they figured out that your data is worth a tremendous amount of money and the way they can utilize that money is to sell advertising mm-hmm ya know they they coulda coming and going because they're they're not only selling you ads or but they're also collecting the information about your habits which they can then sell again yeah so it's a it's a dual revenue stream you know is it the media companies they're basically they're just consumer businesses where they're they're trading attention for ad space right so if they can get you to watch four hours of television a day they have that many ad slots that they can show you and they know how much money they're gonna make you know but the the social media companies get it two ways they're they they get it by you know attracting your eyeballs and then also selling selling your habits to the other the next set of advertise which you know is very insidious but what's interesting about this is that most people don't think about this as a consumer business right like Americans these days are very conscious of like what they put in their bodies you know they won't eat too many candy bowl depending on who they are right but people at least look at what the calories are but they don't think about the news that way or social media like that with it put on their brains and it's also a consumer product yeah it really is I've gone over that many times with people that that's a diet this is your diet you have a mental diet as well as you have a physical like food diet absolutely of an information diet and a lot of people are just eating shit with their brain it's the worst kind of junk food it's like it's like a cigarette sandwich the stuff yeah it's so fucking bad and it's getting worse it is it is getting worse and it's what's weird is that this is a ten-year-old problem and no one saw it coming and it's kind of overtaking politics it's overtaking the social discourse everybody's wrapped up in social media conversations they carry them on over to the dinner table and it gets people in arguments at work and all this stuff no one saw coming these that no one saw the this outrage economy from you know social media sites from things like Facebook no one saw that no one no one ever predicted that your data was gonna be so valuable no the fuck saw that I don't think anybody I mean I think some people in the tech business probably saw early on yeah it's a potential for this but you know in terms of other other businesses like the news media and also politics I mean you have to think about the impact of this on politics has been enormous you know I covered Donald Trump Trump really was just all about whatever you're pissed off about I'm right there with you you know and people are just sort of pissed off about lots of things these days because they're doing this all day long you know and if you if you can if you can take advantage of that then you're gonna have a lot of success and I think I think a lot of people haven't figured that out and some of these things are real causes like people are upset about real things but it's just yeah you're absolutely right people did not see this coming and they didn't prepare for it's just weird that it's one of the biggest sources of income on and people didn't see it coming I mean Facebook is generating billions of dollars and now yeah potentially shifting global politics yeah and you know the the whole issue of a couple of companies like Facebook having control over what you do and do not see is yeah it's an enormous problem that nobody nobody really cares about I've tried to write about it a few times I've written a couple of features about it what about how what a serious problem this is look if you look at other countries like Israel China there there are a number of companies where you've seen this this pattern of internet platforms liaison with the government to decide what people can and cannot see and they'll say well we don't want to see you know Palestinian protest movement so we don't want to see you know the Venezuelan Channel tell us or like we want to take that off you think about how that could end up happening in the United States and it is already a little bit happening it's a little bit but it seems to be happening only in the terms of like leaning towards the progressive side which people are okay with because they think especially in the light of Donald Trump being in office this is acceptable censorship yeah but they're I think they're wrong about I think you're wrong about that - yeah and terribly dangerous it's very short-sighted yes in and they and I think there's there's also this thing that happens with people where they think well this is never gonna happen to me you know like you can do that bad thing to this person that I don't like but you know as long as it's never gonna happen to me exactly but they're wrong and my history shows it always does happen to you you know and that's so we're giving these companies an enormous amount of power to decide all kinds of things what we look at what what kind of political ideas we can be exposed to you know I think it's very very dangerous that biased interpretation of what something is that was what people talked about when the initial Patriot Act was enacted when people were like hey this might be fine with Obama in office right maybe Obama is not going to enact some of the worst clauses of this and use it on people or the was the NDAA so I would rise yeah where some of the things were just completely unconstitutional but don't worry we're not gonna use those but you're setting these tools aside for whatever fucking president we have like what if we have a guy you out trumps Trump right I mean we never thought we'd have a Trump right what if we have a next-level guy post Trump what if there's some sort of catastrophe tragedy attack something that really gets people fired up and they vote in someone who takes it up to another level and then he has these tools and then he uses these tools on his political enemies which is entirely possible well I mean we've already seen that a little bit I mean people don't want to bring this up I mean i but you know a lot of the stories that have come out about Trump they're coming from leaks of classified information that are coming from those war on terror programs that were instituted after 9/11 yes this is five the certifies Amendments Act the NSA programs to collect data like they're they're unmasking people like we have a lot of evidence now that there was a lawsuit a couple that came out about a month ago that showed that the FBI was doing something like 60,000 searches a month at one point where they're on you know they were asking the NSA for the ability to unmask names and that that sort of thing so we're I mean these tools are incredibly powerful they're incredibly dangerous but people thought after 9/11 they were scared so you know we want to protect ourselves so that's okay for now you know well we'll pull it back later but they mean it but you never do pull it back right no and I mean it always ends up being used by somebody in the wrong way and I think we're starting to see that that's going to be a problem yeah I'm real concerned about places like Google and Facebook altering the path of free speech and and leaning people in certain directions and silencing people that have opposing viewpoints and the fact that they think that they're doing this for good because this is how they see the world and they don't understand that you have to let these ideas play out in the marketplace of free speech and free ideas if you don't do that if you don't do that if you don't let people debate the merits the pros the cons what's wrong what's right if you don't do that then you don't get real discourse if you don't get real discourse you're essentially you've got some sort of an intellectual dictatorship going on and because it's a progressive dictatorship you think it's okay because it's people who want everybody be inclusive and you know I mean this is this is a weird time for that it's a really weird time for that because as you said people are so short-sighted they don't understand that these like the First Amendment's in place for a very good reason and set up a long fucking time ago because they did the math they saw where it was going and they were like look we have to have the ability to express ourselves we have to have the ability to freely express thoughts and ideas and challenge people that are in a position of power because if we don't we wind up exactly where we came from mm-hmm yeah no and and courts continually reaffirmed that idea that the the the way to deal with bad speech was with more speech yes and they did it over and over and over again you know we we the the legal standard for speech you know still I think remains that unless it's directly inciting violence you couldn't you could like you can have speech that incites violence generally and even the the Supreme Court even upheld that you can have speech that's that comes from you know material that was stolen illegally that's okay but we had a very very high bar for prohibiting speech always and you know the the liable cases this the cases for defamation you know that also established a very very high standard for punishing speech but now all of a sudden people have a completely different idea but it's like you know forget about the fact that this was a fundamental concept in American society for you know two hundred and thirty years or what they just want to change it you know without thinking about the consequences well that's where a guy like Trump could be almost like it's almost like a Trojan horse in a way like if you wanted to play 3d chess which you would do you'd get a guy who's just so egregious and so outrageous and then so many people opposed them get that guy let him get into a position of power and then sit back watch the outrage bubble and then take advantage of that and funnel people into certain directions I mean I don't think that's what's happening but if I was super fucking tinfoil Hattie that's how I would go about it I would say this is what you want if you really want to change things for your direction put someone that opposes it that's disgusting and that way people just a rational intelligent person is never gonna side with him so they're gonna side with the people that oppose him and then you could sneak a lot of shit in that maybe they wouldn't agree with and any other circumstance yeah Trump's election sort of like another 9/11 right like you know 9/11 happened all of a sudden people who weren't in favor of the government being able to go through your library records or listen to your phone calls and all of a sudden they were like oh Jesus I'm so freaked out like yeah fine when Trump got elected all of a sudden people suddenly had very different ideas about speech and like they you know hey that guy's so bad you know that maybe we should consider banning x y&z yeah and I yeah it's me if he was conceived as a way to discredit the First Amendment and some other ideas that would that would that would be a brilliant 3d chess move yeah super sneaky yeah that's like China level many steps ahead exactly I mean what do you think all this goes it seems like this is I mean obviously just wrote a book about it but it seems like this is accelerating and it doesn't seem like anyone's taking a step back and hitting the brakes or opting out it seems like people are just ramping up the rhetoric yeah I mean I think that the the divisive miss problem is is going to get worse before it gets better the the business model of of of the media now is so entrenched that until some of these these companies start going out of business because they're doing you know they're losing audience because people don't trust them anymore the you know the news is going to keep doing what it's doing it's gonna Canada model is gonna become normal for for news companies I think it or it already basically is you know on both the left and the right and in terms of you know the Internet companies they're consolidating they're getting more and more power all the time and there's I I think we've already seen that people have I think too much tolerance for letting letting them make decisions about what we can and cannot see and I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better I don't know what do you think I yeah that's what I think I mean Facebook Twitter all these play Twitter has some of the most ridiculous reasons for banning people one of them is dead naming oh yeah so if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce right okay I like you better when you were Bruce banned for life right you can't even say I liked you better when you were Bruce banned for life right yeah and and and actually that that what's really interesting about that is that's a that's a core concept that we've changed completely like all the different ways in the past that we punished speech we punished the speech not the person yes right so if you know liable defamation all those things first of all they were all done through the courts so you had a way to fight back if you thought you were unjustly accused of having defamed somebody or live with somebody but if they found against you the person who got something out of it was the person who was directly harmed right and again the courts judged that and they you know it wasn't like you were banned from for life from ever speaking again right they just gave a bunch of money to a person who might have suffered some kind of career injury or whatever it was because of that and usually there was a retraction or it was removed from the press or whatever it was but it wasn't like we were we were saying we're never gonna allow you to be hurt or seen from again we kind of won't we were sort of encouraging optimistically people to get better right and yeah and to be different right now and now we're not doing that at all now we're just saying you won one strike or two strikes whatever you're gone and it's not like it's a public thing so you can't sue over it right yeah well that's what's crazy about it because it is a public utility in a way yes it is even Jack Dorsey from Twitter and admitted as much on the podcast and he wishes that we would view it that way he's actually proposed two versions of Twitter a Twitter with their standard censorship in place and then a Wild West Twitter mm-hmm but I'm like sign me up right yeah on that Wild West Twitter right is the problem with like things like gab and I've gone there a few times and watched it and I mean even Milo Union apple√≠s is criticized for being this is that it's just like so hate-filled because it's the place where you can go and fuckin say anything right so the only people that it's attracting are people that just want to go there and just fucking shoot off canons of n-bombs and RAL everybody a kike it's crazy I mean it's and there's real communication there as well there's there's plenty of that too but the sheer number of people that go there just to blow off steam because they can't say those things on Twitter or Facebook or any other social media platform without being banned because of that it becomes a channel for it mm-hmm you know and it's like it doesn't get a chance it doesn't get a chance to the concept is great the concept is if you're not doing anything illegal we're not gonna stop you're not daxing anybody you're not threatening anybody's life we're not gonna stop you go ahead but if you you do that and you're the only one that does that unfortunately everyone who wants to just say fucked up shit goes right and you get a disproportionate amount of fucked up shit yeah and it's directly because the fact that these places like Twitter or Facebook have censored and they make it so you are scared to say whatever you want to say mm-hmm and so you can so even if you have controversial ideas that maybe some people would agree with in someone you get banned for life for just controversial ideas even controversial ideas that are scientifically and biologically factual right the transgender issue like if you say there's a woman I brought her up a million times when Megan Murphy yes a man is never a woman she says they tell her to take it down she takes a screenshot of it puts that up takes it down but takes a screenshot of the initial tweet haha look at that banned for life right a man is never a woman is a fact that is a fact it's a biological fact now if you decide to become a woman and we recognize you as a woman in society well that's just common courtesy in my eyes like you have a person who has this issue they feel like they were born in the wrong body okay I get that I'm cool with that but to make it so that you're banned forever you can call someone a dumb fuck an idiot a piece of shit your mother should have swallowed you everybody's like yeah do Petain Terms of Service seem fine here everything's good say a man is never a woman gone for life right yeah Caitlyn Jenner I liked you better when you're bruce dunn that's it yeah no and and it's crazy and obviously people see that and they and they just get matter and and it seems to legitimate it makes people very very resentful in ways that they wouldn't be otherwise it makes there's no pathway there's no there's no other thing right there's no free speech platform that's universally accepted like these ones like I said like gab or there's a couple other ones out there there's not no one's using them yeah it's a very small percentage of the people in comparison to something like Twitter which is enormous right and so because people don't want to be kicked off the platform they're radically changing there is no sense right and we're seeing this a lot also with political ideas to like you know you know I have a podcast used useful idiots it's called right we're like we try to talk to people who are kind of excluded from mainstream media because that's happening a lot now right like if you have the wrong idea about anything whether it's Russia gate or the israel-palestine conflict or Syria or whatever it is you'll you will suddenly be sort of labeled I mean with tulsi gabbard friends they call her an assadist right like once you get stuck with the term assadist on twitter nobody wants to associate you with you no one wants to defend you right they all kind of and be it's your you're like suddenly like the kid with lice and people don't want that to happen to them so they stop saying X Y & Z yeah right and and they just sort of go with with the flow will go with the crowd and it causes this sort of you know uniform conformist discourse that does isn't really about anything right people are afraid to talk which is crazy yeah right well you're not supposed to talk to someone I experience this all the time the this idea of giving someone a platform like look if I have someone on like a ben shapiro or something like that you shouldn't give that guy a platform well he's already got a platform should wouldn't be better if I just talk to him and find out what his ideas are and ask him about those ideas like we had a very bizarre conversation about gay people where it means basically full on biblical religious interpretation of gay people which to me is always strange like okay how do you stand on shellfish you know do you just as strong on shrimp whereas your on gay guys right like why is it gay guys it's that like the Bible's pretty clear on a bunch of different things that don't seem to fire people up the way homosexuality does like why why do you care if you had a friend that was eating shrimp would you go to his house we had shrimp cocktail no but you wouldn't go to a friend's house if he was having a gay marriage mm-hmm so you won't celebrate gay marriage but you don't mind a guy who's got a fucking a shellfish platter right out at a party like that's in the Bible man right you're not supposed to wear two different kinds of cloth you you know that is the bunt there's a bunch of shit in the Bible that you like Wow God was wrong about that like how confident are you right how comforting you that you can interpret God's Word so perfectly that you're like you let the lobster slide but all that but fucking we got to stop that you know like it's really weird but that's the whole point of you to challenge the idea yes yes but but the prevailing view now is that even having the discussion yes because you have a platform I mean I read that thing in Al and the Atlantic you know where they're like you you you give people to I forget what the phrase was they were saying something like you had I give to people too many chances too many chances the people who had already forfeited the right to have them or something something along those lines but that was silly yeah guy gave up his hand when he said about me that I'm inexhaustible but that he like snaps right oh it's about you and now that's what it is you not you like naps okay so you don't like people that have energy I'm super sorry but the the you know I thought that piece was really interesting because that the whole idea that there are people who have forfeited the right to take a forever to communicate forever well who decides that I mean it again there's this there's this intellectual snob ISM yet goes on and you know frankly on my side of the media aisle where well we'll decide what what an appropriate thought is what's what's right thinking what's wrong thinking you know what who gets to have a platform who doesn't get to have a platform who we who were gonna call a monster who are not currently I mean Minh Tunder stand that the arrogance where from to decide that some people you know and I totally disagree with people like you know Alex Jones or Shapiro or you know most things and but I don't think that they should be wiped off the face of the earth I mean I don't know well it's interesting to challenge people on these weird ideas and find out how they come to them and and you will get a lot of fence sitters that will recognize the flaws in their thinking if you let them talk because there's a lot of people that aren't sure either way maybe they haven't invested a lot of time investigating it maybe they really don't know what this guy stands for maybe they just read a cartoonish version of who he is and then you get to hear them talking to go oh well I see the flaw in his thinking or oh well he's right about some things and a lot of people are right about some things they're wrong about things and they're right about things and the only way you can discern that is you communicate with them but as soon as you deep platform people like forever you're just gonna make a bunch of angry people you're just gonna make a bunch of people that are completely distrusting and you're gonna absolutely empower the opponents of your ideas but like people that do get to when when do they get a chance to have their voice well when they vote so the more you do this shit the more you censor conservatives the more they're gonna vote against liberals this is just a fact mm-hmm there's no getting around that this is human nature yeah I mean I I lived in the former Soviet Union you know for 11 years and 100% if you lived in Soviet Russia and something was published by an official publisher people thought it was basically bullshit right but if it was in the samizdat if it was in the privately circled stuff that had been repressed and censored people thought that was the coolest thing in the world like that that was the hot ticket right and you're automatically giving something cachet and an added weight by censoring it I mean this is just proof it's just the way it works it's human nature if people think that you don't want them to see something they're gonna run through it twice as hard you know so I just don't understand a lot of that instinct I think people people have this idea that it works that you know the deep platforming works but you can't deep platformer an idea you know you may be able to do it to a person or to yes but you eventually you have to confront the idea you could do it to a few people and it has been successful which is one of the reason why people are so emboldened like they have a successful IDI platform Milo mm-hmm I mean they really have it's very hard to hear him talk anymore you don't he's not in the public conversation the way he used to be right because they kicked him off of all these different platforms and if you go into why they kicked him off these different platforms but even if you don't agree with him and I don't own a lot of things like boy I don't agree with kicking him off those platforms if you you listen to what he got kicked off for it's like man I don't know this this doesn't seem like this makes a lot of sense yeah no I mean the same thing with Alex Jones yeah Alex Alex Jones has said you know he's got after me a couple of times in ways that were pretty funny actually but when he was you know kicked off the all these platforms you know I wrote a piece saying I think people are kind of doing an end zone dance a little early on this one you know because you Jones is a classic example of how the system the way the system used to work they would have punished him for for being in the libelous about the Sandy Hook thing right because that that would sort of fit the classic definition of what was what prohibited speech was before but we wouldn't any he would have lost probably a lot and he still might on in those court cases but to remove him forever I think you know it just sets it it creates a new way of dealing with speech that I think is very dangerous you know right because the goalposts keep getting moved right if you can ban him for that then why don't you ban me for repeating the things that I said about Megan Murphy right or ban because what I said about Bruce Jenner banned this for that I mean you it gets you get further and further down the line you keep moving these goalposts and next thing you know you're in a very rigid tightly controlled area where you can communicate and you're suppressed and that just it accelerates your desire to step out of that boundary and it makes you want to say things that maybe you wouldn't even have thought of before and also logistically it's an incredibly it's a it's an insane thing to even think about asking platforms to rationally go through all this content I talked to somebody who a pretty high-ranking Facebook executive after the Alex Jones thing and he said think about what we used to used to do just to keep porn off Facebook and we're dealing with what a couple of billion items of content every single day we had these really high-tech algorithms that we design to look for flesh tones at that site and that's how the Vietnamese running girl photo got taken off Facebook because they like automatically spotted a naked girl I know and they took that down you know the he's like the Facebook I'll go doesn't know that's an icon of fucking journalism right like it just knows it's a naked girl so you say you take that and now you're gonna ask Facebook to make decisions about about ideas right like if it's that hard and that expensive for us to go through and just just to keep child porn off of Facebook think about how crazy it's gonna be when we when we start having entry-level people deciding what is and is not appropriate political content yeah it's it's not only gonna be impossible to enforce it's it's gonna they're gonna make a mess of it and they will and they already are you know and I think that's what we're seeing well that's why Twitter so weird because you can get away with shit on Facebook you can say things on Facebook like Facebook doesn't have a policy about dead naming or Facebook doesn't have a policy about misgendering people but they do have a porn policy well now Twitter you can have porn right me then I will have to be very careful when I give my phone to my kids that make sure they don't open up the fucking Twitter app yeah because I follow a lot of dirty girls and some of them I mean they're it's just right there there's no warning bang right in your face I mean it's kind of crazy right they have such an open policy when it comes to sex which I'm happy they do I'm happy not even that I want to see porn but I'm happy that their attitude is just fine it's legal do yeah you don't have to follow those people if you don't like it seems like it's in the American spirit to be I know but but it all comes down to for me but but ya know the the policies are completely inconsistent to with with Twitter like I've seen I mean I've talked to people who have been removed from Twitter for saying pretty you know pretty borderline things right like they're you know basically pretty mild insults or something that would be threatening only if you really splinted hard you know there was a guy from the Ron Paul Institute who got this who got taken down for instance because he was having a fight with some you know guy who was I think a Clinton fan I forget what it was exactly but you'll see behavior that's much worse from people who have another political ilk and they will not be removed or they might be a smaller profile person they won't be removed so and then what is that all about right like if if it's only a person who has 20,000 followers or higher we're gonna mean it's just so you just can't do it there's just too many layers and anyway I'm against it just generally but just in terms of logistics it doesn't make any sense I'm against it generally too and when I talked to Jack and he was explaining to me the problems with trying to manage things at scale you really kind of get a sense of it like oh you guys are dealing with billions and billions of humans using these things right yeah yeah and and but they're already you know in many countries around the world they have armies of thousands of people who go through content to try to flag this or that kind of political content yeah in a niche people yeah they have you know in Germany has like it got I forget what the term was they had this um some really scary sort of authoritarian word for like filtration centers or something like that you know the Chinese have have armies of people I mean I did a story about Facebook and how it was you know teaming up with groups like the the Atlantic Council here in the United States remember a couple of years ago the Senate called in Twitter Facebook and Google to Washington and asked them to devise strategies for preventing the sowing of discord you know so they basically what's asking them to come up with strategies for filtering out fake news and then also certain kinds of offensive content but you know that is a stepping stone to what we've we've seen in other countries I think you know and I think it's really worrisome but but nobody seems to care on our side of the aisle which is which is very strange myself it's miles well it's a it's a censorship issue you know and it's it's a short-sighted thing as you said before it's people and it's not even there's people that do pretty egregious things from the left like the Covington school thing when people were saying we got to Doc's these kids and give me their names release their names these people are still on Twitter to this day right talking about kids that just happen to have these make America great again hats and I have a friend who used to live in that area said like no you don't get it like there's these stands these kids are on the high school like field trip there's these stands we could buy these hats everywhere these kids bought the hats they're they think they're being funny these guys play the music and then get in their face you take a photo of it it looks like this guy's standing in this Native American guy's face but then you see the whole video it's no no the Native American guy was playing his drum walking towards him and then everybody sorts probably it's outrage cycle it's just so exhausting in a signaling everyone's signaling how virtuous they are everyone's signaling they're on the right side everyone's signaling you know I want names take these guys down like you're talking about sixteen year old kids right it's so fucking crazy and all what is he Vic he's guilty of smiling was that what he guilt he's guilty of yeah no he's got a mag a hat on I mean yeah it's crazy and the signaling thing is crazy and you know for me the in the in the news business a lot of people that I know went into the when at the journalism precisely because we didn't want to talk about our political views like the whole point of the job is like you know we're just gonna tell you what the facts are like not gonna tell you about what I'm all about you can't do that anymore everything's editorialize everything is about editorializing and signaling this is like what you're saying you're telling people what your stance is on things and that's that's the opposite of what the job used to be and this is again one of the things I've been trying to focus on is that you know what's exactly what you're talking about people used to go to the news because they wanted to find out what happened in the world and they can't do it anymore because everything that you turn on every kind of content is just editorialized content where people are sort of telling you where they stand on things and you know I don't want to know that I wouldn't know what the information yes it's so hard how does this get resolved because we're dealing with essentially a two decade old problem right I mean give or take before that before the this the social media and before the internet and websites this justice wasn't this wasn't what it was you could count on the New York Times to give you an unbiased version of what's going on in the world I don't necessarily know that's true anymore no no other times has kind of gone over to this model as well and they're super woke they've they've struggled with it they they were that there was an editorial and I wrote about this in the in the book that the in the summer of 2016 this guy Jim Ruttenberg wrote the sort of this piece said Trump is testing the norms of objectivity that was the name of the piece and basically what he said is Trump is so bad that we have to look like rethink what objectivity means we have to not only be true but true to history's judgment he said and we have to have copious coverage and a gret quote and aggressive coverage so we're gonna cover Trump a lot we're gonna cover him aggressively and we're gonna show you we're gonna take a stand on this issue rather than just tell you what happened right so rather than doing the traditional New York Times thing of just the facts will tell you sorted out right you figure out we're gonna tell you you know kind of had it what your stance should be and you know I think where does where do we go from here how does it get resolved I don't know because you know unless the the financial incentives change there they're not going to change you know the business used to be back when you're talking about with New York Times and then there were three networks and they were all trying to get the whole audience right so they were they were they were doing that kind of neutral fact-finding mission and it was working for them financially now they can't do that because of the internet it's it's you're hunting for audience and little groups yeah and they're just giving you hyper politicized stuff because that's the only way they can make money I don't know how we change it I don't know how we go you know we reverse it it's it's it's a problem it's so interesting though because I mean if you looked at human interactions and if you looked at you know dispensing news and information and you follow trends from like the 30s to the 40s to the 50s to the 60s to 70s he'd be like oh well people are getting better at this people getting better whoa whoa what the fuck is going on now everything is off the rails yes two camps barking at each other's blatant misinformation on both sides blatant distortions of the truth blatant editorializing of facts and you're like hey what happened guys yeah no it's it's it's crazy and and not not that the news didn't have distortions before like you think about you know we covered up all sorts of thing you know massacres in Cambodia a secret bombing you know the use of Agent Orange like it's definitely I just didn't appear in the news in the degree it should now though you turn on either MSNBC or Fox and you're right you'll you'll find something that's just totally full of shit within five minutes usually and that did not used to be the case you know I think individual reporters used to take a lot of pride in their work you know and it's different now now now when you make mistakes in the business you don't you don't get bounced out of the business in the way you used to and that's that's really strange like only plagiarism plagiarism still bounces you what plagiarism case is pretty yeah that's usually fatal right you're not gonna usually recover from that I mean some people have kind of near in problems with that and they they you know I'm not gonna yes but but um but no but you think about people who got stories like w the WMD thing wrong right not only do they not get bounced out of the business they all got promoted you know they're like the editors of major magazines now or you know and and so what does that tell people in the business well it tells you you know if you screw up as long as you screw up with a whole bunch of other people it's okay you know which is not good and and we used to have a lot of pride about that stuff in this business and that we now we don't anymore you know and it it's there isn't the shame connected with with screwing something up that there used to be I think there's a real danger with in terms of social media especially in not complying to the Constitution not complying to the First Amendment I think there's a real danger in that and I don't think we recognize that danger because I don't think we saw what social media was until it was too late and then by the time it was too late we had already had these sort of standards in place and the people that run it we're already getting away with enforcing their own personal bias their ideological bias and this is this is that when you're at this position where you go well how does that ever get resolved they're not going to resolve it on their own they're still making ass loads of money what he did is the government resolved it well if Trump steps in and resolves it looks like he's trying to resolve it to save his own political career or right to into you know to help his supporters it's like yeah no and and and no matter what if Trump does anything about it automatically everyone's gonna be against it right right you know even even if it's um even if there's some sense in there somewhere people won't won't won't get behind it but you know I do anything about it it's gonna be a correction time there's gonna be a gap time where it's gonna be like that where it's just gonna flood with people that are just like with this newfound freedom they're just gonna go and shit up the town you know but I mean but how would you how would you fix it now like that's something because it's not only about rules it's also about culture like people have already they're in this pattern of you know not saying the wrong thing right and they don't I think there's we're in a culture that doesn't even really know how to deal with free speech if we actually had it in the same way we used to you know no one seems to have a forecast like no one's like well the storm is gonna last about four years and then say there's no there's no forecast no no one's like wow some fucking uncharted waters right right but if you historically the tendency is once you have a tool that kind of can be used to keep people on line and for enforce compliance of ideas and then it always ends up worsening and becoming more and more dictatorial and authoritarian yes again you go back to the Soviet example like once I started you know really exercising a lot of control over the press and literature and things like that it didn't get better you it just continued becoming more of a you know an entrenched thing until so I that's what I worry about I think they were headed more in that direction yeah I think so too I'm not really concerned with on both sides when people dig their heels in ideologically the other side just gets even more convinced they're correct oh yeah yeah and there's no cross dialogue of any kind not anymore there and even now I mean it's it's interesting you had you had Bernie Sanders on your show and Sanders all it's Sanders is one of the few politicians left who has this idea that we should talk to everybody like there's there are no illegitimate audiences out there there know and like you know that's my job as a politician is to try to convince you of things but that's not normal in the Democratic Party anymore I mean Elizabeth Warren you know has made a big thing about not going on Fox and about having certain people taken taken off Twitter and yeah and and I think that's increasingly the the sort of line of thought in mainstream Democratic Party thought now is is that we're just gonna rule out whatever whatever that is 47% of the electorate we're just not gonna talk to them anymore right right yeah I I don't know how that's that can possibly be a successful political strategy then what and what the point is you know I yeah no no it doesn't make any sense I was reading something where people are going after tells he gathered for being on Tucker Carlson she's like I'll talk to everybody and I'm glad she does and by the way it's like it's hard for her because she's kind of an outside candidate it's hard for her to get time on these other networks and so they want to punish her for being on Tucker Carlson's and then they have this you know reductionist view of who he is he's a white supremacist like to all she supports white supremacists she goes on a white supremacist show it okay is that what he is really what he is and using its knee a lot more than that there's a lot going on there right you guys are fucking with life you know you're fucking with the reality of life and you're saying it in these sentences you're printing it out in these paragraphs as and you sending it out there irresponsibly and it's just really strange that people don't understand the repercussions of that yeah that's something we talked about on our podcast easily it's all the time is that the this it's a catch-22 right like you you don't invite somebody like tulsi gabbard on to CNN MSNBC where you they're kind of excluded from the same platform the other politicians get so they go to other platforms all right and then you say oh you went on that platform so you're illegitimate yes you know what do you want them to do like you know what they do the same thing with people who go on RT for instance right oh well you're helping the Russians because you went on RT well they're that's because you didn't invite them on any I mean yeah you their people are gonna try to talk to anybody they can to spread their ideas and that that that kind of propaganda thing is is pretty constant now in the use of the term terms like what white supremacists with Tucker Carlson I mean there there are a million terms now that you use to just kind of throw at people and what they're trying to do is create this ik factor around people yeah right like once you get someone gets a label associated with them then nobody wants to be associated with that person all right Ryan they quickly kind of die out of the public scene and that's I think that's really bad too you know it's it's like a it's it's just an anti-intellectual way of dealing with things and I and I think it's it's not good it's weird that it's so prevalent it's weird that there's so few proponents of a more you know open-minded way of thinking right yeah and just to take the gap we had we had Tulsa together on our show too and immediately we got accused what do you love Assad right do you want a bomb Syrian sure you want to keep murder Syrian children no I you know she's a presidential candidate and we want to talk to want to hear what she has to say but they immediately go to the maximalist interpretation of everything and then they're what they're basically saying when they ask you those questions are do you want to wear that label too because she's got it already so if you have a run again you're gonna you're you're gonna have that label and people they see that you know and and so you know people who have who don't have a big following and who are worried about their careers in about you know the money and advertisers and stuff like that they they think twice about you know interviewing that person the next time yeah and here's another way to get that speech exactly and again I don't know how you get out of it you know and I mean I've experienced some blowback I guess but it doesn't hasn't worked yet right you know I mean it's not real it's just like it's just words like okay well but yeah and and but you're handling it the right way back I think people your audience is rewarding you for for not not bowing to it you know and I think that more people if they took that example and said I'm not gonna listen to what the the pack says about this I'm not gonna be afraid of being called a name you know fuck that I'm gonna talk to you I want to talk to and I'm gonna gonna head you know explore whatever ideas I want to explore then the this kind of stuff wouldn't be as effective so yeah so easy to do to people it's so easy for them to deep platform people yes always and shadow banning and all this other weird shit that's going on yeah they're channeling people and and pushing people into these areas of their platforms that makes them less accessible and I know where it comes from you know I was I was young and politically active once you know you you want to change the world you want to make it a better place so you're in college and you don't have any power you don't have any way to input make something into legislation you know what I mean yeah so what do you do you you know social media gives you the illusion that you're having an impact in the world by you know maybe getting somebody deep platformed or taking off Twitter or something like that it feels like it's political action that yeah but it's not you know what I mean it's it's it's something that they that is open to people to do but it's not the same as you know getting 60 Congress 60 members of the Senate to to raise taxes on a corporation that's been evading them for 20 years you know what I mean like that's that's real action this you know getting some random person taken off the internet is just not change you know but but people feel like it is and they wanna they want to do the right thing so I get it but no it's it's not you know put real political action I don't think no it's fucking gross yeah and it just lead it's there's so much of it on there's so little logic also and you this must be a personal thing for you but it's this is the unfunniest time in American history like yes no because you rewarded for for stepping outside the box that's true in a big way mm-hmm like yeah you mean Dave Chappelle gets attacked but guess what he also gets rewarded in a huge way run he goes on stage now people go ape shit that's true and part of the reason why they go fucking bonkers is because they know that this guy doesn't give a fuck and he's one of the rare ones who doesn't give a fuck so when he goes up there you know if he thinks something crazy about whatever it is whatever protected group or whatever idea that he's not supposed to explore that's not gonna stop him at all he's gonna tell you exactly what he thinks about those things regardless of all this woke blowback he's not he doesn't care right so because of that he's rewarded even more and same thing with Bill burr same thing with a lot of comics I experienced it with my own jokes sure did more controversial bits getting people more fired up now they love it because everyone's smothered their smothered by human resources and smothered by office politics and you're smothered by social discourse restrictions and he's don't feel like you can express yourself any more this is true and and and all people also don't have a they feel like they're being watched all the time yeah things like that kind of can't let it all hang out anywhere right and and so that's yeah they they do feel incredibly like repressed and under the gun yeah I think that that's that's true yeah I just I feel like it I mean I'm not a comic but if but I just imagine it must be a more challenging environment it's more challenging but more rewarding to my friend ari said it best he said this is a great time for comedy because comedies dangerous again right that's true yeah that's true yeah it's kind of goes back to like a Lenny Bruce era right when you know you could kind of completely freak people out with a couple of saying a couple of sure yeah for good or bad or prior yeah well you like you saw it with like louis c.k right louis ck's under the microscope now that joke that he made about parkland is absolutely a louis c.k joke if you followed him throughout his career what was the joke again i'm sorry the joke was why am i listening to these parklands survivors why are you interesting cuz you pushed some fat kid in the way like see you're laughing right like that is a louis c.k joke he's saying something fucked up you're not supposed to say that is throughout his goddamn career he's done that that's always done but after the you know jerking off in front of women all that stuff and him coming out in admitting it and then taking a bunch of time off now he's a target right now he does something like that and they're like oh he's all right now like no this is what he's always done right he's always taking this sort of contrarian outside the box fucked up but hilarious take on things and that bit unfortunately because it was released by someone who made a youtube video of it he didn't get a chance to he was gone for ten months and he had only done a couple sets when he was fleshing these ideas out i guarantee you he would have turned that idea into a brilliant bit but he never got the chance because it was just it was set out there in the wild when it was a baby he was mauled down by wolves it needed to be heard right yeah i mean that's what a bit of these bits they they grow and they develop and that was a controversial idea that we're supposed to think that someone's interesting just because they survived a tragedy and his take is like no no no no you're not interesting right you're fucking boring you're annoying get off my get off my TV and a lot of us have felt that way sure he just the way he said it was easy to take and put in you know out of context put it in quotes and turn him into an asshole well yeah but that's what comedy is right it's it's taking what people the the thoughts that everybody has and vocalizing that the end that forbidden thing in a way that people can kind of you know come together over right i mean i think that was a lot a lot of what richard pryor schemer was about like he took a lot of the sort comfortable race problems right and he just kind of put them out there and both white people and black people laughed at it yeah right like together you know and that that was what was good about it yes but if you can't if if people are afraid to vocalize those things that they think it's gonna you know ruin their career is you know that that makes it more interesting right it's more hype more high stakes but if you can navigate those waters and get to the promised land of the punchline it's even more rewarding right but you just have to explain yourself better you have to have better points you have to have you have to have a better structure to your material where you while the the people who may find your idea objectionable they you you coax them like hold my hand I'm gonna take you through the woods we're gonna be okay right follow me and boom isn't that funny right right right you have to navigate it skillfully and you have to navigate it thoughtfully and you have to really have a point you can't have a half-assed point but you can't have a situation where it's fatal to be off by a little bit I know like there was a writer that I loved growing up a Soviet writer named Isaac Babel Stalin ended up shooting him but he gave a speech about I think it was in 1936 you know to to a Soviet writers collective and he said you know people say that we don't have as much freedom as we used to but actually all of all that the you know the the Communist Party is done is Britta's prevented us from writing badly the only thing that's outlawed now is writing badly right and everybody laughed but he was actually saying something pretty serious which is that you can't write well unless you can you know screw up too you know like on the way to to being creative in a good way you have to miss yes you know and if missing is not allowed and there's high punishment for missing you're not going to get art yeah you're not gonna get revolution you're not gonna get all these things well and in comedy it's particularly important because you have to work it out in front of people absolutely yeah no I used to sit at a comedy club in hatton when I was like in college that you know they would try out their material like on a Wednesday right you know early and that was always the most interesting time for me well like they're trying south stuff out and a lot of it wasn't so good but you know it was interesting right and you just can't have a situation where people feel like you know one wrong word is gonna ruin their career yeah you know yeah I don't know but there's also people that are wolves and they're trying to take out that little baby joke wandering through the woods they they want that feeling of being able to take someone down right and that that's you know that's you're getting that now too which is just and so now because that there's like yonder bags at the improv where I'm performing tonight they usually on their bags you have to put yourself on the bag when you go in there so you can't record things yonder bag yes it's a company called yonder it's just so strange it's like all the shows I did with Chappelle he uses yonder bags and an idea is to prevent people from from filming and recording and you know and then eventually putting your stuff out there uh-huh well you know look I'm kind of all for that I mean I've seen this with politicians on the campaign trail like they are so tight now in ways that they used to not be well you saw the Donald Trump thing Donald Trump jr. where Trump jr. what they didn't want him to do they wanted him to do a Q&A and he didn't want to do it so they booed him the right wing people uh-huh bullying him they're yelling out Q&A Q&A because they want to be able to talk oh I see it'll say something to him and these are people that were like far-right far-right people they just didn't think he was being right enough or he was playing the game wrong or he wasn't wasn't letting them complain to him right right yeah yeah now that's bad and and and politicians are aware of that now and they're they're constantly aware that they're on film everywhere and so they're you know a thousand percent less interesting because yeah they're there I mean I remember covering campaign in 2004 and I was I saw Dennis Kucinich give a speech somewhere and he was going from I think Maine to New Hampshire and I said can I get a ride back to New Hampshire he's like yeah sure so you know it takes me on the and he like takes his shoes off he's like cracking jokes and everything and like eating udon noodles or something political candidates would not do that now like they'd be afraid to be off the record with you right you know right right and and they're afraid to be around people and just behave like people you know which is not good I don't think it's the weirdest time ever to be a politician because it's it's basically you've got this one guy who made it through being hugely flawed mm-hmm and just going ah the fucking locker room talk and it was like well yeah it is locker room talk yes and then it works and he gets through and he wins and so you've got him who seems like he's so greasy like nothing sticks to him and then you have everyone else who's terrified of any slight misstep yeah totally and and you can't replicate the way Trump does this you know Trump Trump is he was born this way there's like a thing going on in his head like he is you know pathologically driven to behave in a certain way and he's not gonna be cowed by the way you know people are but socially because he just doesn't think that way no no he's and but that's no one else is gonna behave like that what do you think about him and speed what do you think I do all that does he take speed you mean yeah so did you ever see his speech after Super Tuesday yeah that's the one we was slurry it was that wasn't always ramped up he was very I just say watch that speech you know we're not supposed to draw conclusions about but you know what what my big lament pharmaceutically with somebody but I would say just watched on Donald Trump's performance after the results of the Super Tuesday roll in in 2016 let's hear some of that firstly chris Christie is hilarious she's talking about wages I've been poor and everything's poor and everything's doing badly but we're gonna make it she's been there for so long I mean if she hasn't straighten it out by now she's not gonna straighten it out in the next four years it's just gonna become worse and worse she wants to make America whole again and I'm trying to find what is yeah I mean it's just I already go back and look but yeah but he got he went on and on also that the Christie factor was really funny with that because he was him he's just sitting back there going what am i doing what am i doing with my life look at his face literally you can see his brain wander well how the fuck did this happened I was gonna be the man like I was the goddamn president it was gonna happen for me I could see it happening I saw him in uh in Ames Iowa basically standing alone in the park waiting for people to try to shake his hand you know yeah it was pretty bad like you see that and but you do you have a theory about Trump and speed yeah yeah yeah I think he's on some stuff mm-hmm I think first of all I know so many journalists that are on speed I know so many people that are on adderall and it's very effective it gives you confidence it gives you a delusional perspective well you get a delusional state of confidence mm-hmm it makes people think they can do anything it's basically a low-level meth it's very similar to methamphetamine chemically sure and people are in it yeah it is tell me what it's like because I haven't done it yeah I mean I've done speed to I mean you know all those all those drugs are yeah they're like baby baby speed basically yeah and you're absolutely right I think people who it's not good for a writer because writing is one of these things where one of the most important things is being able to step back and and ask am I really my full of shit here is you know are my jokes as funny as I think they are like right if once that mechanism starts to go wrong you know you're really lost yes writer right because you're just you're not in front of an audience you're with yourself in front of a computer so I don't think I don't think speed is a great drug I mean you get a lot of stuff done so that's that's good but but ya know I I think there's a lot of people who are on it now and also a lot of us because kids come up through school and they're on it just you know and they they get used to it so I you know I have kids I wouldn't dream of giving giving them any of those drugs you know I think it's crazy yeah I do - did you see you saw the I'm sure you saw the sudafed picture - right no what was that Trump was sitting in his office eating a was that famous photo where he's like I love Hispanics where he's eating a taco bowl at Trump Tower and behind him there's an open drawer and in that open drawer as boxes of sudafed and sudafed sort of yeah I mean you it gives you a low-level buzz and the I mean this is why I used to have to go to CVS to buy this stuff used to have to give you drivers I guess you still do they have to give your driver's license because they want to make sure you're not cooking meth right lying like 10 boxes of it at a time and cooking up a batch yeah if you're like in a you know holler in Kentucky and you go in and get 20 20 boxes of sudafed and pretty much people know what you're doing there yeah that's really funny did he so he had a bunch of sudafed oh yes yeah in his box and you know there was that one reporter that was that guy's name again who had a hole he wrote a series of tweets which he eventually wound up taking down by the way Jamie I can't find those fucking tweets he wrote a series of tweets that there was a very specific Duane Reade pharmacy where Trump got amphetamines for something that was in quotes called metabolic disorder Kurt I can Walled fun Kurt yeah 1982 Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives abused them only supposed to take two for 25 days stayed on it for eight years really now is he full of shit so yeah Kurt I can Walt isn't interesting because he's written some really good books about finance he wrote a book about Enron he wrote a book about Prudential it was really really good then when I was starting out writing with Wall Street I was like wow these books are really incredibly well researched but he had some stuff in the in 2016 where like that's an example of something as a reporter I see that Michael where's that coming from you know and because you in journalism you can't really accuse somebody of certain things unless it's backed up to the enth degree so right he had a couple of things that I thought I you know would be concerned about he took a leap I don't know I mean look that's what I'm Sam stepped outside of the journalistic boundaries of what you can absolutely prove and not prove and took a leap and that's why I think he took down the duane reade pharmacy he didn't take it down oh it's still there as well there wasn't okay there it is there was another thing about a well he's got the milligrams per day Wow where's this from I don't know it doesn't show it or anything but I believe he eats drug use a copy of it from someone or talk to the doctor drug was diethyl propane 75 milligrams a day prescription filled Duane Reade on 57th Street Manhattan not that I know things so you know get the doctor's name to dr. Joseph greenberg I countered with medical records a white house admitted to me only a short time for diet that he took it when he was not located and that's fun he says I countered with medical records they cut me off Wow yeah I mean you know one thing I will say is that when you're when you're covering stories sometimes you hear things and and you know they're pretty solid but you put you it's not quite reportable because the person won't put their name on it or you know you're not a hundred percent sure that the document is a real document maybe it's a photocopy and that that can be very very tough for reporters cuz they know something's true but they can't write they can't and and social media has eliminated a barrier that we used to have we used to have to go through editors and fact checkers and now you know you're on Twitter or you can just kind of you know right right or you can hint at something you know and I think that's that's something you don't want to get into as a reporter too much you know yeah that's a weird use of social media right it's like sort of a slippery escape from journalistic rules yeah exactly yeah you know or you can you can insinuate that somebody did X Y & Z or you can you can use terms that are a little bit sloppy like you know again but it seems like they did admit that he took that stuff forth ah yes so if you have the the white house you know spokesperson saying that they he took it for a short time for a diet then you find that's a reportable story right yeah yeah well I think when people get into that shit it's very hard for them to get out of that shit mm-hmm that's a the the speed train and I've seen many people hop on it it's got a lot of stops nobody seems to get off yeah not with keep intact right yeah no it's uh that's that's not a good old he's so old he doesn't exercise he eats fast food and he gets so much fucking energy I and I mean people want to think he's this super person you know but maybe he's on speed maybe yeah I mean he's just gonna collapse turn over and collapse one not can go a lot longer on speed than people think maybe if you just do it the right way but isn't that kind of the way history always works it's like again not to go back to the Russian thing but all the various terrible leaders of Russia like they all died of natural causes when they were 85 right whereas you know in a country where people get murdered and die of industrial accidents and bad health when they're you know 30 all the time right but the worst people in the country make it to very old age and you know and die and in their alcoholics and maybe that's the thing right maybe maybe you know he has the worst diet in the world and maybe he's on speed and maybe it's also your perception of how you interface with the world maybe because he's not this introspective guy that's really worried about how people see him and feel about him maybe he doesn't feel you know whatever whether it's sociopathy or whatever it is he doesn't feel the bad feelings they don't get in there yeah and this he doesn't have the the stress impact right right and that's the thing about speed apparently it because of the fact that it makes you feel delusional and it makes you feel like you're the fucking man like don't worry about what other people think in losers who cares right right yeah you know that was why not by greenly why not by greenland yeah that came out of what's wrong with that we bought Alaska well we based it Alaska yeah yeah we were supposed to give it back but we we didn't it seems like Greenland would be a good place to scoop up especially as things get warmer right yeah exactly and the fuckin tweet that he made when he put the Trump Tower I promise not to do this and have a giant Trump Tower in the middle of Greenland I was laughing my ass off like love or hate that is hilarious his trolling skills are top-notch very good they're they're fantastic oh he knows how to fuck with people when he starts calling people crazy or gives him a nickname like it's so good because like it sticks yes I mean part of me wants see a trump button race next year just for that reason this is because the the abuse will be on below I mean nothing I'm encouraging that necessarily but this is a spectacle it's gonna be unbelievable you can tell that he he is salivating at the idea of by muscleman Biden to me is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods is not going to work out it's not gonna make it yeah no he's he's so faded he you know he has his moments on the campaign trail where he'll be speaking and you know these guys do the same speech over and over again so they can kind of do it on cruise control but every now and then he'll he'll stop in the middle of it and you this look of terror comes over like where am i yeah you know what town am I in you know like he he confused he thought he was in Vermont when he was in New Hampshire I'm sorry yeah he was he got those states confused like what's not to love about Vermont he was in New Hampshire you know that that can happen obviously but it happens to him a lot but he's clearly old yeah you know I mean he's not much older than Trump right but he needs to get on the same pills yeah yeah actually that would be a thing we should get a GoFundMe to buy it imagine yeah they just filled him up with steroids and and just jacked him up with them feta means had it going after Trump I really think he needs something like that he whatever he's doing on the natch it's not working right yeah yeah he's too tired needs a little bit of enhancement it's not gonna work if he if he gets the nomination the Democrats are fucked I just I don't see I don't see him I don't see him withstanding the barrage that Trump was gonna throw at him Trump's gonna take him out like Tyson took out Marvis Fraser just got was a yeah it was a bomb that was a bad fight it's gonna be that kind of fight right bomb on him yeah doesn't have a chance he can't stand with that guy he doesn't have a cheese to he's also too impressed with himself yes he's too used to people deferring yes like he thinks like the things he says makes sense and are cool and are profound when they're just land right he's just serving bad meatloaf and he's like tada and you're like no this is bad meatloaf yeah that's how he got to be vice president by being just bland enough yes right to get whatever constituency Obama was trying to get but you saw that exchange when he called Trump an existential threat earlier this year and Trump basically he just went off on him you know Joe Joe's a dummy he's not the guy he used to be like you know yeah that's gonna be everyday yep you know every minute of every day and then other people gonna chime in because they love it people love piling on oh yeah and his fans oh my god he's the asshole king where people never had a representative before there's a lot of assholes out there like that where's my guy Brian finally BAM look at this area the asshole made it to the White House holy shit I can be an asshole now the president's an asshole he wants me to be an asshole oh yeah totally oh that's mean that that's gonna wear on a guy I mean if you've been doing one of trumps rallies no chance yeah now I can't wear a rubber nose and fucking I've covered it and what they're like they're unbelievable first of all the the the t-shirts are amazing you know it like Trump 2020 fuck your feelings you know what I mean like Trump is the Punisher you know it's like the Punisher skull with the thing like it's it's it's it's amazing and in the crowds it's like totally out of idiocracy yeah is there a fucking Punisher skull with a Trump wig on it yeah yeah oh my goodness I'm gonna have to get one of those I mean he's like there's oh it's a red white and blue American flag skull Punishers style with a Trump Trump wig on it so I saw that I need that sure son it wasn't the one red white and blue one it was the blood it was a moment to black and I saw that on my god I'm like an eight-year-old kid all right it was like a mother with her little kids and the Trenton Trump Punisher skull but do they that shirt on Amazon can finally show I'm sure being sold everywhere I mean the the the merch is he is he's the most t-shirt able president history I mean Trump 2020 grabbed him by the pussy again boy I mean that they they like embrace that shit it the the trolling aspect of all of it is like the fun part for his crowd so you are what they get off on is how how freaked out you know quote-unquote liberal audiences yeah by their appearance their attitude and everything and they lean into it you know that I mean which is interesting because you know that kind of like group camaraderie thing that you don't really find that on and then a campaign trail on the Democratic side it's different I mean it's a different vibe entirely but yeah it's crazy well it's dumb and that's the thing that he's sort of like captured is this place where you can be dumb like it's fun to be dumb and say grab her by the pussy like everybody knows that's kind of a dumb thing to say public of course but you can say it there because he said it yay you know build that wall build that wall yeah right like it's like it's this chance to like shut off any possibility of getting over like 70 rpm like you we're gonna cut this bitch off at 70 there's no high function here cut it off at 70 and just let it rip right yeah no totally totally and and it's funny the way you say that they'll never buddy knows it's a dumb thing to say right like I would talk to people at the crowds and you know I'll talk like a 65 year old grandmother and you say do you agree with everything in Trump says and like almost the last they all say well I wish he hadn't said this particular thing right but they're all they're chanting you know what I mean like they're all into it and all in the crowds are they're so huge like I was in Cincinnati and I was late to one of his events and I made the mistake that I couldn't Drive in because they blocked off all the bridges if you've never been there right you know I was in the Kentucky side so I had to walk like three miles away and like walk over a bridge and I thought I was going the only person there and it was like something out of a sci-fi movie was just like a line of Magha hats like extending over a bridge all the way into Kentucky like a mile down a road I mean they had eternally thousands of people to get into this event it was it's incredible and that people did see it was like 17 or 18 thousand it was the you know they freaked out what they what arena that is it's the it's the indoor one he's the only one that can pull those kind of crowds here oh yeah there's no one no one can do that you know Bernie and Warren have had big crowds Bernie had a he had a 25,000 that person crowd in Queens a couple of weeks ago you'll see crowds that big but Trump's crowds are just dating back to 2016 they're just consistently huge every everywhere and and again this gets back to what I was saying before all the reporters saw this and they all saw that Hillary was having real trouble getting four and five thousand people into her events and so we all you know we were all talking to each other like that's gotta be in it a thing that's gonna you know play a role in the election eventually but nobody kind of brought it up or they they explained it away well I think they felt like if you discussed it and brought it up that somehow or another you got you were contributing to Trump being Trump winning right but that's a that's a fallacious way to look at it yeah because covering up the reality of the situation I think created a false sense of security for Democrats and they thought they were gonna win by a landslide yeah that's what everybody was saying but it wasn't true I mean the overseer there were serious red flags throughout the campaign for Hillary and people I think were too afraid to to bring up a lot of this stuff because they didn't want to be seen it's helping Trump but that's not what the business is about we're not supposed to be you know helping back both factors don't have you know political indications we're just supposed to tell you what we see how do you get journalism back on track is it possible at this point I mean it is a lost art is it gonna be like calligraphy I mean I think yeah yeah exactly Japanese calligraphy you have to pass it down through masters yeah maybe that's that's gonna be able to adjourn Elizabeth like I mean there's two things that could happen one is that like if you created something like neither side news right now right and just like a that's a great name yeah like a network where it was a bunch of people who just kind of did the job without the editorializing I think it would have it would probably have a lot of followers right away it would make money and nobody has clued into that yet like if if some canny entrepreneur were to do that and that were to bring back the business that or you know journalism has always been kind of quasi subsidized in this country you know going back to the Pony Express newspapers were carried free across to the west right the US Postal Service said that the original 19th the Communications Act in 1934 the idea was you know we you could lease the public airwaves but you had to do something in the public interest so you you could make money doing sports and entertainment but you could take a loss on news and so it was kind of quasi subsidized in that way but that doesn't exist anymore there's no subsidy really for news anymore I'm not a story sure I agree with that that being the way to go but there has to be something because right now the financial pressure to be bad is just too it's too great you know like there's no if there's no way to I started going on this but I came when I came from the business when the money started getting tighter the first thing they got rid of were the long-form investigative reporters like you couldn't just hire somebody to work on a story for three months anymore because he needed them to do content all the time then they got rid of the fact checkers you know which had another serious problem you know and and so now the money's so tight that he just had these people doing clickbait all the time and they're not doing real reporting and so they they have to fix the money problem I don't know how they would do that how much has it changed recently because like when that piece of the stuff that you wrote about the banking crisis was my favorite coverage of it and the the most relatable and understandable and the way you spelled everything out could you do that today yeah but I think it would be harder because that's not that long it's it really isn't it's only you know that was I really stopped doing that and like 2014 or so five years out but the the big differences social media has had a huge impact on a ten and span so you know I was writing like 7,000 word articles about credit default swaps and stuff like that I was trying really hard to make it interesting for people you know you use jokes and yeah humor and stuff like that but now people would not have the energy to really fight through that you'd have to make it shorter even TV you know they people you don't see that kind of reporting that in-depth you know kind of process reporting where you're teaching people something because people just tune out right away that they need just a quick hit a headline and a couple of facts so yeah there's a big problem with audience right which we've trained audiences to consume the news differently and all they really want to get is a take now you know it's like the everything's like an ESPN hot take writings you know so that's easy the counter to that though is this what we're doing right now like these are always these long-ass conversations they're hours and hours long and there's a bunch of them out there now it's not like mine is an isolated one and there's so many podcast that cover and some of them cover them like in a cereal form like the drop out was that there was a they called it yes it was the drop out was the one about that woman who created that fake blood company yes right you know Susan was her name Elizabeth that's right Sarah knows yeah the the completely fraudulent company that was an amazing podcast absolutely that if I read it I probably you're right I probably would have liked boring right I probably Bandhan it earlier but listening to it in podcast form listening to actual conversations from these people listening to people's interpretations of these confrontations listening to people that were there at the time telling you know telling stories about when they knew things were weird and when they started noticing the there's like tests that were incorrect that they were covering up that kind of shit like you can do that now with something like this and I think that one of the good things about podcasts too is you don't need anybody to tell you that you could you could publish this yeah no absolutely I think you're you're right and I think formats like this reveal that the news companies are wrong about about some things about audiences like they they think that people can't handle an in-depth discussion about things they think that audiences only want to watch 30 seconds of something they don't they're interested that they do have curiosity about things it's just it's very difficult to convince people in the news business especially to take chances on that kind of content you know they'll do it for a podcast I'll do it for a documentary but but for for the news they just they're making things shorter and shorter and shorter you know I was really lucky to have an editor who you know understood the idea that we have to get into this and in depth or also it's going to be meaningless the program right that's pretty rare you know for the most part they you don't see them taking that kind of bet anymore but maybe podcasts will help people Punk puncture that but the flip side of that is that they're not they're not investing and stuff like like International News in the way they used to when I came up in the business every Bureau every big Network had bureaus in every major city around the world you know Rome Berlin Moscow whatever it is right and they had newsrooms full of people who are you know out there gathering news now there's none of that right because they figured out they can make the money just as easily by having somebody sit in an office and in Washington or New York and just you know link to something and have a take on something you know so the I think the news is getting worse podcasts are getting more interesting maybe maybe there's a happy medium they can find in between well documentaries as well documentaries are commercially viable if it's a great subject like like your good examples that wild wild country one or you know I didn't even know that that cult existed I had no idea what what happened up there and then so this documentary sheds light on it does it over like I think it was like six episodes or something that'd be fucking amazing and it made a shit ton of money yet though we're making a murderer was another one is really good like they you take because that's something that happens all over the place you have these Criminal Justice cases and they're you know terrible and justice has happened and you know if you really tell the whole story and make characters out of people and invest the time and yeah tell it tell it well people still like really good storytelling but but I think within the news business they just they have this belief they're hard-headed believe that people can't handle difficult material and I don't know why that is you know yeah I don't know why it is either it's I mean I think there's a large number of people that aren't satisfied intellectually by a lot of the stuff they're being spoon-fed and they think that because the the vast majority of things that are commercially viable are short attention span things I think it's like this real sloppy way of thinking non risk-taking way of thinking they're like well this is how people consume things you got to give them like music video style editing or they just tune out but there has always been a thirst for actual long-form conversations yeah you don't an actual real in-depth exploration of something in a very digestible way like one of the good things about doing your podcast for this podcast any podcast really is that you could listen to it while you're commuting you listen to it and it'll actually give you something that occupies your mind and interest you during what would normally be dead time right yeah and and you're absolutely right about the the thirst for something else now and again I think when people turn on most news products they're getting this predictable set of things and that doesn't quench that thirst for them they're not they're not being challenged in any way they're not seeing different sides of a topic you know you're not approaching covering a subject honestly by genuinely you know exploring the idea that so that people you may have thought were bad or right or people you may have thought are good or wrong it's just all predictable so I think people are fleeing to other things now right they just they want they want to just get the story they don't they don't want to have a whole lot of you know editorializing on top of it you know and and yeah and and they I think also there's a lot of under estimating of audiences going out there and like we we just think that they can't handle stuff when they can yeah they're they're interested but we we just take it for granted that they can't do it maybe I'm guilty of that too you know because I've been doing this for so long but but yeah it does happen I don't think people have changed that much yeah no probably probably not it's just um it's just difficult you know maybe it's also we don't have the the stamina to to stick with a story than the same way that we used to like now if a story doesn't get a million hits right away we don't we don't return to the subject mmm you know you think about stories like Watergate like when Woodward Bernstein first did those stories there were complete duds like everybody thought they were on the wrong path they were the only people who were covering it and a lot of those stories kind of flailed around you know what I mean they they didn't get the big response and it wasn't until much later that it became this hot thing that everybody was watching and you wouldn't so that wouldn't happen now right like if reporters were on a story if it didn't catch fire within the first couple of passes your editors probably gonna take you off it now what was that story that the New York Times worked on about Trump and they worked on it for a long time and it was released and went in and out of the news cycle in a matter of days and nobody gave a fuck the yeah the one about his finances yes and it was like a 36,000 word story it was like unbelievable it was it was like six times as big as and is the biggest story I've ever written in my life they thought it was a giant takedown right yeah and it was it your it was like a 36-hour thing if that right and maybe maybe yeah and people kind of said oh and this is amazing it's got all this information in it and it just fell flat you know and that's and the important thing about that is that news companies see this and they say wow we invested all this time and money we put our you know really good reporters on this we gave them six months to work on something and it got the same amount of hits you know some story about you know a carp with a human face that was filmed in China you know what I mean like something that we you know we picked off the wires and you stuck it in page 11 whatever it was so then that what that tells in the incentives now are let's not bother listen let's not do six months invested investigations of anything anymore because what's the point we're gonna get as many hits doing something dumb right now so they just don't take the risk anymore god it's so crazy that that's the incentive now that it's all clicks it's such a strange trap to fall into and there's also the the other thing which is the the litigation problem you know that and this is another thing I wrote about in the book is that there was a series of cases in the in the 80s and 90s where reporters kind of took on big companies and I'm at the Chiquita banana thing that the Cincinnati Enquirer did remember the movie The The Insider I'm up Ryan and Williams tobacco company CBS right there was another one with Monsanto in Florida where some Fox reporters went after Monsanto and they so they all got sued and it costs their companies a ton of money and reputational risk and so after that what news company said is why take on a big company that can fight back and throw a lawsuit at us and what do we win by that we're not gonna get more audience from that you know so now if you watch consumer reporting you know what like a small TV station usually it's they're gonna bang on some little Chinese restaurant that has roaches or something like that they're not going to go after Monsanto or the or or you know Chiquita banana because there's no point that it's too much of a risk so they just don't do it and that's another thing that's what's gone wrong with reporting you know they they've the economic benefit of going after a powerful adversary isn't there anymore so they don't do it and that's that's a problem now clearly you've seen a giant change in journalism from when you first started to where we are now do you have any fears or concerns about the future of it I mean this is what you do for a living what is your what are your thoughts on it we're you think it's going I mean I'm really worried about it because because you you need the journalists to kind of exist apart from politics and to be a check on everything I think that the whole idea of having a Fourth Estate is that it's separate from the political parties right I mean I don't work for the DNC it's not my job to write bad news about Donald Trump right that's the DNC's job you know they've put up press releases about them and if people see us as being indistinguishable from political parties or being all editorial then we don't have any power anymore like that's that's the first thing that the press doesn't have any ability to influence people if people don't see us as independent and truthful and all those things and so that's what I really worry about right now is like people won't will stop listening to the media they'll still tune us out they don't trust us anymore like Walter Cronkite from you know 1972 the Gallup poll agency found he was the most trusted man in America and that was true also in 1985 like for 13 consecutive years he was the most trusted there's no reporter in America who's true who's the press the trusted man in America yeah with it doesn't it yeah exactly so people think of us as clowns and you know entertainment figures and so how are you gonna how are you gonna impact the world if people think you're a joke you know and then that's why that's what I really worry about we don't have any institutional self-respect anymore you know we don't we don't feel like we have to you know challenge audiences challenge challenge powerful people you know it's it's just a bunch of talking points and that's that's not what the business is about so I worry about it and you know I think there are a lot of journalists who say the same thing we all kind of talk to talk amongst ourselves which is you know the the the job as we knew it is kind of being phased out and changed into something else and and that's not that's not a good thing you know because people do need in tough times people need need the press you know as ridiculous as that sounds now because but it's true and I don't know where we go from here legitimate journalism is so important it's so important it's the only way you really find out what's going on right only way right you're not gonna find out through the depictions of the people that were actually involved in it they want you to see it a certain way you're not gonna find out from people that have financial incentives and giving you a specific narrative you need real journalism yeah it's so hard to find I think it's one of the reasons why we're so lost and it's one of the more insidious aspects of the term fake news because god damn that's so easy to throw around it's like it's so easy to call someone a bigot it's so easy to call someone a racist and it's so easy to say fake news and all that they all have the same sort of effect they just diminish anything that you have to say almost instantaneously totally and and there's when you can cast the entire news as being fake people can tune a tuning out but a lot of that has to do with it but who is doing the news reading now right like in the 60s and 70s maybe before reporters a lot of them came from the middle and lower classes like the you know they were it was the job was originally kind of like being a plumber right it was more of a trade than a profession and so you had a lot of people who who went into the job and they had this kind of attitude of just wanting to stick it to the man you know like they they they didn't want to be close to power they wanted to take it on people like Seymour Hersh right like if you see that kind of personality who just wants to take the truth and rub it in somebody's face but then after all the President's Men it became this sexy thing to be a journalist and you saw a lot of people from my generation who went into journalism because they wanted to be close to politicians and hang out with them kind of like the primary colors thing right where you see people who they just want to like have a beer with the king with the presidential candidate and that's totally different from what it used to be like now so now now we're on the wrong side of the Rope line you see them saying like we're like we used we used to be outside of power like taking it on and now we're kind of seeing we're more upper class in the press and we're we're kind of in bed with the same people we were supposed to be covering and that's that's not a good thing people when people see that they they they you know that's that's one of the reasons why they say they call us fake news is because they they see us as doing PR for you know rich people one of my favorite books ever about politics is fear and loathing on the campaign yeah I wrote the introduction to that did you you had to let the last the last edition of that greatest book yeah it's a fantastic book and it's a great example of someone who knew that they weren't a part of that system so they could talk about it as an outsider he knew he was only gonna be covering it for a year you just went in guns blaze and got everybody fucked up drinking on the bus making everybody do all of them you know yeah and he says that in the book he's like I was like look this isn't my beat I don't have any friends I have to keep you know yeah so I'm gonna tell you everything that I see and fuck it and and that's that's a real problem in reporting when you when you you're in a beat for too long you end up have developing unhealthy relationships with sources and you end up in a position where you're not going to burn the people who you're depending on to get your information and when that happens to reporters I think that's one of the reasons is good to to kind of cycle through different topics over the course of your career if you get stuck in the same same beat too long eventually that you fall into that trap and Thompson of course never did that like you know every story that he covered was he let it all hang out and just said whatever the hell he thought and you know he let the chips fall where they may and that's kind of the way I mean you can't do that all the time probably but I think that's thing that was great it was amazing and there's no other examples of it no no I'm like that yeah yeah yeah I mean that book was so great on so on so many levels like he I always thought it was being also kind of like a novel because it's a it's this story about this person who's like obsessed with finding meaning and truth but he he could he goes to the most fake place on earth which is the campaign trail yeah to look for it and so all these depictions of all these terrible lying people they're just so hilarious and and and so it's kind of you know it's almost like a Franz Kafka novel it's amazing and then it's great journalism at the same time like he's telling you how the system works and how elections work and it's really valuable for that so yeah that was brilliant he also changed a lot I mean he actually affected politicians like the shit that he did with Ed muskie that was fantastic when he was on the Dick Cavett show and Dick Cavett asked him about it he goes well there was a rumor that he was on ibogaine and I started that rumor I mean it's just he like literally that he got in that guy's head oh yeah and the I remember the he put that picture of muskie he just found a picture of muskie and it's he's basically wearing like that yeah the caption is muskie and the throws of a nibble gain frenzy right and you couldn't get really get away with that now like he just he just you know it's a crazy drug to choose to because the drug that gets you off addictions right yeah exactly more hilarious aspects of his choice but it sounded great yeah Brazilian which dog yeah yeah yeah it was fantastic oh so good yeah but you know that that kind of stuff probably wouldn't go over all that well right now don't get sued yeah but the that also he had this very very sort of a aggressively characterizing way of looking at politics and and politicians and that that wouldn't go over that well now either like people don't want you to rip on the process as much as he did in that book so it was great it was just a fantastic book yeah I mean he had a bunch of them that were great but that one particularly it's you can sort of redo it you could reread it every time we get to an election cycle you sort of let goes oh you it lets you know these are these are repeating cycles this this is just like the same shit that he was dealing with and you know various different forms but you can see it all today and it's funny the reporters everybody's read that book everybody who covers Kent in the campaign you know I'm on my fifth right now for Rolling Stone like I had I have his old job and everybody has read that book and so they're they unconsciously try to make the same characters in each election cycle so there's always like a christ-like mcgovern figure there's there's a you know a turncoat Quisling spineless musky figure there's the end here's the the villain Nixon trumpet Trump kind of fills that role for a lot of reporters now and then they'll a lot of them try to behave in the same way that the characters behaved in that book so you remember Frank mankiewicz was was McGovern's sort of handler and he was having beers with with Thompson after the events and kind you know strategizing with him the reporters try to do that they all try to do that with the candidates and their handlers now they try to develop those same relationship it's just interesting it's like they're really reliving the book you know that's a problem with someone that's really good you know they take on so many imitators and there's so many imitators take on their demeanor and their thought process like and Hunter was just such an iconic version of a writer that it's it's so difficult if you're a fan of his to not want to be like that guy oh totally I mean I you know I I know that I know that you know especially because I'm writing for the same magazine and covering a lot of the same topics you have to immediately realize that you can't do what he did like he Thompson's writing was incredibly ambitious and and unique he he was using a lot of the same teks techniques that the great fiction writers used like he was creating almost like this four dimensional you know story but at the same time it was also journalism like you can't really most people couldn't get away with that you have to be a great great writer I'm not talking like over rare Mark Twain level yeah talent to really to do what he did which is to kind of mix the you know the ambition of great fiction with with journalism so if you try to do that stuff it's going to be terrible and I've done I've certainly if you look go back and look at my road and you'll a lot of like shitty Thompson imitations and and so I learned to not do that pretty early but ya know you it's one of those don't try this at home things for young writers if you can if you can avoid that for sure do you have any do you have any hope there's it or anything that that you look to ego maybe this is going to be where this turns around in terms of journalism in terms of like yes I mean I think I mean oddly enough I think you you know show it shows like yours and the kind of proliferation of like what you're talking about with with podcasts the great thing about the Internet there are lots of bad things but the great thing about it is that it's given it's provided a way for people to just have an audience if they're good right if and if people have a demand for it they're gonna there if there's a mint demand for it you can exist you can have a platform and and so that's what I think is going to happen is that people are going to crack the code of what what kind of journalism people want and they're gonna create something that people are going to flock to and I don't have a lot of faith that CBS MSNBC ABC CNN that they're gonna figure it out like I think it's going to be some independent kind of voice that is going to come up with something a new formula and people are that is gonna rise up you know I mean you've seen it a little bit with things like The Young Turks you know although they're you know they're chant they've changed a little bit but they figured out that if you provide something it's an alternative from the usual thing that you can you can succeed you can get a viable functioning business a lot faster than you used to be able to what do you mean by they changed um you know I I think you know they've they've kind of become a little bit more in the direction of a traditional news organization than they were originally maybe I don't know I I don't watch I don't watch it as much as I used to so maybe I shouldn't say that but but you know again the ability to do that is a lot different than it you to be like an or in order to have an independent journalism outlet you used to have to like for instance put out your own newspaper which do you do your own distribution do you run printing do your own design all this have cost a ton of money and it was very very hard to do it without big corporate sponsors now you know now anybody with a good idea can pretty much you know do something and I have it so I have a lot of hope that somebody's gonna figure it out it just it just we're not there yet I agree with you I'm optimistic I have a lot of hope too but I'm always like rock with hurry up already yeah I know I know and you know and it's just until we get there the the remnants of the old system of media they're just you know it's just so tough to watch flailing you know they're they're flailing they don't really know what to do they're they're kind of caught between just purely chasing the money and trying to adhere to what they thought the news look like in the past so it's like not entertaining you know if they were just chasing the money if they just come up organically today they would have had a different product entirely but they're trying to sound like legitimate news but they're also completely selling out at the same time and it's just not working you know yeah and so yeah we'll see worse we'll see where all that goes but it's it's we're not here you're right they're flailing right now well Matt Taibbi I appreciate you man
