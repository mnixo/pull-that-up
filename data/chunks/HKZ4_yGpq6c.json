hello freak bitches what was he found guilty before it was revealed that there was he's dirty yes oh yeah and they did and they knew that this case existed and they didn't allow like the the lawyer Ross's defense was trying to postpone the trial a couple months so that the the grand jury investigation the criminal charges they knew were gonna drop the complaint but they were not allowed to postpone the trial well that seems like a slam dunk if you can prove that these cops are using other people's usernames and they were hacking into people's accounts and that that seems like right there like you can you can't prove anybody that's a trial I would sir I'd like to see that trial like my perspective on it is I'm fine with it with whatever the truth turns out to be I would just love to see both sides have their day and I was at that trial and the defense did not have a day that's always how it is though man I mean the idea that you get a fair trial is such a fucking joke because there's so much railroading going on yeah especially when there's an agenda like this to prosecute someone in an important case a landmark case yeah you think it's going to establish a precedent mm-hmm they will fuck you yeah that's kind of how it is yeah they will fuck you and that's what they did to this guy now this Dread Pirate Roberts character what's his name Chuck Pirate Roberts I mean the guy's avails accused of being different as they think Ross Ulbricht is yeah and he's the nine that he was Dread Pirate Roberts yeah he's saying here's what we know about him we know that he had these like hardcore libertarian values he wasn't a hacker he was not a computer guy didn't know anything about coding at all he was a physics major you know he was a he'd put himself through two universities on full scholarship he had a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Penn State very bright we know that he had hardcore libertarian politics we know that much he admitted to creating the Silk Road he said he did it to create like an economic simulation where he would combine Tor and Bitcoin to allow a marketplace to exist that would be free for everybody to use however they wanted to use it he claims he said he built it with the help of a lot of other people was he doesn't really know how to code and he just let it run and he took and he was done and he moved on and that's what his family his mom and dad back him on that that's what his family claims they given being around him because they're very tight-knit family all this time they were like this was not someone who was on his laptop all the time I don't know how he could have been running a you know you know a almost a billion-dollar drug empire he wasn't you know that guy he wasn't a guy just sat on his on his keyboard all the time so he claimed he's not Dread Pirate Roberts prosecution claims that he was and and and that was what that first trial was about what is there proof that he was they did find a journal on his laptop and the journal on his laptop is like you know today I'm setting up a Dread Pirate Roberts account today I'm gonna do this today fuck does that fuck writes a journal on their laptop of all the shit they're gonna do today I will take over the world it's kind of hush that seems so silly yeah I mean it's it's you know it again I would love to see like I went to the trial thinking okay now we're gonna see what happened right and I would love to see the defense really have time to sort of talk through their end and have expert witnesses and get into the nitty-gritty of it because I mean I would say we wherever the truth lies but but to be in the courtroom and to hear all that and just think okay if this is true this is like the most naive you know criminal mastermind like wouldn't it lasted to half a season if they have Walter White like so today I will plant a bomb in the courthouse don't tell anyone from law enforcement you know yeah it's not like he knows a lot about computers and his computer could be hacked into or anything yeah that's so stupid so Artie just really liked the videos that I was doing and asked me to come there for an interview and I just said there's no way I want to move to DC that sounds horrible but I just couldn't I couldn't pass up the opportunity and they said that they wanted me to have a show and just do exactly what I was doing and just ran and and have an international platform to do so the only hesitation that I had I mean I talked to someone who initially interviewed me for RT and I asked her why do you work here like why is Russia today covering things that activists care about like what is what is going on here and she was like look if I have to work for the Russian government to tell the truth about what's happening in my country that's what I'm going to do because we have to get the information out there at that time the cold Russia was not in the news like militarily or like this crazy cold war Renaissance and resurrection in terms of like propaganda Wars so at that time I was like that's great and I mean the editorial freedom that RT gives is completely unmatched and of course people are gonna love you that that gross generalization that everything on the network's propaganda the problem is everything's propaganda every fucking thing is propaganda tell me one media source that is not used in some way to push a viewpoint or bias everyone has bias there is no such thing as like neutrality you know everyone comes with an opinion everyone comes with a bias and I'd rather know the bias which is Russia today you may not get the truth about Russia from going to Russia and watching Russia today but you will get the fucking truth about the US government and you will get the truth about corporations because it's state-funded so you can talk about those things without worrying about advertisers and sponsorship so I always tell people navigate around the bias no I'm not gonna tell people that there is no bias that's fucking stupid of course there is it's Russia today it's funded by the Russian government so there's a lot of factors that go into that but I'd much rather know the bias blatantly in front of my face than not know the tens of thousands of like special interests and conflicts of interest going into the entire corporate media apparatus and all these other agencies I mean and that's even scarier because you have people on those channels that have been fired for criticizing the US government and it's not even state-funded media it's just corporate media how long has huncle Paul been around for well he started uncle Paul started I've been doing character for years in relationships long before I did him on the radio I didn't to annoy my girlfriends he was uncle Larry many years ago there was Roger Davis or Roger T and this is long before chip there was Roger and Roger had a brother Lester who was burned in a fire Lester was burned everywhere but his knees and his knickers to show off his legs was a whole thing and Uncle Roger I know Uncle uncle Larry and then emerged into chip who my girlfriend hated so much and chip became the fucking because they were chip would embarrass people I did that literally before I ever thought of doing the radio I would be out with girlfriends and embarrass them by doing that like we making bad jokes in the cab and my girlfriend uh you know a Jen and even girl fat girl just go just shut the fuck up it's not funny and it made me so happy and what this is what drives Jen crazy we'd be like a really nice steak house and the waiter would come over and she would order like the salmon and then chip just goes how much is that it would ask the waiter and she was like do you know how humiliating it is that people think I fucked that guy people think I'm fucking this guy and that's where they come from that visceral reaction it was real like I was doing one night that she all I would do I would do you know I add Gershwin I don't do as much because Edgar had curse the one with the tiny mouth he just drew a woman who lures and that's this thing but he had a brother Eugene and Eugene was always telling her that like you know you need to get right with Lord and tell her she was garbage and a whore you tell my god she was all or and she was not worthy thank you crying I'm crying but what happened was my girlfriend at the time who's now my best friend she's my ex-girlfriend from years ago she hated Eugene so much and I mean it wasn't even funny anymore could we would do it and she would dig her fingernails into my face she dug her nails into my face because I think Eugene hit his spot and it was it was such a visceral reaction from her as I stopped doing Eugene because she caught me dirty texting with another girl she fucking I told you that I wasn't a girl I ever fucked was just a girl I told you my dirty intriguing right it was a girl I was like I'll pay you five hundred baby I'm such an addict I would save my conversations to jerk off to write and I hit the wrong bunted a button and I fucking printed it I don't I fucking printed it so she wakes me up one morning she goes Jim wake up and I knew I was in trouble so she found these things and she knew I hadn't fucked the girl but it was a real strain on the relationship so as I swear to you as one of the ways of making amends to her I stopped doing Eugene I chilled off Eugene Mellencamp because I do a baby boy character than jelly who she liked mom whose jelly I don't do jelly published to embarrass he's just a little boy but she thought he was really cute and uncle Paul would always molest jelly and fuck him and chip was so stupid chip would always drop jelly off and uncle Paul's house and he didn't know it was a whole fucking inner world so yeah chip would be like why uncle Paul's a good guy he's helping out and she is so it she would do a driver crazy
