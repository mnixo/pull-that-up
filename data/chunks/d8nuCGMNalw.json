hello freak bitches you know I think about that last year I did blow I was ready to call 60 minutes like I think of the state of mind right now like I have already a pitch for 60 minutes to explain to them that I had found the going cure for cocaine that you do heroin on Mondays just a little bit you will not snort the rest of the week like I was really gonna pitch 60 minutes I was going to get an Asia and go to CBS or the listen I got a groundbreaking idea there's no reason for rehabs will get that white powder you motherfuckers are going to war for and we'll get that little white poppy seed we'll make it into some pill and we'll get people high on Monday cuz the rest of the week I didn't want to get high how crazy I was doing heroin on a Monday and it wouldn't let me do coke the rest of the week I look forward to Monday's fuck CSI Miami why are you why on Monday I don't know I don't know I'm no fucking idea that was just that you guys started week off right well this is snorting it yeah snorted two little wines are heroin just to get me out what does it do like what's the feeling hey tell me what it feels like when it hits you oh it takes a couple minutes to hit you you feel this weird thing and then you feel like your blood pressure going up and you feel like this euphoric warmth you feel like this fucking warm to be it I felt like my body - you ever take a white shit it's warm you can see if you should outside steams gonna come out of it but that's what your body feels like that warmth and then I would get an urge to puke for a couple minutes I would gag and puke a little bit would come out of yellow and then after I puked a little bit I would just go into this state of fucking mo monas for four hours it was like smoking indicas all day in mamonas like just sitting it smoking cigarettes looking at a window and I'd make believe I was writing John Lennon type lyrics to that jokes until I looked at them the next day this brilliance about refrigerator like I remember writing a bit about a refrigerator once and looking at the next day and say thank God thank God I never tried you know saying like little things like just well that was Hedberg strug of choice and his jokes man I mean it's I think he's probably the best non sequitur joke I ever because all his jokes are unrelated it's like here's a non sequitur here's some other things I was thinking about here's something I thought his I'm I saw and it was like I was listening to the other day he's like half of his jokes were only funny because he was saying them you know but they were hilarious like he had a he had a way of doing it that was kind of like heroine comedy you know but he messed up during the week or no no said ah it'd take me a day to recover on Tuesdays I'd be out and then say nothing to nobody I was doing the heroin and I wasn't doing coke so I was really fun so you would be like sober Thursday Friday it's out of there and then you'd look forward to the big bump on Monday yeah that kids dead he used to send it to me he's a $77 bags what kid his name was bonehead he died from an OD how weird yeah figured that cows gonna live forever I known had I knew bonehead fuck I'm a rest in peace miniature lost bone had perrantes on my bone head bone head was like your boy he was I could go into a room with 90 motherfuckers and bone handle like a bait ton of bone it was a bad motherfucker dog I love bone boiling her three brothers I love dog but bone head was in and two of the brothers are very successful believing that bonehead was successful as a plumber I don't know if his own company he only went crazy at night Bonin bonehead when I was 17 would take me the mixer always Ale House in New York City no ID he called a bartender only give him three mugs of beer give him three mugs of being give him a bowl of chili the mug head would take ten bucks on the both of us and he'd go to Washington Square Park and he'd come back and he'd give me eight valiums and by the meantime he would go buy his heroin and he buy these mixture pills and he melt them to the black-and-whites they take us to a strip club New Jersey or something then they take us home and the next day 7:00 in the morning this trip had this there's bald head in the fucking in the fucking plumbing van up and then that he was a functioning addict he wasn't like your regular there's a lot of those guys out there he had a chick that was a 13 really she was half-asian have Irish cook and they used to do heroin together and they pass out a little late fuck and they both go to sleep and then I'd be in

if I'm taking my time but I don't like doing documentaries but I need to do a documentary about this family because it's the rise and fall of an American family that I saw before my eyes as a child I went over there and ate with them you know I hang out with all three brothers by the way like I wasn't just friends with boneheads I got with Krissy fish and I hung out with the little whatever his name was but bonehead was my nighttime guy bonehead used to take me into the murky waters of the underworld he could get me guns and share the medium brother was a drug dealer in the 80s and he drunk beat sold big times coke and he stood by jury he used to put him in the tackle box so one night me and the younger brother in the bed sleep and bonehead comes in to borrow money from us cuz he was going to get heroin he goes he and I go bomb it I gotta go to background a money I mean he went into his brother's room and set up his brother was sleeping the drug dealer instead of just opening up
