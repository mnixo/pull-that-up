the girag and experience the reason why feminism exists the only reason why it exists is because there's an imbalance if there wasn't an imbalance there wouldn't be this need to be extreme towards that side if it was like no if men were like really kind to women and there was no dispute then it would be it would be it would be ridiculous to have feminism nobody would believe in it the only reason why it can't exist like whether you believe in a lot of the things that they generalize or not and I don't I don't believe in the generalizations I believe there's a lot of good people out there and I think as soon as you start lumping men into general categories it's just like well um ping women or anyone in the general categories we're too broad in a Spectras always an exception everything there's too many different variables when it comes to humans interacting with each other especially sexually but the only reason why feminism it exists at all is because there's something wrong if there was nothing wrong if there was no women that were getting shit on if there was no a sexual harassment in the workplace if there was no discrimination when it comes to employment if those things existed you couldn't make the argument it just it's that simple that nobody would buy it the women wouldn't buy nobody would join they'd be like what are you talking about like ever men men and treat women like their themselves living another life right yeah but that's not the case so when you have whether it's the men's rights guys or the feminists the reason why these groups exist is because something's wrong there's not a balance you know and there's always gonna be someone that's out there on the far end of the seesaw try to tip it one way or the other it's but that they exist because something's going on the men's rights guys exist because there's something going on because a lot of guys do get fucked over in divorce man I've seen it I've seen some brutal shit happen to men in marriages I've seen some men that were targeted by women who were just there were financial assassins and they went after men for their money and got pregnant with these men for their money and stole money from these men I've seen yeah I know it happens I've seen it without this the baby part I've seen I've seen people get fucked over I've seen it happen many times that doesn't mean that the men's rights guys are right when they say stupid shit like men get raped more than women you know yeah you fucking get raped by each other you dump fuck that's such a dumb thing to say it's it's so it's like it's such a disingenuous argument are you really worried about being raped booed because I don't worry about it ever how about that toko to prison I don't worry about getting raped man it never comes up no and I'm around UFC fighters all the time I'm around people who actually could rape me it doesn't really come up I just what a guy says that if a guy was talking about divorce laws and the idea that you know someone can actually target someone and someone can extract money from them by you know by it basically a conspiracy you're conspiring to rip guys homes and that's what a gold-digger is it's a whole profession this song's about it I mean it's not like a kind of a myth like a unicorn or something like that it's not.you pucara it's a real fucking thing it's a category in society gold diggers and you know that's not good either but then there's the guys who fall for those traps where's that that's natural selection you stupid fuck how do you not look at her and look at you and not know she's after your money you're disgusting right what do you think it's your personality you know you're walking around with a fucking $10,000 watch on driving a Ferrari and you wonder why women want you to pay for the rent okay that's what you do stupid look at I'm on both sides that's how rocket but you know I'm trying to I'm trying to bridge gaps here trying to bring people together trying to let feminists and men's rights advocates and and everybody know that we're all just humans when I seed like I was watching this thing about atheism plus I don't know if you know what a few of them isn't pluses sees the people that want to attach atheism with core values like against sexual harassment racial discrimination my and they would they had this really long for both speeches but my problem with that when I was watching that I was like duh right duh that's what it essentially that's what it is anyways it gay marriage duh yeah racial discrimination duh you know what women sexual discrimination duh all of its duh yeah it shouldn't be there right it should everyone should just we should all know that it's like when you start railing on about it you make me want to sexually harass somebody because you're so fucking annoying and it's so obvious what you're saying it's so stupid to keep harping on shit that I say we shouldn't stab babies yes profound yeah nobody well if you don't want gay people to get married you're a fucking asshole right if you don't think that black people should have the same rate of pay as a white person you're an asshole if you don't think black people should live in your neighborhood you're an asshole if you don't it's all nonsense it's it's so clear by this day and age that it's duh so when I see something like atheism plus and these long drawn-out speeches where they're mentioning all these other things that we should already agree on right like where are we starting from we starting from barbarism are we fucking pirates are we are we educating fucking horrible criminal people it feels like yeah it was like stop harping on this shit enough already we should literally make two countries we should saw the fucking country in half and put up a giant fence and anybody who doesn't want to in marriage anybody who doesn't want black people anybody you know hates Asians get over there stop right you need to figure it out on your own too many people already figured it out half this that's to I would say like a small island I would plug an island just let him go and do that it might even be half the people but it's gonna be but my point is if you're joining atheism plus Jesus fluffy aren't you already there I mean you really have to repeat that I mean how much preaching to the choir has to be done they've done chirp on that same shit that we all rational people already agree in saw this bitch right we'll take the left you take the right go right and we can all live in each other spots we want to but let's improve let's recognize what we have over here we have a bunch of black haters a bunch of Jew haters bunch of gay bashers all in one country we could give them Louisiana not Louisiana's pretty cool we should we give them North Dakota give them South Dakota nobody even goes there I would say Rhode Island the South Dakota people too like Connecticut they'd be so happy this is spot to give them some upper Alaska areas will they have camps that's we should do take races you wanna know how much you're gonna love black people after nine months of living with polar bears I idea let's take everybody and put them in a kid that's never been done before has it well clearly we have too many people that suck
