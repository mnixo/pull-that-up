hello freak bitches I don't know but I feel like remember when you told me that story about the monkey that you had that you had her on fear factor beat my ass that when she held that little thing you thought this thing's made of wood that that's what I feel when I get you up on my shoulder I'm like damn this thing's made of wood dude I was telling Jamie I think I've told you this story I've probably told to everybody I've met that I have a little baby chimp on the set of Newsradio like way back in the day was supposed to be in some stunt that I tell you this I probably said it before this little motherfucker was on my back and he hit me a couple times and I was stunned I was like oh no this is not what I thought it was like I thought it was like a little person my god this little person thinks he's a badass let me just calm him down no he got just hit me a couple of times on the back I was like what in the fuck I just was thinking it immediately I started doing the math in my head and thinking what it would be like to being confronted by a full-grown chimp okay well that's my argument with the silverback versus grizzly you said grizzly because Grizzlies you even more than fucking badass than a chimp grizzly a grizzly can't like there's no way a chimp can outrun a grizzly there's no way no chance in hell what's the suit I don't know if I that's true what is a silverback full speed I really can outrun us so everything I know it I'm straw I feel confident I think chimps are faster than gorillas and I think it grizzly can outrun a chimp genocide for me I think there's no way the gorillas getting fucked do them telling you right now big ass until your hands feel like when they shake mine so I would be I guess I'm not like a grizzly but you're a giant dude who'd crumple you like a empty pop it would even it would even be like you wouldn't even feel you he would go through you like whipped cream fit 25 miles an hour top speed so it was it feels like 20-25 similar animal speeds 34 but it feels like 25 what that mean this is from someone riding its back get to a different website oh my god I love the name whap PD where'd that come from do you know where that came from for elk speed of animals calm a wha PD yeah what is it where's that word come that's what an elk is dude I but I why it's actually a Wapiti who called it the Wapiti what is that where's that name come from heard it it's a cool name Wapiti Wednesday is the hashtag damn uses it a lot powerful Wapiti Wednesday camp I said it silverback I don't know did you think a champ is faster jump off there don't you think it ship is faster than a gorilla me a silverback okay have you seen a silverback come out of the frickin told you so yes what I'm thinking it's it's a it's just like an archery argument yeah maybe the bear gets a heavy arrow slower speed fast arrow but there's not much of a difference in the speed it's real close and a grizzly bear is so much bigger moving so much more mass around like if a big grizzly is 500 pounds a silverback I'm pretty sure I mean a big grizzly interior grizzly what is a big one 900 is that really I'm not I'm not a mountain chrisley there's a more aggressive one that's right a six is 700 and the really big ones are the coastal ones right yes they call brown bears for sponsors yeah why do they call them that but because it's the same animal it's a different species is it yes yeah they don't interbreed right they're bigger they're brick this is a totally different bear yeah one looks like a Volkswagen with hair and one looks more like a Ford truck it's one of those other things were the the one that has the scarier name is like not the biggest one which is weird like brown bear sounds like oh yeah poke yeah Klondike bars yeah that's right what would you do for a Klondike bar I live in a place where there's no vegetables it's a conspiracy theory Toller bears brought that up they literally made the is to make themselves look cuddly so humans would be stupid F to walk up to him do you think it's like a nature trick like nature made them cool to look at so we don't mind as much that they're murderers I would argue Disney fucking right like that Bambi movie so Superman is slower by 10 miles an hour is there anyone that race fuck that old you know but is there any strength of a silverback versus a grizzly I think I say this saying I really respect grizzly bears and brown bears you know that well he's there concerns a lot of grizzly bears and brown bears that were listening yeah they were there they're pumped I think that um they're all dangerous and ferocious and I think in silverback versus the nigger is you think you would win yeah I mean people who listen this podcast needs to put in the putt in the post what we need to know what people want to know I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound fucking terrified to fight a 38 pound rat so the idea 38 I just can't number because that's a fucking giant rat man but you should have said 30 40 I know but like what's a house cat way like 10 pounds no way that's that's Garfield weighs 10 ok like 7 7 pounds I'm I thought I would think someone in those signs okay now now make it bigger I keep getting what what size is it becomes unmanageable first off let's if you're not wearing welding gloves a 10 pound in shape house cat you're not fuck you up Garfield you're talking like I don't know let's talk about a Conor McGregor Garfield at coming in at 10:00 like a real good tiger cat like when I'm you know those those ones like real common house cat ones that look like a little picture this pic if you grabbed a 10 pound mountain lion needs you can control my neighbor when there were 38 pound my neighbors good buddy mine and he he saw a mountain lion and he saw a mountain lion when he was walking his dogs get these little cutie dogs he's walking little cutie dogs and he saw this fucking thing it saw its tail and picked it up picked the dogs up and ran back to his house and then Mark got on a website got on a website and found out that uh that they attract this animal and that it had a collar on it and the track did and it got hit by a car on the five and he's explaining like how the whole the whole thing went down and I was like wow like that thing you were walking your dogs in this big-ass cat it's like a hundred twenty pound plus cat there's an actual cat that had a collar he knew that's the one he encountered yeah yeah he saw he saw the collar and then he went on the website and you can track because he'd found out that this cat it died and when he found out the cat died he went and oh the sound of whiskey are you good yeah I'm good dude trust me your yetis talking a lot of stupid shit I definitely have how dare you you one of those guys bro you never been drunk as me bro quit bullyin me sorry it's my instinct well we're just what what the fuck was I just get oh yeah among other things so a silverback is essentially like a super super primate right the most super super Prime yes but a bear is one of the most super super freak predator animal freaked out things like if a bear was little like a nine pound bear like the size of a nine pound rat was trying to kill you you'd be freaking the fuck out if it was running at you like a little tiny bear you'd be fucking terrified now think of a giant one and realize how you you are totally defenseless and I don't think it's gonna be that much difference for literally think of a silverback gorilla with the way they're built and they swing around I think if you stood on the chest of a grizzly could grab its paws and literally rip its arms out and feed it with it wow that's King Kong was a good movie I agree with it there I enjoyed it as much as the next name I'm thinking it Kong but I believe that I don't think that's correct I don't think they're that strong as the thumb the thumb dubs does give an advantage that right it could grab ya and wait it's a little smarter yes around a little yeah Jamie mm great but he just ABARES way stronger way stronger way stronger they could smack it once him no let me move it well I've seen that I've seen a grown man grizzly hit a moose and can yeah you told me that that I've seen you saw it with your own eyes right is there any solid information of strength of a silverback Burton there's not there's just a lot of people have argued this on the internet for less we get dangerously close to this argument seriously why don't they put Thor's hammer on the ground and like put a put a taco in it or something to wear a grizzly has to try to grab it and pull it off and have a censor versus the silverback doubt well the grizzly definitely can't grab is hard because doesn't have thumbs like we talked about but I think yeah but that's relative to a beating right how many fighters have a big ass and a lot of like leg power crow cough versus someone that's just sheer grill up top let's do go there I just wonder how strong a gorilla really is in comparison to what's essentially like a giant dog I just think he's gonna get far you crazy you think the silverback is equivalent to a giant dog no a bears what I'm saying is a bear a bear is like essentially a giant louse Tony but [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
