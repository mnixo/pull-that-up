hello freak bitches North Korea has a constitution which is for display purposes only but what really governed the country is the ten commandments of the Kindle song and the tenth commandment is I forget what is something there it's the revolution shall be continued through the generations until it's completed which means only a descendant of Kim il-sung can be the leader so Kim jong-il had three sons the middle one is a sissy so he doesn't count he's assisting yeah how so they said he's too much like a girl like that's all we know about him and he's a big Eric Clapton simple I like this guy his pictures of this guy there's some on line yes sitting there was shoes off so the eldest son was Kim jong-nam and the youngest was Kim jong-il and Kim jong-nam wanted to liberalize Kim jong-il said no so if Kim jong-un is going to be replaced the only one who could have replaced him was his older brother kim jungnam so if he's killed that's an insurance policy oh so he killed him just to make sure that he wasn't overthrown yeah and he killed his sons too right no he killed his his his aunt's husband oh Jesus yeah but she drove his daughter to suicide so there it's Game of Thrones inhuman sick sick sick stuff Wow and they boast about I mean when I was doing my research for the book they don't they boast about all the sick shit they do like North Korea was recently criticized by the UN for having concentration camps and they literally said we don't use that term so we don't have any that was their response what are you going to do about it that's how I described the first and only time I ever smoked gust oh Jesus he did that well I hung out was like when I was at one of the neighborhood's I moved into happiness is there a fucking gateway drug to us and tell ya it's called solo what did they go right from Diet Pepsi to done I don't know I got is my stories I moved on to this street called Independence Avenue in in the valley it's like West Valley kind of DeSoto Sherman Way ish and it was heavily Latino neighborhood and like we moved in and it was cool I mean like I lived I came friends with a lot of people but like I went from like the end of elementary school into junior high right in that era so like once we hit the junior highest like a lot of the de Mexican kids I was hanging out with started hanging out with you a little bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them were dealing in like kind of gang life over there it's just part of the way they get down and then so and a lot of them I can fucking do dips which is like a fucking Sherm cigarette dipped in a motherfuckin angels on angel dust sounds like a healthy choice dudes out that's how I wound up with this this little tattoo right here first tattoo I ever had in my life this little three dots normally is supposed to be up here but I wasn't in the gang and so it's like for some reason they was so fucked up this is what I love I mean represents what they call me vida loca it's like little three dots here but it's like that happened because I smoke dust because I these dudes pass me the shroom I didn't really know what I was I was like this bang and the literally the way you just described that time travel and it was like I felt like if I thought of something to do by the time I was finished with the thought of thinking to do it I had already done it I'm gonna call my mom goodbye mom you guys like that kind of day it was like fucking nuts I fucking never experienced anything about my hair apply clarify terrified I didn't know what the fuck's going on it was almost like you know implemented gaming's a lot of feelings if you remember the first Friday movie when Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody snuck him a little piece of dust and he fucking lost it so I didn't lose my mind naked all that shit but I feel like I was the butt of a joke that night like like somebody gave me some dust it was like let's watch black in the white boy fucking trip on dust on stage and everyone but it made for a good story on toe broken so now I'm real duh you don't have to sit there and say well hundred years from now they're going to be looking at our level of knowledge and they'll be saying the same exact thing what do you think would be the big one would you think it would be antidepressants you could be painkillers that they're haunting out what do you think would be the big one to be freaking out about today I think about what we figure out what we're doing out it's I think it's over well mainly going to be my god that quaint medieval destructive belief they held on to them about human agency and freewill hmm whoa they punished people who had brains that couldn't regulate their own behavior they punished people who because of toxin exposure or stress during adolescence welled up with brains they couldn't control this without a particular junctures and they used words like justice back then wow I can't believe the stuff they did it was practically like gangs of like Gordy respess getting burning torches and going and burning down under whatever's around the me Castle in terms of senses of the word justice and applying to what biology has to do with behavior there's so few people that share this idea that you're having obviously your sense of it is so much more educated in the average person and you understand all the mechanisms behind all these particular behavioral problems that people have and all these different things can affect the way human beings operate but most people are not aware of this I mean literally most people I give you out of guess it might be in a ninety percent of people haven't really considered all the factors that lead to someone having a brain that would put them in these impulsive decision terrible decision making situations well what's what gives me a little bit of sort of optimism is most people though at least in the West have done that in a couple of realms like five hundred years ago if you had an epileptic seizure the smartest most reflective most compassionate like Middle Ages bleeding heart liberals even would have had an explanation for what caused an epileptic seizure which is your demonically possessed and the therapeutic intervention was to burn you at the stake and now instead we're 3 or 2 min to having a mindset where instead we make a biological statement oh it's not him it's his disease oh he's not demonically possessed he's got something screwy with his potassium channels in his brain unless he gets synchronized outbursts every now and then is a seizure disorder like it's taken us about 500 years to do that one to go from this is a blasphemous behavior where we know the intervention which is to burn somebody at the state the same oh it's a biological problem and we even recognize constraints with it if somebody has uncontrolled epilepsy that's treatment resistant they may not be able to get a driver's license but you don't sit there and say yeah let's have a burning of the driver's licenses and the epileptics it's about damn time they caught but they were no it's a realm where words like evil or soul or punishment or justice is totally irrelevant oh it's a neurological disorder so it's only taken us about 500 years to get to that point so maybe you know we've done that cognitive leap at least once how much shit is going through under the city every minute the Comedy Store has a bathroom there's a new bathroom they just put it yes other Nancy it backed up last night oh no yeah they have old pipes in a new bathroom I don't know what they did they replace the pipes but something went wrong hopefully I walked by the bathroom last night I was like what the fuck is that narrowed about the smell of shit outside of the water that is just so Oh Oh Chris back to the dog thing this is my we're talking about our dogs like rolling and shit and stuff my cousin's dog the other day they people coming to paint the house and my cousin's wife told them hey listen you can use our bathroom don't worry about go you know you don't to go outside you just our bathroom is your bathroom but they didn't really speak English they didn't really listen to her and some guy took a dump in the bushes the dog rolled around and Akira came running inside and she's like oh what is uh oh my god oh my how did you get human shit on your head oh my god Schumann shit it smelled different and then they went outside and looked a man like you guys use our bathroom are we so sorry Oh No oh my god my saga so hey look what I found these guys are great have you seen
