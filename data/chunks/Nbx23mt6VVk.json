fucking my wife was there and Juana came and lady who takes care of mercy and they didn't steal a fucking the Mormon stole my pipe let me tell you something I got in that car and hunted those two be a little cockeyed bitches down all over I couldn't find them they never came back they stole my pot pipe do you think they stole it because they were just stealing things or do you think they stole it because they didn't want you to be engaging in such horrible behavior smoking marijuana when you're taking care of your child I wasn't smoking taking care the job don't always leave without there's always that salami I mean like you have one you have a child but you still smoking marijuana I like how dare you what are you doing with a pot pipe that we need to take this from him they smoke anything cockeyed no more that two bitches a cockeyed no more telling holes in her feet and the shoes what religion since people knock on doors on Memorial Day that's a guaranteed slam through the doors in the face didn't you have another one that you kept like he kept coming back yeah I had a Jawa witness I was stringing him along I want to talk to you caught me at a bad time come back on an hour and see him lurking it for the mass that beat Dragutin gong I said I had him strung out for like four months every time we come over you know what I really want to talk to you give me those pamphlets eyeballing them you think starting from your your face that your zero set point of just you know now we're gonna reboot civilization you would think that if you had this kind of process each candidate would be more impressive than the next I mean well you'd be like I can't believe I came to the podium like James yeah it'd be light you'd be like the dunk contest you know for the NBA be like oh my god like just one you thought you saw the best dunk in your life you know the next guy comes along exactly and it would be that it would be that on every topic right it would be like you'd be talking about the science of climate change you'd be talking about the the the actual dynamics of the war on terror so topics that that seemed had to have no relationship where you would have to be you'd be amazed that anyone could be an expert in all of them you would find someone who was an expert a functional expert in all of them a jeopardy winner dude yeah yeah but and but someone who is also ethically wise who doesn't just wasn't obviously an asshole right and who who had a mature relationship to change in his or her mind right so like that this whole bit about flip-flopping and and not you know being caught it like it says someone who could honestly represent changes of mind in you know across a political career right there's no it's nowhere written that it's a good thing to believe today what you believe twenty years ago in fact if you do that on every topic it means basically you haven't been in dialogue with the world but there's something it's so taboo to change your mind that either you have to lie about it or you have to pretend it was always that way or it's just a I'm an assistant yeah the the the the system is is broken in that respect but given the choices you know and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of compromise and capable of not just just breaking the entire machine and you have someone who's just he just got stepped off the set of his reality TV show and then lied about everything and a an elbowed his way you know onto your television set and never left because you know CNN couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else it's it's amazing well he's a product of attention because they realized that there's a the heated race right the heated race this guy was really famous and in a heated race this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune in to him so everybody had to tune in to him so because of him saying crazy stuff he accelerated the amount they were talking about him so they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people and but he's created a wormhole in our political process now where there's nothing so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who like him to have so he can just keep it to like nuclear bombs of craziness that the the press can't ignore that the every time they think okay this is the crazy thing he said that's going to harm his candidacy so let's shine a light on it it just helps him you know he could just he could you know he could even get on Twitter right now and say you know who I'd like to fuck I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj and it would work for him it was hard for me you would see a you would see a tweet storm of a billion people who say I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj to go get her and it's insanity that's where we are but did you ever do a program thing did you like go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting or just stop no I had a so I had there were a couple times where I was like all right I need to I need to quit and quit and that never works and then there was one night where so it's it's the first real time on the road I was terrible with women in high school in college and then suddenly I hit the road as a comic and they're everywhere and they're interested and life is different and so there was a show I was doing a show for a sorority and usually the sororities that sponsor comedy shows are like the philanthropy sorority and they're all terrible no these girls were all hot just just dimes the whole chapter just thought they had like one ugly friend as the charity but they had just gorgeous girls and my opener goes up in bombs and then I go up to a standing room only crowd and crush and so now it's afterward we're hanging out there's like this after-party thing that they put together for just them and the two of us one of which they hated because he bombed and like they're just these eight hot girls surrounding me one shouldered another one out of the way to sit next to me I was like this is this is I've like nothing I've ever experienced and then they took us to another party and I'm pretty sure someone put something in my drink not in the way of like I want to fuck this guy in the way of like this is a guy getting all the attention away from the other guys and I think one of the other guys fucked with my drink really yeah because I got super violently ill very quickly like very very quickly and I spent the whole night I was supposed to stay at the sorority house like the plan was I was gonna stay in the guest room so I didn't even have to do the whole excuse of like hey can I use your bathroom can I come in for it like I just I was supposed to go back there with them and I spent the entire night just just vomiting it was terrible Wow somebody spiked your drink and then I lost a gig the next day and at the time it's my first year on the road I lost a $1500 gig the next day because you were so sick I couldn't do it I was we were driving it was the middle winter but I was wearing like two pairs of pants like two sweatshirts and in the sleeping bag in the car with the heat on full-blast and I was shivering the whole way like I was fucked up now so I'm sure you didn't have like the flu or something that it went away like six hours later so it could have been it could have been a very temporary flu a well time flu I don't know but that was the night where I was just like I can't keep doing this have you ever heard of a drug that does that like a drug
