hello freak bitches you know and when so many people are driven or the entire life is about fear mm-hmm and it's all it dictates everything they do versus following your gut and putting the fear aside and once you do it makes all the difference in life yeah fears good it's a motivating factor yeah well it's also the lack of fear can be very dangerous one of the things that I would say like people that aren't scared when they're fighting like those people are in trouble you're in trouble man you should be fun nobody likes to be scared but when I was competing the worst tournaments that I ever fought in I was not nervous I was too confident and I just performed poorly but when I was fucking terrified and like completely on edge then your body's just it's just primal it's just like you get down to that that the the bare minimum amount of understanding of what you have to do of the thing the rest of the world fades away and all you're thinking about is that task you cutting out everything else there's no thought about bills there's no thought about the future there's just what's going on in front of you right now and with if you can get down to that that's when you perform at your best but it's fucking terrifying so nobody likes it nobody likes to be like when you see guys that are in like the UFC that are like like here's a good example now I'm a big fan of Luke Rockhold he was way too relaxed he was gonna kill Michael Bisping and Michael Bisping fought that fight like he was that going in against a fucking silverback gorilla he was terrified or not terrified but you know jacked up with nerves and like you always on the line for me yeah yeah and that's how you walk knocked him out such a great sport his first knockout two in the UFC it's his first KO like that that's I was telling on the way that's like Jorge Rivera in Manchester a long time ago beatdown mayhem Miller as a TKO but the the TKOs yeah I mean he's also sitting down as punch is better Jason Perillo his boxing coach has really been working with him and done a fantastic job with him and with Chris cyborg and a bunch of other people that she their build up to that reminded me of Keith Jardine talking about Houston Alexander it was like I kept thinking like man he's really dismiss like not even in my league and all that stuff and all of a sudden yeah you're done yeah you can't when a guy's a professional fighter if you just stood there and let him punch you in the face would it knock you out yeah absolutely okay so that it can fucking happen it comes all the time yeah and the last thing you want to be is the guy that says this guy can't beat me I'm gonna go in there and fuck him up and then you wake up with a flashlight in your eyes like what what's going on the doctor saying every don't move like oh shit what happened motherfucker yeah and then you have to deal with that that ego that allowed like the ego tells you that it's gonna protect you from all this you know you're the baddest motherfucker you don't need to worry about shit whoever you have to worry and then blam you know like god damn it ego the ego leaves you alone like where are you now bitch he goes come on it's okay to say it just don't believe it yeah yeah and even if you say it really yeah yeah well look at your Santa - these guys are killers yeah I mean I just man that Sports awesome it's a crazy sport is Brandon's got me into it and I'd never miss a fight now have you come live yet I have yeah where have you been to live I went to Don Thompson Hendricks I've been like 25 oh yeah now I know Lorenzo Fertitta nephew owns go go hunt yeah yes runs on our buddies so he took me we got full access oh yeah the big ones coming up next weekend you only diference alive oh yeah been on TV oh yeah yeah I was like wait I need a belt here Rogan so I know what's going on well they have these little things these little radios that you can get at the you know the concession stand can you really yeah most that most arenas have them now and you take these little radios and you you turn them on and it actually has a frequency that picks up the commentary really yeah it's excellent it's really cool I missed that part yeah well sometimes something's going on you don't know what happened yep yeah and like like they stopped the fight like why they stopped the fight you don't realize oh is fuckin legs broken or yeah exactly it takes a while yeah yeah yeah commentary and it also oh I believe you can get I'm not sure about that that might just be fight pass one of the cool things about UFC fight passes you could listen in to the corners oh you can yes the corner guys are miked up so you can you can hear like someone saying oh you know his hands broke or oh you know this is what you get insight that you wouldn't yeah yeah you just get you get insight and you also get a sense of building up anticipation like if you know that the guy's got an injury and then he's trying to gut it out it makes it even more exciting to watch you know it's like I said I only got a couple hobbies watching MMA hunting that's it and then there's a very it's very they're very comparable like you know from going from being a wrestler I mean you do you mean it's just it's exciting it's slow portions of nothing and this training and grinding and all of a sudden and then every now and again you get to step in and and and see where you're at I mean yes it's it's you know like you always say like to guys I mean that's that's a stripped down of the gets you either win or lose fifty fifty I'm either gonna win or I'm not and same with hunting I mean at certain point in time in that hunt you either either get them or you don't like that the percentages work out like that I mean it's that's that's the cool thing about it well I think also like honey it's very it's not perceived correctly by a lot of people it's very misunderstood and a lot of people think of it as this barbaric awful thing involving bullies and assholes when really they're incredibly intelligent difficult people were pursuing one of the most one of the most difficult things to do with dire physical consequences if you fail those bullies and assholes they don't have the dedication that you know they're those aren't the real guys well they don't have the understanding of who they actually are in order to face your own fears like a lot of the bullies and the assholes like you can get a certain distance with that with physical power and genetic attributes I mean some guys just hit fucking hard and they're just good at taking a shot and and if you stand in front of them wael with them they might catch you knock you out and beat your ass and you just got beat by a bully but the reality is when those guys get to a steep a Miocic or Cain Velasquez or you know the best of the best they're gonna get fucked up yeah because those guys are just as just as physically strong just escape but also have their mental shit in order have their ego in order they have their understanding in order and those guys are some of the nicest most down-to-earth people you ever gonna meet because they get their ego checked on a daily basis every one of them I met we have some guys that our customers are TJ and Mendes and I mean they're really sharp guys very sharp and very nice very polite not assholes very thoughtful I mean just great people to be around
