hello freak bitches you wanted to be the head of police of Chicago is that still going on no I mean they certainly the corruption went in and so we could tell that story real quick what they did is they did a national search so the laws in Chicago said that this appoint police board has to do a nationwide search and then they give three names to the mayor the mayor investigates those people and then chooses one so I predicted they weren't going to go with me I'm too far ahead still that no one's really ready to take that bite yet but it's still something we could have talked about and they would have had the opportunity I figured they would pick that they they would pick a black guy who was educated and not from Chicago that was my prediction and that's who the police board did choose they chose a guy from Atlanta who fit that bill to the tee he was going to be the black guy that represents the police department but still totes their line I'm thinking of a word that everybody knows and I'm just not saying it so you can all pick up on what I'm suggesting you say and Uncle Tom yeah and and some people have an Uncle Tom he's a nice guy you have an uncle and his name's Tom don't worry about it so that's what they're gonna look for something that will visually seem satisfying ice-like and structurally be exactly the same mm-hmm they so they chose that guy and the mayor still said yeah I don't know that guy I'm gonna choose this guy that didn't even apply and that's he's the commissioner so who is this guy that didn't imply he was couple ranks down already in the agency he is he said that he has never seen misconduct or corruption in the Chicago Police Department in his entire 27 year career he is intimately tied into a cheating scandal and the promotional test another thing that she could solve easily so his friends like wife or something got number one the lieutenant's test which is extremely qualifying so say and as soon as the information comes down that he actually was the one that was developing the tests had the answers and then she gets this super high score out of nowhere and you know it's when everybody says oh come on we've seen this before we know what it is right so you could solve it you could retest them right and see who does it first of course not so they're not going to do that's right they have any interest in exposing thing so if I'm going to come in there and I'm going to say all right that's it we're gonna be transparent I don't think they're ok so now when you say that you were a little too far ahead what do you mean by that well it seems the people of a city or of any area have to be pushed hard enough to have that change like they have to have that breaking point where they say that's it we're gonna do something different because what I really push is for civilian controlled policing I want you guys to tell me what what should be done which is a huge drop in power so that's that would require a mayor that's willing to give in to the people that have pushed hard enough to say look I'm going to relinquish control of my essential armed wing and I'm gonna give it to the people and so this isn't done before not that I'm aware of not in America it certainly hasn't so who is going to be the city that takes that leap it has to come it has to we all know it one of the things that I've been ranting about a lot lately is choice you know in people this we live in a society that loves to take choice from us and say all right everything is a disease everything is privileged everything is this thing you know you really didn't have a choice because there were these preconceived conditions and and there really is robbing us of choice because with if we accept our inherent superpower which is choice then we have responsibility for who we are and if we have responsibility for who we are all of us have such a harsh self judge that every failing we have if we say well it was up to us the judge just beats us to death about it so we'd rather shrug our responsibilities and go with hands up to the judge judge it wasn't my fault it wasn't my fault because we have such a harsh self judge in our own head that that we intend to do that so we we give up our inherent super power which is choice because we don't want to take the responsibility but at any point we can take that back and you have to deal with the judge and you deal with the judge by making a pact to always forgive yourself forgive yourself for any of the fucked up things that have happened and just accept that we're all imperfect this idea of perfection is nonsense we're all gonna fuck up we're all gonna make mistakes and so the judge is this is nonsense you know it's like we're all gonna have come to the place we are you know through any variety of channels and we're it's gonna be an imperfect path no matter what so continue to pound that own you know message of self love and forgiveness and then rehan us that element of choice so that we can then decide what we want to be who we want to be what we want to go and put our intent forth and yeah and maybe not everything is possible but what better thing to do then than to fail in the cause of your greatest wish and your greatest intention your greatest desire I mean that's the ultimate warriors death that's what they would talk about with Valhalla to find an enemy worthy enough to kill me in battle that was the the ultimate idea and we can all choose those battles and choose that thing that we're fighting for and fuck if we fail so what but at least if we're going out on that way you know we'll go out with a smile 100% of the time but it starts with re harnessing that choice I got a bunch of shit for coming against the naked shows they do comedy shows what naked shows they do these naked comedy shows in New York sometimes yeah the whole audience is naked no just the comics oh what the fuck unless I'm doing this we're doing this thing this weekend skank fest for two days for Legion skanks and at the creek in the cave in Long Island City and we're having a naked roast battle I see the novelty in it I argued with a girl comic who's talking about like this is about getting over things and you know there's just artistic back to it I go whatever you say I'm just telling you every guy goes there to see pussy and she's like and her argument was like no like people want to see like you know the social experiment of it and see I go I'm going to look at pussy and I'm telling you that I am Joe average in my thoughts like I am common guy but she'll run into a guy who argue against that I don't know therefore personalities I like to hear these people talk so she came on our podcast with a dude yeah we said the whole thing goes no Matt's about like you know getting over fears and copied on a dude you are just so excited to be with a backstage with a girl and everyone's like sitting there with your dick and pussy's out yep we used to me and Kurt used to do a gig in in Philly it was a we could do comedy once in a while at a burlesque place it's called the five spot or less like a date they did dancing yeah their clothes on you know they get down to the pasties and everything and and the goofy outfits but me and Kurt would do this once a month we like do comedy on that show in-between the first time we did it we Rebecca and we were blown away because it's you know well they go don't be weird backstage dogs you know it's the theater technically so the girls are running around naked other changing so they're just naked a lot and sometimes they would just sit around naked smoking cigarettes back there but naked sitting down in chairs pussy all mashed up and me and me and occur I should even pluck her throat curtains under the bus like this I'll speak for myself only I was just staring at tits and pussies non-stop I just I'll speak for Kurt I was what he was doing yeah I was staring at him and in the next week when the next time we came in next month it was there was like they put like partitions up for the girl good yeah but I'm not gonna pretend that I wasn't back there to look at you want me to force myself to look into your eyes if you're that comfortable being naked then be comfor when we stare at you pussy that's what I'm saying yeah that's sorry a t-shirt it should it should
