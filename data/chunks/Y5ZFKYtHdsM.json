four three two one and we're live mr. Roth as live as live will ever possibly get on the intergrade international good to see man you really do look great you look healthy you look vibrant you look surprised no don't look so surprised yeah I haven't been to sleep since the late 80s I didn't miss a thing but I'm a little groggy but I'm good to go in my job you expect us to dissipation and illness right you know kind of get along with you you expect a disintegration right in my kind of job and let me from Motorhead style mm do you know the term wabi-sabi do you know what that is no wabi-sabi is a Japanese term that succinctly put means that which is perfect because it's a little fucked up right your favorite genes very well yeah that's like a patina on an old car hmm the guitar player in the Rolling Stones very Oh of us up yeah yes he's very well Vasavi in New York City for example the old that starts to fall apart right next to the new that's part of the beauty there your favorite leather jacket yeah is that can you expect that to increase but I don't know I'm not really an athlete I don't really train I'm kind of a singer who always traded as celebrity too you know hey show me how you do that and how many times should I lift this and what happens if I fall off of this going this fast but you used to train right used to didn't you train with Benny or Kita's oh yeah I went through martial arts the first time let me go back okay I lived in student housing up until I was just about a teenager okay and it was a time when you bought one paint brush at a time okay and most of my values come from that public library I learned to swim in a public swimming pool in my dad finished medical school okay I happened I wasn't planned in the 50s that happened a lot and so we had a lot a lot of patients who were kind of on the periphery of Pasadena California which is where we came okay I was born in Indiana lived in Massachusetts he was a resident grow up around the hospital's dinner meant going to the hospital meet that you know and when we came out to LA the Japanese were kind of peripheral spanish-speaking people curiously enough you know the running story was that there were six spanish-speaking people at UCLA and three of them were in gardening no really that way back in the 60s that was a case today easily you know massive amounts of percentage is a yo hablo sufficient days but he'll come he okay it's not the second language it's kind of the first in half now right things have really changed a mental yeah and I grew up in those neighborhoods okay so I can gang sign the whole alphabet can you really yeah I have two lowriders I've got I really like at a 51 mercury that's a shot dropped low and slow do you drive it oh yeah I got a 66 v-dub bug with a Chevy engine a 383 up in the front what a lady and I couldn't hold my gosh got a roll your R's you see old Riley what do you drive those things no we drive them all around you know it's it's Southern California of course is generating a lot of you are listening in with five layers and going hey fuck I'm not driving anywhere for the next three days according to the weather map you know but here for example it's t-shirt weather so you know the great outdoors means how's that sound over the headphones good sounds like like an engine yeah yeah but I always tricked the first time I ever we were just playing with a sword there and that's not a samurai sword that's like calling a 9-millimeter a police gun yeah it kind of is cuz they use but that's a katana right and we were playing with that a little bit first time somebody handed me those we were at the Buddhist temple in Pasadena 19 you bet I remember sixty-five and there was a demonstration of the Japanese culture thank you and fella came out and demonstrated I thought one you know there's sword arts and stuff and then he said I'm gonna take somebody from the audience and my dad pushed me and I walked out in the middle of that floor and held it you know here hold that sword just like you said wow that's what is that a hundred-year-old sword it's from the 1500 years wham-o what am i cheers something like this first time I held that sort it's like out of a graphic novel lightning you know zoom ah it's Japanese for lightning careful what you show your kids Joe well you went and lived in like last time I talked to you you were living in Japan nice you were doing kendo over there yes well you pitch up all someday I'm gonna play for the Yankees Joe I loves the wrestling for Apple and someday I'm gonna get in the middle of ringing Joe Rochas gonna say my name and I'm working my way up through ed Parker's American Kenpo system and someday I'm going to Japan but I'm gonna learn from the guys who invented this stuff now I'm putting on a pork barrel access to make it entertaining but it did and I started exactly like I did in Barham Boulevard making rock and roll with the my TV mighty van Halen in the late 70s at the Oakwood Garden Apartments in Midtown Tokyo I did not know a single person I didn't know a syllable of Japanese I had no idea where I was and no I can't drive on the left side of the street I barely carry a cell phone Karen come on and I suspect that a lifetime of adventure you do all the traveling come on artists to artists you're at home everywhere now aren't you yeah a lot of ways yeah who are the comfortable one in the room especially if there's conflict which there always is and that's what's the most unsettling to the to the tourist travelers hmm you're at home when you first start learning Japanese comes in three stages first you watch kids shows on television because they pronounce everything and nobody interrupts then you watch the news everybody speaks with a perfect accent bigger words nobody interrupts and then you start going with me to the movies in the middle of the day on Tuesday in Tokyo at Ginza and you're the only pale face in the room it's all in Japanese and it's the movies everybody's interrupting everybody shooting screaming sirens airplanes going by and if you can begin to decipher even one character then you'll develop yours maybe why do you know how to write it well you practice that certainly and think of it as cross-training all right there are a lot of schools for example Hebrew school you always hear about Hebrew school before you go to bar mitzvah class it's an ancient way of wait a minute got to develop the side of your brain by correlating designs with language with meaning that may not actually be in English nobody's walking around speaking Hebrew after all the only four summers of why but you developed that side of your brain to where you start to have a capacity to learn in an accelerated way so all your best musicians speak a couple languages we're best politicians speak a couple ball you're best artists architects all your best design folks and stuff speak a couple of language it's no secret that you develop that side of your brain if your kids don't speak Spanish get after it I have to learn a language it's never too late you'll see the difference you don't I did every single day everybody called it Roth University in Tokyo every morning two hours Japanese class you know speaking the language I can get things done for you but I'm not conversant right you're follow the end result is that it's cross-training mmm all right long-term memory my short-term memory is a little too short get shorter but you'll see the difference in your ability to remember what you read to start remembering everything you see sometimes that's dangerous because of the fact that you're learning this new thing so you're activating as part of your brain oh yeah they'll start it off with little kids in art class for example where you take a pencil and you got is just a pencil what else could it be well in this environment is a stick shift no it's not it's a Kubo ton he's got Joe's wrist no the little girls go it's a bo dad me I'm a hero I'll save the day and you can start to think in those terms using actual language movements same thing at this point in your career with jujitsu and grappling you have a vocabulary that starts to expand expand by having to learn and challenge and challenge people marvel at Anthony Bourdain gun lesson one his biggest talent was to be at home everywhere yeah no matter what somebody might say or a posture or present he was able to let it go by win later or no will Duke it out right here hmm and he had the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it so maybe it's stay cool school what do you think well he just had a fascinating mind for travel and food and culture and he just wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw things differently and if you think I kind of feel bad now for people that don't travel I really do I just feel like that you're missing so much of what a human being is mm travel is a little bit perhaps like music or looking at art on the wall you kind of have to have somebody teach you how to do it a little bit yeah yeah it's like the fight game yeah yo you know you somebody could sit with you and get really bored with technical boxing it might be the best you've ever seen and it's not a slugfest or prong you have to explain well see some jazz bitches brew yeah kinda McGregor's bitches brew arguably one of the several it's all over the place and illicit and some is very contained like the disc jockeys voice yeah there's a very mekin the Jazz thing is a really good analogy because you're either in a jazz are you not in a jazz and I I've never liked elec of his background music but I have a good friend my friend Alonzo Bodden is a jazz aficionado and he like hosts jazz tours and stuff and he's a stand-up comic so he'll do like comedy on these things and he just loves it I mean he like lives for it well I see the look on your face just because nobody taught you how to taste beer mmm if beer works in three parts and like it says in the Pickwick Papers you don't taste it with a sip we tasted it you gotta go you got a quaff you got into something and when you describe well there's the finish to the taste of a Cuban cigar you mean when it's finished in the at know the finish okay somebody explain these things all right what's the difference between scotch whiskey and Tennessee bourbon well there's an e in the word right whiskey there's an e and there is no easy in the word in whiskey for scotch okay that simple sort of starts it jazz music somebody explains it to you in very simple digestible Matt lofty necktie terms okay I begin to understand a little bit of what's going on how do you get how do you explain okay how would you explain jazz I'm gonna I'll really tighten up for you excuse me well at least I got my health go for me huh um we'll do it in the Beatles style here's the best way to go for somebody new and interested the McCartney note in the Lennon note okay the McCartney note is always kind of happy I've actually bumped into Sir Paul over at Henson studios and he's really happy okay in his note here how pretty that sounds sounds ready I'll do it again Lennon he's the salt in the caramel baby he's got a there's a darkness there's an edge there's a shadow listen to the last three notes my mom and there's a little darkness and both of those last three notes is where you get that little a little bit of pepper in the chocolate and it's a little whistle it's a little melancholy a neat life like that and when you put them together it doesn't sound like they do but if I could I'd sing both parts and it goes together you go Wow bittersweet mmm like my fucking career my last three really and there we go so you kind of have to listen to jazz like you would taste one okay the best for this felonious monk you know yeah same thing the right hand is Paul left hands John and he's working this thing you can't tell is it happy ever sad right I don't know how was dinner last night same it is indicative if that's what's around it cuz snatches happy that's Disney it's not just sad you know think of something somebody who's always tuning his guitar too sad there are some folks yeah Leonard Cohen mmm since past is what Bo's that sounded more like Bowie I know what you mean getting tattoos yeah two sleeves both my arms same here I know I rarely show yeah okay maybe that's a baby-boomer thing from the elbow up yeah this is all Japanese style right traditional tap style did yeah yeah well my colors were tapped in and in front is Horry Oh Shi I have the tuxedo to have you do yeah the whole cheeks and everything yeah the whole thing Wow interpreter had to sit on me and hold me down I'm not gonna kid you you know it was a trial you know what imagine is it much more painful to do with that top that way no it's uh overall I think what happens is tattoo when you get something that stings you can take it for a while it's the distance mm that counts you can the cold for 30 seconds you can make a miserable cold are you doing the cryo dunk yeah I do that stay boom you know take anything for 30 seconds right you're a showbiz man try holding that out in front of you for 15 seconds kind of a night your suit yeah Wow look at that so there's some photos of it up yeah because you never really do show your tattoos anywhere now it's not part of the show it's not part of but behind the scenes my mom who was an art teacher was the the the healing happy side of my family came from my dad I learned a box from mom really oh yeah bad Dave like my sisters call it comes from civil rod okay if you way if you get you competed for the magnet for the refrigerator okay and mom would be doing something you come up with your new drawing and she'd say should I go get the magnet and not look at it Wow you wouldn't look and go you're right stay here harsh yeah and then before you would look at it go just clean up your paint box you see your brushes okay family yes ends when I got my tuxedo first thing mom said was I really like the colors what do you do when you're outdoors playing ball okay and that's you know part of what compels what we're doing here I invented ink the original okay and this is a whole series of things that didn't exist before so products to protect your your tattoo oh yeah you know I I just whenever I go anywhere outside I spray down with sunscreen and people like why are you doing that that's like because I don't want my tattoos to fade away I have artwork on my body you have a Rembrandt on your body it's probably more expensive than the paint job on your car driving a ranger cereal for short yeah I'm serious yeah and you won't think twice about it right okay cuz it's forever all right it's forever I'm 64 doctor says 64 is the new 90 for me I believe it take my word for him a little farther down range than a ladder yeah I can tell you what I see from here you look great if you wait until you're 55 to start hitting the weight stack you will look like a 55 year old who trains three times a week right if you start when you're two digits old you'll fool mmm yo fool yeah and that's kind of the fun you just got to keep moving oh yeah you start way early when did you stop the tattoos I got my first one in 1977 all right came back from a delirious trip to the West Indies and a handful of folks that were camping out on the beach I'm a combat hippy okay peace love and heavy weapons yeah case you know they don't wanna feel the love and camping communist style somewhere in the it was in Martinique to the West Indies and we all came back got a seahorse hmm on the on the ankle oh boy how feminine yeah and then from there I waited you know most uh today what's popular for example Hispanic style you you use the badges blossom you document something here's a name here's something we got when we went on spring break here's something when we got married and you build like a mural and I waited to do the whole thing in one sweep you know thinking in terms of plans so I waited until you know I was well past that I was celebrating my 60th birthday but I got about 300 hours in on it and I'm still outdoors I'm still bouncing around and there's nothing out there I've been climbing I started off at Joshua Tree and climbing out at tok it's in the 70s didn't know how it wasn't Alex Honnold just on the show yeah okay well same circuit from camp four to Studio 54 I was on I was in both I was flavor of the week the first time when studio 54 was that happening yest okay at the same time I had just bought a Winnebago that looked like something from Breaking Bad the same way Tobago as I saw it is that I used to own that that was for nothing but going to Yosemite really you know how Al and the documentary is this is living in his van mm-hmm part of me always looks back at that it's Wow sleeping in the back of Bobby hatches pickup truck parked out in the middle of nowhere in Joshua Tree 1973 and you would be climbing even back then oh yeah what kind of equipment did you guys use back then to use today no nothing like it we used webbing for our harnessing and you used 11 millimeter kernmantle or Manila rope all right and I remember the first times in 1972 you'll see his name John Ball as pioneering a lot of the routes in Joshua Tree first time we watched him as seniors in high school go flagging you know are you pressure what can you see this on the screen there where you pull with your hands and push with your feet you know flagging all the way up the corner of a handball court at Muir high school in Pasadena all the way up to the top and then stood on the top and looked down showing incredible Wow well nine incredible talents we'd never seen such a thing and from that point you know we just floored it because living in up in Yosemite in the various parts was something new traveling to Joshua Tree TOC it's down to the beaches and such that was a constant for me I've always tried to follow something as opposed to thinking of his training even then even the word training tastes like homework right so I've always tried to I I was running for a while period of times about seven years when I jogged and ran and I decided on the road I'll run across every bridge in America that we tore through so I probably 1520 different bridges Golden Gate Brooklyn's and that's where I ran now I did smoke a joint and run the New York City Marathon and I came in right behind the wheel chairs in the back well some folks need the ribbon and they need to see the clock and everybody clapping and then there's some folks you know who just just won okay and they had took down the clock but the line was still there on the cement in Central Park hopped over the line got the picture airborne went home took a nap and that night I went out and got drunk on tequila how long does it take you to finish the marathon about five and a half hours that's not bad that's very good it's better than Bert Kreischer no no come on let's be complimentary it's the worst it's definitely yes that's about the absolute worst did you was the winner do it hour 20 I think they get it in around two hours there were like two hours in seven seconds yes I think they're trying to break two hours isn't that what's going on yeah someone's trying to break two hours so but that's what I did for a period of time you know keep going kayaking you know so you just always been involved in physical activities that were fun in the early nineties kayaking was illegal in Manhattan okay because it was dirty water and people would get trundle deliver under the ferryboats okay so what we did is we cut a hole in the fence next to the 14th Street sanitation department over by the West Side Highway you all know what I'm talking about if you're from there and we did it exactly like movie style like a great escape where we fitted the fence back with duct tape and we would drag our kayaks from Union Square West all the way down 14th Street ok and you pick up your provisions for it all right you got to get your bagels you got to get you know so that's what you know like this you gotta get something to drink get some Gatorade you know not to drink the Gatorade so you have something to is in serious and we get the girlfriends okay to wait up is in the Meatpacking District right there it's dead silent it was a ghost town then it was not hip-hop it was not going which is what it's doing now right and you go to shopping with your old idiots at Stella McCartney down there now at Benton is a ghost town man it was great scary dangerous hmm and one girlfriend what's that I got to be careful with names they're all married now how'd you manage to die mine Karen would always go north and wait around because if the cops come they would step out we would see them or whatever and we would sneak our boats through the hole in the fence into the river right where Sully landed his point right there all right and then girls would come and jump into boats and we would take off more than two or three times local PD would Shaw going hi whoa what are you gonna touch that water back then no that was that was death inky black horror death like this did you ever Duncan it accident uh no not in not in that River particular but we started a number of the trips today you there's probably six different kayak clubs that you can show Manhattan kayak club and Brooklyn clack many many now the boomers what senses of humor figured it all out all right and we would go geez we started trips we go at midnight under the Verrazano Bridge in the winter all right and you wear dry suits something you know you're long not long johns inside of a dry suit like this and don't get me wrong I would be the DJ I have a a tape player and I would Bungie tape player like this and everybody would have this is primitive time since 1990s and we would have little little microphones and the earpieces that you use on motorcycles back then so you have communications from boats about oh and I would put mine on the tape player and I'd be the DJ oh yeah we'd listen to the ballgame late at night sometimes you don't need your laughing all you couldn't see anybody in the swells and we go under the same bridge that John Travolta sits and looks at with the girlfriend it's Saturday Night Fever same bridge you know that Woody Allen in Manhattan look sad you know you have a wonderful with son the other sighs terrible imitation of either oh yes and we'd float under there full moon midnight February snow drifting like this and since it was illegal to do it we had a buddy who owned a plumbing company in Brooklyn and he would bring his truck and park it right off a Coney Island your Stillwell Avenue where the ferris wheel is and he would blink his lights Allied forces style Winkley like that and we'd be about a quarter mile off having come from under the Verrazano Bridge no why don't we see those lights blink know where to turn left dick do you even want to hear this yes okay and and okay we'd have to make the left and we'd wait for this swells like a give us another blink when all was clear and just beat ass all a quarter-mile of row row row catch the wave get out of the boat you know silently drag it all the way up the beach okay like you see in every war movie all right otherwise this about it but I don't know $200 fine or something like this and we would put the boats big two-person kayaks into the back of the plumbing truck and onto the top of it drive it back to the coffee shop on Union Square West it's very well-known like that and get drunk with pretty girls and tell him about it prints your stories and all this was going on while you were you were air quotes David Lee Roth I mean this is the 90s you're a fucking huge you're still a rockstar and you're going through polluted water in a fucking kayak hiding from the cops put the tape player and a some sort of jury-rigged microphones to some of the best places that I went rock climbing we're on walls of hotels in Europe we toss a toss a rope out the third floor of a bed-and-breakfast in San Sebastian that's covered from flagstone with flagstone from the 1400s like that and then yo yo you know one guy would stay up watch TV and work the ballet and you climb up the outside Jesus Christ hardcore jollies and you were doing this all around the same time oh yeah take my bicycles with me I'm gonna it's outdoors is in the blood you know it's part of growing up without any real things my dad was a student so uh take this stick for you it'll be a bow for me it'll be a baton when did you start working as an EMT that was around the same time wasn't it mmm EMT was about 12 summers ago for me so I was turning 50 and I started going back to school for outdoor med response camping climbing and what is it like when you go to one of those classes and they've realized who you are how weird is it kid sometimes you can get a little bit uptight because I'm the oldest guy in the room okay and I want to clarify something when I became an EMT shield number three to seven 466 47th precinct big shout-out to all of you who taught me and tolerated me until I became an EMT and put on that uniform I wasn't somebody somebody cleaned the fucking truck up until I put on that uniform Joe after training for how many months it's almost a year for me like this I wasn't someone someone clean up the truck and that was my job starting right off but I was also the somebody who dragged the oxygen box all 13 floors up in the Eaton walled projects and artist to artist how many times have you driven past something whether it's a huge building or a teepee I wonder what's in there hmm and then you go oh I wonder what's in the frigerator I wonder what they listen to in there and I wonder who the they are I have a fascination for that mmm my pop had a big sprawling I think is it simply empathy for people you know when the fellas started getting AIDS in the early 80s he started treating him he's the eye surgeon and everybody my sisters and stuff started saying but this is a time when you think you can catch that shift from breathing it pop and whatever and he turned to me I'll never forget he said I don't get to choose my patients well I don't get to choose my audience so what was the motivation to start doing that though let's go see what's in the refrigerator Joe and you'll walk in first cuz you're way stronger than me in case there's trouble and you'll go ambulance and in case somebody comes at us you handle it oh I had a I had a mentor named Keisha who had to pile her dreadlocks up so high that it was as long as from her shoulders to the top of her head her hair cut it was like she had to she put her hat up on top and Keisha walk in that door first homey domestic disputes she dealt with the guys you had to be there for domestic yeah those areas very and you get an eye on your audience stops being audience mmm starts being the neighborhood yeah and pretty soon you live in the neighborhood I was under the train once in the Fulton Street Station talking to a homeless valid quick briefing act like nothing's wrong so you can get them to come out hey you hungry train breathe okay subway train breathes it doesn't just sit there silently you gotta go grilled cheese mmm I'm laughing now but that's a nervous laugh yeah well and now every one of those folks is in my voice when I sing oh I like that I like that thought process when you decided to do this was a conscience a conscious effort to try to just enrich your experiences cross-training cross-training I'll give it the coke rationale and I also know it's gonna change me don't know how but you got to get in it and after a certain point in your life maybe go where there is no shallow and mmm challenge yourself as just as I move somewhere that's a foreign language is you can't even read the street signs in Japan for example but you know you start off on the bunny slopes you don't surf 40-footers right all right first you gotta move to New York and go through that whole thing of what have I done but what's so what's the thought process when you're like I'm gonna be an EMT I'm going to study for a year on a train I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna actually do it I okay sometimes when I go for a walk in the city my plan is to just follow where the Sun is beaming I get to an intersection the Sun is on that far corner I'll cross over to that and then I'll look down the block and see where the Sun is and I'll walk down the block and get into that part and he's did a lot of this by yourself oh yeah I did the same thing with EMT training iced geez my dad was a doctor the first thing merit badge I got as a Boy Scout was first aid I was that guy and I learned that for skinny guy like me real power probably came from being cool when everybody else is going yeah because my dad had to do that right I assisted him in surgeries at a very early age I mean oh yeah and you know and stuff that made everybody else like this pocket I have a good ambulance boys you want to hear it let me know that you're gonna be just fine do you imagine though being in an ambulance you look up and it's motherfucking David Lee Roth telling you you're gonna be okay be like oh I'm dead I must be dead I only twice has that actually happened because I only worked in the hood I only worked around it at night I only worked you know you would never expect to see me once was after Ozzfest oh geez lost ad yeah poor kid was you know drank too much or whatever and he was out of sorts corner somebody found him in from the local liquor store and you could see that this belief in his face you know when I leaned over ya and said you're gonna be just fine like this it is like the lyrics of an Ozzy song come to life ya know but beyond that no nobody ever really did and you know ah Jesus I weighed 15 more pounds I was doing the Arnold routine at the weight stack mmm because I was somebody well somebody help me lift this my fourth day mmm that pretentious about you know what my fourth day's work so you bulked up for the job oh yeah and I wait 15 more pounds and I lifted man I could lift I lifted people out of bathtubs I lifted him out of the ocean I lifted him out of the projects I lifted him out of the truck I lifted him into the other truck as the first truck just broke down in the snow and this far oh sorry how long did you do this for Irie certain once about four and a half summers four and a half years okay and I you know in between playing and whatever and again a big shout-out to all my teachers in mentor it's not a day goes by I don't think about it and not a day goes by that I don't use some skill including that you know that'll level your head a little bit yeah somebody go make some coffee Joel mmm so you feel like first guy like you who is such a gigantic superstar and you just touring these huge arenas and people are freaking out every time they see you for you it was maybe a good way to balance things out too because you're seeing people in a life-or-death situation and dire straits when they're unhealthy and they need help and and you're out there in the down-and-dirty and the nitty gritty like you know like you said trucks breaking down picking people up out of the bathtubs well a lot of what you just described is the first response team yes we always describe our patients our friends and clients okay but the struggle for our I'll call it the uniform starts with military police fire first response I'll throw in nursing emergency room in those of us with bells and whistles you call the ambulance it's cetera um you see that from the inside out yeah and that really will sharpen your vision okay for example right off the bat I pay 52 percent in taxes just tear my dollar in half have for many many years I'm all for tripling police fire medical paramedic emergency nursing cetera like that starting pay should be about $2,500 a week and on I'm free with you I would pay more tax happily I would too if that case would be and we would take what is a very set of very refined sciences and art forms everything I just described I call it the uniform because we put on a uniform when we go to work in there like that on it's time to go digital and you can start making real demands in terms of just the preparation you follow mm-hmm today being on the beat taking care of people whether you're in first response medical or answering fire calls us on part of these days you have to make the decisions of a SEAL team er mmm where's the same training where's the same gear I went to I was out in Palm Springs at the international school for tactical medicine out there in the fellows we had game wardens from Alaska we had heavy rescue from Cleveland we had all manner of folks coming through there and they all discuss well sometimes we have to share one helmet what sometimes we don't have enough guys to do this and that so we just parked the car and let them think there's something these kinds of stories follow and you start paying people what they're worth and start paying people according to what your expectations then a lot of things I don't go political there's nonsense like Charlottesville and what's happening in a lot of areas around these stages will go by the wayside they move from no qualifications necessary to a mint you guys work just as hard and you endanger yourselves way more than a trial attorney yes I personally got out of jury duty recently by saying I didn't want to get out of jury duty in fact I raised my hand when the judge says anybody here think they can do jury duty you're all trying to get out of it and I raised my hand and she said Weiss and because I now can see that there are neighborhoods where everybody is I know of neighborhoods where everybody's a liar a cheat a cripple and if they're not they're covering for somebody and she said what neighborhood is that I said little community in Beverly Hills [Laughter] the bailiff almost dropped his head everybody was laughing they dismissed me mmm too opinionated mr. Roth you've had too much life experience don't let the door hit in the ass on the way out yep have you ever done jury duty no I have not if I uh if I did get in there I'd probably just tell them I think everyone's guilty well you have cop socks and it's when you walk into the room and you know everybody's lying hmm no not really I mean I I probably should do it soon probably good experience for me do they ask you to do it I'm sure it's happened I keep showing up the last time I actually showed up a fella I think it was a dryers two guys who are being accused of shooting somebody walks up his last I don't know it looks faintly Slavic if you grew up with James Bond movies everybody will know who you are you are very popular in the Podesta coffee where are you playing next you're gonna Pasadena this yeah it's a nice house all the time yeah constantly there do you have a vibe about the ice house is there a mojo to it oh yeah please explain oldest comedy club in the known universe that that place has been in operation since the 1960s it was originally an actual ice house we're back before there was refrigeration they would bring in ice and people would go to buy ice they'd have a gigantic you know freezer type room one was insulated so would keep the ice for a long time then it became like a variety type place and then somewhere in the 60s it became a comedy club and it is now the oldest longest-running comedy club in the world 1973 I was working as a janitor slash tech in surgery at a hospital Pasadena hmm this was night shift okay Wow in their early 70s we did everything it was the stepping stone to going to medical school and I was playing an acoustic guitar okay I still take lessons playing acoustic guitar okay and on Sunday night's audition night you would sign up for audition at the ice house at 6:30 they'd opened the window and you would sign up so I'd take my dinner break and drive my opal cadet station wagon up to the ice house get there at about 6:15 wait they popped the window sign up so that I would be one of the first three to audition after the last act on Sunday night which would happen right around ten o'clock if you weren't one of the first three during audition night nobody was there and they shut it down and I would sign up and go back to work and then come you know drive myself back change out of my hospital stuff you know put on the right clothes like jeans or whatever and I auditioned there probably 15 times Wow Bob stain who owned and ran the place was just a voice over the intercom he was unforgiving bob was a famous non smiler what's funny is there's a bob that owns it now Bob Fisher it couldn't be more different nicest guy on the planet Earth oh he's smiling hugging everybody super sweetheart of a guy okay yeah well Bob stain was a voice over the intercom he was hard core you know of you go well here's a little song and the voice would say hopefully it's littler than the one preceding it and you worked your chops accordion he was your he was your Ike Turner oh boy yeah he was unforgiving and you learned quick of about timing in between transitions segue you were allowed to do three songs and if he felt your song was too long or you're you're riffing between his ego he called you out if you didn't like your shoes you talked about it you never saw him you heard it over the PA oh wow he was in the back is quite a ritual and I learned a tremendous amount about how you communicate with a with a crowd how do you talk to people as one how do you make eye contact what in fact are the wrong shoes what are the wrong shoes platforms okay David Lee Bowie will be singing as hopefully a shorter song than the last when he sang last Sunday are you the same David Lee Bowie you would hear this that over the over the PA system when kiss performs today do they still wear platforms I think it's in the contract Jill it's part of the outfit McEnroe has to yell you gotta be fuckin kidding kiss I've never thought of that like they might be the last band that's wearing platforms until it Wow everybody likes to make fun of platforms bell-bottoms sideburns so they come back around oh there's where there was something there Sarge I don't know about platforms on guys but on the right girl yeah on the right girl oh right the roles in platforms do you know into the right like oh wow that suggests different time frames that's the 20s that's the 30s that could be the 7d you know there's something about those kiss ones though that was like their inexorable right there a part of the gig like with gene Simmons he's got demon boots look at that they're still rocking them right those are new and improved costumes yeah those are digital they're definitely new and improved I like the boots I like it man that has got to be fucking hell on your knees though that's got to be hell on your lower back Stanley's still in shape yeah oh he's he looks great he was here a couple years ago you know this is where I failed I should have gone kiss Blue Man Group years ago do those of you were my age Lassie there should be four of me oh that's the move right because yeah all right no one could tell right such thing like you could replace a lot of those guys and if you didn't tell anybody and a lot someone have you ever heard the Japanese gentleman that's he does a Steve Perry impression he's the new lead singer for journey oh he's I think he's from Philippines oh is he Japanese either way fucking phenomenal yeah the guy sounds exactly like Steve Perry all right well this solicits an interesting subject perhaps compels it um are some bands like West Side Story where you can continually revitalize the production different actor it with different actors okay a whole lot of Shakespeare going on yeah okay um but you have to kind of replicate the initial sound or do you because I'm sure all of Beethoven's early orchestras are dead dead just because I don't think you can say this because this is a part of my youth Van Halen was a part of my youth I mean we used to juda the van Halen logo on our notebooks in high school along with the Rolling Stones like the mouth and you know all the kiss logo when it switched over to Sammy Hagar it became a different thing it was a different there's a whole different pivot I mean it wasn't it wasn't a bad thing no no it was the same thing saying all of Sam's lyrics contain love yes okay why can't this be love and I ain't talking about love be right back with more fighting after this who do I jog with I don't run who's my running partner yeah run with the Deaf and hello okay I want to keep going yeah should I jump should I jump might as well jump thank you it's questions and love are a great classically that's Sinatra yeah okay um but I'm not well-adjusted nobody in my job ever was much less kept at this long and I faced it embraced it well Julian strong yeah yeah chokes oh no it's all right there in the lyrics yeah even using what are considered classic music parlor tricks taking a very sad lyric and positioning it against a very happy piece of music the music is rapping it's it's it's a heavy metal rumba Bluebird do do do do do doop do do doop and lyric is she's crying yeah Jamie's crying you didn't notice that yeah yeah it's it's it there's a sense there's a sense of larceny there's chaos to it lirik there's a sense of its music for after midnight when we're all guilty Joe yeah whereas again nothing wrong with the Sammy Hagar thing but it moved into a mall crowd it was a different sort of a vibe it was it was a good vibe for a lot of folks but it was a different vibe I mean I don't have anything against Sammy Hagar I think he's wonderful I always loved that song can't drive 55 he's got some great shit but I never listened to the van Halen with van Hagar I just didn't listen to it to me it was like it was the end of an era for me it's two different folks yes I wanted to be the art project not just where one yeah so by placing everything we've discussed if you think of it as cross-training that's a great rationale yeah why'd you do that and then you did this and why it's cross train it's gonna reinforce aound it's gonna reinforce the way you're stagecraft how you even walk out on stage yeah your choice or what to wear yeah follow in your sense of humor especially well that's a great way to look at what you were talking about with the West Side West Side Story analogy because it kind of went on but it kind of didn't it's like if you took West Side Story and then you changed the story you can't change the story but you can change the voices yeah but it would be a different story like the van Halen story became a different story all right here I'll venture this okay one of my favorite freeze-dried bands in history is Toto what my freeze-dried well all freeze-dried coffee looks the same and it's great I've been camping and man there's nothing better than just a cup of fresh freeze-dried get it in the world in the wrongest places that's fun some context it's the best thing you could ever have that Afrikaans a good song it's an amazing system male that's Smithsonian level yes song yes okay Roseanne and soul does amazing any of the fellas could walk up to me and I wouldn't recognize him no you know I said would not recognize them no I would say is the greatest genius in all of music in that regard Steve Miller nobody knows who the fuck Steve Miller as Steve hold your liner yeah but mean yet some every layman knows those songs if you stay few even start to play du duta-de to do yeah did it it didn't everybody was getting ready to sing that's I'm the love me god damn he had some jams but then I don't go anywhere and then there are artists where you just can't replace it right Stuart right arguably one of the best animals in history of any genre yeah gather oh yeah that's a no weight division thing and yeah one of the all-time greats the ollie is probably Rod Stewart yeah okay um his songs you can have other people sing them but in um something other now journey I would recognize the guitar player but that's just as I listened to that kind that part of the band okay my favorite part of the orchestra is the gong it's just clarify that but Steve Perry who sang for journey okay um was not so much a personality as an eloquent sound yes all right so it's a universal sound and if you even get close to it it is part of every prom every wedding every going in and coming out party okay if you you're going into the into the army that's the last song the band's gonna play you're coming out of jail they're gonna your girlfriend's gonna pull you throw your bag to the side and run you've seen the movie yes okay even Tony Soprano we're not sure what happened but it happened to journey yes true that's right this is right okay that's very significant you can't play a David Lee Roth song and still worry about Tony Soprano right that's true half of your mind is gonna go wait a minute the long Ranger just walked into the same diner that Tony's it's it's why I have no acting career mmm I'm already a character lone ranger sits down next to you says Joe there's a forest it's a dark forest you're not getting lost in any story yes and your legs go that's tough right right right right a good actor will sit down and go a dark forest fucking scary right some people can become that other person yeah and then some people are stuck being David Lee wrong exactly you know Denzel walks out and then it's space shit you go wow that's an astronaut he could be anything you know he's a walker bad Dave rock comes he goes what's Dave doing in a spacesuit right exactly yeah we're not buying it yeah yeah I'm already kind of a cultural yeah you're anything you're already a thing yeah that's that's uh that's really interesting how there's all these great bands with great sounds and great vibes and they're all different well if you think in terms of the personality let's think of a band oh I just saw John Mayer great show all right and when you think of John you think of who that is in the neighborhood and the vibe and the mood before perhaps you even think of a specific song mm okay um as soon as you know well you I know his hits I know his songs but it was the same thing that the fellows in the Grateful Dead who said they're identifying that vibe what's more important the jokes or the person hmm what's more important you or specific jokes because some of your jokes are bound if I go flat I don't care it's Joe yeah but some of the Joe the only way they some of them the only way they work is with you like there's some people like Mitch Hedberg his perfect example like you couldn't separate Mitch Hedberg from the jokes because he was the jokes he was part of what made it funny you're right I ran into Jeffrey Ross the other day okay and he did Mike bumps into telling ya who's managing them that's a movie to happening those two right that's why that's a man foul lemon action cook yes okay that's a billion dollar fucking franchises Bernie Brillstein still alive get after this link Bernie's along hasn't agent stellar yes it is it is if they were walking around in the park doing warm-up for their routine you know and the Netflix special I expect the clapboard Woody Allen to walk out and go I think that's a tank I think though that with guys like that especially those two guys the best product is them on stage yes I'm fucking around you really don't want to make a movie you just want to keep doing what they're doing with Netflix well this is the visited vibe you have them be there's there are some folks like Jason straight them yes okay yeah she's always the same so same haircut yeah he's always Jason yes right but this is Jason in different time periods right Jason in a fast cars Jason on a horse I don't know but if he's always that and this is what compels me some folks are very joke dependent now take my wife place right I don't think that kind of thing um yourself is the audience that you see when it's like at the comedy club I've seen you at the comedy club um it's the same audience as fight night sometimes yeah yeah it's real similar in a weird way I was weird I see that I see George Michael eyebrows because I'm always trying to figure it out yeah they're real similar you know it's a weird crossover but what makes it weird what's weird that I do cage fighting commentary and stand-up comedy in the first place it's weird that those two things work together that doesn't that doesn't know that makes perfect shit for you know somebody I'm funny not happy yes yeah funny you ain't happy yeah there's a big difference yeah the more unhappy you you are the better the funny really think so absolutely really if you know how to channel mm well that's certainly the case in some situations I'm open to all possibilities when it comes to comedy I know people that are really happy and really funny and I know people that are really dark and also really funny like I don't know it's just it's different it's different with different people just like music is different with different bands and different singers exist City either works or doesn't it really depends upon how much time and effort you take working on yourself your act your perspective that we deliver it we always had to win in Van Halen we had no choice we had to win the battle of the bands it was competitive yeah we had to win over the club owner this was before there were dance systems Irwin Vega hadn't in Denton figured out those bass bins yet you had to have a live band 5 45 minutes that's a night place was your motherfucker closer song or you knew a band couldn't go on after you Lagrange yeah oh yeah we were pretty good at anything we had no development phase mmm I have tapes of us at the Hilton Hotel in Pasadena 1973 you would if I didn't tell ya you know wouldn't you would think it was three years ago what kind of a sound there's virtually no development how'd that happen how did it work that way we had classical training all right and this kind of speaks to what we were discussing earlier in that a lot of my colleagues are having a great time making music and they celebrate and it's the word fun comes into it and we grew up in classical music backgrounds where you had to challenge for first chair saxophone mm every six eight months you got to go to the conductor's say I want first chair mmm and if your first chair and he thinks I have a shy he's gonna come over Joyce's Roth's talked about you whoo you both you both get will play this piece in front of the orchestra next Wednesday you best practice okay and we'll both get up and we'll both play 18 bars of the same piece you dig yeah they're just maybe a switch in front of a hundred and twenty people mm all of them colleagues all right we learned from in music school you know the racy stuff was big-band all right if you're in terms of you know we played rocket roll in parallel but big band it's got a square vibe to it because it wound up in elevators in restaurants whatever but they had cut inconscious and there was nothing more cutting than Benny Goodman vs. Chick Webb big band at Roseland Ballroom that shit is on people would bet on it they would play the same four songs you play your version of it and we'll play ours yeah throw down a big band throat oh yeah and it was furious shit too you know it wasn't like friendly dancers would stand in the middle of those sparks and that's where you get that yeah he's postures enough like this okay and the dancers were competing the Lindy Hop is capiche Wow Frankie you know these guys throw it um so it's competitive mmm and we learned that's how you do it you know my two mentors in music were first and second share clarinet the LA Philharmonic and it comes from that also you know you have a whole different vibe that I'll take a Grateful Dead approach which is the complete opposite of that competition man leave that at home bro ya know well we're here to celebrate and so and I completely understand that's where I'll go after work take my vest off it took a totally different turn right they said go ahead tape all of our shows come you know sell food in the parking lot man we had to win we are we didn't eat boxing for money it's different than boxing for fun right right learn that very early and we learned it through music yeah you know some of the folks learn it in the ring other folks learn it in their first few days and a law firm or and they join a team it's interesting the way you describe it with music because I try to explain that to comedians I say think about how much time a musician has to spend practicing and how little we spend practicing we our practice is in front of the audience for the most part it's a simplified version of this ten big apartment a simplified version of the how many hours rule is the 10,000 hours yeah you've heard about yes that's a very simplified version mm-hmm okay that's digestible 10,000 hours I don't know you break that down was that take six years maybe something like this the true Asian paradigm is 10 hours a day every single day for 10 years if you have a little a little kid he's got to have heart surgery you want that guy rats right around 30,000 hours if you're gonna go flying in a helicopter over New York City you want captain poly try muqtada it's about 40,000 hours okay my dentist dr. Glassman who teaches is a $40,000 man okay so if you ever crash or get belted give me a call I will hook you up it's about 30,000 hours in that's ten hours a day every single day for ten years and that's what creates a jet pilot a great surgeon a great writer yeah anything in the arts and lives that's that's the architect unless you're a prodigy and if you bungle that and typing it's tragedy very easily so yeah prodigies and tragedies often go hand in hand something about people that get things very easily that for whatever reason it slips through their fingers more quickly as well when my sister my dad was an eye surgeon okay did well and when my sister's wanted to go to college he said I think that's a great idea and made her pay for it she wouldn't value it if she didn't pay for it herself it's probably right I signed my first contract when I was 13 $150 stereo and three records I worked all summer shoveling shit at the local horse table it's where I learn Spanish I don't know that you got it do that you learn the same thing from sports okay yeah your kids do sports yeah which ones martial arts and one of them is really into gymnastics yeah yeah are they competitive in it or are they do they enjoy themselves are they on team like they're unturned aren't tournaments or yeah and is that something that the get-go here I'll back up I'm leading up to something can you guess yeah I think you always are folks folks are starting to recognize certain traits in me as in I really like the getting ready more than the actual show really the actual show I'm making fun here and be a poetic right the monitor blows the guitar players pissed the spotlights on the wrong guy I have a cold but that's six weeks six weeks leading up to it I remember the rear so we did another thing and when we recorded the track over that they remember when we got measured for the shoes that fuck and it was great and it's where did we eat after that I gotta go back there and yeah we sought to make those rehearsals and whatever as memorable as possible because you can do a whole lot more getting ready then you are throwing the punch yeah ask anybody on one of your shows yes yeah you have such a great insight for that though you know some people they mean even if they're aware of it they're not consciously aware of it they're not focusing all these details the getting ready is as much of a if the band says they don't like Rare erson you're doing it wrong mmm a man's like if you're sitting on your laurels you're wearing them on the wrong part of your body [Laughter] first off where are you rehearsing right as in Miami no where are you training Hawaii Cleveland okay let's talk because even in Cleveland you can turn it into your place do you follow what is your routine you find what music did you listen to hmm you dig how did you warm up simple simple things you know most people are feared terrified of singing when they go into singing em I don't care who it is the first verse is always a little tight and the second verse is a little better why because they didn't warm up right all right and the idea of well go in and sing along with a dozen of your favorite songs put your headgear on get the reverb to Santa for me that starts with Motown I'm a soul growler I'm closer to Wilson Pickett than the guy in the Rolling Stones I don't know what that sounds like on the headphones but you know that's I spent many I'm gonna put the headphones on hear that babe yeah that's right I started sounding like that when I was 12 I started practicing that when I was 12 I started imitating the persuasions Gerry Butler's singer -13 much to the Cantor's chagrin in Hebrew school okay again parallel existences you know I'm Jewish but we've always walked around with little buttons back then that said never again I'm a combat hippie peace love and heavy weapons some people don't believe sometimes you got to get insistent did you ever realize while you were while you were in the middle of this especially in the beginning in the early days that this was that you mean you guys had especially with Van Halen in the early days you guys had a massive impact on culture were you guys aware of that like while it was happening how I mean you when I was in high school I when I graduated in 1985 and you guys were the shit my girlfriend might my sisters rather boyfriends my sisters boyfriends license plate I am with a soundtrack yeah I'm the soundtrack to your okay I get it now absolutely I mean what was that that the Jew was in jail yeah it was intentional I can tell you now the Van Halen's knew it but can't articulate it but right there instrumentalists here comes the funny joke words em my thing I understood the words em my thing so you realized it why it was happening well your endgame depends on how you started it's like chess right and we began very early on identifying that there's a whole lot of different neighborhoods in Southern California I knew this from being with my dad all of his patients was like a Benetton ad yeah you know that's part of the beauty of Pasadena you got everybody okay and okay what you play at the birthday party in the spanish-speaking neighborhood O'Reilly some kind of you got to change your evil ways broken yeah is different than what we're going to play for the surfers out of Venice Beach that's Aerosmith stuff like this and then you have the working man okay out in San Bernardino that's easy job right subtle but important genius is in the details and how you interact with that crowd in between we would play out and pull money at a biker bar guy got killed right in front of us and we finished the song what happened a couple of bike bike gangs went at it and there's a scrap and when everybody cleared out there was a fella right in the middle of the floor next night we came back vengeance had been sworn there are police everywhere we pulled the amps out from the wall so we could hide behind the amps 70s it was a mighty time Wow and we played on the Queen Elizabeth for really fancy oh my god I remember sitting on that ballroom at 4:00 in the morning in the days when we carried our own equipment and stuff and thinking of all the people who had been in there and everybody to perform there and so forth and dozens and dozens of places you know that were all a little bit different and our thing was that we could play anywhere we had to otherwise we had to feed ourselves all right and that meant five 45-minute sets at night five six nights if you could get it we would ping-pong all over the Southland anywhere we could drive for two hours two hours north south or east is how we would do and every neighborhood was a little different and that shows up in the music you know now you can take a look at something like dance the night away or Jamie's crying there's a there's a Latino influence in that okay doo-doo-doo that's Ricky Ricardo you will say well what's your favorite Cuban expecting me to name a cigar say Ricky Ricardo but it's rumba Lamott dude now you're thinking about you go yeah Incan and if you listen to dance the night away the middle break is all cha cha cha Chi is definitely because here this is you know are you're surrounded by Hispanic culture here and we had heavy metal influences okay we had super wealthy stuff so you have to be able to move to acoustic you got to be able to ease up if you get hired for a wedding and more importantly perhaps you know artist to artist I don't know it Springsteen better during the song or in the mmm careful we're going to the Broadway show yeah yeah that's about a $12,000 ticket now and I'm guessing I'm guessing before t-shirt right and I'm guessing that yeah I haven't seen the whole show I've saw some of it on Netflix and the very pivot of it is the in between songs yeah the songs are almost secondary you know they're almost peripheral to his narration in his descriptions and his poetry well he sets a deep I like you have to hear the in-between stuff you want to hear and brood you want to hear him talk you want to hear him think about things yes and where do you learn that we're dealing that mm-hmm already I'm gonna count to 30,000 Joe yeah hours and hours and hours and when we're done you'll be able to you know Joe that's not a good Springsteen you know you're a good man Joe we what I was trying to get at was does it ever freak you out like when you're ever alone and you think about what you guys did and what you've done in your career does it ever freak you out the impact you've had if you looked at the amount of human beings that have had the kind of impact that you've had it's a the tiniest tiniest fraction of a percent like the amount of human beings that can relate to your personal life experience I'll paraphrase the James Brown movie there's two of them both of them were helpful helpfully produced by Jagger okay and he doesn't interview he goes there's a little bit of me in every bucket you hear yeah he's in the DNA yeah there's a little bit of David Lee Roth in there yeah there's a little bit whenever you see videos today doesn't matter if it's hip-hop doesn't matter if it's rock'n'roll doesn't matter if it's classic or pitbull you dig there's old you can trace it back you follow right and it's not yeah I don't think of it as impact that's a result what's the verb contribution yeah at family reunions whatever we go everybody picks a word and my favorite word ever was contribution did you try mmm you know go climb the tree here's my favorite poem I saw it inscribed on a rock by an anonymous poet at the base just sort of base camp on Everest go climb the treasure mountain do not return empty-handed where are you now hmm yeah that's some GPS shit what's interesting about music that's different than anything else - is it brings you back to the moment where you heard it or when it was significant to you or where you know like if I hear dance the night away if I'm in my car and dance the night away comes on it's just like God you get goosebumps you just you have this feeling you feel like you're back in Newton Massachusetts in high school my favorite audience is disbelieving non-believers non smilers give me a room a North Korean who hate everything about the trips starting with the airport yeah get distance like this why those they hate rock and roll you give me two choruses son of a ha first we're gonna drive away the evil spirits we might use a little volume to do that Joe use a little this here we go drive away the evil spirits and then I'm gonna make you feel young and skinny how much is that worth lyin estimable inestimable yeah that's the thing about music that's different than anything else it really does change your mood it elevates you well you do that if you please it's also we have like like a big glass bowl you mean all history and we and no movies don't do that books will if you used a paperback and you open it up and the pages are still dried from the vacation Sun you know you were reading it at the beach and the salt there made the page is kind of old and dry and crackly and some sand comes out and you get the memory yeah all right music we'll take you right back right back right back the women will feel desirable you will feel invulnerable you guys are making songs like saying run with the devil so how do you know when you're done no it's not when you're done its how'd you get there right that informs the whole thing okay somebody asked me once how long did it take you to write running with the devil and that's an astute question I said well the true answer is if you watch a thousand movies many of the multiple times if you've played thousands and thousands of hours in clubs and bars if you've read I don't know five hundred books tried to memorize all the good parts take about 18 minutes write the song see you guys are out running with the devil in 18 minutes yeah really yes Jesus Christ okay but deston rhapsody in blue right you're right it took 22 minutes to come up with the basic theme and the rest of its improvisation how would you guys write how would you guys get together and say the whole point is not the 18 minutes it's the whole lifetime before it it's everything that led up to that now van Halen we never took a demo tape around because we didn't get lost in the stack we said if we're as good as we think we are they'll come find us and if they don't were not that's unforgiving instead of the requisite two and a half three years it takes for most acts we spent five and a half years working the clubs and the bars and everything like that so you know we came in with scars and stars we'd been we've done the State Fair circuit like that I wasn't exactly new same thing for Springsteen he'd done ten years in the clubs in bars before yeah you know Thunder Road and whatnot right and you'll see this routinely I think the Beatles did four or five years of working in the red-light district Reeperbahn and all the club shows and stuff like that and they're adding up they're getting that 10,000 and then ultimately that $30,000 mark yeah the Beatles there's I think it's Malcolm Gladwell's book where he's talking about the Beatles and they're there when they came up when they were performing in Germany and they were doing these shows where they were doing multiple sets at night every night of the week and that this is really what made them so good is this constant performing that they were doing it so much it's so often that they just became this smoothly oiled machine if you have a team that you're working together again this is another kind of thing I learned along the way 40 hours a week is about your minimum if there's a team like we're a rugby team or a SWAT team or a emergency room kind of a c-block kind of you know intensive like that inner-city intensive we call Vietnam sometimes it takes like that 40 hours a week is batch of minimum that you need to train together in order to be going without looking at each other right when the lights go out you're you don't lose velocity so to speak all right um ultimately you'll start to look like each other this is the nature of things The Beatles look like each other mm van Halen we looked like each other we all have the same haircut we were the same leather jackets too safe as we became I think it's the golden times you know these are the golden years that most people look back on before the friction of time implicates itself you get married you have kids yeah you bump your elbow now I got to get my elbow work done and as you know and it's the friction of time the rent expands you know contracts etc and people routinely look back on that as the golden years you know your gang everybody had one look back in graphic arts you know the Picasso's and the dollies and everybody wandered around in gangs the great writers in New York all hung out together and they didn't get along you're always competing with each other you're pretending to love each other I just read in New York Magazine some advice from me art critic Jerry Saltz it says create gangs and remember always treat the weakest one is your best friend because there's somebody else in the gang who thinks you're the weakest one yeah that's what you learn you know as you go what are you gonna learn from working the clubs and the bars and stuff well my string just broke my nose is running I'm angry my girlfriend's just ran off with two not one guy should I keep going I'm underpaid non respect it's late and I'm starting to sound like double dutch bus to top it off I'm late to work that got bad feet my corns hurt and you're gonna play you will perform okay just as you will expect that surgeon at 4:00 in the morning this is my little baby girl that unforgiving mm apply that to your art ooh sage words sage words of advice you have expectations you may not have used them yet yeah when you guys wrote songs how did you how did you put the lyrics to the music what was the process like how did you guys sort that out so you would you come to them with an idea would they come to you with a riff like how would how would it work you work a number of ways but a mistake that a lot of young writers in my department the lyrics make is that they think of it as secondary mmm they wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio and hope that the hand of God will descend and grace you with amazing epiphanies I can't even spell amazing alright and called upon to do it right away you know you'll work out a beat and go Dave you got some lyrics if I go walk into that room and try to create it right there nine times out of ten it's gonna be moon in June right moon in June really when some time soon mmm what time of day I'm thinking noon literally I'm gonna put my hands in the air why well because I just don't care you wind up there unless you're banking think like debate if you're gonna debate somebody you're banking your ideas right alright and whatever the subject is you can ghosts don't even have to have a subject it's okay I like what he just said I might even write that phrase I like what you just said yeah could be a Drake lyric any expressions ideas slogans anything that comes from other tunes in terms of their lyric and is everybody contributing no that's just me just have volumes of that and those kinds of ideas ideas for songs storylines etc you would never go into a fight without doing that collecting moves around from every other film of every other fighter that you possibly can so that when somebody goes like this you go oh I know what to do someone suffers and then I'm gonna visit like this and somebody says it's a song about they play a song I go well it sounds kind of like cowboy music let's write about Cowboys mmm going through the banking giddyup that's cool title I heard a cowboy I said on the TV set and I wrote it down literally okay and you start back you could I see the lights come on and you start banking okay somebody says something you dig I heard somebody a waitress named pepper with an unlit Pall Mall cigarette tell me uh honey nothing could have stopped us back then d anyway that's a title that is a time I wrote a song to it did you oh yeah where was this waitress on the road just uh well she also had something else it said she leaned home she showed back that cleavage a little bit and she looked she go keep your fork honey there's pie and you write it down yeah banking yeah I like the term they use in debate your banking banking your ideas so when you would go on the road and someone say some of that you would physically write it down and go home and write it down today today all the time Bank yeah and it goes into the books and then when it's time to deal with a given says you listen to music if the music came first in you know what's just remind you so that sounds like kung-fu that sounds like country that sounds like engines are coming it's and on and on you follow you might suggest an idea to write things down physically or do you type them mmm I print print yeah and I paint and draw routinely okay as you know that's part of the martial arts okay sure miyamoto musashi yep but when I was in Japan two and three nights a week I what we call it training I did assume yay with Sumi any teachers duress Samia it's some like calligraphy pen and ink in in the world of the digital future I spent two years practicing four shades of grey and two shades of black mmm yeah you want to see my lesson can you can you focus a camera if I stand up can you fucker you well here's my lesson okay okay I'm gonna walk from here to here okay I'm here painting okay I'm the only guy in the room okay no yeah okay after six months I heard better Jesus Christ after almost ten months shit that because mr. Roth I think you are my best student Oh I said not my painting he said none of not your painting you are most determined you are most sincere you really enjoy most like Desmond thank you sir he said I wish to invite you to Directors meeting sue me a society whoa that's I made the same face I said whoa when is that he said right now we pulled out a bottle of sake that's few little cups okay one of my best friends it took Wow first shit four six six six first six months I might have got seven words well for a guy like that in this day and age it must be insanely difficult to get someone to have that sort of appreciation for commitment well it's it's a national thing yeah you learned that stuff in grade school and it's sort of like music classes okay painting and calligraphy is as well-known as perhaps piano lessons that what were you thinking while you were doing all this while you're learning this and spending months and months I focus on specifically that knowing that at the end of the term I'm going to be a little I'm sharpening things a little bit and when I'm called upon even to have the discussion like this yeah I I can bring a little contribution to it yeah it can be more entertaining for all of you listening to this it can you know that's an amazing recognition that you have though that you realized while you were doing this that even though consciously all you're doing is doing calligraphy you're working on other parts of your mind I knew I was never gonna pay for shit fifty Shades of Dave but you were still focusing 100% of your energy on doing it while you're doing it yeah yeah and there's something to that oh yeah it's the preparation what are you doing now that's weird oh well I went corporate you okay oh yeah 34 employees you do it I have offices at one Park Avenue and usually like that I'm a guy who might go off the grid and be very difficult to find in the I got offices at the beach in my company is we're about eight million dollars into it here running that kind of a team and dealing with the people because it's art centric what is this team what's it about this is this happens to the original is my stuff and I didn't just hire a bunch of people to pass things in front of me I designed what that logo looks like I put together what the general everything okay at all and then I hired the architects and said build this create this so it's virtually everything that you know how to do as an artist because you have to keep everybody entertained you have to be creative on levels everything from Adobe Photoshop to social engineering and plan forming dealing with marketing publishing all the way that publishing is changing magazines now make e digital are you approaching this the same way you approached calligraphy oh you bat art centric singing and dancing paid every penny for the company and this is what I bring to it mostly when you have a celeb get involved in something like I don't know JLo does fashion hmm she's not really taking a pen and ink and drawing out the words and drawing out the clothes somebody passes things in front of her and she makes sounds I'm assuming it goes like this I'm the guy who has to interpret those sounds yeah and because there's got to be sense of humor right next to the name of my company is laugh to win mmm and it doesn't have anything to do with mirth mmm all the best pirates laugh especially if it's the last one um few of these are gonna detonate on the freeway home not sure when you're how much of your time how much your time is involved in this mmm no significant amount of time we're back and forth and so you look a real professional now like a professional corporate dude you look at the 50 hour work week thing and no no it's art centric okay all right it starts with what was the need what was they well the need that is like when al Han old goats climbing he's gonna put on some sunblock and he doesn't want to touch that shit for another four hours right so I built it for him okay I act my two molars and walked around for three years with no molars on this side of my head when I caught dengue fever whoa okay cuz the sunblock and the stuff that had the mosquito shit in it washed off when I got out of the ocean so I solved and we are stripper friendly but we are not strippers so I don't want shiny so it's like once I want sadden set whoa okay I don't want to shiny there's room for shiny like you know Friday nights sure honor and as far as fragrances thank you no mmm okay it took three years and more than you want a quote to solve that because every time you go and you smell something you crack the jar of anything somebody has played with that probably in New Jersey okay think like this I'm already doing the pitch you like ice cream you know what your kids do gelato even better okay suppose you want to make coconut vanilla all right well if you're buying most products you got to just go to one Factory in New Jersey true story the L'Oreal's the Neutrogena ziz so forth and they're gonna take the smell of coconut and the smell of vanilla and then it makes it so far this kind of a thing the fact is the cow lives in a very different place than the coconut lady who grows coconuts and the guy is going to sell you your vanilla lives in a whole nother country the reason that ice cream tastes so good as somebody got their ass on an airplane and flew to all three places and that's what my staff does our staff is artisanal slike craft scotch from the Carolinas which put your Pendleton on we're going to Portland really and then we're gonna go to Seattle because that's just one product it's my artisanal art thing that I do there and it came from a need behind the scenes started years ago when we'd be climbing and stuff would get all over our hands and all over our ropes we'd be kayaking and somebody keep dropping the oars because something was slippery and you follow yeah so okay someday I'm gonna solve this someday I'm gonna solve this when you're in your 20s there's an aha moment when you're my age there's more than one and that's when we went again third time today and we began to expand laughs to win make ink the original and we have 60 other products coming up all of it developed for people who live in vans like Alex Honnold hmm folks who live in transit at hotels people who live orbán camping is what we do especially me and my tour bus everything I do is in the disco submarine we travel and you got to be familiar everywhere even Canada even Canada and and and today we travel the entire world with impunity you go to South America you go to Europe and something as simple when you go to Japan you're really gonna go find dental floss on you're on now you're not paleface you got to take me because otherwise you're doing Pantha mine yeah I wait until you get a bad stomach and you got a pan of mine that too little weight yeah okay um all of these things okay I got a stabilize got to fit in my backpack every container has to be able to be sat on in a third-world Airport you got to be able to Stevie Wonder it in your backpack it's an insensitive illusion analogy but every one of our containers is such that you can stick your hand in the bag while you're driving and find it I'm safety conscious what do you have kids in the car so this is done by design the shape of the package is done by design so you've absolutely absolutely what does it look like pull it up Jamie you can read our logos from across the Atlantic Ocean all right having worked and played there in the diner cake suppose your granddaddy doesn't speak English mm-hmm okay all of our products have this kind of low going here all right so translate this to granddad into Cambodia and granddad you're going to water exercise everybody there's gonna have their own gear take yours make sure grandma puts this one on and that works in 82 languages I like the logo okay thank you cool-looking bottle of sunscreen thank you you got hand grip in case you're wearing gloves at work in a lot of times when we're waiting in the projects okay and the rain storms are wearing two gloves you got your rubber gloves and you got your duty gloves on all right you still got the no-slip grip on the side fair enough and you got a daughter right she's gonna grow up to be somebody right and hanging around with guys and controlling guys my dad worked in the prison system the last 20 years of his life okay did I surgeries up and Folsom San Quentin Norco Pelican Bank etc little skinny Jewish doctor how do you control a level for violent lifers theater okay you're gonna tell your daughter don't pull anything pink out of your purse if you're sitting with a bunch of guys pull that stuff out mmm it's the right color right if you're at a legal briefing you got to be a boss don't pull any cerulean blue especially if it's shiny vinyl out of your purse you can't have a purple that pull that yeah it says boss yeah in 22 language in it like what's in it that makes it work well like that makes it waterproof and it's 100% in the brightener for example it's organics okay it's a brightener well it makes your tattoo shiny you bet even stays on just shorter forever it's days on when you go swimming so forth okay and what do you always do when somebody goes hey what's that new peace symbol you lick your finger and you're of it and you show it before it dries out it okay I'm gonna deal with the vanities as guys you never want to say you give a shit right I would teach my kid to say that if I add one hey your tattoos looking a little rusty I don't give a shit learn how to say that in a few languages right okay but you know you give a shit otherwise you wouldn't have gotten a paint job right I mean you want the girls to know you got a peace symbol anyways cuz you look kind of me like me great put your finger away will you we got to clean up that's a factory old thing so what's the nez enough you're gonna make all the mistakes too you're gonna go out and you're gonna try and find cheap shit moisturizers did you get a put on there and you're gonna smear it all over yourself and it's gonna look like that scene from Something About Mary when she wants that shit and everybody's gonna think was that shit all over Bobby's arm it's like this and it's gonna get all over your t-shirt right and your wife has a $600 t-shirt doesn't she Joe mm-hmm okay so you got to consider all of this okay I saw a nice car out there I'm guessing there's nice upholstery in it yeah I took that into consideration I got you covered oh okay and it's the smell of victory there it goes now today's vitamin C shea butter and coconut oil not tested on animals dermatologist reviews yeah man we're paraben free petroleum free we are full list of ingredients here we go what is all this jazz we are one of the few products here that is reef safe allowable in Hawaii okay the limits of what's going into the oceans now and the tourist areas of the world in Hawaii you can count on one hand the products they're allowing to be used on the beaches and even in the swimming pool so you know now so that comes so this is a hundred percent organic stuff it's all waxes and butters yeah when people talk about miracle ingredients I don't know I think in terms of there's water and then there's feed butter eggs sugar flour that's all that there is in the bakery all right we invented the cronut okay you take the best of this and the best of that and the considerations again come from life experience I didn't just look at myself and go wow here's an idea to make money my fortunes been made what we did is find what we can use when we're living out of backpacks what we can use when we go dance and I still go dancing and I don't leave that floor for four hours where do you go dancing I'm not telling you oh yeah routine really oh you bet where you gonna show that ink right follow today I know in New York City for example mr. chin lives right next to mr. Gomez they both live over mr. Katzenberg mr. radik ovitch owns the building none of them can speak to each other they all speak a different language they're all different religions etc so there's two ways we communicate first is swearing you know how to do that I learned seven eight words and swearing you can describe anything this shows the shit show you the shit thank you what kind of shit are you doing lately that last fight that was the shit we're having a conversation okay like so and the next is ink I see I got a chicken on one arm and a cleaver you butcher and the girl down there's got cupcakes with funny noses let me guess he's got musical notes can I guess more right and and add in an Esperanto you walk out in front of Columbia University it lunchtime it's the future you would not know that it's United States it is a complete composite International just the smell of all the food trucks mmm the last thing you smell is salami and yellow cheese on white bread thank God say thank God in a few other languages yeah really yeah okay so it's a communication and that's part of my fascination with it it's a constantly evolving Esperanto art form I've visited tribes in New Guinea who can't dance they don't have they don't dance but they did have tattooing mmm they did have scars you know that's nice man they found a little play sure that guy you know they found his body I forget what they call never care what his name is but he had tattoos on them I mean he's thousands of years old I mean it's very recognizable favio is like sideburns and flares and easy-listening we always make fun but there's one of them in your past that got banked on his hair I mean if that guy went bald like me he'd be fucked it still is the exact same fabulous right yeah amazing genetics he got a lucky break he's one of the characters who are other characters like that Oh David Hasselhoff sure now has a hassle book what is that it's well he has his own Facebook thing holy shit Anna Nicole Smith yes three pay there's three phases yeah first phase pretty dude yes jeans ad right and then there's married to the old dude yeah I kind of like the last one to the rich right before she dies Elvis had three phase yeah so yeah but there are folks also that don't have phase springsteen never had a phase it was always Springsteen there it is looking good Fabio he's about 85 years old right I don't see him working out a lot but he's there what does he do if he's at the gym I don't know talking about women and oh damn still scoring nobody insurance that's that's so on to think about it but you don't but you do do but you don't yeah you want to think about the gal that wants a bang Fabio super pumped about it he's coming over in five minutes gotta get ready what are you watching on TV to have television yes and and what are you watching regularly because I don't have television I listen to Sirius XM routinely well I listen to like six different channels over and over again there lately I'm watching the marvelous mrs. Mazal which is a it's a not Netflix queues me it's an Amazon show it's an Amazon original show about a stand-up comedian in the 1950s a woman stand-up comedian who hangs out with Lenny Bruce it's really good okay really good show women stand-up comedians if there's a great subject Sarah Silverman yeah her right mm-hmm spectacular right yeah she has a real hurdle because one of the things that she does best is play the part of the character she's lampooning sure yeah yeah she plays the part beautifully of a witless yep racist whatever and her hurdle is that a large segment of the audience doesn't realize that it's an act well now now that's the hurdle especially now if you go back and look at some of our older bits and look at any special if you looked at it written down as opposed to her saying it we're in such an overwhelmingly sensitive time when it comes to subject matter that yeah that would be a big hurdle for now but it's the best work ever and it made such an impact the first time I ever saw her do it and this is a tradition that goes all the way back during Lincoln mm-hmm there was a fellow who wrote the nasbe letters where he pretended to be a southern racist and making fun of southern races pretending to be Lincoln kept the articles clipped from the newspaper in his drawer so he could read them occasionally and laugh during the Civil War you know this is a tradition of acting out the character that you are about to execute unfortunately there's a lot what what is the chemistry that folks don't understand that you are pretending they don't care it's not it's a dishonest approach they don't care whether or not you're pretending what they see you have said something or there's something written that shows that you said something that they feel is in violation and so they want to go after it and it does shake in a sense yes it's literal and it's also it's disingenuous because they know it could be parody and they don't care there's so much of that today it's really interesting it's really interesting because there's so many people that are there just looking for things to be upset about it's recreational outrage and I think it's probably because things are going so well in this world I mean sigh I mean some people say it's not going that well you know there's a lot of things to be fixed first it's the safest time to be alive ever it just is this is undeniably the safest tell agree with that and I think people are more open-minded than ever more kind than ever there's less violence than ever all you look at Pinker's work all these things are trending in a very very clear and obvious direction and I think when you have coddled Minds and you have more safety people start running around looking for things to be upset at and also a lot of young people that are very idealistic think they're going to change the world and one of the ways are going to change the worlds by policing language and policing the way people talk about things and discuss things and so stand-up comedy which is you know you say a lot of things you don't really mean because they're funny you know that's the whole point behind it and so it's ripe as - as far as a target for that kind of recreational outrage the musical equivalent perhaps is really shitty songs written about important subjects yeah yeah really shitty songs written about important subjects or offensive the melody sound reminds you of overdue dentist the points the singing sounds like hot water being thrown but it's about starving children right what's a good example no don't go there if you criticize the song even if you excuse a it's just musically right that sounds like we shall overcome oh wow that's about patch yeah I love pets beautiful well you just and with these movies like that too right there's movies about really important subjects that are terrible movies like how many who caused me to think that if it's are really really important subject it probably is a terrible movie yeah most likely why do I think that right well there's no way to really get an important subject and boil it down to two hours oh I didn't think of that you know give me two hours yeah I mean especially like one thing that drives me crazy is when they take liberties with someone's biography like if they do a biography on someone's life and they've changed things around or add things to it for theatrical Flair did you see the Queen movie no I did not see I haven't seen it either I heard it's very good though you heard it's very good yes you asked the person who told you that why it's good yes yes what did they share they said the first of all the guy who plays Freddie Mercury apparently is brilliant in it and it's had they seen origin had they seen Freddie lies no not live I saw Freddie live at the Forum I was in the maybe 20th row 6 in when Bohemian Rhapsody had just come out oh my goodness yeah I saw him in his absolute that his major major prime there so I'm very curious as to well stagecraft is one thing but what Freddie was and what he brought was way more than what you saw on stage yeah yeah fella what was he bringing well his sensibilities in terms of music weren't just three chords in an attitude and they'll fall for that shit either if Keith ever sits here and tries that she is alright Rogan you know you just need three three codes in an attitude yeah and you need to know the inversions of each one all 7 modal not fuck you Keith when I think is he doesn't know all those and the trick tunings and whatever yeah um Freddie brought a whole wealth of listening to different kinds of music whether it was orchestral big band Bistro you mean done it that yeah that's bestrode what do you call it music mute music small something you might hear in a coffee shop in France well his music was so different his singing was so different than anything else from his era but you listen to we are the champions he didn't try to sing black ok sang Freddie Mercury he's saying European non black what we're very used to even in country hmm I had a very famous black producer african-american producer say to me David Lee do you know what it means to be a black man in the United States to - every time I step up to the mic I try that's what I grew up with right trying to sound like Motown you trying to sound like Wilson Pickett trying to sound like and on and on that that you know that voter block had such an impact on music much less the overall culture in comedy as well I mean if I had a vote for boom greatest all-time comedian would be prior the greatest of all time I would I would have to say it's he's in the running I mean if it's not him I don't know who it is I'll agree with ya or so many some I mean when you look at African American stand-up comedians in the contribution in terms of like the overall numbers the top ten a giant chunk of them were black a giant shark Chappelle Chris Rock definitely Pryor it guys that guys Bernie Mac Bernie Mac was a goddamn genius you know there's a lot of people who don't know about Robin Harris Robin Harris is a huge influence to people in the 90s the 80s and the 90s when he died he died died thinking though early 90s you're illuminating for the audience but here you're preaching to they already convinced judge yeah what's I think it's because of the I grew up with comedy records yeah okay thanks Redd Foxx and if you see you can still hear red doing on the classic comedy channel on Sirius XM and his shit is still funny still good and it's a if that's read let's revisit is it the delivery system it's everything or the thing because you can't celebrate I started imitating Redd Foxx when I was probably 12 years old yeah yeah I sure do it and you know I mean Bill Kavi Cosby was obviously a horrible person in retrospect but his art form his artwork was amazing I mean I listen comedy records you memorized word-for-word you memorized Richard Pryor you're memorized Redd Foxx you memorize Bill Cosby and you memorized Rodney Dangerfield oh yeah okay those are the four horsemen yeah and if when you run out of conversation at a beer soaked frat party high school whatever which is in about two sentences you say you either quote your favorite movies yeah that's how you eat converse as guys you know hey you know let's see where it fucking blows them away fuck good and you express ourselves or you go you start you know I can't get no respect yeah yeah and doctor told me I have to run it I even try this with the staff I said David how you doing say yeah ma'am doctor told me I had to run ten a mile a day and then call him on ten days later and well I'm calling you I'm ten miles away Rodney Dangerfield okay you learned comedy records and you sat around the record player and learned it I don't think people do that no no that was a thing man when I was a kid we listened to Cheech and Chong big bamboo would all sit around and listen to the record yeah man and that was a different one too because they weren't even doing stand-up there that was a completely unique thing they were doing sketch comedy on a record it's interesting that pot culture which is international now okay um started with an Asian and Hispanic yeah they fucking were the kings of it age you can again sideburns yeah the way it was those we make fun yeah but everybody on earth knows Cheech and Chong how many decades later how many decades I went rock climbing as far away as humanly possible from anything ever made by God man or others place called a rap Alize it's about four hours north of Melbourne out in the middle of nowhere big sand drip castles you can dial it up a fire or a police and we had a couple of campers like trucks that we parked and we put up a tarp in the middle and campfire and whatever and I had a little uh a little television screen and we plugged that into the car battery okay you know I went to the other campsites because we fucked up not broad enough whatever it was water food or whatever that's our appellees Wow and I went to the different campsites and invited everybody you know hey man can I borrow this and you guys got any oatmeal or anything like this today yeah we're gonna be watching Cheech and Chong over under the far edge over there you'll see us he'll he'll come on over and join us from all over the world you got guys from Thailand you got girls from England everybody knew Cheech and Chong it was the great leveler Wow all right and we sat there in sub-zero temperatures swaddled and sleeping bags laughing in seven languages gosh damn look you don't even need subtitles yeah you read the movie they're back together doing it again which is amazing and they had to get those guys in here long as they're talking to each other to make sure are they actually talking to each other or has this gone Eddie and Dave for awhile don't know and Eddie and day for a while but they're back yeah they're back together well they were touring quite I think success brought them back together again they realize like everybody wants to see Cheech and Chong everybody doesn't really want to see Chong or Cheech you know I mean not that everybody doesn't want to see them but that the numbers are so different the numbers of people that I meet Tommy talk to a beloved guy but the together they're there exponentially more powerful it's the Everly Brothers yes yes yes yes it's but the culture changed a man of his times sometimes the times changes and yes look how the times now represent that which they you know free I mean those guys whatever they were doing something that was illegal this was an illegal comedy there was a legal subject matter today in Studio City you could spend a ten-day vacation if you came from somewhere and just worked from the sushi bar to the dispensary on Studio City there's a space that's about two miles long you could spend ten days come visit us from Japan stay at the Marriott all the way in here whatever at a universal and you can't just work from sushi bar to dispensary from sushi bar to dispatcher there Turin look at that up on the screen there's a whole schedule and where are they working I can't read it it says they're in Richmond BC the River Rock Casino and Vancouver at the Hard Rock South Lake Tahoe there's a bunch of places San Juan Puerto Rico in the house what's on average age of comics today the best ones are in their 40s and 50s it seems like right now really yeah between Chris Rock Dave Chappelle oh you're right okay see can that BRR yeah other basket Joey Diaz all the best guys are in their fifties because it does change when you think like I don't know there's a lot of gangster movies on Netflix right yeah and when it's that then the fellas are older they're wearing tuxedos you know they're in nightclubs likes eros kind of uh yeah the 21 club and then that changed - yeah Comedy Cellar and you know something like that today it's also about productivity like you you have to be able to put out material and because most of us are doing Netflix specials now and most of us seem to be on a schedule of doing one every couple of years so you have to be able to turn over an hour every couple of years and then take that hour and hammer that motherfucker down to a samurai sword excuse me a katana polished that blade hammer it down polished that blade you have to have it and then you have to know when to release it which is one of the things that I asked like how do you know when you're writing a song like running with the devil how do you know when it's done because with a bit you kind of don't know because you do it differently all the time you fuck around with it onstage and you know I'm a how long does it take to do an hour because it changes it changes there's no real one thing I like sometimes I've come up with a new hour and like like four or five months and sometimes it's taking me a whole year it's just really it's really different every time depending upon how much effort I put into it and also depending about how lucky I get with subjects like sometimes there's a subject that's just rich almost like it you hit a goldmine and like you hit all that you hit that money like ah there's so much here and there's so many also branching off Little rivers from this mind this one initial mind so there's there's that you never know you never know it's it's it's hard to tell fascinating mess around with it it moves and changes I'd do it differently all the time you know I'm a giant fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd and one of the things that I always thought was crazy about Skynyrd was their riffs when they would do guitar riffs it was the same riff they wouldn't when they would do a solo their solos were like orchestrated like they don't get enough credit for bringing dynamic musical artists as well as these southern dudes that were just drinking and singing about whiskey and getting away from women like their fat ugly dudes and most their songs are about getting away from women like I gotta go I gotta be free I'm moving on call me the breeze it was like I gotta get the fuck out of here but you lock me down that was a big part of their music but when you see like like some of they're like free bird that free bird solo that could suck which is one of the greatest solos in the history of all music no there's some specific reasons for this okay one of the more specific reasons is you had you built it has a beginning a middle a crescendo and end there they're specific names to this okay um when we moved to more channels in recording when no Leonard Skynyrd recorded all their early stuff as 8-track and then you had to double up a really van Halen same thing you had to compile your tracks or whatever um you had to really walk in with your solo written okay and play and you would work it until it really had a thing crescendos yeah okay once there were many tracks guys would come in and just wing it and go okay let's try one okay great that's fine let's do it again track two and they just make it up as they go okay and then when it's time to mix they'll put a little of track 2 and a little up track 6 and start moving those channels in a way that you would never think to play the guitar for example ed started doing that on a couple of tracks all right original solos running with the devil did it okay these are thematic solos most Beatles solos thematic yes into the solo and ain't talking about I did it you know these are thematic solos when it started going but other look like this he'd record six different versions of the solos okay and then just start move the channel like here turn this one on turn this one off during this 100 this and then he'd have to go learn the solo Wow so you'll see his hand move from down here to up here and down there it became a gymnastic effort more elbow and shoulder to get his hand from the far end of the fretboard all the way up to the pickup and back to duplicate that wabi-sabi approach to making solos so it was a very a weak or unique kind of way of creating a solo it was utilizing the digital digital future multi-tracking and improvising you follow as opposed to I'm going to sit down and I'm gonna just I'm gonna create something like a book mmm there's the beginning here's the scene here the characters here's the conflict instead it's let's just mix that all up together in interesting ways in literary Burroughs came up with bilborough's many many years ago came up with the idea of writing a book then clipping the pages into pieces putting them all in a hat then pull the pieces out one by one this is piece number one this is piece number two face number three and that's the way you actually remember a story huh I don't get that okay you remember a wedding yes you don't remember in sequence all right we had a batch party then I got measured for the tasty then I went here you remember bash party then putting the ring then I was throwing up back behind oh there was a car right it it doesn't come in sequential order right okay so it's another way of kind of a crafty way of writing an essay um perhaps a bit difficult to digest but movies are made that way now Tarantino starts in the middle right let's do it yeah he always James Bond always starts in the middle of a chase mmm door flies open yeah well these guys are why is he off guard he's running across the top of a drink as they started in as opposed to here's the field horse walks onto the field I see the cabin I'm getting from this one in regard says song making in particularly the way Eddie and you did it was there's no shortcuts you know and the fact that first of all you know he's one of the great masters right Eddie Van Halen's one of the great masters if you have mean a hundred of the greatest guitar artists of all time in the history of the human race he's in that group they certainly made a contribution commensurate with that yeah yeah 100 percent so you have to have that but then there's also no shortcuts even when you're a great master no there's no shortcut no you will have to sharpen and sharpen and show you describe sharpening a sword I've visited a foundry where they make swords north of Tokyo how was that well hot Oh Sun because in the his work goes in the museum's that is one of the things that I really want to do yeah the found school foundry for guys with hammers super sweaty hot like thanks like visiting the 1600s okay that's not who sharpens and polishes the sword that's my other friend who's 55 years old lives in a suburb of Tokyo and that's all he does for a living so they take the first sword to him and then he sharpens it yes okay and he's the one who makes it get that chrome finish so the man who forges it does not sharpen it correct it's different specialty is that always been the case yes an insured pot sword polisher does the sharpening and that's a specialty requires certain stones from different parts of Japan you don't use wheels you use the old stones from the mountains etc use water from a wooden bucket hmm you rub it with your hands it's 55 years old this is all he does for a living museums from around the world is there video this oh yeah what's the gentleman it's you will find it I'm stalling for a sec um he lives in a very little apartment and he's got two gun safes like you would use you know like Liberty gun safes yeah and museums from all over the world send him swords oh here he goes okay that's become rusty humidity 30 what is that okay this is that pants that's paste and he's gonna be using that's what they used to laminate by putting paste on that sword parts of it will cool differently anyways so that sharpen had a sword takes forever that's what makes your patterns oh so they do it so you want that edge a little different of hardness then you want the rest of the sort you clad it and what is that pasting on it what was that stuff it's made of ash and it's made of or or Wow and so when it heats up is that when it becomes a part of the sword mm-hmm why he's gonna laminate that okay this is wild oh they got a scientist look at this motherfucker with his lab coat he's examining you're gonna ruin it get him out of there at that scientist major kind of Steel tamahagane II mmm okay and when you do the little padding like that that's ash so he's putting little pieces of ash on it on perhaps a stone on the stash house gonna sharpen their Oh on a sword which is why they cost so much Wow there are many different kinds of stones that they'll use on different parts of the sword can you dig the point that the top gets a different kind of stone in the middle of the sword cetera it's amazing like Japanese culture and especially when when you look into the ancient samurai culture like a book of five rings is one of my greatest all-time books I've read it dozens of times my life but just to put yourself in the mindset of someone with such a Singh vision too great to become a great samurai he needed to become a great artist a great poet he needed to be good at carpentry he needed to be good at calligraphy he needed to have all these different skills no just like yourself out yeah kids got to take chess lessons or you know or go-go lessons okay they got to learn to paint and draw yeah got to learn some martial arts you know multiple languages this is a liberal arts education as seen through the eyes of somebody in the 1500s it's just I'm so fascinated with the Japanese large arenas so many things came from that one small island I mean - in terms of like martial arts contributions I mean it is probably the there's a bunch of contributors Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Chinese kung-fu and Western boxing but goddamn you look at the contributions of Japan I mean overwhelming we're just overwhelming between judo and jiu-jitsu and so many different martial arts karate there's so many different styles that were perfected in this one small place okay it's an island I agree with you and that lends itself towards drilling down burrowing in really digging in yeah you follow if somebody is going to make a sword it takes six different people to make one sort the person who makes the handle is not the person who wraps the handle hmm the person who makes the sword is not the one who sharpens it the collar the furniture on the sword the peg that holds it in that gold scholar that's a different person and the person who makes the scabbard for the sword is a different person you want me to keep going no oh yes I mean what's an age of specialization yeah started for them many many decades ago the idea of I'm one man and I'll build everything in the cab alone in the wilderness this great movie comes from the nineteen sixties the fellow who builds the cabin and uses handmade tools to do it up in the woods right I'll dig the well I'll plant the potatoes I'll build the house I'll create the hearth I'll fish the fish I'll hunt the ELCA said hmm in the Japanese perhaps you know as well as other neighborhoods said hmm I'm just gonna specialize in elk yeah and somebody else said um I just like to cook if that's okay yeah somebody else said I'm not even gonna cook it I'm gonna eat it raw have you have you ever fucked around with archery Oh a million years ago you know wood Scouts whatever but that seems like something that we right up your alley that's a it's a an act of doing it without doing it yes it is a mind cleansing thing too I think you'd be perfect for you this is what I saw you have a virtual reality range out there yeah wait a minute yeah all right officer I confess it's all coming back I saw you on TV filling the frigerator are getting ready to fill the frigerator with a bow and arrow or something about this no I bow hunt yeah but do you actually eat yeah 100% yes most of what I eat is elk meat or deer meat yeah that's the if you look at my diet on paper it's like 60% elk when did you begin this 2012 was the first hunting trip I went on my good friend Steve Rinella took me on a trip on his television show meat eater and then I became obsessed well I was trying to figure out what I was doing because I'd seen a bunch of factory farming videos and I was like okay I'm either gonna become a vegetarian or I'm gonna become a hunter like this is I follow that be a part of this I follow that and so I became a hunter and first of all the nutrition that you get from wild games you see a difference all the difference yeah yeah everybody does like bull he just feel better it just feels amazing really yeah it's so nutrient Danson's red and rich and so what you're eating an athlete you're eating a wild athlete that's running away from wolves and mountain lions I mean it's just a different thing than a cow that's like locked up in a cage or a pig that's locked up in a stall make stellar sense and they live a free life it's a wild animal they there's no one telling them what to do or where to go and you got to be able to sneak it up in on them on the right wind with the right conditions and make sure you get a shot off on them yeah that's it yeah I love it how often you go out a couple times a year usually and that provides all the way uh-huh yeah if three commercial freezers in the back I'll show you after we're done I have three elk there were two elk rather that are parsed up and two elk and to access deer in those freezers yeah each elk is several hundred pounds of meat you know and then I give a lot of it to my friends a good portion of my friends they always get little packages of elk for me elk sausage and elk roasts and all these different things I'm always giving people recipes showing them how to eat it so I don't cook it citrus ting that's the most modern why is the him is the classic I eat what I call rabbit food it's the croco diet like a crocodile bird's foliage says the other word you have for breakfast a chicken and the slaw was it sitting in we would you have fish but you catch it in seaweed but that seems to serve me yeah the Brady diet everybody's talking about the Tom Brady diet what does he do well we call it he eaten eating plain he's not eating any process for he's not eating any white bread he's not-- meal in clean proteins you know no fried stuff he's in his forties so crazy yeah he's is he a miracle it's something he's special and when you look at his body he looks like a guy at the beach like a regular guy he doesn't look like a super athlete one of the greatest football players of all time are we seeing something because between him and Alex Honnold and there are a couple of other stellar like whoa are we starting to see a trend because of better nutrition and better training and cross trainings and I think there's so many factors when you deal with football there's so many people are bigger these are stronger yeah well I think with football but with Tom Brady I think it's training intelligence dedication obsession and then also nutrition all those - all those factors but you have to like really be him and there's no way to be as good as he is without being incredibly immersed in whatever you're trying to excel at there's no way and with Alex Honnold I mean the guy lives out of his van because he wants to live out of his van because all he wants to do is just drive around different mountains and climb them I mean that's his thing for me it was the surfers yeah nineteen sixties exact things lifestyle they needed to be a vertical water kind of just the doors of the useless they call themselves some vertical surfer that's it yeah vertical so for me it was you know we're gonna go camp at San Onofre yeah you know there's something you talked to surfers there's something that there's a weird corny way to put it but I haven't talked to all of them obviously but a lot of high-level surfers like Kelly Slater or like my good friend Shane Dorian they are their spiritual in some strange way they're at peace in some strange way and I think part of it is because they're constantly on that ocean and I think the ocean is like a battery I think you get energy out of it I think it's alive it feels alive I think it stimulates you in a very unique way and with those guys they're riding these immense waves these these creations of nature and gravity and force and mass and water and they're riding them and they're riding a living thing there's organisms in it it's just filled with salt I mean it charges the body it's got a different frequency than the rest of the world and these guys they seem different they have a there's a different vibe about them a more content vibe I've always said it's like - something about beach towns like why is everybody by the beach so fucking chill like what is that alright something crazy this music isn't chill Jack Johnson is but you know what I'm saying classic surf music is Donna no no no no no no no no yeah I guess it sounds like the waves mimic the way well the the way I perhaps dick dale and the del-tones were imitating the way waves made you feel no no no and now they're playing what it feels like to sit around the campfire on the beach right yeah that kind of shit it's kind of a beach tone yeah a little bit is it runner's high I don't know there's we used to walk into the running stores and you know everybody behind the counter has attended a yeah and it stays with you that's right hey that stays with you I ride my bicycle everywhere I'm on two wheels I've successfully replaced the automobile in Pasadena really I got to go to the 7-eleven I'm on the bicycle I gots to live in Pasadena oh yeah I want to go to the you know wherever you get on the bicycle right in the rain doesn't matter real yeah just you don't try the car in Pasadena as infrequently as possible Wow this this is how I cross train as opposed to I'm gonna hire a coaches just stay on that bike well if you go to dinner somewhere don't laugh okay I'll take it to an extreme when I'm in New York City my bike and everything set up over there I'm a bicycle and so forth got a little apartment there um I saw a scene in dr. know careful what you let your kids see it could be for life Shawn connolley comes out of the ocean and one of those black neoprene wet suits right right and he peels it off and he's got a blue tuxedo on underneath without a drop of water I have to finish this yeah no I got my I got my jump suits and I got my flight suits and everything lay is more than once I've gone to a club or a dinner I give the door guy or the parking guy of the valets it's on that's my bike chained up over there and the corners $20 keep an eye on don't Lenny Pro snap that walk and I just stuff my backpack up under the bike like this and I do this in the rain I do it in the snow they do it every when somebody says the rain I go yeah like every kid know why there are no snow days in Hawaii right it's raining just assume it there are no snow days in the Dakotas it's snowing yeah go to school yeah and I've done this all over the world I take my bicycles with me wherever I go so when you're in Japan you took a bike oh I know all of Tokyo bike like I know the roof of my mouth I'll take you anywhere on those streets I know every alleyway I know all the ways downtown I would routinely make a two-hour trip to my art lessons from where I lived all the way downtown into Ebisu and all the way back like that when you drive around today as opposed to in the old days before cellphones do you notice a difference with people paying attention texture moves yeah I know that getting off the line could take a week you know the light changes in counting on how long it takes is everybody's got to sign off their phone yeah turn off the computer do as or whatever um by and large what I have noticed is that when people are watching you they're no longer Kev their hands in their pockets and pretend to be whistling hmm now you pretend you stare into your cell phone that's true why'd you do it that's 1960s nowadays it's like and more often than not I'm the only guy who's actually present in a place I walk into a car you don't carry a cell phone no I walk into a coffee shop or a restaurant or even a club which is critically a social experience and everybody is staring into their cell phones at different banquettes and different whatever I'm more often than not I'm the only one who's actually present looking seeing have you airing just meddled with those things have you ever oh sure fucked with them and you decided it's not for you I'm gonna let you know we'll see please do very digitally literate okay I can fly six million dollar helicopter backwards can you really yes but it forces people to make eye contact you want to talk to me is it just like this yeah okay and you can't text me cuz that's avoidance you can't uh there's a whole lot of off ramps I take out of the program what about email I don't you tell me email nope well I'm surrounded by individuals and I know exactly what to ask for and what to about so what do they want to get ahold to you they have to go find you mmm-hmm at no point in my life like is it with yourself I'm assuming am i more than five feet away from somebody with a cell phone huh I was laughing it's like James Bond or some secret agents shit we're even Miguel the gardener has a smart phone he's gonna pull a gun and defend me did who ever carry them at one point and decide to stop carrying them yes and it became a constant as show people we are targets targets for love targets for greed targets for proximity etc aims it became a constant interruption mmm became a constancy in an effort to find my way to where Shane Dorian is I don't want to be out on that wave man I want calm I want to live in New York City I want to live in the middle of the noise and the clamor and I want to be able to keep my heart rate down I want to be able to keep my waist down you dig yeah and I found myself constantly having to answer that phone and having to deal with hey man how are you just what cut to the crash right and getting texted is avoidance yeah nine and a half times out of ten it's just somebody didn't really want to talk on the phone you hear this well I texted you I don't know you're the only plan M landing today yeah but at any given time the guy driving the car the assistant even the gardener has a smartphone and everybody knows you can find me yeah you keep it that way oh yeah so what what year was it where you decided to do this how long about four years ago four years ago you've stopped until then you're carrying the phone doing the whole deal anyway I don't want this anymore it was constant phone ringing constant having to check in constant of I called you how come you didn't call me back right right alright became a leash yeah it also indicates you know as you start to call over and over and over again it's it's like a tracer you follow you have stalkers sure I got a good one no not right now I got stalkers yeah I got a stalker who makes prank calls okay I can tell you what time get to work I can tell you what time he goes home I can tell you if he went to church and then brunch and what time you got home from that I can tell you if you had something to drink the night before and went home and slept it off the next day mmm it's the nature of communications right number of tracer bullets work both ways boy yeah I'm gonna indicate everywhere you are and everything you do and your entire thing of your life is very Orwellian especially with social media right yeah probably the last thing I want you to know about me is how boring I am well there's also that there's a thing of giving in to this non-human device and and integrating it with your life you in where people just they never leave it alone they're constantly on it they're checking it with then you're not even getting anything out of it you're just checking it for nothing you're just checking your email checking your photos checking your Instagram is nothing coming nothing positive coming out of it it's just like this weird distraction from life you used to use the refrigerator for that yes right it's almost the same you're so right it's like a digital version of opening the refrigerator when you know nothing's in there and crazy that's true it's so true it's like a boredom exercise yeah it's a habit you just gotta reach for it or reach for it do you have one just in case you have to use it I'm giving away all my secrets I am constantly in the grid okay okay um one of my closest colleagues that I work with two and three nights a week Colin Smith has written 17 books on how to run Adobe Photoshop okay we've been working on an art project together for quite some time will they be you that at another time yeah um I love the Internet I love what the digifuse brought to us my only real regret in life is that I didn't have this growing up go look it up I should have that tattooed yeah and signed by my parents yeah it's a great time for finding things out you know the information if you want to learn the Encyclopedia Britannica was what we had goes lock it up and Canterbury records in case you wanted some music which was an hour's bike ride inch way okay and I can keep going and now you can get music instantly God was just it's for somebody like me when I was flavor of the week the first time you know I did all the rock star stuff and one of the first things that I wanted to do cuz I'd read that Elton John did this is you would get him to close the store store and shop around by yourself yeah and no one oh you gotta have a security guy of course brings a pillow case ah you put the records on a pillow and you with with impunity you pick your record you don't even read the liner's if you have a good cover you're in the case is sit election something yeah that I used to buy records based on how cool the cover looked a routine like a chance routine especially double album covers and and and and I would routinely I would shop by weight okay I would do that at bookstores to as much as we could carry coming out of the book stores because for example I like many different kinds of music one of my favorites is danceable electronica okay R&B disco anything that has I call it floor if it has anything to do with dancing it's for and there were no floor stations here in the in California in the 70s you wanted to hear anything that's you know you had KJ LH maybe you know some small am kind of a station but you went to New York you had let me put the headphones on I can do the voice this is Puckle w Katie you shadow traffic we're missing DJ's right sorry we're missing DJ's that's something that's missing from our culture the kannada bhavana miles I'm with the best bet for the boss beat at the top of the pop smash gold I'm Diamond Dave no time to waste making the taste baby shut up time to play the record baby yeah Wolfman Jack those guys are gone that that's like a missing segment of our culture mmm I was in Pasadena listening for the first FM radio underground station which was kppc it was Metromedia I believe was channel 5 tell me if this gets too boring um here's the history of it is during the Cold War right around 1965 66 it became a legal imperative that all radio stations regular ones had to operate an FM band station FM had been around since the 1930s my uncle Manny remembered it okay but it never got used it was AM radio KFWB channel 90 right it was like the mighty 1090 you know I'll catch that kind of screaming DJ kind of thing why because you know in case there's an emergency you were not allowed to take your normal programming though from KFWB and put it on your sister station on FM had to be different programming mmm okay you can't just dominate FM because you got the advertisers your channel 5 got a lot of advertisers you got are all shy car painter you ever in so you've got chase and Sanborn coffee you're gonna squeeze me right you're not allowed to have the same programming in channel 5 they operate kppc which is 106.7 today it's k-rock or whatever unit like 106 right in there and they brought in literally all these FM stations you know the the bosses you know all said well my nephew he loves that rock stuff you know he's got a lot of Records maybe he'll be a DJ kind of thing or who would be a DJ for this kind of stuff I don't know who's a non screamer the jazz guys okay they brought in Big Daddy Tom Donahue and his wife Rachel and they came in and they start broadcasting on kppc and Tom was a jazz DJ Benny would just kind of like this and he'd okay we got a new Quicksilver here can't wait till it comes out in stereo take a listen now to first side seeing a few yeah and we would practice that there's an art to that oh yeah there's an art to preparing you for a new song yeah okay got a brand-new wooden here yeah he used the velvet hand like DJ's you know like such as yeah jazz guys back then a lot of them were doing things that tells you to slow down you know at me and we started doing those things to egg you lord lola gage your little strength of patience Joe knows what I do right after and then it would set you up for the music you'd actually enjoy the music a little bit more because of that guy oh yeah yeah I would get into the enhance day okay here's a little something you were kind of coke inspiring that if streaming services were smart they would bring that shit back they'd find someone you know because like streaming services are the new radio right I mean that's where a lot of people get their music agreed are you talking about like the Endora yeah but that's sort of what Apple's pitch was they have a whole radio section on Apple music and they have why did you yeah that shows and well the DJ is running yeah but like as a sports notes what is it in the natural okay great movie bro yeah Duvall Duval's a writer yeah writer and they get into a little bit of an argument mm-hmm somebody says you don't play baseball he's is yeah but and a good day I could make it look a little bit more interesting and a little more exciting yeah I hope you see what you to help you understand what um paraphrase sure that's what I do with commentary yeah exactly that's an art form that he implicates everything drama pay those hilarity all in one paragraph I've watched you go from Channel seamlessly I grew up with the great Scully Cosell so tell me so tell me Holly so cash is please its ollie cash okay and we would imitate that yeah you know trying to get that kind of an eloquent sound yeah you know but you have DJs they're not really DJs they are represented of a lifestyle for example I'm going into DJ boys because I got the headphones this is why I don't wear the headphones because you come to aware yet Sun Goes Down I've been to sleep since the late eighties but um what was I talking about it I started riffing their DJs now DJ's now aren't really DJ's when you listen for example is Sirius XM you have for example of the country artists sure okay and it's no shoes radio and you know it's um he's not a humorist okay he's not even an interlocutor where he and behold and so it came to pass like in Greek tragedy and so it came to pass that the Sun came and the war was wondering that he's not that it's Kenny Chesney going and I said with respect you know hi this is Kenny and I was just walking down here and paying him on City and my phone win did no I walked inside and I asked Goodfellas right here the Joe Rogan barbeque to fire it up if I could just sort of charge it up and they said hell yeah so I just want to tell you I'll come down and rub mark you see you can always find us right here on know she's radio so there's something and you follow it's not announcers he's kind of being right um Tom Petty he was a co-conspirator or you know like a a man I'm down here in the basement man I'm listening to some wreck come on down will fire up the bomb and check this ad this is fucking tasty this is a it's an important I had friends like that yeah they could choose the music to that was the other thing about DJ's they would choose the music I don't know what tastemaker all the FM radio do yeah yeah that yes you bet in yeah that makes a big difference I did not think about was listened to WB CN in Boston it was a like 1980s and they wanted to play Michael Jackson and the guy said listen I know this isn't rock as W vcn was the rock of Oz - sure look I know this isn't rock but damn this is good music and they played Billie Jean I remember thinking why what a bold choice soda what's a bold choice in a certain sense okay and the certain sense is that after a while FM radio became very codified mmm you know just like the horse races somewhere in the low mid 70s late 70s it became a playlist in the in DJ's no longer picked their own records program directors picked the records okay it became very specific target demo we want to home in and whatever now keep in mind when Howard Stern left regular radio terrestrial radio for the stratosphere I got his job in New York City oh that's right I was broadcasting in seven different cities I forgot you did that okay Dallas New York Philly I think I was on and cetera cetera and it turns out I think what they wanted was a version of Howard Stern okay great I'll be a third class Howard Stern or a first class David Lee my approach to it is very different then his would be were two very different people right he's talked he's a personality it's all about interaction I see myself as show people I'm music first mm-hm so the first thing I'm gonna pick when we throw a barbeque is not the food or the guest list but what's the music right well white people listen to Bob Marley when we're on vacation and when we celebrate things we listen to cool in the game right right and I would play those and the ratings were going up and they were pissing off management really well they said we feel that Leonard Skinner did Nickelback are more appropriate for your audience so the ratings were going up Yammer upset yes and because you couldn't rein me in okay now keep in mind I hired cooling the gang to open for Van Halen tour before last you have never seen so many people dancing in one place is the sound of every wedding Bar Mitzvah from bachelor party cuz this is ladies night and the feel water die and you gotta sing look at each other as you're driving like what so what did they say to you before you took the job like what was the the what was the conversation when you agreed to do it what did you think was gonna happen as opposed to what did happen well what'd you say and what is real yeah that's the problem I we discussed doing commercials for example and I don't feel comfortable doing commercials unless it's something I actually use like sunglasses or cigarettes beyond that you know Vermont Care Bear kind of a thing I don't know right so it was uncomfortable from the beginning I got fired for playing too much ethnic music and for late-night humor too early in the morning but that was Howard Stern's whole deal was late-night here no it's not it's not different kind of humor what was your deal but as opposed to his well whenever we brought on porn stars I actually knew him there were no died we'd already gone through that getting no you face seasons early her kind of they expect you to do all talk or did they want you to play music as well as my sense of humor as difference unique as is his and as is yours okay can we have a League of imitations in our end of the business and broadcasting okay but there's no snare drum and hi-hat nor is there for Howard you follow mm-hmm he's very nice again I start with the music I start with the ambience and of humor arises or personalities arise or we have guests great if we don't that's fine too and I think they expected other what I showed up with was it also ranged it wasn't always funny hmm okay do you think that it was just maybe something you would Excel that if they'd had different expectations like instead of following Howard Stern - just - David Lee rush oh you bet yeah do you think you'd still be doing it yes really yeah Wow yeah their expectations was the funny the funny interview the guests have pop-culture funny guests right in the subject matter just as we've touched on subjects here that are whole areas and subjects that are pretty dense yeah cuz I call it yeah it's gonna detonate halfway down the turnpike oh that's what he fucking meant mmm yes that stuff that's gonna go away real quick gives you thought about doing that now like what if Apple came to you or one of these streaming services came to you and wanted to do something like that they always arrive with expectations and the expectations just as we discussed three phases of Anna Nicole Smith and Elvis yeah which Dave are you referring to right I just think just with someone like you I mean I'm not a program director but if I was I would say just let him be him just figure it out just let it give it time to grow that's what people don't do they metal they metal they are like you're gonna do I look from what I know of you you're gonna do your best at everything everything you do you're gonna do your best if I was gonna hire you that's what I would say everybody get the fuck away from him he's gonna do his best now let him hire who he wants to hire and do what he wants to do and put what he wants to put on and let him figure it out but you hired David Lee Roth didn't hire Mike Fitzgerald and and and can beYOU can Twitter the fuck the other people are that work in the office it also wants to jizz in the soup no you hired David Lee Roth let David Lee Roth be David Lee Roth and let it find his legs that's difficult entity because comes with a lot of history yeah you know and then the people will start folks will start conducting well you got to play this you gotta play and it has a very specific expect you away however in this age there's a lot a lot of freedoms there's a lot of you know what you're discussing is something that I think about occasionally so it seems like something you'd be open to yeah I'll get you a job just from this particular interview I would be very open to it um I you know they've approached me before to talk about it um my interest in music is diverse but it's energized which duh is he know Henry Rollins of course you know he does his own radio show and he picks his own playlist it's like one of the last few things that a person like him is able to do like that and he does it once he once a week right does it he's going one night a week he does and he loves it I mean something else that people have approached me for is writing a column you some of the good magazines have approached me big ones about becoming a writer that interesting to you you bet yeah it seems like it would be you bet it's it's a different sound when I write you know it's uh it's in a bit of a different voice it's my sense of humor comes out a little bit more in terms of darkness mmm remember reading an article in New York magazines far bags 1968 I don't remember the element the fellow was the theater critic for New York Magazine and the title was in defense of booing why do we always have to tolerate clapping especially for shitty performances right there's the clapper who claps because they're part of the gang and there's the clapper who yells Bravo so that they exist I am heard and he talks about how you know he gets thrown out of an opera for booing and everybody knew a theater critic for 36 years at New York magazine Wow in Italy they permit booing and I support that America stands a lot well that kind of sneaks in not just as if as a form of negative targeting okay but as a form of elevating you dig yeah you don't go to the golf swing guy put on all the electrodes they do the slow motion things they can go you're great Joe no he wants to go see your wrists right right no what you're doing with the elbow you're making me stay exactly yeah he's there to identify the flaw right if there's no flaws there's no booing you know a lot of folks agree to go Jesus man you concentrate on the negative I love booing as much as going yay in fact I can think of certain heavy metal records that we could discuss on the airplane from LA to New York that's five hour flight and I could discuss the record endlessly as long as we're going boo hmm if we're discussing what's wrong with it you can go for five hours what's great about it how long you gonna sustain that 20 minutes mmm hot it's really smart and smart the criticism you know identifying the Flies in that negative right over here yeah you think it's a good example as Edie woods monster movies you see the string you see the smoke you see the Flying Saucer it looks fake that's a version you feel smugly superior you look at that thing that's you know that's a form of bullying yeah you know now today if a people weren't doing that you wouldn't have black panther you wouldn't have spider-man you wouldn't have Avengers in all the amazing special effects and CGI and everything because of high expectations just somebody going I see the string right right yeah Joe yeah all right
