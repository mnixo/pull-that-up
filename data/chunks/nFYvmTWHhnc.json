four three two welcome back Jocko what's happening baby it's good to be here it's good to see man we were just talking about Chris Cornell we found out last night at The Comedy Store that he died and then this morning found out that he hung himself fuck it's it's hard to even comprehend how do you comprehend that I'm living in a parallel universe doesn't make any sense like how could someone like eat you know it's easy on the outside looking in a guy like that be like that guy was one of the best ever like how does a guy like that even want to kill himself how does the lead singer of Soundgarden to me it just really kind of reveals the complexities of human life yeah exactly what you're saying to have a guy that is at the pinnacle of his skill the pinnacle of fame the pinnacle of money and and for him to say you know what not gonna do it anymore yeah I don't I don't know what was going on in his head obviously who knows well if he was on medication if you had some sort of an issue a health issue who knows I mean I would never speculate but I just I don't understand I mean again I don't know his life but I I couldn't even comprehend I can't even imagine it well that's that's one of the really hard things when you start talking about suicide people that for someone like me and I haven't had suicidal thoughts right so when you when you go from that to somebody that not only has the thought but then goes ahead and execute it it's very hard to comprehend yeah I've met people that have done it before I've met have had a few friends that have done it I just have never understood it I don't get it but I don't know them you know I mean everybody's got their own unique mindset and it's just you you know what's really crazy man I've read the statistic the other day about suicide that people in poor neighborhoods are far less likely to kill themselves people that are in the struggle yeah well I actually believe that because they're fighting for something yeah and someone that's already got everything and then there then end up with no drive with no goal and nothing left to achieve and so then all the sudden they're just staring at the mirror without anyone else to go you know and may I'm not talking about Chris Cornell and in particular but for some people I know one of the things that happens is that when they become very successful and they're still not happy then they get hopeless they just feel like well I have everything and yet I'm fucking miserable you know I have a nice big house I Drive this fancy car and I still am miserable like there's no hope like this life is meaningless I don't even know what to say to that I don't know what to say to be honest with you and you hear that you just don't even know what to say to that you know what one thing that why I don't understand it I like struggle I like it I think it's important yeah no there's no doubt about that there's no doubt about having something that you're striving for some goal and like you just said when all those goals have been achieved and now you're sitting there at the top of the mountain and you now you don't feel happy what do you do just pick up a fucking hobby man find something you suck at and get better at it I mean that seems so simplistic but I'm you know I just you and I are we share this is very important part of our lives which is intense exercise indeed and I think that you know I go to your Instagram almost every day to look at your watch it's hilarious if you go to Jacko's Instagram it's a fucking Timex watch advertisement it's office that Ironman watch with 4:30 in the more the occasional 3:30 this motherfuckers up at 3:30 and you know and you working out like like that's his fucking hairy gorilla arm and a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch but that's what's up man that's what's up being just fucking doing it getting out there and struggling and then once you do do that here's the thing like you know like a friend of mine said that he's like I was I was saying something about you could come on the podcast and he goes can that do take another picture was fucking watch I go I hope he takes a picture of his watch every day until he dies I go it's important it's important a lot of ways it's symbolic of what we're talking about like no it's not fun to look your watch every day but your I can do it every day like that's what's important yeah and I actually early on I had someone you know say something along the lines of on social media on Instagram or on Twitter you know are you gonna post another picture you're watching I was like unfollow me I just don't follow me it's no big deal I'm not making you do it and and now it is kind of turned into something where I'm I'm doing it every day regardless of anything else in the world yeah fuck them I like looking at your watch I wanna know when I get up at 7:00 and I think I'm getting up early you've enough for hours you already gonna work now I like it I think it's uh it's but it is in a lot of ways it is it's symbolic of what we're talking about it's the struggle yeah and you know you know who doesn't complain about it I always make this point to there's like a a single mom somewhere in the valley here that's working three jobs that's getting up at 3:30 in the morning so she can go work as a waitress somewhere before she's got her other day job that she's got to go through so she can feed her kids yeah I get up almost as a luxury at this point I mean I'm a retired guy from the from the military so I can kind of get up whenever I want right I get up early as a luxury sort of but you also get up because that's who you are yeah and I get up because it is it is a way to maintain discipline in life for sure to get that stone out and sharpen that blade every morning it's the grind that sharpens the axe indeed there's no other way there's no other way and I don't want to say that this would have saved Chris Cornell or anybody else that did it I'm not saying that but I mean for some people out there that aren't feeling good man if you've just fucking struggled more you get over that struggle you feel better it sounds so simplistic but I swear by it yeah I felt shitty myself then forced myself to work out and after I get out of there my whoa 1% fucking percent guarantee you know actually I had I had you know I had Tim Ferriss come on my podcast when he came on he was like hey I don't know if I'm the right kind of guest for your podcast because you know my podcast is like about war and death and killing and all that stuff and so you know Tim's are about being better and stuff like that so it's easy to raise your voice yeah I mean look at Steel's writing better tick Tim's Tim's podcasts about improving yourself and mine is about war and genocide and horrible things and he said to me you know hey I don't know if if I come on the podcast but you know maybe I'm not the right type of guest or whatever and I and I wrote back to him and I said hey man you know you've been through some dark stuff in your life because he wrote a blog post years ago about him being suicidal and him contemplating and planning commit suicide this is Tim Ferriss did he really yeah he went through full motions got you know typical Tim Ferriss methodology what did he do he went to the library and got out a bunch of books on killing yourself and then did the research on how he was going to do it and planned it all and then when was this how long ago he was going he was like just done with college and so I mean what is that I want to see 35 or something so maybe it's 20s 15 years ago Christ and he was under all this pressure you know he was an Ivy League guy and he was trying to finish school but then it wasn't working out and it was just problematic and so he started saying himself okay well how am I getting out of this well there's one way to get out of it and luckily he didn't do it but when he came on you know that's what we talked about and what he said you know as he was making recommendations from again from a guy who's been there was like hey if if you're trapped in your in your mind and you're starting to feel that way go do something physical get in your body get out of your mind the same thing you're saying when you're feeling bad when you're feeling down go out and swing your kettlebell around and you will feel better yeah this is just too much for some people especially they're just experiencing way too much pressure and that pressure a lot of times it's just an imbalance in perspective and some of its and like I was talking to this mom once her daughter does gymnastics with my daughter and we were talking about kids killing themselves where she used to live she's to live in one of the really wealthy tech areas outside of San Francisco and a bunch of kids that went to school with her daughter that were like 15 16 were jumping off bridges and chin like it was a like an epidemic and they were trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and they're literally calling it affluenza that these affluent kids and their families are literally worth a billion dollars you know I mean everybody's super rich and they're having this insane pressure like before high school and in high school to be in Ivy League schools and to get 4.0 s and all in their fucking they're not having any fun and they're not experienced in life and they don't have any hope and their parents are all on fucking pills and they're just killing themselves yeah and as you said it really is a piece of perspective because if you think about think about some when you watch one of your buddies go down the downward spiral maybe it's not the suicide but whether it's drug addiction a lot of times some female the girlfriend the ex-wife will just take him on the downward spiral and there's there they can't get out of it and if they were to step back if they were if it was you and your buddy watching one of your other friends go down the spot they'd go oh my god I can't believe he's doing that that's crazy but when you're in that spiral people get caught in that and they can't they can't get the perspective of what it looks like from the outside yeah it's hard for people to break momentum to momentum that's good momentum or meant to momentum that's bad momentum when I get a like when I get on a good groove or working out all the time I feel it like after I'm done working I'm like Jack can't wait to get in there again I can't wait to work out again that's the good momentum but then there's that bad momentum like you get injured or something like that you can't do anything for a couple weeks and then to try to get that kick start that meant motor up the end stall it's hard to get momentum yeah and I've caught some some flack for saying there was a big science experiments or something in the and they said that willpower dissipates throughout the day and the more decisions you have to make the weaker you get throughout the day and I think that's BS I agree with what you're saying which is when you wake up in the morning you get a good workout you don't lose willpower you actually build it you feel better you feel stronger and then at lunchtime you you're not saying hey where's the pizza and where's the donuts no at lunchtime you already worked out you feel good you're like hey where's the where's the steak where's the protein um and and that carries throughout the day as opposed to exactly what you're saying which is when you sleep in you skip your workout all of a sudden the donuts are starting to look pretty good and then the next thing you know it's pizza and then when you get home at night you're just watching TV and that can continue on for days and then days turn into weeks and then the next thing you know you're fat and out of shape yeah and then on top of that if they did do that study like really I want to know what those people were eating because that's a big factor too there's a lot of people that are eating shit food and then by the end of the day your body's in a crisis yeah no body's just processing all this bullshit yeah and people ask me that - they go you know how much you sleep first of all I get asked all the time so I go to bed around 11:00 over wake up around 4:30 that's five and a half hours I sometimes I sleep or not sometimes I go to bed at 10:00 10:30 11 sometimes I stay up later but when the person says to me oh you know I can't do that I feel horrible how can I feel better and my first question is like what are you eating what are you eating cuz if you're eating Cheetos and chocolate chip cookies for lunch there's no way you're gonna feel good now I don't care if you slept 12 hours a night before yeah that's a it's a giant factor and if you're eating a big like bullshit lunch filled with nonsense like your body's got to process all that stuff and so the end of the day yeah you're going to lose your willpower so like when five o'clock six o'clock rolls around you're going to be tired but if you have a healthy lunch and you know you're properly fueled and then you also have positive people in your life everyone is motivated by the end of the day you're gonna feel good like say if you're going if you're doing jiu-jitsu with a bunch of other people that are doing jiu-jitsu everybody's enjoying it you're looking forward to that 6:30 class everybody's fired up you get out of work you're fucking pumped man you what you're doing it when you get out of work you're fueling up with water you're trying to get some electrolytes in you because you know you're gonna get out there on the mat so you're gonna sweat it out yeah and the thing you got to do too is when you get done with work and it was a grind it you didn't get you get crappy food and whatever happened happened and you got yelled at by your boss or whatever and the real easy decision is to be like I'm not gonna go train tonight those the nights you gotta train because that is going to kick you back on the track real quick when you get in there and you see your boys and they're getting ready to tear you up on the mats and that's going to get you on track as opposed to going home and watching TV which isn't gonna do anything for you yeah and if it's juice is not anything whatever the fuck you thing is just go and do it just force yourself to do it and if you feel like shit because you ate lunch then your lunch was you know filled with bullshit well then hey dummy don't eat shitty lunch tomorrow tomorrow try a nice salad yeah now try salad with some salmon and see how you feel then you like hey I feel way better today at 6 o'clock duh yeah now your decision-making will be better like that people don't understand how significant it is like all these little decisions they those are like that that's the path for the rest of your existence on earth and if you decide to go to fucking Cheetos chocolate chip cookie route you're if you're just making a shit path you're carving your fucking path through broken rocks and glass and it's not the way to go there's no doubt that the the life change decision isn't one big decision that you make all these little tiny decisions it's the you know having a salad set of Cheetos that's that's that's what it is on a daily basis and if you think about that and then you just make the right decision on those little things that's where that's where the changes if you just reach in your refrigerator see the coca-cola right next to the water just go like that grab that water just do it you know you don't want to but just do it you're like I fucking did it I grab the water listen water doesn't taste good compared to coca-cola if your body is like craving that that heroine of coca-cola but the reality is if you were out in the desert and you saw a cold bottle of water you'd be so excited for that watery blood ah it would be the most delicious thing ever when you're at a restaurant you're like oh you got any lemonade oh you know I want a soda I want I want some some mouth pleasure yeah and if you've ever been truly thirsty before like in the desert yeah I'm having that water you didn't bring enough water and you're really thirsty you coke isn't even appealing if that not nasty you get to fill it really is you get in that mode where you've been truly thirsty which I've been before you know just not like I was gonna die but I've been close to getting some sort of a heat stroke scenario happening and fun and then got to a stream pump the water drink the water and that's the most beautiful thing in the world and you don't have water and you get it yeah I bet more so even if you get in from a stream and pump it through a filter and you're just getting it right out of the earth so good oh so were you supposed to have folks well I think people are supposed to struggle I think there's there's a part of us that longs for the old times when we were just some sort of primitive monkey people running away from animals there's it that's still in our DNA there's no doubt that you have an instinct I mean that's why we play sports right you play sports because you want to compete with people and and look at the rise of UFC why is that because that's the most primal sport you can possibly come up with is I'm going to fight you who are we're going to do in a cage so why is that so popular we still have that instinct that we want if we want to fight we want to struggle we want to survive yeah you know Dana White and I have talked about this so many times that it transcends every language like cricket is so giant in England right and in India try putting that shit on TV in America will be like get bitch get that fucking stupid paddle game off TV what the fuck are you doing what's going on or conversely a baseball you play baseball to some country that doesn't accept baseball like what is this nonsense this takes forever yeah you know in the real sport of MMA like is not I mean it is unquestionably it's a sport and there are rules but it trans sent you know what's happening you might not understand the ground that much when when submissions but when you see a guy turning red cuz yeah the other guys behind him choking the fucking life out of them you get it you see what's happening you understand it that's another cool thing if you ever ever teach kids jiu-jitsu yeah it's so awesome to say no you want to put this guy down and that's that's all you say they go okay and then you give them a little little taste of information like if you grab their legs and push them they'll fall down and that's all you need to tell them and then they'll be basically doing double leg takedown instinctively yeah and it's savage yeah it is beautiful but you can't do that with you know with a regular sport like baseball okay what you're gonna do is you're gonna have this guy throw the ball two three times every time you swing it to misses that so that goes to him and right was how's that work no yeah well it's also that something feels good about like choking somebody you know it's just something about it like even if you're not hurting them I mean it just feels good it feels like you're supposed to do it maybe just see you and I you know I think anybody I think anybody that that tries it and gets that that's quite why do Jitsu is getting so popular because you take a random person on the street male female 10 years old 20 years old 40 years old you put them and you say okay when you get them this other person in this position right here and you get their arm around you get your arm around their neck you can kill them or you can accept you can accept their tap you can have mercy on them that's a powerful feeling it is real possibility you know another thing that's powerful about it is the two guys can be friends and practice killing each other and not even hurt each other yeah like like I'm sure you you've recognized that like I feel better working out with black belts I feel safer oh for sure training with guys that are like super high level than I do with even guys that are like an athletic white belt it might spaz out and accidentally headbutt me yeah I mean I get asked that question all the time too is people say hey am I too old to start dude so I'm 52 years old I'm 49 years old and what I tell them is you're not too old you're definitely not too old but you need to be smart and one of the smartest decisions you need to make is choosing your training partners and you don't want to train if you're a 52 year old guy that's never trained before and you're a white belt you're gonna get on the mat the person you don't want to train with is the other white belt that's 22 years old that's on steroids that's going to go psycho and he's gonna he just he just doesn't want to control his body whereas the black belt the black belt the percentage chance of you being hurt by a black belt if you're a white belt that's just you know try is nearly zero a nearly zero zero if it's a legit black belt yeah yeah I teach my kids class sometimes my kid takes a mixed martial arts class and the instructor asked me to come in and demonstrate one particular type of move the other day and so I start I demonstrated it and we were talking about like some different positions that are important for kids to recognize like how to make sure you don't get like kids were giving up their back where they were trying to pass guard they were trying to pass guard and they were pushing down and I'm like you never want to turn your shoulder like that because I had explained to them the arm drag so I'm explaining to these kids to arm jack and you see the little brain spinning man and you see them practicing on each other and they're laughing and they're girls you know so you're watching these like eight year old girls having the best time like choking each other and everything and going through these motions and to me I mean I think it's fucking awesome man these kids do it all the time no one's getting hurt they're having a great time with each other and it's just this primal release like let's get all that shit out of there and then you could be civil yeah well even if there's no jujitsu instruction involved and there's no mats around and you take two kids and you put them in the yard eventually they're gonna start wrestling with each other channel these boys yeah boys for sure yes for sure I was at a party once with my kids and these two boys started going at it and neither one of them at any training you could tell but it's just natural like they they're getting their hips low and they're trying to push each other they're trying to figure it out and neither one of them knew what to do I kind of wanted to go up and start coaching them but they're just playing in the grass I didn't want you know it's like it's it's fascinating to see just natural human instincts yeah and that's the other thing I've noticed in teaching kids jujitsu is the kids that are a little bit more cerebral your your you know the parents will think well you know my son he's kind of a nerd he's kind of a smart kid I don't know if he's gonna like this but the opposite is actually true very often where the kid that's cerebral he'll recognize as soon as you've shown three things like you said his wheels are turned he's going to wait a second this is this is a skill I can learn and if I know this then and the other guy doesn't know this I'll be able to beat them and so cerebral kids often get into it even more than then you know some kid that's just kind of a natural bruiser oh yeah don't mean tenth planet jiu-jitsu is filled with nerds they're all nerds the assassin nerds it's really kind of interesting is and and you're you're not being facetious when you use the word assassin nerds because you know this is you know if you go back before you knew jujitsu before I knew you did too before I knew jujitsu and you know I was a big Navy SEAL two hundred pounds one of those kids that's 145 pounds would absolutely have destroyed me if we got new fight boom take my back put me to sleep you know what I mean I I might you know put up an OK fight and hit him one time in the side of the head and then he's in on my back and put me to sleep that's the reality nerd assassins coming at you strong well it is I mean it's a complex game of kinetic chess I mean it's more complex than chess because you know in chess you've got these different pieces and they're restricted in their movements jiu-jitsu is not restricted in its movement and that every transition has so many different possibilities and so many different setups there's so many different times you get led one way and then just to get you to defend so that they can establish a second position and they get you to defend that so they can establish a third position yeah and that part of it is is what I think really for me transferred from jujitsu to not only to the battlefield but to life as well because the big thing in jiu-jitsu from my perspective is that you don't go strength against strength right if I don't if I'm trying to choke you I don't try and choke you overtly I don't just grab your neck no I work on your arm and I put pressure over here and I pass your guard and then I eventually while you're thinking about something else boom that I grabbed your neck or that's when I grabbed your arm and that's what I think on the battlefield you know you can't you just don't attack hardened positions of the enemy and in life you know if you're trying to be a leader you're trying to step up and lead somebody you don't just come down and bark orders at people because that's not as effective as maneuvering and adjusting your position and getting in a better position and then getting that person to give you what you want instead of trying to take it from them yeah that's a really important lesson for Parenthood like you can't just tell kids what to do you know like to just do it cuz I told you do it they like fuck you I'm gonna be a hooker yeah yeah and that applies not only to kids that your your honor percent applies to kids but applies to adults as well and that is people need to understand why they're doing what they're doing it and you know if I want you to go take down some building and capture some bad guy I don't go hey hey Joe I want you to take down this building once your pack captures bad guy these the guys I want you to take with you here's the route I want you to take in here's the methodology I want you to use for the clearance because then when I send you to go do that mission it's not your mission it's my mission I came up with a plan you didn't so you might be you might have thought there was a better way to do it or you might had a different idea of how to get it done and now when you go out there and you meet some kind of resistance whether it's an obstacle you didn't expect or whether it's some scenario that you didn't foresee instead of you trying to overcome it you just blame me you just look ahead Jocko came up with a stupid plan and here we are it's failing forget it we're going back we're not going to carry out the mission whereas if I said hey Joe here's what I want you to do go figure out the best way to do it and now you come up with a plan and now you make up all the methodology of how you're gonna get it done and you decide who you're going to take with you now it's your plan you own that plan and when you go out in the field and you meet a little resistance guess what you do you say I'm gonna find a way around it I'm going to overcome this I'm gonna overcome that obstacle to make it happen and that's another piece of leadership and it's the exact same thing with kids if you tell your kid you know you will get good grades in school that means nothing to them but if you explain to them hey I would love for you to get good grades and here's why it's gonna open opportunities for you in the future it's gonna allow you to be able to outsmart people because you have more knowledge than them and then you're gonna be able to end up making more money which is actually give you more freedom in the long run instead of doing a job that you don't want to do you explain all those things to a kid it's going to be a lot more successful than just do I told you get good grades because I said so now when you do these conferences were when you you speak it at businesses and they bring you in to sort of you have these leadership media would you call them yeah their leadership seminars seminars yeah now when you have these seminars are these some of the principles that you discuss when you talk about absolutely yeah absolutely because that's another another big piece of this is that all this ideas about interacting with human beings they just don't change like there's little variance but whether you're dealing with kids or whether you're dealing with adults and whether you're dealing with business people whether you're dealing with soldiers on the battlefield the leadership principles they don't change and therefore you can whether you're trying to get people to go out and capture and kill a bad guy or whether you're trying to get them to build some product and sell it the principles of leadership don't change you're still trying to get a bunch of totally independent people right and that's one of the myths we have to overcome a lot because everyone thinks oh and the military ones just like a robot and that's just not true everybody in the military is free theater people they're people they're free thinking people they're gonna come up with our own ideas they're gonna have their own agendas and they're gonna think of ways to do things that they think are better than yours so you can have all these independent free thinkers and you got to get them on board with the same plan to you to go out and execute and so it doesn't matter if you're on the battlefield in business that's what that's what you're trying to get done and the leadership principles don't change to me that's as a person who's never been in the military that's it's one of the fascinating aspects of how it works is like how how do you get all these different people to follow through on a plan and who are the leaders and why do the leaders have the right ideas and who educates them as to how to have the right idea to having the right ideas like I know that a lot of people are excited about where the military is right now like Tim Kennedy re-enlisted yeah and he got a lesson yeah he relisted because he believes that the military has support now and look Tim Kennedy's believes he's put on this earth to kill bad guys that's what he wants to do me I think I agree with Tim Kennedy I think I agree with him too for sure obviously he enjoys it heavy he's not fucking around he went back in he put his his money where his mouth is and in his eyes that this is you know this is the way it should have been that you should give the military the chance to do their job that's their idea and then other people believe that there should be much more civilian oversight and there should be much more much more checks and balances before things get done this is a great debate it's going on today well I think there's two different things that you just talked about that is what the military gets told to do and how they do it and those are two different things and III think that yes you absolutely the civilians should control and do control the military by the way they do control the the civilians are unwritten or the military's under control civilians and yet once you say okay this is what we want to have happen you need to let the military professionals figure out how they're going to go and make it happen yeah that's that's where it gets tricky right because if you're in like one of the things that was explained to me by a friend of Navy SEAL he was saying that when something needs to get done and you have all these people that are telling you how you can do it how you can't do it that if people that are not in experiencing combat and don't understand what what could or could not go sideways like to put more problems in place or to put more checks and balances in place you're actually going to put these people in more danger that that is true yeah you should like I said if you let the civilians decide what it is that needs to be accomplished and then the military leaders decide how they're going to go ahead and make that that happen and I mean it goes back to it goes back to Vietnam you know there was too much civilian oversight of what was happening in Vietnam and the military leaders were they didn't really have the the wherewithal not even the wherewithal they didn't have the free rein to go out and try and make things happen the way they want to do and it ended up in a big quagmire well Vietnam seems like to me from an outsider to be one of the most fucked up wars ever absolutely it didn't totally make sense that it was happening and then now we know that the gulf of gulf of tonkin was very likely a false flag and that there was some sort of motivation to get there in the first place and then you're dealing with guerrilla warfare for the first time ever in US history like they didn't exactly know how to handle this no we didn't and we didn't adapt very well to what was on the ground which is always going to be problematic if you have close-minded people in the military if people are close mind that you're not going to be able to move forward against a when the battlefield changes and the battlefield changes all the time I mean you can look at Iraq Iraq the battlefield changed drastically from this big conventional force that we went up there to fight against Saddam's big army well once that fell apart then what happened now the sudden we were facing guerrillas again and an insurgency and it took us several years to change our strategy from we didn't even know what to do oh my god you know what do we do there's all these people running around what do we do with these all these people running around and how do we get these people under control and and the civilians want us here and and yet if we don't do the right thing now the civilians don't want us here what do we need to do so it took us some time to adjust our strategy in Iraq and luckily we had some good leaders that went ahead and made those changes isn't it also that when when you're in war and though the strategy and not the strategy but the motivation is very clear like if you fight against Hitler's army in World War two yeah this is very clear that you're dealing with an evil force whereas in Vietnam it's like wait a minute why are we here like what's going on the organism what's happening extremely extremely challenging no doubt and that that is why and you know I've talked about this before if if America or any nation is going to go to war you have to decide that this is the most important thing in the world you have to end the Wills that I talked about that you have to have to execute this war you got to have you got to have the will to kill people and again I say this all time no one wants to hear it because it's ugly and horrible but when you say you're going to kill people in war you're not just going to be able to perfectly kill just the bad guys civilians are going to die it is a nightmare kids women it's horrible it's awful and if you think oh I'm going to go to war we're just going to kill the bad guys it's not going to happen war is too complex it's just not going to be saying like I'm going to go and fight in the UFC and I'm not going to get hit it's not going to happen you're going to get hit you're going to get bruised up you're going to get dinged and it's the same thing in war so you have to have the will to kill people of course it's easy to have the will to kill the bad guys but then you have to accept the fact that some innocent people are going to die and that is going to be awful and then on the other side of the coin is of course if you're going to send people or people Americans are going to die and there's nothing you can do about it you have to accept that fact and you know that's why Vietnam was just the ultimate tragedy and we in many respects because we were killing a lot of civilians we were losing a lot of Americans but we weren't progressing the way we needed to this is a nightmare I agree with you hundred percent what do you think about transparency like when the Bush administration wouldn't let them take photographs of coffins and and send them home like a lot of people are really upset because there's a lot of people that felt like look Americans should know that there's a cost to this and they should know that there's consequences to these actions and they were saying that these consequences and knowing about these consequences could lessen morale could lessen support back at home when they really need it that people didn't really need to know this that what they need to know is we're on the right track and we're doing well yeah that's a tough one and whether it's the right decision to keep the Americans in their beautiful bubble that they live in and let them know that this war is happening but you don't have to see the the brave Americans coming home that are sacrificed their lives and interestingly if you remember I think it was Tarawa the Battle of Tarawa in World War two and for the first time so we were we needed money to run World War two a lot of money war bombs and all that and we were kind of falling behind and we needed some money and one of the first times that they released a lot of pictures of American dead Americans was I think it was the Battle of Tarawa and there was all these Americans washing up on the beach I mean Marines that had drowned and got shot and it was awful but they did it for a reason they did it to show like hey this is real this is happening we need to put pitch in we need money we need to you know save save meet save don't use your cars we all need to get in for the big win right and that's the opposite of what we're talking about when they're saying hey you're not allowed to take pictures of dead americans that are being killed and you know i think there should be some level of transparency there when you should America should see what is happening what is the cost because it's real easy for Americans to to sit there and allow these young kids to go overseas and fight and die or be wounded gravely wounded and just to shut those you know just ignore them because I'm I don't care cuz I'm over here in the mall no maybe we should uh maybe we should not only you know maybe we should not only show pictures of the coffins that are coming back but maybe we should explore and show the lives that those men sacrificed and who they were and what they did and what their families are like and their wife and kids and mom and dad that they left behind that they gave up and why did they give it up because they believed in freedom and so now we're just going to say oh that's not happening no it's happening and you need to you need to know it it is kind of strange right when you think about how little access to information people really had back in World War two they were counting on the news they were counting on newspapers and now today we have massive massive access to information instantaneously but yet you get less of it when it comes to that yeah and and in some ways you get more of it I mean obviously when there's an incident that happens overseas you can find out about it on Twitter as fast as you can find out about it through you know waiting for a real new source to come up with it but you don't get anything that's like specifically distributed by the US government to let you know the consequences of a war and say hey folks we need your support this is what's really going down these are American citizens this is what's happening to them over there yeah and then the same thing could be said if for hey sometimes civilians are going to get killed yeah and what do we do what do we do then do we brush that under the rug and we just show the Americans getting killed or do you universally show what's happening what war is men war is jacked up I'm here to tell you war is not glorious it is not fun and it is it is a horrible horrible event and so yeah I think you should expose it and I think you should expose it at a high level so that people understand what we're getting into and as horrible as war is there's many times throughout history where war is the absolute in my mind in my opinion the right thing to do and we don't have a choice and we need to do something when when horrible things are happening and and you know I think that's you know in my podcast I talk about like the like I said I talked about war and death and horrible genocide and and that's one of the reasons why I think it's it's gotten the water action is because I'm talking about things that although otherwise being ignored and I think people do want to know I think people do want to understand war at a deeper level so that way when they hear a politician up there saying hey we should go to war they can at least save themselves I know what I know what he's talking about and he's not just talking about hey we're gonna wave the flag we're gonna send some soldiers over they're gonna kick ass they're gonna come home we're gonna high-five that's not what war is and let's not ever forget that that's not what war is war is a man and another man on a battlefield surrounded by people civilians and they're trying to kill each other and it's a bloodbath and we shouldn't forget that and is it necessary sometimes it absolutely is it absolutely is necessary sometimes but we better way are our minds heavily before we make that decision to go and execute now when you think about the evolution of human beings you think about how much safer it is today versus how it was thousands of years ago do you ever foresee a time where war won't exist I don't know you know people joke with me a lot about the robot wars and and robots being able to accomplish wars I actually believe that thing will come I mean we've got drones right now that that are very capable pretty soon we'll have land warfare robots that will be able to go in clear buildings and and make things happen and then will the enemy then have robots that will fight our robots at some point yeah and then at some point will that elevate to a point where we're not dealing with physical robots anymore but just the software behind the robots and now it's just a big sort of cyber warfare that that is that seems conceivable to me now Joe don't mistake me for some kind of like a Sam Harris intellectual over here or that I'm going to sit here and explain to you what the future of you know warfare from a technical perspective but from my from my rudimentary thought process could it not elevate to a point where we have robots fighting robots and then that eventually escalates to a point where it's some kind of cyber warfare with it's not physical but it's just information based that does make sense to me that that could happen yeah it makes sense to me too especially when you see those Boston dynamic robots have you seen those things you kick them over bounce back up they run up hills they can run like 60 miles an hour they're freaks I mean it's it's really and what they're doing now is just I mean who knows where they're going to be ten years from now I mean they're going to be solar-powered the there live out there with no food yeah it'll be awesome and then and then then where we go will those robots fight people for a while probably people that don't know any people that don't people don't have good robots yet yeah and that's not going to be fun for the people about robots right and we'll see where it goes from there yeah I mean I think that's just a surrender scenario right if you got a if let's say America has these robots that can just come in with ruthless precision and take out bad guys and you know you're going to be at their mercy there's a fucking science fiction movie right like China develops robots that take over New York City yeah look at this goddamn thing yeah it's one of these bosses also bots it's just it's so weird man to see them moving around yeah and what's interesting I've seen some other ones like you don't need they put all this effort into making it actually walk instead of have you know wheels or tracks or whatever the you know wheels are tracks with little pods that could get over things would be they want this to look like for a person for some reason a human shape is not necessarily the most effective you know structure for fighting this not even will for us right yeah barely yeah I mean what's one of the reason why our backs are so fucked up we got you know you can't even talk us into standing up straight I can pick up ten pounds okay it's a big deal oh I'm better than that yeah fuck this robot someday though what's it's just we like things that look like us for whatever reason you know we like the idea that this thing is going to look like us but yeah I agree with you it doesn't need to and should know I'm not the best and the real the real combat robots probably won't look like they won't be bipedal nerd yeah but you know they won't be by people to probably have little treads or something and just haul ass at 60 miles an hour with the machine gun or they'll have many legs like what was that one that was like a cheetah there's some some crazy one that's like a cheetah and it runs at some fucking ridiculous speed and it's terrifying they had one that was on a treadmill this is the cheetah one again it's obviously not the best galloping it's not the best structure because you have to make this thing up and run whereas wheels on it or treads or something like a tank a mini tank yeah but I wonder like for getting over logs and stuff like that if there's any sort of benefit they also have those ones that leap up in the air and they go over there go over the top of walls and shit yeah that's what you need is some kind of a legs that can pop out if they need to yeah maybe we should just design this thing and take a look there you go here's one wheels yeah see oh god that's got the best of both yeah let's fucking terrified that we've got front legs let's go back wheels yeah they're not fucking playing games didn't Google buy them in that Google Skynet that's what we should be careful of yeah Google is powerful goddamn their big announcement they made this week about the Google i/o assistant AI stuff is pretty crazy too I don't know but it did information so I can't tell you just look it up if we're getting scared this is like the Google Siri type thing yeah yeah yeah exact this is for the new pixel phone yep yep what is oh it was lunch an extra announcements on top of that - what's supposed to be significant whoa do you see that thing jump over a fucking look at this yeah see that's the thing you know out fuck that thing see without even knowing it I was saying wheels legs is burnt there you go but that thing that rewind that a little bit well I should go over the wall it jumps over a wall look a little bit before that yeah watch this watch with this fucking thing can do man after it does this he goes down these stairs and then it gets to means it gets to this wall like a hurdle and it fucking bounces over this hurdle like it's nothing there's snow doesn't matter grass doesn't matter yes doesn't break one of those stupid wheels the problem is one of those wheels may now you shoot one of those wheels I think fuck look at sowing bounces right over that no problem tucks its legs it looks terrifying yeah then put it cover it in like some creepy fucking fake skin like an alien you know yeah and then you'd put sensors on it you know thermal sensors and night vision sensors and you wouldn't be able to get away from it yeah you know wasn't you down and kill you I mean just think about that technology and then had that Tesla technology for self-driving cars and knows where all the cars are and everything we're just we're just a few years away from something very very bizarre yeah I again I kind of look forward to it bring on the robots all the fight them I'll go down to blaze of glory yeah that's like at the now Nukem sorry ripping out battery cords and trying to take their lives yeah Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator it's funny because when that Google assistant can see and understand the world around you why they built that like google google lens thing that used to be existing and they took it away it kind of just built with a new blend and then you get the you track sunglasses you know you mean Google glasses yeah I'm sorry my lens is that thing that translates the world that translates languages they just kind of put all that data into this and so now it's on that phone and everyone will have it that has the new pixel in it so what does it do it's doing a bunch as far as I know right now it's a bunch of AI information so it's looking at barcodes and QR codes all over the place and it's you don't even have to have a really excuse me a good version of it you can do it from far away and it can read it it can be really low pixelated not saying about where I'm losing the word resolution yeah yeah low resolution you can use resolution it can pick it up from far away to off the TV so that's cool isn't it like shown again what does bark why why do you need to read barcodes each other tell me well I know one thing it's the new pixels supposed to do like say if you have like this stevia and you I want to get this you know it's got a little barcode you put your phone up to it'll show you a link on Amazon you can one click it just like that so that's one good thing that it does for the barcodes but you know it can compare prices and stores it's saying automatically whether it's using Amazon and they'll block that my PC so basically we're moving into the ultimate age of consumerism yeah so buy this now it's just a step up in instantaneous per instantaneous purchasing but like as far as like reading the world around you what else is it doing uh I mean I think you have to hold it up to see it so it's right here it says you can aim it at a flower and it'll and it will identify the species whoa you can point pull up a bands music or videos by pointing the lens at a concert poster whoa so like right now there's something that popped up an apples fun recently that people don't really know because it's hard to see like if I type in your name Joe it gets underlined and if you click that a whole bunch of information pops up and leads to like all of your things on Apple music it leads to your webpage it's like a little serious iStent thing but it hasn't been advertised and it's not really it doesn't work for every person's name like it might not work for Jocko willing but it will work for Joe Rogan and it might in the future if they update it or I don't know who needs to update that's kind of it's cool too this is an updated version of that I believe and just to bring this conversation back to where we were the further we go in this direction of technology being in every part of our lives the further away we get from having to struggle with things and the bigger hole there's going to be in the hole that you sense and I sense which is if you're not struggling if you're not working if you're not fighting for something that's just going to go further and further into the past and further then further down and people can have that hole to fill up somehow yeah the physical body needs it has requirements that is stress requirements and if you I always do the way I talk about it's like a battery and like almost like but not a conventional battery the way we think of us but almost like a storage vessel for energy and then if you don't do anything with that energy it's sort of oozes over the side and fucking battery acid crust the outside of it like it gets all fucked up but if you just keep pumping out energy you keep doing something it maintains some sort of homeostasis it maintains some sort of a balance point it it maintains some sort of a operational happiness like where the body's not fighting against itself because I think that a lot of people's bodies are just fighting against them and a lot of like the way the decisions they're making it's a big of a big part of it it's just not taking care of their meat vehicles so they're getting all this confusing messages from the flesh yeah I I mean we see that every day when you walk around America and you saw people that are just you wonder how much longer they're going to be able to survive and what happens if they if there's a fire and they have to run they're not going to make it around the corner to go to Disneyland everybody's on a scooter it's weird it's so weird and I have a friend who works at Disneyland and he was telling me like he's working there ten years ago it was rare to see someone on a scooter and now they're all on scooters and they're not on scooters do they got a broken leg well there are they're old they're on scooters because they've eaten themselves into this unmanageable shape well again even five years ago if you wanted to eat yourself in a miserable shape you had to walk to the grocery store to do that which was at least some form of movement and now you just one click on Amazon and you got the the cheetos in ultra large size showing up at your front door in two hours and they're gonna come in a drone soon yeah and by the way you can just like cheetos and then it'll it'll put you up the other things that you will probably want to you want cheetos you probably want two liters of coke and you probably on some marshmallows to go with that and there you go two hours it's there are just killing yourself what the fuck man like when is this going to end I wonder when they're going to be able to figure out a way to compensate for all the shit that like just some sort of a pill that figures that or even crisper I was I was listening to his radio lab podcast where they're updating CRISPR where do you know what CRISPR is it's a new tool that they have that they're using to modify genes and they they've only figured it out over the last few years and apparently they've already started doing work on non-viable fetuses in China with this that's what they say who knows whether it went by time they say that my thought is the guy telling you is probably some fucking fake person by then you know by the time it actually gets to the news who knows what kind of crazy advancements they're making you know behind the iron curtain or there is is there an Iron Curtain anymore well there's China and there's definitely some things going on in China though for sure they're doing some dark shit yeah with people in this goddamn technology but they think that they're not only going to be able to use this gene editing tool but they're going to be able to implant this gene editing tool into our genetics so that your own genes start doing the work of CRISPR for you so things like they think that's going to take the place of antibiotics they think it's going to be able to edit out things like Alzheimer's like whatever the gene is for Alzheimer's they'll be able to edit that out so Alzheimer's will no longer exist it's going to be really really strange because we're going to have to make decisions yeah and I think the stuff is gonna come quickly once it like once we turn the corner it seems like it's gonna come fast oh it's gonna come real fast there's going to be some weird mutations that happen in there too yeah there's gonna be people to look like the Hulk yeah there's gonna be some people that have one eye in in two heads and just gonna be all jacked up and they're gonna what do we knew those people right the ones that didn't look yet that it didn't work right Tijuana is crisper job whistles crisper uphill is it uh no it's some sort of a gene editing tool I don't know the actual mechanism behind it I don't understand I've only like listened to people talk about it and read things on it and then how far away is immortality from that because once you can eliminate all these different diseases yeah I think like a hundred years and I always thought if you could just clone your body and then you let your body grow to be twenty years old then you just take your brain out put it inside that new body then you're good to go yes I think it's going to be even creepier than that I think they're gonna be able to turn back the clock because I think that when you think about like cellular aging well what is it your body's not reproduce you know every cell in your body except for your neurons reproduces like somewhere between every three to seven years or something like that right your neurons are the only things you keep for the whole life and so what they're thinking is that like as time goes on your your cells reproduce shittier and shittier your telomeres shrink okay doesn't do what well they'll be able to flip that around so that as time goes on you'll be like Benjamin buttons you'll start getting younger and younger which will be really weird if they fuck it up and you start turning into a baby you know you're like some fifty year old then also and you're like dude I'm 12 again like this is not good next year I'm going to be 11 ya know like if it goes backwards in that direction if they can literally halt it like if they can take you and then like say if you're a 40 year old woman and they put you on a 20 year program and they're like well in 20 years instead of being 60 you're going to be 20 and this is how it's going to work next year you're going to be 39 next that's totally conceivable that's totally conceivable totally a hundred percent conceivable possible and likely yeah yeah then then that immortality thing isn't that far away then the only thing that's going to fuck you up as accidents and murder and you know like that asteroids is life become more precious than because now you're thinking hey I don't want to go skydiving because I could actually live for thousands of years if I don't screw this up I think more likely you're gonna see a lot more parkour and those assholes that are doing backflips off the Grand Canyon like that kind of shit you're gonna see you can see more more more people that are like wanting to feel alive by taking crazy risks yeah those Russian dudes though ah well I had James Kingston on the podcast he's that crazy asshole from England yeah great kid but he's does backflips on top of fucking buildings in Dubai and shit like what are you doing man yeah you posted one of those the other day he said something like you know I don't know how you wrote it but you said something like and I wasn't I was like I said if it's exactly that is jacked up there was one just a couple of days ago these guys released it they were on the Golden Gate Bridge I didn't even watch it you see Jamie I wouldn't even watch it they like Daredevils we're on the Golden Gate Bridge but you see them on the very top of the Golden Gate Bridge doing some silly shit hanging off the edge like yeah I did some dumb stuff when I was younger I did some rock climbing without ropes not not any Alex Honnold stuff but you know where I would definitely get injured if I fell that was just being young and stupid I remember one time we were I was on a ship out in the middle of the Navy ship out in the middle of the ocean somewhere I was in the seal platoon somewhere and me and one of my buddies we were doing pull-ups off the side of the ship at night on a little cable oh Jesus what's that cable breaks or if we slip off and fall you're a hundred percent gonna die but we were doing it anyways because we were just young and stupid Wow want to feel the juice yeah just the juice cream or you know there's no war going on how do we prove to our buddies that we are brave and badass you do stupid stuff dumb stuff hanging off the side of a ship on a cable 300 what does that rush like yeah it's got to be a crazy brush right you know one that you can't let go yeah it's just dumb no but what do you do when you're whatever 23 years old there's something that like particularly in the human brain there's something that resonates about hanging from something by your hand like that's one of the scariest ones like Kingston is on this gigantic crane and he's hanging on to the crane with his hands and then he does it with one hand he's hanging there and he's fucking hundreds of feet up and if he falls he's just splatter he's just the water balloon oh but there's something about for some reason like balancing scary but hanging is really scary I'm the opposite really balance is scarier than hanging I'd rather hang pretty good hang we got a good grip yeah I don't do a lot of tennis I don't feel good about the the balancing cuz I think you know I could trip and fall that's it what's the life expectancy of Kingston not so good I mean he knows that right yeah he's got to know that he's a smart guy too which is really weird and really calm okay look at these fucking assholes oh Jesus Christ my god this guy folks if you listening this guy has a skateboard and he is on a beam on I mean like what a couple thousand feet in the fucking air shit it's terrifying I mean how many of these guys died it's not that many that's what's weird about it I saw I saw a video one guy for a pin in oh they didn't make it where was it I don't know something somewhere in Russia of course what was he doing we're doing this walking around up on some high area oh Jesus Christ this kid is okay they get right to the edge with skateboard look their foot what the fuck dude yeah what does that work did you talk to him about how he how he built into this did he start at 20 feet and then he went to 30 feet and then he got more confident oh I don't think we just just didn't start feeling that gene well he's got the fisa smart guy he's a weird guy because you meet him you're expecting like I'm gonna talk to this meThe doubt psychopath who just just wants to just get a juice rush all day long no he's super calm and relaxed and normal it's weird doesn't make any sense where did it start for him I don't know yeah I don't know he's got a normal family seems healthy yeah I just likes it people are weird weird yeah nicely Alex all you had Alex ah yeah and you know we my family gokyo somebody and stuff so we are familiar but you can see how he kind of edged into it right now you start climbing and you got robes and then you get really good at it and you're like you know what I can probably make it to there without a rope and then next thing you know I probably make it there too and then the next thing you know you're climbing you know El Capitan with no rope or half tone with no rope which is completely Benny or somebody yeah completely insane to even think about that so he does some insane stuff where you're going backwards like here at a reverse degree you know like 15 degrees the wrong way yeah like any climbs up it to go above it and he's got no ropes and he's just hanging on with his hands it's like what the fuck dude yeah he was telling us a story about one time where he's halfway up the mountain he realized he forgot his powder yeah so he ran into some other people that were up there that were on ropes he said hey can I borrow your powder like uh you know me pounding like yeah borrow penny left the powder bag at the top of the mountain like yeah I heard him talking about it that he for him it's not a big deal because he knows how strong he is and he knows what his limitations are so it doesn't hurt it's like he's comfortable with it right he's comfortable like you know someone walking on a balance beam that does it all the time they're gonna be comfortable with it and he's climbing stuff all the time so he's more complex still hard to get a grip on though it's hard to get a grip you know when I was hosting Fear Factor we had this one thing that we did where we people had people hang from a pole that was suspended over this water and it was shocking how like the least the little amount of time the small amount of time that men in particular could hang from a pole like they were like a minute in these guys were dropping into the water and I was like what the fuck like women want it really yeah women want it because they have they have lighter bodies so even though their hands might be weaker like and one guy was fucking jack there's like this football player looking do it and he didn't make it man he was like a minute and 15 in plop it into the water I was like this is crazy yeah I had I had a guy in my my SEAL training class of was a big giant monster guy and he couldn't complete the obstacle course no you know two people in strength it's too much too much mass behind you that you're asking small limbs or small digits to control and then also too much of your heart is got to pump too much blood through that tissue there's like a point of diminishing returns when it comes to size yeah you know and that that's one of the things you saw when you see Cain Velasquez fight guys Cain Velasquez has always been in that sweet spot of about 240 240 to me is about as big as you want to get because the guys over 240 men they might fuck you up in the first few minutes but you take him into that fourth and fifth minute of the first round and they're huffing and puffing then the second round they're getting their asses kicked and the Cain Velasquez storm was that one of the more fascinating things to watch in all my years of the UFC because he was a heavyweight that had the cardio of a lightweight now but he was again 240 pounds a well-marbled well-marbled 240 dollars not like he was a lean no he had some he always looks a little bit need a lot of executes away yeah there's some rice and beans on is he can eat lunch with like for real like you like one of the elite heavyweights ever yeah and he's sitting there with fucking 10 tacos and shit and you know that's a talent too but the having that kind of sustained energy is a talent just like some guys are super flexible and some guys are super strong and explosive and some guys just have that they could they have that range and what is its medium twitch muscles right it's medium twitch flow to it yeah well know that it's not theirs slow twitch which is I'm a marathoner right and then there's fast twitch which is Amin Olympic weightlifter but in recent years they've said there's actually something in the middle twitch which is I'm strong but I can go for a long time that's interesting I didn't know about that but it makes sense and that's what a guy like Cain is cuz Cain like you said I mean for him to be able to get in there and go five rounds pushing away pushing around another guy that weighs 260 pounds yeah that's beast mode right there there's a lot going on with Cain I think one thing is going on is genetics he has incredible genetics and they they're like Bob cook would tell me that Cain would be out for months like get an injury and come back it's at work everybody I could just have insane cardio so maybe it's also that his base was so rock solid that his out of shape for three months is everybody else's you know peak condition and what's one of the reasons why I was able to overwhelm so many people but also like when you see Cain execute things he's restraining Leah Cain everything is perfect technique there's no like there's no like grunting and forcing anything there's no like crazy looks in his face and like windmill punches everything is clean and crisp and it's all like very efficient he's a machine and obviously that comes from training hard and is that training hard too hard has he been training too hard is that why he's all dinged up then yeah some fights because of injuries well there's also like the mind like his mind is so strong that he's able to overcome the feeling of pain but sometimes like elite athletes especially fighters they can't distinguish between what is just like dings like everybody gets dinged up but something that's a significant injury like hey you've got a compromise in the structure of your body if you keep pushing it you're going to blow this knee out you're going to fuck this disk up you're going to need surgery and he canes out a gang of surgeries now shoulder knees back and now you know he's been out for quite a while with this most recent back issue it sucks because in my opinion it's like him and phaidor you know those are the two greatest heavyweights of all time interestingly same similar body style yes I'm 30 to 40 well marbled yeah yeah fader phaidor at his peak had like the ultimate dad bod he had like a dad that used to play rugby you know like fuck guys they post those videos of him training in Russia runnin with his buddies and swinging kettlebells new yeah this guy works hard oh yeah no doubt he just probably ate shitty food yeah just any tons of it you know but it's also like their methodology is just different I mean he was like very very old-school with his methods like he was doing kettlebells but way before CrossFit first came to America I mean there was a there's an old school picture see if he could find Jamie back when he was jacked like he got smaller as his career went on because he stopped doing strength and conditioning as his body got older and focused more on skill work but there's this ancient picture not ancient but there's a picture of him standing there shirtless around a bunch of kettlebells kettlebells yeah ah sure 2001 or something like that you know yeah and the thing that I think that he really had was he had a good his skill in my mind was that he was really good grapplers a really good striker but he the way he mixed them together yeah you would see him just like hit somebody in the face and then the judo throw him in an arm lock emerge oakum it was all just so smooth I don't think anyone knew what to defend because if they defended one thing they were gay defended it a grappling move they're getting punched in the face if they defended a point they were getting taken down yeah he was something special man and you know he was something special for quite a long time too I don't I don't think anybody can keep going longer than like just like a time that you can compete at the highest level some folks think it's about eight nine years they like it and after eight nine years the highest level like nobody's body holds up yeah he just all falls apart and you know as much as I'm talking good about Fedor and his style and everything let's face it what was the best about Fedor was his attitude when he would just come in there with no emotions he's raised his hand dead face you know they'd introduce him he just raised his hand he'd destroy someone and he would have the same fresh face like before he fought you just had total absence of emotion that was to me that's what I always thought yes yeah that's when hazel was right up there at the top of my list yeah there's the picture just exact just Jack's standing around a bunch of fucking iron cannonballs with handles on them and those aren't some little kettle bells either yeah I bet that picture alone must have sold millions of dollars of kettlebells people saw that picture like I gotta get some man but he also was very smartness that's his brother actually yeah he was very smart with his training where you know he spent some time in Holland his brother like way back in the day a picture of his brother now get a picture of Alexander he just got out of jail yeah I don't I wonder if he's gonna fight again his brother was a bad motherfucker hey listen he was he's an animal he's got the there's something about Russians man for sure there are different kind of white people they totally different they just did so much different well it's the hard upbringing yo yeah diamonds diamonds made out of pressure and the other guy that comes to mind when we're thinking about fighters that really it wasn't just his skillset which was unbelievable Sakuraba because the way Sakuraba his craziness oh yeah and just did you go in there and just have that incredibly playful attitude also chain-smoked and drink through this entire camp chain smoked and drank I went out with him in Japan after one of his fights one time really what'd he do he was just getting after it but that attitude of not giving a fuck is like that's what worked so well for him inside the inside the ring yeah well I know we see this all the time with fighters we see with anybody that is going to live out on the fringe like that they're going to have some sort of offset there's there's another there's for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction right so you get a guy that's living that far on the edge like like Sakuraba was that edge just doesn't stop when he gets out of the cage right was going and gonna get after it more he had some horrible losses though oh he got he got you know used and exploited worse than anyone else right I mean worse than any other fighter no one has been exploited and put into those horrible fights where he just wasn't out and he was just outmatched it was old he wasn't trained right and they would just put him in there and just let him get destroyed well his knees were mangled so he would wrap his knees up like a mummy yeah yeah they were horrible and you knew that that was a real injury like he had like he could move so good his knees were all wrapped up and fucked up and then they put him in there with Wanderlei and Vandelay knocked him out what three times brutal brutal Kos I think at least twice I'm trying to think of his two or three times but um and then Melvin Manhoef ooh he was soccer kicking him cuz you could soccer kick and prod and stomp yeah he had some really tough fights he's apparently doing a grappling super fight now I think he's grappling he'd grappled benzo yeah but it was right that's right yeah I was thinking of you know what I was actually thinking of Shinya Aoki is going to grapple with Gary tonin oh yeah yeah they're gonna have a straight-up grappling yeah Gary kill fuck not most likely but Aoki's good man a year but it's a big difference between guys who are good in MMA and guys who are good at like straight up grandpa and in the training vids of Gary I just like pretties just training although all he does he's completely obsessed with jiu-jitsu I love it yeah and he's doing rope climbs and he's just that's all he does he was also being coached by John Danaher and he's a part of that hens Oh Gracie crew in New York City and that Danaher death squad man you want to talk about a would a real like wizard of jujitsu Danaher understand his Instagram posts are some of the very best Instagram posts on the Internet I haven't I got a following that oh you got a man his breakdowns of certain techniques and matches and what went well what went wrong what's required of athletes and and how to excel and the difference between an athlete and competition versus a difference in training this one as was most recent things about putting yourself at bad positions and working on your weaknesses as opposed to just continuing to push your strengths yeah well that's a big one that the fighters that are good in training but they're not good in their cage and there's other fighters that are there kind of get beat up and training but when you get in the cage they they rise to the occasion and I got to see that a bunch with a bunch of different fighters over the years that I trained with and you'd say this guy's going to do okay but then they'd get in the they'd get in the cage and boom they would just turn it on they elevate themselves and then some guys that are crushing everyone during training they get in the cage and you know UFC Fight Night or whatever and just they just can't they can't get it done that night even though they're crushing people in the training yeah there's so many factors right and I think some of them are also the ability to overcome adversity and with really talented guys they didn't really have to overcome that much adversity because they were good really quickly like guys who had massive physical advantages yeah and then for some reason you know once they faced other people that also have physical advantages but were tougher they would just go they'd just fall apart there's wilt yeah yeah it's so common yeah you got to get that in and and we got some guys at the jacket this guy at the gym right now who's just he's just a amazing mutant he's a mutant like he's so strong he I was it he shot on me the other day I sprawled on him and so he's on all fours and he's he fights at 185 I'm on all fours and he picks me up with one hand with one hand picks me up and slams me and gets a cross-eyed and I said bro did you just like shot put me right there and he's underneath once he walk around that he walks on a 200 205 you know to hit you up is one one hand but not with his back but like with his arm you're gonna see him Taylor Johnson watch out for Liz's background he wrestled he wrestled he's it but this is the thing we know we know this right there's wrestlers that are great wrestlers and they're and they're OK jujitsu but they can't quite make that transition and their striking is ok but they can't quite make that transition for whatever reason whatever gift he's got he it so the other day we were training and he's been training this was a few months ago he's been training for like 6 months right and he dives for a Kimura on me and I you know I move and get out and you know we keep training whatever and we get done he goes man you know I just I can't walk anything up on your educate I got can't I can't get any finishes on you and I was like bro you've been training for six months those guys have been training here for 10 years that have never even attempted a submission on me and you're trying to submit me with my own move the Chimaera and I'm like bro don't worry about it it's going to come so yeah it's it but my point is with him is he's an incredible athlete and he's got that work ethic - yeah so and he's competed a high level and wrestling you know he's an all-american wrestler I think d2 though but you know nonetheless he's savage yeah peep this the ability to compete it's a it's an interesting ability like some people just don't have it or they wore that it's not even that they don't have it they lack the mental skills to overcome pressure filled obstacles yeah and you're right and there's some people that step up when that happens yeah and can you train to do that I think you can I think you can I think you think used to it you inoculate yourself to the stress it's just the mind so like you like the idea that these pitfalls in the mind are insurmountable I think that's ridiculous that seems to be more scible or more more more passable than physical problems because like physical problems like if you're 140 pounds and a guy's 240 pounds gives you're both equally talented and both equally driven boy you're fucked they're kind of fucked yeah well that being said it is similar to what we talked about earlier which is when you have somebody that's caught in their own mind they can't get the perspective to step out yeah like you just calm down just it's not a freak out about yeah you're gonna go in there what if I lose if you lose it's no big deal we'll get around it will train more it's no big deal they can't get over that and so you do get people to get trapped in their minds and I mean there's all kinds of fighters that have gone through that never came out of it well there's a really important quote if you win you win if you lose you learn yeah and so you always win and if you really can think about it that way every time you know I remember pretty much every time I've ever been humiliated on the mat every time I've ever been really manhandled and tapped I remember them very well and I also remember like every time I rolled with like a real high level black belt got my ass handed to me my training jumped up a notch because like you know it's that expression the rub like you train with someone who's way better you know you realize like oh there's I'm whatever I thought was like a high frequency there's people that are operating like several hundred rpms faster than that and I just hadn't encountered them you know you know and I think that to be around that is so important if you ever train with a guy that like trains in a small town and all the people in the towns like maybe like purple belt and coaches and they they have like a there's a certain rpm that they all operate in and if you come in and you're use that fuck in San Diego Assassin rpm and they like well fuck is this guy doing like they're just not used to it they have or but if you come from a place like that and you try to train at Enzo's or something like that like you're dealing you jumping into a fucking pit of killers like and that's you know that old expression iron sharpens iron it could not be more true when it comes to Jiu Jitsu ya know there's no doubt the better people you train with the better you're going to get and you got to seek those people out you know yeah I'm gonna not mind hey that guy Taylor that I'm talking about dude do I like get my ass kicked by a guy that's been training for six months no I hate it I hate it Taylor but guess what I call him out every time you know and I talk smack to him I don't talk a bunch of smack I talked back to him I'm like hey what's up young buck you want to come get some of this every day because I want to train with him cuz he's that strong course I'm training with Dean I'm training with Jeffy Glover I trained with those guys too but got the young buck that growth wants to get after it a little bit more yeah well also there's something about freak wrestling strength that's just it doesn't make any sense a guy I've rolled with some wrestlers before I'm like okay whatever you are this there's there's people and then like it's like a chimp people you like a chimp person you know if they have like when your body is used to from the time you're an early kid throwing bodies around like your tendon strength and your your ability to manipulate bodies it's a very different kind of strength I mean it might not translate to a 40-yard dash or or Sprint's or you know lifting weights but there's a their physical ability to move bodies is very unusual yeah and they're them you always have to be careful too because there's been plenty of wrestlers along the way that don't do well in MMA oh yeah for sure just they're great they're strong but I think that's a mental thing I think they have like some limited factor in their brain where they go they just can't quite open their mind to jiu-jitsu they can't quite open their mind to striking they can't get out of that wrestler mentality of you know this I have to go as hard as I can right now because in anime you can't go as hard as you can try out for the whole time you will run out of gas especially with striking if you're if you're boxing and sparring with people and you think you're just going to go in and do that you're going to run into someone who actually knows how to box you're going to come home with headaches every night you're going to get very discouraged yeah it's a matter of who you're training with to look as far as your trainers like who's who's coaching you and what methodology are they using and what what mindset are they trying to impart on you as far as like skill development because there's so many people out there that just don't have like a real clear philosophy like they don't have a goal like in terms of like I want to work on footwork and avoiding certain shots and being able to move in better you know instead they're just trying to win every round or they're trying to you know push hard and then do you not get to the next level which in my mind when we get past the athleticism we get past the mental overcoming of challenges and then in my opinion you get to the next level which is creativity yeah and that's when you get to Gregor right Jonny bones Jones they're doing things that they're kind of making up yeah and they're making up live as they go and I think that to me is is you know we kind of I think we saw with BJ Penn back in the day he was creative I think phaidor did it where he was he was doing creative things but I think to me that's that's where you go that one level higher is when you add the creative element to a guy that can take a and B and make F out of those things somehow yeah and and when you watch those guys there's something about watching a Jon Jones or a fade or a primetime BJ Penn it elevates you if you watch someone do something special like that and you just walk out of there you feel like I know I can run faster than I could before I saw that fight I know I could I could lift more weights I know I could do something better just people well I think this is a huge thing that one of the reasons why people enjoy watching all kinds of sports but in particular combat sports when people do something amazing it makes you feel like amazing things are possible yeah I actually I have limitations on that too because personally I'll watch somebody you know some random fighter or whatever and I'll say like I could probably do that you know I mean like I could do that that's a good fighter but I could yeah I'm gonna judge it so I'm pretty good striker I could do that and then occasionally I see a guy and I go no you know what I could not do what that guy can do it just makes me it's humbling I think it's humbling I was want you know jack black write the short Jack Black I was watching Jack Black the other day and you know I look at Jack Black I look at some I look at some actor right I look at Brad Pitt and I go what's what's Brad Pitt do and I could do what he's doing he's talking on the movie screen whatever I know I'm under estimating this right but that's what I'm think I'm like you know I could do that but I was watching Jack Black and Jack Black was singing and I was like I can't do it Jack Black's doing right there respect and crossed the bow homeboys got pipes right got pipes and I look at the same time I look at you know at Jonny bones Jones and I go I wouldn't have done what he just did I look at G a tad McGregor I go you know what he's got he's got some little spark that I don't have he's got a flare yeah yeah there's a flare that McGregor has it's half of what he does I mean he's unbelievably talented he's got ridiculous power but there's also this Flair about him when he fucking walks in there playing in his arms and then he stands there and part of his opponent and goes like that there's something about him the the fucking audaciousness yeah of his you know he's just so ridiculous but it really impressed me when he came back and beat Nate bad fucking really important I thought it was a very close fight I actually and I'll have to watch again I usually don't watch fights more than once but I know it was very very close Nate could have won that fight yeah I decision for me yeah I thought so too but it didn't and even just as close as it was I was impressed and I was I think one of the most impressive feats I've seen as far as that mental game we're talking about to come back and say you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do it this time daddy even wanted to come back yeah yeah 170 again he aims at 170 at the second West is awash it's impressive it was very impressive you know a lot of people don't know that he had a pretty bad staph infection just a few weeks before the first fight and he was on some serious antibiotics and that's one of the reasons why he was so drained like people like all you cast out like if you've never taken antibiotics before you don't know how fucking horrible it is on your gas tank it's one of the it's a weirdest thing ever so you could be in great shape you get on a run of antibiotics and your body's just you got a fucking thimble gas tank there's nothing left you got no energy for whatever reason you just can't push yourself through stuff and I think that played a factor in that fight and here's the thing about McGregor you never heard a fucking peep about it yeah if it wasn't for me talking about it most people wouldn't even know yeah yeah yeah he's a bad motherfucker and I don't know I don't mean they said he signed the floyd mayweather deal oh really yep he's signed when did that happen it did happen yesterday he has signed Floyd Mayweather has not signed they're negotiating to kill Madison yep pure boxing yeah excels I think like people look I mean maybe he's gonna go full Bernard Hopkins just fucking clinch and hit him in the clinch and tie him up and rough him up and maybe that's the plan lean on his neck you know just put fight dirty let him take points away it gives a shit long as you get disqualified don't like stand the ring and try to fucking shuck and jive with them but the other thing is Floyd's not knocking a lot of people out yeah you know it's a good fight in terms of like to see what the fuck yeah how much money is that gonna make he's gonna make a fuck ton of money he's gonna make the heap estimated I don't know if it's true between 75 and a hundred million dollars yeah do it all and then who knows how much Floyd's going to make somewhere in that range to maybe more probably more but I think that it's going to be interesting first of all Floyd's 40 almost 41 Floyd's may be the best defensive boxers ever walked the face of the planet I mean he's right up there and my I mean you go back to Willy Pappa a lot of the guys from the old days and for sure lomachenko today but in terms of like overall performance against elite fighters over the course of his career the guy's only been tagged hard like five or six times ever yeah he's a fuckin freak and hard work I mean he's a you look at him he's throwing money around driving Bentley's but that fucking guy will get on the strip and he'll be running miles at 3 o'clock in the morning he opens up his gym 3 o'clock in the morning just does 15 rounds of the back just he works hard me I don't know if he works that hard anymore yeah that'll be an interesting one fuck yeah I watch it I hope it goes down look he might get his Nick kind of might get his ass handed to him but he might not yeah you know he might tag Floyd I mean if he can Conor is very good at closing distance and snapping off like lead shots like that's one of the things that he did with Nate and he's a southpaw if he can just snap off one or two clean shots and make it interesting it'll be fun know if he can I don't I don't know what he can do straight box it's so hard to judge come on to judge without without knowing without seeing and if they do do it I think they're gonna do it somewhere around September I think that's the idea Jesus Christ so what's he doing with UFC until then nothing nothing so the lightweight division is on hostage right now they're being held hostage interim something or they were supposed to do that but fucking Habib nurmagomedov got sick trying to make the weight and didn't make the way what happened there Tony Ferguson and Habib were supposed to fight Habib's livers shut down yeah he's cutting too much weight these guys they get too fucking big you know they get up to 190 and they try to get down to 155 and he couldn't make it was he walking around at 190 I don't know that's what I heard I don't know what he really weighed but he's a bad motherfucker yeah for sure Habib's grappling is so super high level I want to I wanted to see that fight so bad because Tony Ferguson is a fucking savage he's a straight and savage so him versus Habib like I watched that fight with him and Edson Barboza again the other day crazy fucking wild bloodbath until Tony caught him with the dars yeah was a fucking amazing fight that's the guy I want to see fight a guy who's one of the only guys undefeated at the top level of the game which is Habib he's the only God it's like a top contender that's undefeated and it smashed everybody in front of how much longer until he can fight again who knows if he'll ever be able to make 155 again who knows who knows what kind of damage he's done to his body and he's rabid rapid horrible weight cuts I don't know man I don't I don't know his medical history his medical history or his medical issues but I know before the michael johnson fight apparently had a similar problem he made the weight but apparently was real touch-and-go yeah can't do that no you got to cut your calories get cut I mean you want to suffer cut your calories back do a lot of fucking running drop some body weight you're going to have to and it can be done it can be done you're going to have to do it because this rapid dehydration you're gonna fucking die someone's going to die in the UFC's just past some new weight cutting rules and new weight classes like this is from Andy Foster Andy Foster's the guy who runs California State Athletic Commission and he is such a fucking animal Annie Foster is one of the most important guys in terms of like Commission the guys who run commissions in MMA he's like one of the most proactive one of the most knowledgeable and one of the very best maybe the best he's so on the ball and so he's pushed hard for these new weight classes and these new weight cutting regulations and such a fucking smart thing guys that guy's awesome man I like the 225 weight class yeah even the 195 weight classes 10 they should skip 70 and do 10 every every you know like do 25 35 45 55 65 just go 10 every 10 is good 10 makes sense when you don't like 70 and then you got 85 they get 85 and 205 that's too many that's too many pounds what was I mean GSP versus were the new GSP versus Bisping yeah you I've tried to explain this to people as I've been in the room and stood next to those guys Bisbing is a big big big man yes and GSP is a normal-sized guy I don't see how that fight was going to be fair you know also Bisping is currently active GSB took years off this Bing is capable of fighting in 55 he says the best being said he can make 55 Wow yeah so if he wins at 180 185 he has thought about fighting either at 170 or at 155 like what the fuck these are big dudes strong I've trained with him he's a big strong he's what six to something like that is ping yeah yeah he's tall yes big he's got incredible cardio that for sure he's a hard worker yeah yeah that guy is a perfect example of just like the ultimate like Bulldog mindset and just refusing and now look at mr. Chan yeah and he took that fight on what a weeks notice two weeks notice against rock hold when the Jinja not even that I think it was a few days I think it was like 11 days notice it's rock raised you know just being pissed talking shit Dana White on Twitter because he was mad at GSP got a title shot he hasn't heard a title shot yet he's like what the fuck - GSB do ah man the whole the whole weight class is in a flux there's a funny meme of because Bisping said that his knees hurt because they said that the UFC said they want him to fight ul Romero because the GSP fight is off and he's like well actually my knees hurt so I can wait for GSP it's like I can't really train right now I'm good I'm just gonna sit back and take a little break so this is a funny meme of GSP or of Michael Bisping in the hospital bed that says a Bisping be like I'll just sit here and wait for GSP that's harsh yeah Yosef Savage is terrifying but that really bummed me out when Tim Kennedy lost him well that was cheating yeah that shouldn't happen it was cheating and that that was horrible Tim did a little bit of cheating in that fight too what'd he do he grabbed his gloves he's grabbed inside of his glove punched him in the face couple times while he's holding uol's glove but dude but people show that in slow-motion but what they don't understand is you're showing slow motion like it looks like he's holding on to it for a while and punching in real life it was less than a second or maybe a second and it's probably just chaos yeah something is just throwing shit whether or not he actually knew that he had his glove consciously the gloves make a really big difference huge grappling yeah you got a train with them if you're gonna fight with them you know secure and chokes I mean even Demian Maia you see him get rear naked choke swith the hand on top of the head like old-school Ken Shamrock style I killed Hill because he can't get the hand back there you just can't get it yeah and you people start grabbing if you get a guillotine people are grabbing the inside of that glove it's hard it's a lot harder to finish yeah people have gloves on well some people finish with it Josh Thompson used to grab his own glove which you can do you could get deep in there I saw him choke somebody out with that I was like whoo you can do that I think you can grab your own glove yeah and that makes a nice handle if you can slip your fingers in to train with them if you're gonna fight with them yeah oh it's amazing how hard it is to choke people when you have those especially those pride gloves of big padded ones mmm even marcelo garcia it was having a really hard time with it when he had his one lone MMA fight yeah he had this dudes back and he couldn't finish them and a lot of it is because of those doesn't make a big difference they really do I don't think you should wear gloves I really don't I totally agree with you I think fighting if you could kick something in the shin to the face like you can shin somebody in the face we can knock a woman yeah I think it would be so helpful for all the head trauma that's happening if they took off the gloves and oh yeah and you add to either strike with an open palm or you had to pay the price because I might hit you twice before I broke my hand and now I'm going to be grappling with you and trying to take you down I don't think people understand that that if someone just ducks their head down and you hit them with a straight punch to the forehead you are very likely to break a hand I don't think you should be able to wrap your hands either yeah I really don't I would be awesome that we should have I think you should have a cop on and a mouthpiece and shorts yeah and I really think that's it I mean and people like I you're fucking idiot you're barbarian they need to cover the globe no they don't you know you're less of a barbarian you make yourself you make yourself more able to hit someone and you don't really help them at all like it's harder to hit someone bare-knuckle yeah it's it's more realistic that's it's it's it I wish they would make that change I wish that would change everything come you can elbow somebody but you can't bare knuckle that's crazy your knuckles are way more vulnerable yeah like it's way harder to get that off until you wrap it up then you make it like a cast you wrap it up and you get some you like a nice stiff wrist round where your rips wrist isn't going anywhere nowhere up buckling and flexing when you punch someone it's hardcore when they wrap up those hands boy like even like holding pads for guys when we're backstage getting ready think they're did they just turn it up yeah yeah but they'll never make that change I don't say I don't think she should and I think for really for the head trauma of the people that are fighting is that that's who really needs it for sure in the head all those times you know it's not good for you know it's not good for you and again that goes back to the grappling thing I think we see more submissions I think it would be way easier to catch people with stuff like it'd be way easier to secure guillotines and chokes it's just you you you wouldn't have all these restrictions of having something on your hands your hands need to be able to articulate move to secure certain grips and you get it's you'd see a lot more submissions I think yeah it's too bad they don't make that change it'd be better for everyone yeah I mean I remember when I first started working for the UFC you didn't have to wear gloves Vitor was one of the first guys to wear Vitor and tank tank was one of the first guys ever to wear gloves and he wore those gloves that he was wearing were like old-school century martial arts Chuck Norris gloves like nobody had even thought to wear those I think tank was like the innovator that tank was an innovator for sure then Vitor innovated his head yeah but pop pop pop pop pop pop yeah man Vitor in the early days I was there his first fight in 1997 the first time UFC 12 nobody had seen anything like that yeah this guy comes in with his blazing hand speed built like a fucking Greek god and everybody's like oh Jesus what do you do with this fucking kid yeah that was AI was interesting and of course have we all heard because I was you know jujitsu guy at that time we were like oh he's only a purple belt is what we were hearing and they gave him his black belt just because he's doing this flight and blah blah blah he's a purple belt and he comes out just what is it thirteen punches to the face bump up pop and they needed the same thing to Vandelay pop pop pop pop up yes straight punches down the pipe crazy yeah when he fought vandal he was wearing shoes remember that there's wearing like wrestling shoes there's all these wacky rules back then it's really interesting to see like from 1993 to 2017 how far fighting has changed how much we know about it now yeah I always say that fighting in 1992 was theoretical and we did you know some somebody will say something me on the internet like hey you know what about this martial art or whatever and I'm like what do you think of this I'm like god there's no reason to theorize not only do we know from the UFC we also have been and now a country at war for whatever 15 years so all of our guys been going overseas and doing the same stuff on in combat so we know what works is know there's a big question anymore right not like oh I wonder what happens if you poke a guy in the eye no we know what happens we know what happens yeah it's pretty obvious it's not good here's another thing like like Wing Chun and things like that like yeah that'll work if you guys know what the fuck he's doing and you chain punch I'm don't yeah that's not good hit somebody 17 times in the head yeah we're not expecting they didn't ever trained before definitely not good very effective are you gonna get that off on someone who actually knows what they're doing oh no ma'am gonna get that off on a high school wrestler good luck good a double-leg was like you're going flying your head on the curb yeah it just it just seems to me that like did you see that video that is becoming a huge issue in China is that a Chinese Tai Chi master tried to fight an MMA fighter and just got obliterated in ten seconds oh and this guy's had to hide this Chinese MMA fighters had to go into hiding because people are offended that he battered this Tai Chi master and made their country look bad yeah because it's making their their traditional martial art look ineffective yeah that's not that doesn't make sense to me here we can watch this real quick but I don't know why the fuck this guy didn't understand what was going to happen with the THAAD they sometimes I think they actually believe what they're saying this is so brutal though this Tai Chi guy what's really bizarre is Tai Chi's not really made a physical fighting martial art it's supposed to be something that's more of like a meditative it's like a yoga it's like a yoga deal it's supposed to be grateful I had one of my one of my buddies black belt guy named Jeff Higgs old-school jujitsu guy and he got told by a tai chi guy you know you can't take me down Oh God and my buddy see that yeah I mean that guy just got obliterated yeah and the only way you can ever actually know what would happen if someone punches you in the face is to train that way if you just have these ideas in your head you're gonna stand in front of them this guy's just oozing blood all over the place and getting up he's battered his nose is shattered wobbly I guess my first time he's ever been punched maybe the MMA guy should have if he had a little bit more foresight on what's gonna happen he should have come out and like really done the whole you know respect and then the bow and then all this stuff and then after defeating him should have helped him it maybe that would have helped him from a from a political standpoint hmm but yeah because wonder yeah but you know it seems to me that this is something that they need to see they really do because there's too many people out there that are just buying into this foolish shit well like I said so my buddy Jeff Hicks got this up this I think was an Aikido guy does Aikido people say Chi and all that I don't know I kept chi they probably do well depends on which asshole you're talking whether whether it was Aikido or whether it was Tai Chi I forget but the guy says you know hey I'm a martial artist and once I settle my Chi you can't even take me down so how are you gonna do jujitsu on me and he says what do you mean you can settle your chases you know I once I Center my Chi and it's based into the ground you won't be able to move me you can try it if you want and my friend Higgs goes uh okay cool tell me when your cheese all centered and the guy you know does his little thing and then settles his Chi and he says okay I'm ready and Jeff just did I mean it's no big deal just hit a double leg on boom you know you can't stop a double leg without defending it without falling and yeah so so again say the guy actually believed that the guy actually believed that that's a type of mental illness it is but I mean you know it's flat earth right it's the same I don't want to bring that up right now it comes from so off this podcast I've got a couple people that are you know now every time I talk about jujitsu at all they're like Flat Earth Flat Earth they believe it yeah yeah people believe it I get fucking shit every day from people that are flat earth supporters that are mad at me for disposing they just want to believe it that's real it is a weird thing with and by the way one of the main guys who send to flat earth makes it has a whole video about how jujitsu doesn't work and it's about Wing Chun isn't it like one of his biggest videos on his page yeah hilarious but there is something about people wanting to believe that there's mysteries and secrets that there's like some secret power yeah like in that you know the idea that you could just center yourself and a college wrestler can't take you down yeah that's one of my new things that I tell people with you Jitsu because I used to say like Jiu Jitsu is magic cuz cuz it kind of is you know when you know Jiu Jitsu you can do things that are almost magic right but then when you're teaching somebody for the first time almost like look it's not magic it's you know I've always shown somebody the other day of you know elbow escape or something from the mount and the guys like a you know he's it's really hard to do cuz he keeps pulling my arm away you know yeah it's a fight you're in yeah it's not magic it's you have to fight against the other person's another human I just told him what to do and I told you what to do now you gotta fight for it yeah you got to figure out how to get to the right position yeah it's not magic but it is weird the people they know they're they're looking for something to believe in I guess yeah and maybe they just want a contrary and viewpoints so that's why they pick saying that the earth is flat well I also think it's it's sort of the same thing of people wanting sure if I'm going down this road right now I just want to walk away the end of podcast about people a lot of shortcuts they love like she like they love like throwing out other the entire paradigm of modern civilization it's all based on a lie we're not on a globe we're on a flat disk do you ever spins around us like this maybe you know people that just like to argue is this maybe just people that like to argue another country I could be some of them for sure that could be some of them for some of them I think it's just the same they're people that straight up just straight up believe that the earth is 100% 100% in their soul oh your soul yeah yeah yeah they really believe it but there's also people to join the Moonies you know it's people join silent Scientology yeah I mean look there's people out there that'll suck a dick if they think it'll make them live forever they pretty sure I soak your dick on my live forever yes the knowledge will flow through you but you have to believe like yeah one down in San Diego I don't know what it was ten years ago 15 years ago they had that Heaven's Gate thing we're almost had on those purple shoes he put on the purple Nikes yeah they kill themselves in the comet was flying by yeah and it shows you again you know now we're you're talking about the human mind it's just so complicated and complex that it's grasping for something to believe in and some people aren't gonna believe in anything yeah well you know it's one of the things that Guy Ritchie brought up the other day about your book extreme ownership and it's one thing that I think a you and I are both really focused on is the way the brain works and the way the mind works and this is one of the things that I think that you reinforce with these big photos of your watch every day it's like the mind works in very peculiar ways and you can it's kind of pliable and you could force it into positive productive ways you can you can you can express yourself in these very positive product ways and in ink and carve those grooves of productivity and of advancement well it's what you're talking about it we just talked about the Moonies in the scientology where people are trying to do mind-control and when i talk about mind control i'm talking about control your own mind yeah you know you can make yourself exactly what you're just saying you can make yourself and force yourself to do things and once you get in that groove and get in that habit it becomes part of you and that becomes who you are and why not be that person then the other person that's not doing positive things you have a people like people like to also pretend that the way they're doing it is the right way they don't want to be open to the idea that there's some other method that's maybe more productive or more successful well there's the downfall I mean and that's that you know again I think this is one of the reasons why your show is so popular and why people listen to you because you you listen to other people right people listen to you because you listen to other people you listen to what they have to say you go okay that's an interesting viewpoint haven't heard that before and you I'm the same way when somebody tells me hey this is what I believe I don't say well I don't believe that I believe something else I go that's interesting that's an interesting viewpoint yeah I always want to try to see things from other people's perspective and it's hard because the brain wants to go fuck this guy this guy is no shit you you're you're right dude this guy's wrong but you you always got it like pause and think I mean again I hate to bring this back up but that could easily be what's also going on with the Flat Earth thing is they have this idea in their head and then someone you know there's no photos of the earth other than composites if there really was of around Earth you'd be able to see a hole in the OL actually there's a photo taken every 10 minutes from 22,000 miles away of the fourth oh well that's not true that's fake and they get into this thing and they get into this thing because they don't want to ever stop and pause and look at the way they're thinking versus the way other people are thinking okay did I get myself in a fucking a trap here that I get myself into an intellectual trap where I'm supporting an idea that's not true and now I'm reinforcing that in my head and I'm fucking I'm tightening up all my borders and trying to figure out a way to not let new ideas in and to to reinforce my old ideas you know your podcast with Jordan Peterson the other day he kind of brought that up which I think by the way if anyone hasn't listened that podcast that's that's got to be one of the best podcasts that I've ever heard he's a mind-blower unbelievable podcast and he's talking about the fact that sometimes people if they if they accept those new ideas all of a sudden what they've done with their life for the past twenty years gets thrown out the window yeah and that's got to be really hard and immediately when I was listening to that I was thinking to myself yeah that's that's what happened in the 90s when somebody that had been studying some traditional martial art god bless them they were doing the best they could but when all of a sudden some blue belt in jujitsu could come in there and roll him up and choke him out and there was nothing they could do about it and they either had to do one of two things say okay I'm gonna start training this other new thing that I understand or block it out which was very hard to do with jujitsu I mean that's the good thing about MMA and about UFC is it was like uh you can deny it all you want but you have to face this guy on the mat that's the only way you can and when you do that you're gonna lose whereas with all these kind of intellectual arguments a lot of times it's just I say you say I say you say and if you tell me you know if I'm telling you that every picture of the earth is whatever CGI and that's what I'm gonna hold and I'm not gonna let it go and how are you gonna prove to me otherwise in every single picture you show me I say no that CGI and you show me another picture and I say no that CGI we're never going to get anywhere yeah I'm not arguing with you about it you're never gonna tap he's gonna just gonna turtle up at a ball I had to go through three of those man I cuz I started out with Taekwondo which was it's not like the it's not a good martial art for fighting it's got a by itself it's got too many holes in it but it's a great martial art for throwing kicks and when I went from that to kickboxing I realized how easy it was to get punched in the face and I was like wow and so then I started really studying boxing and I was like man my my ideas of like how well I can fight are so overestimated I'm not nearly as if I'm a good at Taekwondo I'm not good at fighting and then I started doing my time I'm like oh well fucking leg kicks Jesus Christ leg kicks and knees to the body and the coin shows like oh fuck there's so much I can I'm so fucked now because I got I got really good at something that kind of sucks on its own yeah and then from there jiu-jitsu where I was just getting raped I was like at least with kickboxing I could throw kicks I could move around I could try not to get my legs kicked I could try to like to be more mobile but when I was going into jujitsu as a white belt I was just getting fucking malls what happens and I had accept it and then so I literally stopped doing everything else and they said I've got to get better at this what a whack and you can't even start like white but some of us never change it's before is it has a zero percent chance of beating a guy that's a black belt yes zero like 0% chance a kick I'm not going to if you take somebody that doesn't really know how to fight against a boxer there there is a puncher's chance I mean there's a puncher she's not probably not going to happen but it's a crazy chance but you know it could and at least the person that hasn't boxed before has some semblance of an idea of what to do right lock the punches from hitting me and try and punch the other guy right when you don't know jujitsu you don't even understand what's happening you're completely lost yeah and there's certain positions like you get your back taken or something like that where you're almost a hundred percent dead yeah it's but I think that there's parallels to that in life because if you look at life and you look at the way you're behaving and the way you're thinking and the way you choose to accept ideas and the way that you choose to view the world if you're so rigid in your ideology that you're unwilling to accept any sort of new information and new data or any sort of contrary data or information like someone who's telling you something that you don't agree with but you're going okay well alright well what's your perspective instead of just agree or disagree with them and arguing and going to war with them try to take it in try to go okay well what is this guy saying that has merit where's this guy coming from or if I even if I totally disagree with them what what makes him think this like we're what's going on in your head that you think that we should take everyone's money and distribute it equally across the country like there's people to believe that yeah that everyone who's ever been successful somehow another god if you're stealing and then what we need to do is take all the money in the country and redistribute all this wealth so everybody gets $50,000 okay all right why do you think this close yeah I want to know you know I'm not I might argue with it or I might see your point or I might think that if you did do this but you still if you did this right now this is what I think if you did this right now if you took all the money from all the billionaires and all these fucking rich tycoons all of them and took all their money and distributed equally amongst everybody in the country how long would it take if you just allowed normal capitalism to flourish after that how long would it take before the levels went right back to where they are yeah would it be ten years would it be 20 how long would it be long the way I explain that concept to my children was I said okay here's here's what communism is because this is what you're talking yeah I said let's my kids are really hard workers and they do well in school and I said you know you study hard for your tests right let's say you get a 90 95 on your test and then what happens with communism is there's another kid in your class who's the dumbest kid Billy okay Billy's getting up whatever a third yeah so what we're going to do is you're going to take the test and then we're going to take whatever points from you and given to Billy so that you both get a D and that's what we're going to do now that's what communism is now if I do that is that going to inspire you to work any harder the answer is obviously no you know you're going to get a D no matter what is it can inspire Billy to work any harder the answer is no it is not Billy's not going to work any harder so what we have is no one working and that's what happens in communism you're you're all just level set you're all going to get the same thing and that's why it's failed everywhere it's tried yeah it's not the right idea for just the way the human reward system works it's not the right idea for motivation it's on a ride right idea for like the only way things get done the only way you get a laptop or a big skyscraper someone else a profit from it yeah they have to get something out and by the way someone has to make that happen someone has to be driven to want to that laptop and to walk that skyscraper somebody's got to want to make that and you're right for them to want it there's got to be some reward there's got to be some moral being driven is you got to have something to show for it so we got to be really careful that the amount of you know wealth that you spread around if you spread it all around you're going to know no one wanting to achieve anything yeah like I hear Bernie Sanders talk and he seems like a really nice guy and he seems like he really has his mind in the right place and his heart in the right place and this idea of democratic socialism seem talking to people I'm like well that's definitely better than being greedy it's definitely better than being corrupted by the banks it's definitely better than being corrupted by Wall Street and given these bullshit phony speeches for hundreds of thousand dollars and fucking over people for profit but does that shit but the socialism really work doesn't seem to work it doesn't seem to like work in terms of like motivation she doesn't even work for Bernie Sanders who has multiple homes he does I mean the guy's got multiples he just bought our house for you know eight hundred thousand dollars and what does he open that up to the public to come and stay in his house no no of course not so it's all that's different talking about a different thing I've learned this money serving the people yeah it exactly exactly right you did in that money and if you want to go on by that second home on a lake yeah good good for you Bernie yeah but don't try and you know make it like that's like like that's okay to take everyone else's money they will do to everybody else but not to me yeah it doesn't work well the concept of income inequality is always strange because it's like well okay but you should you make the same amount of money for a job that doesn't have the same amount of important significant let's just go ahead and straight-up answer for yeah retail no shouldn't if if you got paid after ten years of medical school the same that you got paid to drive a bus after you busted your ass and worked hard and had to study and do all the stuff to go to medical school and by the way you built up a bunch of debt trying to go to school hey why wouldn't you become a bus driver Oh your motivation should be financial your motivation should we hope we be here yeah I don't you you gotta be we we have to be careful that and and of course I there are people that legitimately need help in the West there's people with with disabilities there's people with mental problems and we've got to be compassionate and take care of those people to the best of our ability but we definitely watch out for hey let's steal everything from the people that worked hard and give it to people that didn't yeah just doesn't seem like a good idea it seems contrary to what we know about human motivation basic human instincts yeah and then where do you stop yeah where do you stop legitimately like worldwide because we could distribute all the money and wealth that we've built an American distributed over the whole world well I think a better concept is figuring out why there are pockets of extreme poverty and how to mitigate those pockets of poverty that have just I mean generation after generation certain neighborhoods has just been extreme poverty and these people that grow up there that's what they know they're sort of almost programmed into it because they're they're seeing it around them that is the the paradigm that they accept and it's very self-limiting in a lot of ways we don't see anybody escape or you see very few people escape it's very you feel like you know resistance is futile like what do you do you know there's a there's a I wish I knew that all the details of this but there was a Native American tribe and somebody I'm sure will tell me what it is but there was a Native American tribe like in Northern California that when all the Native American tribes got designated as Native American tribes and they got you know here's what you're going to get and this is your tribe and this is these guys for whatever reason they didn't get it they didn't get designated as a Native American tribe they just got they got passed over no one noticed them and now all the members that tribe like completely dominate they've run everything financially they own everything up there they kind of kicked ass right and it's because they had to and I think a lot of times when when people just get given stuff it becomes very very difficult for them to say you know what I'm going to go out and work hard you know am I going to bus it's a classic example of hey am I going to bust my ass at McDonald's for 8 bucks an hour 40 hours a week or whatever 30 hours a week for 9 bucks an hour I'm going to work that hard doing that or am I just going to take my welfare check which is equal to or almost equal to for sitting around doing nothing yeah that's not a hard question to answer for many many people yeah I'm going to sit around and do nothing so we had to be careful that it's hard yeah it is hard it's it is a natural inclination that people have to do the least amount to just be as comfortable as possible or as lazy as possible you know I think your your statement that you always say discipline equals freedom people should have that shit tattooed on their thigh you know you should look at that when you get up in the morning you put your underwear on like it's that shit is it's so important because if you do have discipline and if you do go out there and get the things done that you need to get done you have freedom and you feel better and you feel relaxed because you're not you don't have that balloon hovering over you that balloon of you know look you know just knowing that you're not doing your best knowing that you're not out there hustling and if you just get a free check every month and you don't really have to go out there and kick ass you can kind of get by boy that doesn't it's not it's not conducive to lighting that fire under your ass you need to be successful yeah and again I'm going to point this out for I think the second or third time today I'm no sociologist I don't I'm not some big guy that understands the mechanisms of the welfare state and all that I'm just going off of what what I think which is similar what you're saying look if I was just getting a check for not doing anything I wouldn't feel good about it yeah you know I wouldn't feel good about it and so I I think that there are people that go hey if I can get free money I'm going to take the free money you know there is a concept of universal basic income that's kind of interesting though because this idea is that once we get automation and once we get artificial intelligence that there's going to be so many jobs that don't exist anymore that we got to figure out what to do with all these people and the idea is if you just have your basic needs taken care of like not enough so that you could actually thrive but just we have food and shelter how many people would then pursue their actual love and what they're actually passionate about and would it be to say there's there's tests they're doing they're doing on it now they're trying to find out would the same amount of people be successful would more be successful or would less like how many people would pursue their dream if they knew they didn't have to worry about starving to death they just got money every month they got they knew where they were going to sleep and eat and then they could just go and do whatever the fuck they want to do or would that just squash motivation I don't know I don't know what the answer is yeah I'd say what I think I think it I think it squashes motivation for some Hank you with it for you if you got a check every month for like 12 grand or 12 grand for the year whatever it is like I think that's the idea so you give people like a thousand bucks a year or a thousand bucks a month thousand bucks a month yeah maybe double that just enough that you could just get by but you know you're not boiling to questions number one of course would I take free money sure would I feel good about it No number two where does that money come from right where does it come from cuz that's the thing that I also explain to my kids is that you know every time you every time the government gives a dollar to somebody they took that dollar from somebody else yeah oh and it's you know it's that's the reality of it yeah then the question is like where it like when a guy like Bernie Madoff or some crazy Wall Street character when they just move some money around and make money like okay how much you getting out of that yeah where's that coming from who's whose money was that like where's that go where's that going and has it how does it exist well Bernie's a bad example right because he was stealing everyone's or the best example well okay yeah I'll give you that yeah yeah but again those people are formulating companies and funding companies that are trying to grow and build and create things you know that that money it moves somewhere and it ends up you know investing in a company and building a company that's what that's what that's what America is right now trying to build things trying to make things yeah taking risk I wonder what is going to happen though when all these fucking robots well I think John is the automatic driving cars trucks because that's a huge you know you go to Vegas I always think about this when I'm in Vegas you go to the buffet and there's like top ten billion pounds of food none of that food comes from Vegas it all gets trucked in there so at some point all those trucks can be driven by robots and that's not too far in the future at all I think they're already doing in Australia they have automated trucks in Australia that are driving you know shipping things around it's going to get weird it's gonna get real weird between that and genetic engineering and all these different things that we've been talking about this can get really weird and I think again going back to the original conversation we started off with today I think the weirder gets in the further we get away from primal sort of existence of hunting down food and fighting against other tribes I think the further we get away from that the more we're going to have to reach back to it and ground ourselves to it well at the very least the more you're going to have to deal with whatever requirements your body and your mind have for difficulty I think we have requirements for struggle and difficulty because I think your body is set up to extinction expectations for difficulty and when you don't uncover those orcs encounter those expectations I think people find like a real lack of meaning and stress in this lack of stress in a piece and that's why we're gonna have to reach back yeah to this physicality mm-hmm at some point it's not just physicality or like you're saying it's mental struggle too it's trying to achieve things it's trying to win it's trying to be competitive if I'm just sitting there and I don't have a job anymore and I just get you know twelve thousand bucks a month and that's enough for me to pay my food and pay my rent I'm just gonna sit there and play video games yeah I don't think that's the kind of existence I would want to live it might not even just be physical to I think it's just in overcoming and enduring and figuring things out like even writing a book I'm sure you're feeling like you just thought you have a new book out the way of the warrior kid yeah and I'm sure the feeling that you get when you write a book and complete complete it is I fucking did it I I made that happen I didn't want to get through all those days there's a lot of times I didn't want to write but I got through it and here it is there's a satisfaction of accomplishing goals and of overcoming obstacles and problems and they don't have to be physical I think there's mental requirements that we have as well yeah I think when people aren't mentally challenged they just start to fade yeah and if you're not looking for the physical and the mental challenges you're going to start to fade so yeah you got to be careful that why'd you write this book well if we hit book it's a kid way the warrior kid and the reason I wrote it is because first of all all the things that we're talking about right now they're happening even more to kids I mean you have kids right high pads iPhones they're sucked into technology and there's nothing completely wrong with that but if they get sucked into technology and they don't ever come out of it you've got issues yeah and being a kid if you remember a lot of people forget this being a kid is hard being a kid is hard and in this particular book there's a kid his name is Mark he's in fifth grade he's got kind of the typical issues that a fifth grader has he can't do any pull-ups so in gym class when they're doing pull-ups he's getting made fun of he's doesn't know his times tables which he should absolutely know in fifth grade but he doesn't know them so he's thinks he's stupid now he doesn't know to swim because he never learned and he's when they go on the field trip to the to the lake he doesn't not a swim so everyone's having a good time and he can't and eventually they call him out on it and finally he's getting picked on by the big bully Kenny Williamson you know the fuckin Kenny and he had shit Kenny Williamson so it lasted the the book starts off last at school basically all these problems come to a head he's all bummed out crying behind the library goes home and he gets home his mom reminds him that his uncle Uncle Jake is coming to stay with him for the summer and uncle Jake is a guy that was a seal in the SEAL Teams and he's just got out of the SEAL Teams and he's gonna go to college in the fall but he's going to spend the summer with his sister and with his nephew mark and so you know the Navy SEAL shows up Uncle Jake shows up and he sees his little nephew and he say you know either actually staying in the same room and you say you know what you gonna do tomorrow you you know go play some ball you want to go for a swim and the kid says you know like I don't want to play ball it's not fun and and I don't know how to swim and I don't think breaks down you know getting picked on the whole nine yards and his uncle says okay so you can't swim you don't know your times tables you can't do any pull-ups and you're getting picked on we can change all those things we just have to get a plan put it together and make it happen so puts them on the workout program teaches them how to study teaches how to swim teaches them jujitsu if it was only that easy yeah it and what's what's good is it's not as hard as people think and I think that's why the books getting a strong reaction because there's actually pragmatic methods in there on for instance I went through all this stuff not known timetables I went through that with my daughter my oldest daughter didn't know her timetables and what she thought was she's stupid she thought I'm stupid I don't know my times tables other kids know him I don't know him and I said to her you know she's crying you know this isn't whatever third or fourth grade crying what's wrong I'm stupid why do you think you're stupid I don't know my times tables or how much have you studied him I haven't studied him well how do you think you're going to know him if you haven't studied him what do you mean study him boom make flashcards an hour later she knows our timetables it's that and so I actually go through that method in the book how do you learn how to fight you're getting picked on how do you learn how to fight you go down to your your jujitsu school and you start learning jujitsu and you and I both know if you know jujitsu in a grade school fight in sixth grade you're gonna win a hundred percent of the time right so you learn do you learn that learn how to swim how do you how do you do that in his big thing is he's afraid of water well why are you afraid of the water how do you overcome that fear how do you overcome fear you got to knock you let yourself to it you start off waiting in the water then you dunk your head then you get you know then you then you lay down and you feel the water all over your body and then eventually step in and then eventually you start to dog paddle then eventually start to swim and then eventually jump off the bridge so these are real things that's how you overcome fear and that you know that one I got from my my middle daughter who wanted to be in the school play but she got stage fright and so she would freak out every time she would have to go in front of a crowd so I said okay we're gonna knock you late you two being in front of people first you're gonna sing in front of me you know and then you're gonna sing in front of me and Mom and then you're gonna sung in front of me and mom and your brothers and sisters and then you're gonna sing in front of you know our friends are going to come over they're going to be 10 of them and then you're gonna sing in front of you know all the people that we know at a block party and then you're going to get out you're gonna do your rehearsal and she did it and she got inoculated and I'll tell you right now she's not afraid of anything that girl and so that's the same thing that that he goes through in the book overcoming his fear of water he inoculates to it gets used to it and then finally the final step is you have to go right you can't overcome every part of the unknown you have to there's always gonna be some unknown in doing something that you've never done before and then what do you do when you've prepared as much as you can and you've done all the training that you can do then you've got to step up and you got to go that's what the books about and I wrote it so that kids can apply these things that I learned both in the SEAL Teams and then raising my own kids they can apply them to their life and the reacts be great it's been great to see all these kids reading it and all the great feedback of kids doing push-ups and pull-ups and and training and going down and starting jiu-jitsu and making flashcards it's awesome that is awesome and one of the cool things about being a kid is you well it's hot it's a struggle in that you haven't really achieved any success yet in anything but what you don't realize is that you've got all these possibilities to get good at stuff yeah like once you become really good at something one of the real problems is people don't like to get out of their comfort so I want to become a beginner again yeah and it's one of the beautiful things about life is humbling yourself with something new they're humbling yourself and learning stuff and kids they don't have that lesson yet so everything is terrifying but once they do learn it if you could teach a kid how to get good at one thing like one of the things that led me to get good at stand-up comedy and all the other things that I did is that I got really good at martial arts young so I knew okay I sucked when I first started I remember sucking but I remember I kept working and I get good at it because I focused and I put the time in well if I just do that with anything else you mean you've learned that you you can make a path you can do it it can be done and that's that's you know that's kind of one of the main points the book and when the kid finally does his 10 pull-ups that was his goal and his uncle says you know do you understand what this is about and this kid says you know well it's about I can do pull-ups now and he says no this is about everything about everything that you want to do in life you're going to have to work for you can have to come up with a plan you're going to have to have the discipline to execute that plan and when you do that you're going to be able to achieve what you want to achieve and that's hard work hard work and discipline is what's going to get you there probably a lot of kids don't have anybody in front of them like Jocko to tell well and you know what it's interesting so in this book you know uncle Jake is the character and and he actually addresses that in the end of the book cuz uncle Jake leaves and the kid says hey you know you're not going to be around anymore who's gonna who's gonna lead me who's gonna help me train and he says you didn't need me then and you don't need me now you know what you need to do you know it's going to take hard work and the other thing that I did in this book which is I I played around with the idea but his dad the kid's dad is not really present and and the reason I did that is because a lot of kids these days don't have a dad around and he the only thing he says about his dad I put one line in there about his dad which was you know he says my dad's gone a lot for his job and stuff that that's the only line so you you have an idea that the kid knows his dad and those work that he's out there he's working or doing whatever he's doing but there's a lot of kids out there that don't have a dad they don't have an uncle Jake and that was you know another reason why but wrote the book because kids need to see and learn you know if you wouldn't a done martial arts who would have told you that hey if you work hard and you train you're gonna get good at this that would have if you would have done that with martial arts you wouldn't done it with stand-up comedy you wouldn't done it with the rest of your career you said you know you would have gotten on the stage the first time for for-4 stand-up comedy you wouldn't have made anyone laugh you would've walked off said I suck and gonna get a job you know down it down at 7-eleven or whatever you know that's whereas if somebody said look man of course you suck you just started of course you suck of course you don't know your times tables how would you know them you don't born with that information of course you're not good at stand-up comedy you just did it for the first time you got to learn how to do it of course you're not good at stand-up fighting in Taekwondo you've never done it before so you've got to learn these things you got to put in the work you learn that lesson through martial arts a lot of kids don't get that opportunity I'm trying to give them that opportunity to learn it with this book and even for people that aren't kids like go do something you're not good at it's it's really important it's good just try something pick up a new hobby pick up a new discipline try learning how to play chess try to just do something you suck at and let let your mind feel what it's like to be at the beginning stages of improvement again I think it's very invigorating not only that I mean factually that's good for your brain you know they say you're supposed to learn new languages learn to play chess learn to play guitar read new books you're supposed to do that stuff your whole life to continue that's that's what continues keep just like your body falls apart if you don't exercise it your mind falls apart if you don't exercise it as well yeah I definitely feel that if I don't do anything new for a long time I feel stagnant but when I start doing some they knew especially something that I'm not good at so I start thinking about it a lot I start obsessing about it a lot I get invigorated I get excited about going there yeah yeah we and we saw the same thing like when our first book came out it's a leadership book right and everyone thinks hey you know it's another leadership book and then when you read it people go oh wait a second this is like a new thought it's it's a new thought I haven't seen before and we have these you know we we have these things that we do where we bring people in like it's usually we go out and work with a company we go out with one company and we go out and we work with a company but we found that there was some smaller companies or people that couldn't afford to bring us in so we said okay what are we going to do about that so we made this thing up called the muster where we open it up to the public to come and you know come and spend two days going through all these principles and it's the same thing that you're talking about they say it's a challenge it's new thought it's thinking about something from a different light people that have been in leadership positions for five years 10 years 15 years and they go oh okay I can apply this new methodology that I haven't seen hadn't thought about before so they'll continue to grow and learn is just so important across the board yeah stepping outside your comfort zone it's just one of the most important things for a human being for whatever reason I mean I don't know what it is but I know what works and that's it yeah that's what it is man for me I'd like to I've got a bunch of shit that I do that I suck at right now it's it's so important man I just started running really recently like the last couple of months I've noticed that you've been coasting about that dude I suck out and I'm fuck I'm so it's crazy you're getting a lot better a lot quicker though man like your endurance jumps up quick like within a few weeks I was able to like way pass areas I got get this this trail that's about 2.7 miles through the hills and real steep hills and there are some spots where I was just fucking dying and now I can get through them I can get through them and get to the top but I'm still dying yeah but I'm dying less are you timing yourself - yeah cuz I'm trying to make the times and and then you know I started wearing a heartrate watch too which I let my heart rate get down don't like when I when I when I have to take a break on these hill sprints I'll get my heart rate down to 140 and then I'll start going again if people ask me that - because when you get bored when you get bored of working out and also when you reach your physical limitations right so you reach your physical limitations on something you know like you're gonna get down to a six minute mile let's say and then for you to take it past a six-minute mile you're gonna have to like stop lifting kettlebells get all skinny you know you go to a point where you now that'd be your sole focus and I know I'm guessing you wouldn't want to do that I know I wouldn't want to do that and so for me I'm always jumping around from kind of a goal to goal right like oh maybe I'll be doing pull-ups heavy poles for a while being Paul's false was trying to get up my max pull-ups and I get to a point where okay now I'm I'm not gonna it's gonna take every bit of focus in my life to get to from from 58 pull-ups to 62 I don't want to do that so I'm cool with 52 and now I'm gonna start working on my deadlift or I'm gonna start training jiu-jitsu more I'm and I'm just consoling 52 pulps yeah yeah row yeah but like you know kipping pull-ups well not not not just full dead hang pull ups how many full dead hang pull ups mean doing uh probably 30 something damn - that's a lot are you do you do any do weighted ones at all oh yeah yeah I do weight it with the waist belt or you you use a vest I have a weight belt and vests so I have all set up in your basement is that what I'm looking at yeah it's my it's my garage oh yeah it's my garage which is you have a house yeah I mean yeah it's a game changer yeah I hate to say it's not everyone can can make that happen people live in cramped quarters but man if you can even just get a pull-up bar uh-huh and it may be a set of rings yeah I can do so much and then you grab yourself one kettlebell if you have a yard and you have a kettlebell you could do a lot yeah for sure pull-up bars are so gigantic well not really all you need for a pull-up bar is a ceiling not that's why me I mean it's so gigantic oh yeah you should have for sure like you get so and also it's so good for your shoulders just to hang no you know I thank your back yeah but if you have a pull-up bar in your house you can do pull-ups you can do push-ups you can do squats you can do you know all kinds of burpees and everything else sit-ups and got work and you can pretty much get your whole body in really good shape yeah with that one piece of equipment yeah yeah for sure yeah so when you set out your workouts do you do you write them down on paper do you just have an idea what you want to do I do write them down because I kind of log what I'm doing but I'll put down you know whatever exercise I'm going to do or whatever a bunch of exercises I'm gonna do and I'm logging down what I'm you know what my times are if I'm going for time or what the weights are if I'm going for weight and I'm pretty I heard this the other day something to say it um they said Arnold was an instinctual trainer so I do that somewhat you know I'm not like looking at a book and I don't plan out for three weeks or a month in advance of exactly what I'm gonna do that day cuz that day I might go damn I you know I'm not feeling that type of workout and I'm I need to not do it I'm gonna do something else so I use my what my body's telling me somewhat that's not to say that I go hey I don't feel like doing anything to do today so I'm not gonna do it because that's actually a rule that I have if I don't feel like doing something today I feel like I need a rest I'll do something that day and put the rest off till the next day hmm make yourself do it today and then if you still need it tomorrow you can take a rest but you can't take a rest today not allowed ooh interesting do it to yourself you're your own boss so when you write your stuff out do you have like a logbook you'll keep like so you could go back and track progress and you look at yourself know so like say if you're going to work out tomorrow do you plan it out tonight nope I know kind of what I'm going to do tomorrow tomorrow I'm going to do a bunch of ring dips I'm going to do a bunch of dips I'm going to be doing a bunch of parallel push-ups I'm gonna do a ton of burpees and probably some yeah that's that's gonna round it out right now I have a little tweak on my knee right now so I can't sprint um like I normally would but otherwise I do be doing some sprints in there too yeah jujitsu tweaks right it know what it was yeah yes it was looking joints man it is in in but if you think about how much time you spend on the mat if I would've been playing basketball yeah or playing soccer I'd still get the same be worse yeah probably worse yeah so it means relatively in your refree and this is not a bad tweak it's just like oh yeah we'll tweak well that's one thing that I try to impart on people to that like strengthen could training particularly strength training it protects the joints for sure in the back and a lot of other issues I think that is why I have been relatively knock on wood injury free because two two reasons I work out all the time and I never take like any significant amount of time off I never say I'm not gonna work out I never just fall into a hand with two months or even two weeks or even five days for me to for me to not work out for five days there were some kind of like something happened I was like majorly sick or I was even if I'm traveling I'll still get it done but I think that that consistency your body just is used to it and you don't you don't get hurt as often and you're like a hardcore metal guy right what do you listen to I listen to you know I so I grew up on the East Coast listening to old school hardcore music yeah and and you know so metal and hardcore bands like the Bad Brains cro-mags agnostic front just old-school hardcore bands from from yeah from that guy john joseph is a trip yeah the head of the cro-mags yeah he's a fuckin trip man I watched his documentary about him he's in his 50s tapes up his ankles and shit before shows like he's warming up and stretching out does triathlons in between shows right wrote a book called meat is for pussies the hardcore vegetarian he's like a Hari Krishna yeah I got I do the other guy the guy that founded that band the crow max he's uh he's actually putting my his jiu-jitsu guys a black belt in jujitsu but he's had a completely insane life as well his name is Harley Flanagan and he his life's been completely insane isn't it doesn't even really uh doesn't Harley this really rise to a picture yeah he's maybe I actually it was interesting because I just had him on on my podcast and it was a different it was a different you know guest for me a different genre and people you know first of all the guy you know people that listen my podcasts um they expect a certain type of podcast right I'm gonna talk about leadership I'm going to talk about the military and all of a sudden I bringing this guy who's been a complete maniac and I mean he's done you know he was uh drugs you know drugs sex rock and roll it's basically been his whole life and since he was like ten years old he was playing in a punk rock band in New York City holy shit he was loose when he was 10 he was 10 he was smoking a fuck where his parents his mom was a hippie his dad was a Roma never never never met his dad and he is just he just grew up in the streets of the Lower East Side of New York's did you go to New York City in the 80s at all very little I fought a tournament in New York and then 1980s I remember driving there with some of the guys from Boston we were driving to the city and looking at it going what in a fuck is this place in New York in the 80s is completely different than it is now it was really really bad it was filled with crime like 42nd Street down in Times Square and I when I was a kid I would go there cuz I was into this kind of music and I fancy hardcore shows and metal shows and you'd get off the train and you get out in 40 seconds riether people you know every two steps drugs dust crack everything and but that's where he grew up basically without parents and then he's got just just a crazy crazy story how old is he now he's 50 he's still training so she teaches kids class at hensel's he's the kid's instructor Denzil Gracie in New York yeah Wow that's amazing yeah that's cool but it was interesting because I had him on the podcast and it was interesting to have people that listen to it that listen to my podcast which is very different in basically all kinds you get all kinds of such a completely wide variety of people in here my guests have been basically war guys right Brian Stann Tim Kennedy Jodie medic was Canadian sniper wounded real bad in in Afghanistan I had a guy named Colonel William reader on there who's a pilot in Vietnam got shot down and got shot down twice actually captured in Vietnam was in captivity for a year and he's talking about he's you know in a bamboo cage with his leg shackled and he wakes up in the middle of night because the rats are eating his wounds I mean I'm bird guys that are just talking about and not only talking about heavy subjects but they're also talking about it from you know a very positive perspective of life right I mean is there anyone more positive than then Brian Stann right guys just like a like just an American Hero right and so then I Olson out of left field I bring on Harley Flanagan and he tells his story it was really interesting immediate to have people's reactions and there was a couple people that like oh you know this was a real letdown for you to bring him on but if you hear his story you listen to the whole podcast I mean here's a guy who who you can hear it in his voice like his his heart is broken over some of the things that he's been through his life losing his father his father was a was a heroin addict and in his father died burned alive in a dumpster as he lit a fire to try and keep himself warm that's how I was harassed died buried his mom I mean it's just it's just a tragic story but my point is that the even though I had a very few people that were like all that was you you shouldn't have he swore literally he swore a bunch on the podcast that's inappropriate or whatever and then I what was really that that was kind of hot that's that's kind of too bad to hear hear someone say that that they would have that viewpoint but what was really cool was all these other people that are very straight-laced kind of kind of middle road American people that that listen to podcasts were like dude thanks for having that guy on what a heart what a guy and it's good for me to know about that stuff and it's good for to hear someone that's been through the depths of drug addiction and he'll come back out of it and do alright and and again from my perspective I think that my interaction with those kind of people when I was growing up which I certainly had you know a young kid going to New York and Boston going to hardcore shows and all that it'll let me see part of the world that most people don't really see and so when I got in the military I got it was kind of used to dealing with people that people aren't used to dealing with and I think it helped me a lot so is it a hard managing expectations once you tell me how many what do you do you have like 75 episodes up already yeah yeah that's crazy yeah last time you here you had zero I love it though getting after it's a it's a lot mate on my podcast is a lot different than yours because I'm going deep on some subject that I'm actually going to like I have to study and prepare for mm-hmm and and it's not interacting with another person most of the time most of the time I'm interacting with history so it's it's harder for me to prepare now of course you've been preparing for this podcast for 50 years right I mean that's what you've been mentally preparing for getting your experience in your background but I have to like dive into stuff and and so it is hard my my point is yes it's hard for me to do a podcast a week I got a reader but is it hard to manage expectations I was getting after like because once you disturb lished like a fanbase sometimes they have this idea in their head of what the podcast should be to them like what they want out of it and then they they can express that they don't like where you're going like I don't like that you brought this Harley guy on this guy's not what I like I like straight-laced military guys who don't swear this guy's a fucking nutty dude jumps around on stage and the my answer to that is no and I'll tell you why from the beginning of say we know when you said it was you and gives you and Tim Ferriss you know both you guys said you should do a podcast and I said okay cool to this day your podcast with Tim Ferriss one of my all-time favorite podcasts I listened to it in in my I was cooking I was listening to my kitchen I was like Jesus fuckin Christ this is a good podcast it was intense you know and it was uh it was so deep and intense and I was like I got it I got to talk to this dude I gotta get you one because I I had known you like from peripherally genes fights and I'd seen you around and that but I didn't know who you were you know I didn't know your story and well Tim had you on yeah in it and so you know Tim again when he when he press stop on the on the on the recorder he said you should have your own podcast and then you told me in the middle of the podcast you should have your own podcast and obviously when you two guys are telling me I should have my own podcast I'll be a complete idiot not to listen to you well you did now it's a huge success she's hilarious they love when people listen yeah everyone listen to Joe you don't listen to me about everything no be selective but as I've done it I've done you know what I want to do and if people don't like it that that's okay I'm okay with someone saying hey you know what you're you know I did so I've done some episodes that were horrible man I talked about the meal I massacre if you don't know what that is the meal I'm ask her you know people talk about these atrocities that Americans commit all the time Americans don't actually commit atrocities all the time but we have committed some heinous atrocities and this one is well documented Vietnam the me lie Massacre it was a company of soldiers going into a village and they raped murdered killed around five hundred people just cold blood I mean it's it's heinous it's awful probably the hardest podcast that I've done because I'm a patriotic guy and Here I am talking about you know American soldiers doing heinous acts to innocent people and and so I have done that I did the I did a podcast about the genocide in Rwanda which was if you don't know anything about that to tribes and it's very hard for Americans to understand this the difference between these two tribes is nothing it's just two tribes they speak the same language they have the same they look the same they have the same religion which by the way the religion was Catholicism because they've been like converted to Catholicism well they went on a rampage and the Hutus which is one tribe murdered 800,000 Tutsis in a hundred days with machetes with machetes so I've covered these dark and horrible things on my podcast and and I and I don't even know really a hundred percent why other than this thought in the back of my mind that I've always had which is that you have to kind of understand the darkness of the world in order to appreciate the good in the world and that's why I was really interesting to hear you talking at Jordan Peterson because he covered that part you know he was saying look man is got a dark side and you won't become a good person unless you understand your dark side and it's interesting for me because Jordan Peterson is clearly a highly intellectual and academic guy and I'm not right I'm I'm a nug right I joined the military after high school and and yet all so many of the things he says when he says them I say oh yeah well that's the same thing I stumbled upon he came across that reading the the French philosopher or whatever that's where he comes her I came across it in life and so it's very interesting to me when I hear him say look there's darkness in the world and there's evil in the world and we have to face that and and as soon as I heard him saying that on the podcast I'm like well that's that's what I think and I can't give you the philosophical basis for it like he can but I can tell you what I've lived through and I can tell you that if you don't understand the fact that there's darkness in the world and that people human beings are capable of evil things if you don't understand that you're not going to understand the the first of all you not understand what you need to look out for in the world and what we need to be aware of as a society and as a race of humans but also you're not going to appreciate things in the world that are beautiful and good and positive so with the podcast I'm not doing it to make people happy I'm not doing it to make people listen I'm not even doing it to make people listen I'm doing it because it's things that I've lived through it's things that I want to understand better and I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and if people like it then that's awesome and if people don't want to listen to it that's cool too well at least from my personal experience listening to guys like Jordan Peterson or listening to yourself or listening to anybody talk about really deep important subjects even if you know what they're saying to be true it reinforces it in your own mind and maybe even opens up new doors of comprehension Jordan certainly did that with me when I was listening to him talk he was saying some things like you know like like talking about dragons and dragons have gold I was like whoa Jesus Christ like he was he was hitting some notes about human psychology and the reason why we behave in certain ways and the pitfalls of these certain types of behavior that I absolutely knew he was right but and maybe I had even thought about them before but seeing them reinforced so eloquently and seeing expressed so articulately it really like it sparked life in in my mind yeah and even you know he was talking about being a warrior right and how these guys in modern times we don't that we don't spend time being a warrior if you and I were living 500 years ago you and I would both be battle scarred and we would be used to that lifestyle people aren't used to that lifestyle now they've kind of forgotten what that feels like and so I'm that was my life I mean that was my life was to prepare for war and go fight war that was my whole life and so for me to look back on it now and here Jordan Peterson to say like that's normal that's okay that's expected and it makes me say okay I understand now we're you know kind of part of part boo I understand myself better when I hear him say oh yeah this is this normal for guys to go out and fight wars this is the warrior mentality and when you come back and you tell the truth about it people will react to that in a positive ways what are you saying about you is okay look you're not you're not some you know academic sitting there reading a book and and talking about what you're reading in a book you're like no I live I'm a fighter I fight I've been through this stuff I had physical challenges that's why people are listening to what you're saying you know because you have that warrior mentality in your life well I think that guys like Jordan Peterson I think that anybody that can tap into those truths that we know you know uh I just don't think we hear them enough I think we're in undated with so much stupid shit every day it's so hard to get to any like real substantial truths that will positively affect you both your outcome and your your outlook on life and I think guys like you like Tim Ferriss is putting on all these amazing podcast Jordan Peterson all these people that can express things to someone like this podcast literally has changed my life I mean it's changed my thinking it's shit I'm a totally different person than I was when I first started this podcast because talking all these interesting and fascinating people and wise people it's been like having some crazy crash course in a million different disciplines and a bunch of different conversation seeing the pitfalls of some people's thinking and and and being around people where you see the holes in in their their the way they express themselves or the way they process information you know made me recognize though the holes in my own processing and the way I used to communicate with people I'm just I'm a better a better conversationalist now and it all comes from just having these intense conversations this this whole podcast thing is something that I never expected in life I never expected it was going to come along when it came along I never expected it would be something that I would do and I never expected it would be something I consume as much as I do I don't even have radio anymore on my fucking car no I listen to music if I listen to music it's my music that I get off iTunes or it's something that someone like a new band that someone tells me or turns me on to but I don't listen to anybody like I don't want some satellite radio I don't listen to local radio I listen to podcast constantly 100 percent yeah yeah and there's something that is and I know you even I experienced though so I what I'm 75 podcast deep it's been going for a year and some change but when people come up to me now they look me in the eyes and they shake my hand I know they know me they know you and I kind of know them too like they have these shared experiences with me and I talked about this on that on that podcast about Rwanda they talked about the fact that the first thing they do in a revolution in a coup is they want to take control of the radio and there's this great piece in there where he says they're talking about the fact that with with TV you have to take what the image on the screen in your mind your eyes process it and then it goes into your brain with reading you take those words and they go in through your eyes and it processes when it goes into your brain but with audio there's no filter the words are going directly into your brain they're unfiltered and so it's this that's why I think this podcast audio format is so powerful because the people that are listening to this right now they're sitting in the room with us they're here with us and when I'm recording my podcast I'm actually talking to them and they're there and when I go out and I meet people you can absolutely feel like hey and that the little inside jokes cuz even though I'm talking about how dark and evil my podcast is but we have a good time too when we have episodes that are funny and we talk about regulars we talk about jujitsu and food and everything else working out and we have fun too and all those little inside jokes people will say the inside jokes to me that I never met this person before but but he knows exactly what I'm talking about and and so it's it's a very very powerful medium that I think got skipped over and you know we went from radio just completely absorbed into TV and then absorbed into the internet and now all of a sudden we got to this other side where we're back to this thing that there's some reason why people used to sit around that radio and listen to those radio shows back in the day even I did you know when I was a kid for whatever reason I liked radio shows listen to dr. Demento dr. Shara documented I would sit there and listen to dr. Demento and they'd have those little radio shows and those skits and that was a powerful medium and I knew it back then and so for me like you you know as soon as as soon as you and Tim were saying you should do your own podcast I was absolutely I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna every you know my goal is that when people press play on my podcast I want them to like be putting their headphones on and like stretching their neck a little bit pressing play and then and then just going okay this this is I want them to get absorbed in it that's what I listen well there's also nothing else like it in terms of like that you can have you only have one guy you work with right echo Charles and show him yeah so it's you and him and that's it like there's like a whole team if you had a the the audience that you have I know that you guys are shit-ton and downloads now so the that kind of audience if you were on a radio show you'd have a successful radio show so you'd be in a studio somewhere you'd have a network behind you you'd have to have production meetings you'd have to have a bunch of people that would tell you what the hell is gonna say I'd have people telling me what I couldn't couldn't say yeah people tell me to stop yeah I do an advertisement right now and well no and that's the beautiful thing about it and you know I know we're leaving money on the table because right now all these advertisers that come to us and they say can you talk about this and can you talk about that can you and they want to pay us money and I just like nope we're not doing it we have one we have on it because your your boys your company and you helped me in the beginning so and good products but that's it that's all that's the only advertisements we have not doing anybody else and so there's no one that can tell me what to do yeah this is my lot that's a beautiful thing there's a lot to that there's a lot to it and also not interrupting your podcast is giant yeah not ever never breaking up that thought now just keeping that thing going to the end say thank you very much see you guys next week you know boom and I just think that people get locked up in this is like sort of like almost like a trance of the way you're thinking they're in Jacko's mind you're talking and they're thinking how you're thinking they're like allowing themselves to be taken on this journey whether they're in their car whether at the gym they're absorbed in your thoughts in a very unique way and because the fact there's not a whole lot of other people contributing it and entering into the picture you know like producers and network executives and advertising agencies and look we've looked at the stats and joggle you've got to talk more about this and you know I mean you could get lost in analytics and never find your true voice but podcasts it's almost entirely your true it's so it is I want to say I don't want to say low tech it's not low tech but it's low there's a small amount of voices you know in terms of like each individual podcast it's just your voice and it may be like mine it's mine and the guest and whoever else comes in that's it there's not a lot of other intrusion yeah and that's where you I mean the singular visions is what makes something that's like this reason why Netflix does so well and the reason why a lot of these HBO shows do so well is because they leave those fucking people alone they just go make a make us Game of Thrones we'll be back here go ahead and what are you gonna do gonna make a comedy special you know I did my last comedy special with Netflix they have fucking zero notes for me zero I've never done a goddamn thing where they didn't say you can't talk about this you can't put that bit in it's the only thing I've ever done where they said we love it they like that's it yeah do it don't kick ass okay like literally that was it I love that joke you're gonna do that one I'll do it yeah I actually told that to my publisher um about you know my publisher I was like you know what the best thing about my podcast is is that no I can do whatever I want to do I can do whatever I want to do and that's what makes it it's very very liberating there's no I mean you write a book you know there's someone's going to edit that thing and they're gonna change this and they're going to adjust that they want the cover to look like this the podcast is it is just you and you know even the first my first podcast came out and you know my wife lifts it listen to it and she was all stoked because when was the last time that you sat down and talked just talked to your wife for two and a half hours right yeah it doesn't happen it does and my wife was like hey was awesome like she got to know me better get me through it for 20 years she got to know me better because she got to sit and listen to me talk for two-and-a-half hours and now she's listened to every single one of them and she's she knows she actually knows me better than she did before the podcast started because I got a wife and four kids and jobs and work and travel and all that she can't I don't have time to sit there and talk to my wife for two and a half hours hey maybe I'm a bad person but that's just the reality of life yeah well you know what honestly when do you ever get a chance to sit like this across from someone talk to them for three hours without checking your phone without anybody coming into the room with anybody interrupting you with something you have to do or some place you have to be it's very odd in its that's one of the things that I say one of the reasons why I say that it changed my life is because it educated me on other people's thought processes in a way that you just don't you don't get one-on-one dialogue with people in the real way and if you think about it you know as we talked about going back these primal things there's there's a primal thing about calm having a human conversation and if you think about where technology is going we don't have much human conversation so you're a hundred percent right not only am I not having two and a half hour conversations with my wife I'm not having two and a half hour conversations with anybody anybody until I come up here and sit down with you or until I go into my podcast studio and I sit down and I have it a two half hour conversation with you know a million people that are gonna sit there and listen and they're gonna give me feedback on Twitter and they're gonna tell me this and they're gonna tell me their story and it's it's very it's a we're filling a hole I think as a hole in communication right now because you know we text each other you know you and me text each other yeah I text our text echo I text everybody text my why do you think you and I've ever had a conversation on the phone no no that's a word we're living in people just text we're texted we're good weird like legit things hey I gotta send you something up I just boom happy it's just just like that's the way it is and it's totally acceptable but there's something missing yeah and if we can't you know the next level is like well we're gonna roll you know to me like that's the next thing is you train together but there's there's there's a gap in in human contact right now but in having conversations and I'm just thinking this right now that this the whole nature of podcasting fills that hole and if you look at the podcasts that do well it's podcasts that are conversationalist unless you go with the podcast that's highly produced and they're gone they you know cuz like radio lab yeah all those ones that are highly produced and even the ones that are produced by you know NPR so they have real money behind them and they're they're a different thing but for normal dudes that are just sitting around and talking those are popular podcast that's why 10 Sam Harris those guys are sitting around and talking and explaining stuff because that doesn't exist anymore in the in the day to day life for a lot of people you know what else doesn't exist in a day to day life what a place where it's okay to be a man it's actually okay to the end it's okay to have man thoughts like everybody is so so toned down and neutered it's like human resources and and corporate life as watered down people's natural behavior to the where people are just dying on the inside sitting in these fucking cubicles rotting they're just freaking the fuck out having all these thoughts they can't entertain having to pretend to be someone there they're not all day long putting on this bullshit way of talking this fake way of thinking everybody's got to subscribe to whatever fucking ridiculous policies their company wants to enforce and you're just a robot and you get out of there and you just want to scream yeah or you want to listen to some guys talk about some real she's a real shit yeah and then go fuck how come I can't talk about real shit no it's another reason why they wrote the kids book because the kids book instead of you know it being about hey if someone's picking on you go and tell the teacher it's like no actually if somebody's picking on you learn to defend yourself and kick their ass if needed that's that that hasn't been said it's another reason I wrote the book I went I've told this story before but I went and got some book from my kid when he was little my Valon son and three daughters I went got a book form is like a pirate book right and I'm thinking cool Pirates are gonna burn stuff take over villages and steal things this will be awesome and I read the book and it's just complete these guys are complete you know pathetic they're pathetic they're not a fake pirate they're fake pie they're not manly pirates right and I just was so embarrassed with the book I don't know some I don't even recheck I check I threw it away fire hook they had it damn it you know you can't learn from a pirate that you got to go out and like crush something sometimes then we got to just check ourselves cuz guess what life is that's what life is it's another there's another thing that we shield kids from these days life is hard yeah you don't get a trophy you don't get it there's no such thing as a trophy for participation that's fake it's a lie doesn't exist you can't learn your times tables guess what you need to work and study you don't get put into a special class and get a tutor and maybe you get eight you know you got some special help to get know you need to work and make that happen you don't don't know how to swim guess what that doesn't mean you stay away from the water no you learn how to swim you step up you man up that's what you do so that's another reason why I wrote the book so that people can actually our kids can learn that life is hard and in order to deal with life you got to be hard yeah and just this idea that life is hard something you're supposed to shield from them it's so silly and you know I've had this conversation with my friends because everybody that I know that's interesting how too fucked up life but but now we have kids and the last thing we want is our kids to have a fucked up life so we put our kids in these good schools we live in these nice neighborhoods everybody eats healthy and there's no fucking domestic violence and everybody seems it's it's so different than all of our lives and we were talking about it me and bryan callen were actually talking about like look we all had fucked-up childhoods and everybody we know had fucked-up childhoods and they're all interesting but I don't want my kids to be boring but I also want them to be safe so it's like oh yeah how do you approach that you know I think you get it mauled that's what I've chosen to do is get my kids involved in martial arts and and and and give them the opportunity to pursue difficult things and understanding that through pursuing these difficult things like in accomplishing stuff like you you learn something about yourself you learn that you have this ability inside of you to overcome I've got this statement that I made on my podcast about kids and I said if you're helping your kids you're hurting them and if you think about it right innit the example I gave is like tying your kid shoe if you tie your kid's shoe you're you're actually taking away the opportunity in their life to develop their fine motor skills of tying a shoe that you're actually taking that away from them yeah and it's the same with everything make your own sandwich make your own bed clean your own room you need to do this stuff for yourself and when I'm helping you you're I'm hurting you so I think we can I think we can protect them without just completely coddling them and making sure that every issue that ever could present itself to them has been eliminated yeah cuz you're gonna end up with some weak kids yeah and if those kids have to compete with some kid who's had to take care of himself their whole life that kids going to be ferocious yep yeah you're gonna have a feral kid competing against your little soft fleece line kid yeah that's why some of those competitive sports are are so important you know whether it's and martial arts are great wrestling's great jujitsu but you know football basketball anything that puts you in those challenging positions where you're going to have to step up you're gonna get groundout and like might one of my daughter's wrestles whoa yeah and she is you know this is the same one that got stage fright and to see her step up and you know we live a pretty good life right I mean it's we live in Southern California we live in a nice house it's it's it's it's a nice living right it's a very comfortable situation some of the hardest times that she's been put through is on the wrestling mat and having to step up against some girl that like exact role you're talking about some girl from the barrio in San Diego that's a tough ass girl that's been through the wringer and has domestic violence going on in her house and her one escape from all that is to come out wrestle against some other girl and beat her down so my daughter has to step up and do that and it's it's an incredible thing it's it's it's incredibly powerful and empowering even I watched her change you know when she would be intimidated by in those situations to where now she's like bring it bring it I got something for you that's awesome man um we're almost three hours in here so anything else you got a hold is you're the only guys ever showed up I think with this many notes yeah well so what I want to do is now if we can spend the next four hours going through - oh we have we have all kinds of studly okay yeah I was driving up here taking notes on on the Jordan Peterson podcast I think everyone should listen that's a great great podcast to listen to and there's so many points that he covers in there that are really profound and I think important today but he's dealing with a very unusual situation where those coddled soft kids are now in universities and they're trying to run the show with these ridiculous programs of inclusion and diversity and you know forcing their mindset down everybody else's throat it's really fascinated yeah it's fascinating and disturbing to see all that happening and it's really yes it's it's actually disturbing to see that happening and see kids could be focused on such important things in the world and they end up focusing on something that is borderline in many cases borderline you know meaningless you know why don't you let's let's move towards a real goal there's diseases to cure and you know yeah good things to do in the world well you know I think everybody agrees that racism is bad and homophobia is bad but that's not exactly what you're dealing with here were you dealing with his people trying to control the way other people behave and talk and think and it might not even be in response to any actual real like negative things that have happened it's like they're trying they're trying to create negative things to battle that might not even be there it's just a lot of weirdness today in this world and I think that to bring it back full circle a lot of this weirdness comes from a lack of true struggle like do you think that these kids that are growing up in Russia that are doing backflips off of the top of buildings are they dealing with the same like you know diversity lectures and classes that they have to have and I think there's an there's an intrinsic part of human beings that wants to be part of a tribe of some kind and wants to defend their tribe and when you grow up in a place where there's no real try but then you look for one to latch on to and these people over here they have a cause and they've got a tribe and you can be part of that tribe and you could be and you then you can lash out at the bad guys and I think that happens a lot and I think it's uh it's unfortunately unfortunate because it really crushes you know individuality which is what I you know that's my kind of my premiere base you know thoughts are around individual freedom yeah be an individual think for yourself for your mind yeah there's a lot of like comfort in those groups that these people belong to whether it's you know any kind of group whether it's a hardcore right-wing group or a hardcore left-wing group you get in you kind of know what the rules are and you play by those rules and then you you surround yourself with a bunch of like-minded people in an echo chamber who also support the fact that these rules are the rules and we have to get these out there and like I think we just need to establish there's a bunch of shit you shouldn't do don't steal from people don't rape anybody don't you know don't shoot anybody like figure out a way we can harmoniously get along together without fucking with each other you know and then just let everybody be whatever they are if you're gay you're gay if you like listening to fucking classical music and and running naked through the streets I don't care don't fuck me just don't you know trouble don't you know and again that's just you're talking about individual freedom yeah Peter sighs man what I'm you know what's which is what I like individual freedom do what you want to do hard for insecure people to allow that to happen because into insecure people when they see individual freedom that's contrary to what their own personal behaviors like they have to question themselves and challenge themselves they decide that that person's wrong and these people are wrong and I'm right and this and this needs to be established and we need to fight and we need to you know go out and punch Nazis or whatever the fuck they think they're supposed to be doing and just gets real weird man yeah it's weird than when that becomes your whole life yeah and I'm sure you get this I get it a lot which is people on social media that want me to weigh in on this thing or they want me to weigh in on this side or they're attacking me because of this or attacking me because of that not so much attacking but people want me to weigh in on things all the time and it's things that I just say man that this isn't affecting me and and not only that my comments aren't gonna move this forward and finally I don't care about that thing I understand that you're obsessed with it but I'm not I know I'm not obsessed with this thing that you're obsessed with so I don't even care that you're obsessed with that's cool and when people ask me they sound good you know sound go keep keep keep doing what you're doing sounds great not not my thing move on people get obsessed with things they won't even be obsessed with a few years later like hey man I got obsessed about that thing that you were obsessed with and now I'm like you know man I'm not even obsessed about that anymore I'm on to some new shit yeah go get obsessed with kettlebells and jiu-jitsu you start that out yeah get obsessed with life improvement find things that you enjoy doing that are difficult do them and get better at them seems so simplistic it seems like a ridiculous idealistic point of view but it's effective yeah you will be happier and you will be a more positive influence on everyone around you yeah pretty nice to people not so hard jackoway ladies and
