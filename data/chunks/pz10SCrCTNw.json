hello freak bitches it's it all is about the the the issues with interspecies communication my spray dolphins they kind of understand the concept they can't make the noise because they have a blowhole but this lady was trying she was living with this thing for a long time and she was jerking the dolphin off and then everything I still train that and Lily was doing acid and trying to cut off funding her yeah I would just you know it's like I I respect the effort but this ain't sure to do that i howled to show you that right no more you get another dolphin you know you just have too little to live with the coffin to him there's got to be a better way I think they were created imagine that dolphin was fucking happy I can't imagine was like this is great i'm living with a lady I don't know if he thought it was bad i mean we have this big hang-up about sexuality but imagine if you had an itch on your back and you couldn't reach it and you know you are being take care of by someone and they scratched your back you're like oh thank you i just mean i would always lean towards like fun put a dog though yeah i mean i'm more of a don't jerk an animal off kind of a guy but I just mean there's my point is well then maybe get a better facility to keep the dolphin and get a couple of dolphin let them live put them in a I don't know i mean you know anytime you have an animal in captivity it's pretty fucked up but i don't know that jerking them off is the right way to do if you know she's totally rubbing would you do which what if you had to choose an animal to jerk off which I let you know a lot of people ask me this question I would not do the monkey because if you do it wrong and bite you yeah I think it was a monkey would be a little bit too much like this doing it with a dude if you're a rough few second off a monkey they just fucking some 30 through your thumb I don't like I can work in the air I'd go exotic I go like giraffes right like I know cuz it's tall you could stand you know but they might come and kick you in the head hey my look there's always a risk there's always a risk when my boy was worried he was executive producers and Daily Show no one said it was an easy job you know television died jerking off a donkey I think it's a terrible way to go I do koala bear cuz they're so cute undo it do you know they rape a lot yeah real little bears are famous for raping each other there you got a vicious they when they fuck they bitin really fucking yeah get crazy yeah I did not know that yeah you don't want to jerk off koalas I'm saying don't bite you bite the shit I'm gonna need to sleep on this I'll let you guys know I yeah but so let's put this to a test I mean it's what what she did was ridiculous but only ridiculous by our cultural standards if you think about it like biologically the real issue biologically is your right like shouldn't have a dolphin in captivity that's all but in the the podcast he sort of document why they did it because it was really hard to communicate with dolphins in the wild yeah I did this thing in a lot in Hawaii recently where we went swimming with the dolphins yeah I had my four-year-old with me too she was in the water like right next to my literally I was holding on to her while we're swimming and she's got the scuba mask on and shit and she's you know snorkeling looking down with its soaked swim underneath it it's amazing yeah it's amazing and they're wild these are not like she well I see the end they'll they'll sonar you like it's fucking cool like don't get near yawn they'll make quick weird noises and shit I like that the ladies during time had talked up Carter to my calculations he's saying jerk me off I've just listening to him what I mean we don't know that for sure trust me I speak tough and he wants to be jacked up it's like seeing um that woman who went jogging in Florida and she was you know I was like seven at night shit along their work shunt right and she just dangled her feet off the bridge oh I just gotta die on my feet I'm so fucking hot and an 11-foot alligator was like I'm gonna I'll take you now I'll be having you now Oh found it with no arms took her arms fuck that's good time alligator was like I know I'm an alligator and usually I don't do this cuz the crocodiles do it I'm gonna do it today to you you're going to be uh the third only three people are four people of the year that's going to be eaten by a fucking 11-foot dragon that'll be me yeah that weird that alligators they let them hang around because they're not too aggressive it's like they're just docile enough usually run from you that people don't just decide to fucking kill them on sight but really everyone in Florida should be in up in arms they should run out to the swamps and gun those fucking dinosaurs down like those are a bunch of kiddie eating dog eating monster shit out of dogs yeah a guy was walking his dog and they all Gator didn't go for the dog went for the guy not the guy he's fucking Jesus yeah they're just not as aggressive his croc if they were Crocs we would be killing them left fly crocodiles no they found Nile Crocs in the Everglades stop it yes they have there's a shoot on sight order iphone i all right people that used to have them as pets I'm not out crocodiles yep they don't know if they're breeding you don't don't have any idea but they've spotted more than one now crocodile and the other guy confirmed sightings they're saying straight-up killer yep you see him they kill him on sight straight up come they will come right at you you are food and they're being big oh they get really beside that peace corps girl who who's like oh they're in Kenya well the crocodiles died out years ago she heard she heard she goes swimming the guys like I don't know she's like I'm going on with a rally I'm a water baby 30 seconds later gets pulled on a cloud got my feet Mufasa bear hug dude there was a document or article I was reading about these people that were canoeing in the Congo and the guy behind washes the guy in front gets taken by the croc where the croc just rises up out of the water and literally snatches the guy and spins the canoe upside kayak rather oh that's like I know it's stuck in it and it like goes up and down like a bobber and then poop and then pops up no guy that's it it doesn't see the guy ever again the croc just takes him out of the water yeah and just saw the motto of that story is don't fucking kayak in denial I mean in in the combo it don't do that that would be the motto of that story Oh fucking are you out of your fucking mind they're not like sharks they will bother you they come after you come after everything yeah that's what they're they're here for cleaner fucking zoologist sending you Gandhi saw salt water crocodile eat a goddamn tire eat a whole tire it's like I'm gonna heat this tire looking tired I was like can you repeat that again is it a toy car Tarkas yet ain't
