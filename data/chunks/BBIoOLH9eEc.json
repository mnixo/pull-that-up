and then it changed to black and then it went from black to Puerto Rican and they went from Puerto Rican Dominican Nicaragua and shit like that delicious engine happy phone look at that huh come on I am twice the size giant huge stall almost too huge I thought it was almost too needed but then when I first got it I took it to England and and I was on the phone a lot like doing text messages and emails and stuff smells like this is a much better experience for that right very much better but I don't know how shut it off so if everything mmm so you were just you're just with a hearin and Henner in manchester oh yeah yeah I know this guy's yeah well I trained with hearin I know Andrew are you training with him now you trained with Chris how der is that who you're talking to yeah I was training with him and a black belt under here and and Henner and then I migrated to hearing are you the badass of the intellectuals now when you go to the skeptic conferences they'll just come I don't I don't think I've been to a skeptics conference since I started well I shouldn't say status kind of conference I should say debate you know you've been in quite a few very entertaining debates online um more atheist than skeptic right with uh I there was one that you did with this really smart dude it was really fascinating um I believe here's a Jewish guy and he was so passionate about about religion he was so passionate about the intellectual pursuit of religion and it was really fascinating to watch him like weave his dance like he tried to make it seem like it made sense it clearly didn't but it was fascinating to watch him weave this dance and just it was all prose and delivery and drama and he put it together in such an entertaining form you almost want to go with him like God maybe maybe there is a God maybe the Bible is true I think you're talking about rabbi wall P yes that's exactly I'm talking about debated twice won once alone and once with Hitchens and was Hitchens and I against roll hoping another rabbi you get accused of something I think is very fascinating you get accused of Islamophobia and it's by liberals and progressives there's this new thing that's really interesting to me that you can goof on Christianity to the fucking cows come home you can shit on Mormonism and polygamy and any other cult whether it's Scientology you can goof on anything and no one says peep but if you say anything about Islam progressive people will deem you Islamophobic and they'll say there's something wrong with you I I think that's a really interesting thing that we do and I just show there's a lot of psychological reasons because you know we're bombing the kazir - come on Doug that's less bending right here and it go like this and you've got a handle don't put your hand around put it on this side okay okay and if you're going to put your hand around go like this and squeeze the fingers together you like the hell not the small finger the right here yeah and out squeezin okay now you're cutting the blitz pie off the thumb a little bit little bit okay this is a curl this is a rip curl and rip curl and rip and you get used to that and when you're cranking guys neck or choking him it doesn't slip if you squeeze the thumb you know so you know you go like this and it might slip up right but it's my slip yeah but there's no not that finger this yeah okay now curl and rip so you feel like this is more stable than I I do ball but I will see this this way now you go like this you're using your back to see yeah and you're pulling them in close it doesn't feel like you smash your fingers like this the thumb to just see just the thumb squeeze the thumb are you squeezing the thumb huh you see her getting ready now as you squeeze the thumb go like this that's a curl and this is a Ripper causas face now do it the other side yeah and go this way now you're still working out at the shadows or anything yeah yeah that he brought was to everyone yeah I've been injured for a little bit I have a big of the neck injury but I just got any time go car said to buy our place I'm not to prove yourself there's nothing you know just to go there and see the place I used to have those want to talk window days okay they are these are my um I like zzs for the hook because even for kids and also it teaches the it simulates a lot better because that I feel the pad when you're hitting something I'm home the mitts but they can actually see the power in this one rut so when I teach it I teach it like the karate kid hook even all my students to this so you know the credit kid when he heads up on the bow and the he's in the island the guy was yeah the the drum thing right and everybody was doing it right so it's kind of like that because you're spinning your hip and your whole hook comes from your hip and your arm is just a rope and your hand is a rock so I tell people visualize your hand being a rock I mean and your arm being a rope no power in your arm your arm is relaxed your hand is tight and it all starts from your hip but if so it just turns that way and you spin it and you don't stop you go in this direction right it's almost the same on the right hook but it's mainly the left hook I teach it that way so it's like a whip it's like a whip but you're hitting them with a rock that's a most efficient use of movement and then and then the commitment is not there like with a right hand if I throw it hard I'm giving the person my hip so the wrestler can get my hip right when I'm throwing my hook I'm throwing my hip over there on the way past I'm trying to hit their chin but my hips going here so even if it's a wrestler I just step out this way it's easier to defend a takedown I'll commit all the way even taking my eyes off them because it's really hard to counter this hook he might grab her single and I can step through but I want all my foot hook so what I'm doing hope they do it this way and then and what I know when I teach them not coming back first the way I teach them to not pull back forces have this guy try to drop it because you'll see you guys like this and then they pull back too so the hook right every time let's go out here more like I stepped Chuck fighting out here so that from here says he steps in you can just turn it right over so he's right here you don't pull it back first he can reel that all right and so it's ascending it's going to get a connection with some others okay great so this is easy the Android app is much nicer than the I phase it yeah cannot first it happens really annoying so that's gone so now if you go into your piggy bank okay wait a bit that's alright don't phone so I go send that's also good I like this MC thank you this is cool now I can say huh so I say scan the QR code it slow stuff it sure that the the mega is not as good as the jobs you know yet that resolution smells good it's actually the guts of the gs3 a galaxy a salon oh really yeah okay here we go it's got Sony got script it's really not that good it's just big but I got a Grasso ok so now you're not a college or dress you see how it says 1 3 HC is just to send me this in an easy way you could also copy paste that's in an email there's nothing secret about this okay it's like an email address just your identifier on the network and I say 0.005 and sent it asked me for a second password because I'm trying to send money and then you just wait and in a few seconds still sending on this side oh thank you now this was not from my phone to your phone this was from me to the Bitcoin network from the Big Horn Network to your phone so if you were in Kuala Lumpur I would have taken the same amount of time right just mediated by the network now tell me when you could send five dollars electronically to some random person without jumping through hoops and taking seven days and you couldn't I mean this is a lot more than PayPal obviously but even as basically hell it does such a better job mm-hmm and if I wanted to I won't and freeze this by the way no one like PayPal know this is sitting on keys your wallet on this bone holes on the website did this as a backup now somebody wanted to buy more Bitcoin how would they go about doing them two ways for Americans probably the easiest one is you go to coinbase calm I can write it down for you so coinbase is a San Francisco company they work with the banks they're registered as a money transmission they've done some of the regulation they'll connect via ACH directive it to your bank account they'll do two small deposits to verify that it's yours and you give them you know like paperwork's and then once they've got that link up you say buy bitcoin $5,000 boom it's going to say this is the price we're going to get you it's going to debit your account in four days then four days later your account debits the dollar account and the Bitcoin appears in your Bitcoin account and the long time it takes is because the dollar side is slow then once you have it in Bitcoin you can send it anywhere for 40 cents it's the same see but it's great meeting you thank you so much right to talk to you again the Joe Rogan experience train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day [Music]
