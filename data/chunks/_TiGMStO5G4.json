five four three I was good that day within the next day like Oh live and we're live Herb Dean how are you sir I'm good how about yourself so glad we finally doing this you never talked about doing a podcast for the last like three years yeah yeah yeah you know yeah I'm glad to be on it yeah hey yeah what'd you talk to live a little bit yeah I think in the upset this before you have the hardest job in the sport other than the fighters does the fighters obviously they have the hardest job you have the second hardest job referee is the second hardest job in the sport it's a fucking hard job like you have so much responsibility yeah I think you have a really hard job I think to talk how long do you talk for see it's just hours six hours six hours in there and sometimes there's not always something interesting to talk about and or sometimes yes so I think it's amazing to be able to talk about that it's not that easy it's not that hard rather it's pretty easy I mean it's just bunch of stuffs happening and you're calling it and I'm a blabbermouth so I can't shut the fuck up anyway so if there's spots were this it's not that interesting you find something interesting but it's not that it's you know in terms of like what's what's happening is happening you know I mean the guys getting here the guys getting choked there's a lot of crazy action going on and it's really pretty easy if you're a lifelong fan of martial arts like I call it you know as long as you're enthusiastic and you're interested in you know you got to treat you with respect you gotta treat it for what it is you know you're trying to entertain people you're trying to use the your words in the most pleasing way possible you know you're trying to massage people's ears and in a way you know you're trying to you're trying to also represent what you're seeing and how special it is especially great yeah I did it a little bit not for real like somehow you said I do this thing that was for these people black belt TV and I was with don the dragon Wilson and they're just like old fights and we're supposed to commentate this old fight and that's why I think it's hard cuz I was horrible that whole fights are harder because you might know what's already happened so you got to play dumb so it's like almost like you have to be an actor as well as on a fight I think it would be harder to call him old fight yeah cuz in the back your head you'd be like I'm a big a phony yeah I know what's happening it's fight has already happened I think they did that with some of the pride fights I think I think some of the pride fights they they did the commentary after the action cuz you remember when pride yeah I'm on it like 3 o'clock in the morning we wouldn't get it to like a day later or something yeah I remember one time I was the worst is when when your friends tells you because you you you wait you don't look at the yeah yeah I remember I was training I I think I wouldn't I trained with savant one time I don't know if you know I'm sure yeah we have been in the car the whole time rolling I was like when I get home and watch pride and then right before he got dropped him off at his house right before I get to the car goes OH Wanderlei Silva lost yeah we would have to wait sometimes like there was a couple events where I feel like it was like a week or something crazy wasn't it mm-hmm so you had to like stay off the internet for a week yeah which is which is good for me you know I could do it but yeah but you got to also avoid all your friends we're a little Internet fanatics they start talking you're like stop stop yeah I don't I don't know one yet these days it's so bad like if I go and I do a comedy show on the night of like a big boxing match or something like that like my text messages tell me like people start sending me to the big they can't wait to spoil shit to like damn golovkin got robbed I was like what what happen and then I don't get to just watch it I want to just come home and hit the DVR and watch it I'll keep the fuck away from the news yeah yeah yeah yeah that's like let me get home but then I'll know the text messages will get me it's almost like I can't even read text messages yeah yeah yeah damn it it's funny big you don't enjoy a fight even if it's a great fight as much if you don't know if you know what happened yeah no no no you're not go you want to watch it for the first time yeah as it is yeah like I heard they gate she knocked out Barbosa and I was like wow oh shit Emily God oh my god kgs a savage he's a savage man he's that got a special kind of savagery there's something you know like I guess it's all judged on a spectrum there's some dudes are just so ferocious they're just so willing to lead in the battle yeah and to engage and yeah that guy just engages it's a weird willingness to engage almost like almost fearless willingness to engage there's like yeah like yeah and when he's in there getting it that's when it seems like he's at his happiest yeah I rep the fun like that um I've sold like I rough a lot of fights in um in Russia so I refer to fight with this guy bah lieth Marat balaiah vs. Salomon Manas for championship ac√° man these these guys went to war he uh he hurt him early on and had him you know almost put out and then he came back a ballet applause but it was his his I mean as an older gentleman for T pushing the pressure and made a really yeah but you could I saw that energy come out like when he was struggling through the hard times you could tell that like you know some sort of battle Joey was on him you know I mean he's that kind of guy battle Joe joy yeah you hear like oh he's in it you know battle Joy's real shit yeah battle joy Diego Sanchez is all full of battle joy yeah yeah yeah yeah it didn't die with the Vikings people are experiencing battle do I do this oh yeah there's my man right there it is yeah yeah that uh he just look at a fucking body's covered in blood and you know and there's and happiest the happy as they can be goddamn that dude's face is busted up yeah it's some did you see the bare-knuckle fighting I haven't watched any of them yet I watched some exchanges between it's just it's hard to watch it's weird I was a big proponent of bare-knuckle I was like they should fight bare-knuckle because it's ridiculously pad only your gloves but you don't pad up your elbows which enzoanis but Jason Knight versus Artem Loeb off was it was a weird fight to watch man I mean they beat the fuck out of each other I heard they both came out of it super cut up man like a lifetime's worth of cuts in one fight yeah and you saw that it's like I think it's gonna be it looks like I saw their faces that looks like it's gonna be some long healing yeah man I mean these guys beat the shit out of each other bare-knuckle and it's it is kind of weird that you do recognize first of all they're not really there bare-knuckle but they're not bare wrist look look how their hands are all wrapped up to prevent them from breaking which is it's interesting it shows us how fragile our hands really are no no yeah and so that's why I I didn't really think that a bare-knuckle was gonna be that that more intense but when I'm seeing some of these matches they are really intense but at the end of the day I think the bottom line is still the most dangerous weapons I think are the elbows and knees right yeah four cuts for sure and for damage I mean knees that Jon Jones hit uh Brandon Vera let Mills elbows Jon Jon hit oh yeah for sure no no John's from the mount position from the top he's got some of the most horrific elbows of all time maybe not from even from the hat from the guard right yeah from anywhere yeah remember Tito Ortiz never pass card never pass card just beat everybody up from inside the guard smashed him from who's an expert Joe shillings last fight he cut that dude up real bad all from inside the guard was horrible ground-and-pound with his elbows yeah yeah there but I think for the most damage it's like I think it's like a wheel kick to the head yeah like that's the most like when he's remember when Barbosa fought at him yeah yeah that's like the most damage no the wheel kick to the head is and that's man that um yeah who who used to do that we'll kick to the head he just fought guy he's from Canada Oh from Canada he just fought but he didn't do a wheel kick he didn't do it he said get everybody with a spinning back kick and he's a UFC guy or yes for ya short thick guy is it Makdessi jhamak does he yeah john makdessi's Tuchman oh gosh yeah how many people he caught a couple of people with spinning back-kick right probably I mean he's caught people with a lot of stuff he's got a full kickin arsenal but yeah originally a Taekwondo background yeah it's in it's it's amazing that you're seeing all these different styles that it's still even all these years in there's all these different styles of fighting like they're completely different you got like the Ben Askren style still just grab ahold of them use your superior wrestling beat his ass and then you got style bender style yeah yeah just full-on super technical striker tricking you sand traps you know as a person who loves striking like it's a it's an interesting time you know there's so much variety this yeah and so forth because so many things come back and they go back and forth and there's all these things that people are telling you you're not supposed to do this or this isn't gonna work and then someone comes up and shuts it all down to ya know this is gonna work and so it's it's it's so it's always so exciting how about that Russian dude what is his name the guy that only neck whoo oh yes people with a fucking he gets people that Ezekiel from the mountie around him in ezekiel's yeah yeah all the time right yeah he's Iike what amount he gets it from from your guard here in your guard he kills you and he's yeah that's exactly a guy like he's that guy who who everybody else yeah that is a crazy grip the weight doesn't you could see how tight it is that is amazing that he does though he has grip like no because he I mean he he does scarf chokes the scarf hole chokes at people he's done it took quite a few and I seen he laces it up a little different I think he did one and uh but he he does stuff that nobody else does car fold chokes real legit you gotta remember like Josh Barnett tapped out Dean Lister with scar oh yeah he but I think he's done to people with that right he's dead did that one he did guy in the UFC with it and I think he did it - um - crow cop I've refereed him and cro cop in Russia ones in Moscow and he did on the crow cop yeah that scarf all choked if you've got a real like you know like that guy Olynyk does that kind of death grip yeah those guys which brings us to the last fight man yeah death grip yeah that Ben Askren fight dude I've watched that fight I've watched that finish like ten times trying to figure out what happened or whether it was out or whether he wasn't out I was pretty convinced that at one point time he went out and then tomorrow Uman changed my mind tomorrow Iseman showed that we watched the videotape together he's like no no he's given a thumbs up in like shit yeah okay so I'm still kids because the angles I've seen haven't been the best I'm trying to see this thumbs up was the thumb going up or was the thumb in a thumbs up position going this way right like as the arm drops was this okay so when I give somebody a thumbs up like let's say somebody want a job you want this job do you know I mean I don't know like I mean I saw one of them's nobody's gonna know whether he was conscious or unconscious what I saw I saw everything that would indicate I'm seeing an unconscious fighter I see an arm go limp for no reason whatsoever and so that's what I'm that's what I have to work with because that's what you know we don't know what someone's feeling whatever we just see if they're doing something that doesn't make sense and you see an arm go limp at that time you're gonna assume that the person is unconscious we assumed it yeah as the broadcast team yeah thank you guys and and and that I'm supposed to do certain things and like so here's the thing with that choke when I'm refereeing fights you know there's some times where you know some positions are anxiety like you know you see two guys going after leg locks you see a noodle mess of legs and you know you got a you're gonna have to help one guy out and we figure out who's tapping and make sure you're on the right arm when I see some choke so rear naked choke specially got on the back face up I took a sigh of relief my job just got so much easier this guy you know it's not like he's gonna go out and then a second take some extreme amount of damage he may go out I'll have a sec to make sure it's not even a second a half a breath to make sure he's okay and then let it go out and he's not gonna take any other damage a bulldog choke we have anytime you have a choke where somebody's where where there's pressure on the neck and there's bending bending the c-spine backwards like that that's a that's a rough situation for me so I see someone go limp and I know that on top of it they're no longer putting tension on their neck and their neck is just being bad I can't I you know I can't see that I should do something different than that because that's the arm I like to talk to people about this I'd like to talk to people have opinions about fights especially people who are interested in who they know what they talking about because if I always have a situation if I was having mindset that I'm always doing the right thing I can't get better so I'm gonna have to look at something and say is there you know a teachable moment there is there a way I can learn from this and is there a way I could do something different and no I don't think with that same situation with an arm going limp with that type of a choke on someone I don't know of a defense that requires the arm you know I mean I would think the arm should be doing something else I at this time I don't know I don't see that I should do something different you know I'm always interested in always looking and always I love these type of conversations but right now I can't think of you know you know they sell you something it was an amazing fight it was yeah it was I mean first of all was the first time I seen I refereed bit aspirin I don't think I'd refereed him before and you know when you're at his prayer his pressure or something special it's not the normal and the way Robby dealt with it and Robby had him and he had him in trouble you know it's so close to stopping that fight when they're on the ground yes so many times yeah yeah it's a bomb yeah the the the amount of respect I have for those two athletes man it's like so that's so that's the thing is you know we never want to see anything that could make you that have a feeling that it's inconclusive but I can't think of what else I should have done but you know I mean especially for that that fight for those two guys you know yeah you always want it yeah the people would have a feeling of conclusion there well when we talked about on the phone when you brought up the the the damage the possible damage to the neck with the Bulldog choke you might be cutting off nerves and you might be bending the spine and in a kind of a fucked-up way yeah I really hadn't considered that well not what I was thinking of the choke when he grabbed hold him I was just thinking it was a blood choke but you're right like the way you lean in on a bulldog choke you lean back yeah that's a lot of pressure on the neck I've had some chokes where their referee to fight where a guy did one of these moves that you had to move for it a technique where he's been in the spine back Wester it wasn't a twister I think guys have a name for you do you know what that executioner is so that's what it was that's what it is that explains people to what that is is like if a guy is okay tend not to cut you off okay I feel for so long I've never really want to talk about it because people weren't doing it this was years ago I saw it but not there's a name for it I guess it's okay but you hadn't seen a lot of people doing it before right well we we started doing it in tenth planet a few years back it's I think people have done it what it is basically folks it's like our guillotine from the back it's like taking a really like rear naked choke hooks but instead of choking guys this way which is how you would do it which is wrap your forum underneath his neck and wrap the other arm behind his head instead of doing that you wrap your arm all the way around the front like a guillotine hold but from the back and you have ungodly leverage right it's ungodly how much pressure you could put on someone's neck and our friend Scott Epstein he he used it quite a few times so we called it the AB Secutor is that it there om trying to find a picture of one of us arm oh no this is this is the executioner choke this is a different choke he calls it the AB Secutor I look that up and nothing came up okay I think I might have a have a have it here for you the something like this this is a little different this guy had arms in this is different but it's similar yeah it's similar though that's similar yeah you can have arms in yeah that's the same thing yeah this is it that's a 100% it so um I don't know we're gonna show people that all right either way it's a real bad place to be in okay I got it yeah that's okay that's kept Steen that's the the north/south choke but what he would do if he wanted to do an executioner is he would get his hips underneath the guy and get back position this is just a really good north-south show so yes so what I saw was the guy who went north south and here this was years ago at a king of the cage and way out in Wisconsin and he had wow this is a long long time ago he had north/south and he sat up once he had the guy he sat up and pulled the guy's body up onto him in almost a sitting position mm-hm and then put hooks right and then I've done it before where you all roll the guy to the side and I'm just to walk it through and figure out how it worked he put hooks and I was sitting I was like okay this isn't illegal if I stop this fight it's not you know this is not an illegal move but I don't want to see how this plays out and the guy got one hook in and almost the second hook was about to go in the guy tapped and when I pulled him off the guy couldn't move his neck was fucked up yeah he couldn't move you know he had some sort of stinger I don't know what's gone he well he was he couldn't move he was terrified I was terrified okay and then it kind of you know came back and came back out Jesus yeah I know of several guys that have gone paralyzed because of Defense from guillotine or trying to take a guy down right yeah you know when someone gets in a guillotine yeah I've heard of that yeah so so that's why with some submissions you know especially some of the chokes it's like okay things are slowing down and okay things are got a little bit easier for me with that one things are not easy at all that's not something that I want to I want to play what I think if you know I'm kind of disappointed with some some people have a platform I don't want to mention any names but some people have a platform of kind of tossed it out it was something sensational and say oh look at this is he drawing or right I think that's a little bit when it's um dangerous techniques like that well I think you really pointed that out about the neck in a very important way and I think that's something that people should really take into consideration when you see someone you've seen people if you ever ever eat someone who got caught in a twister yeah mm-hmm it's a horrible place to be yeah yeah it's a horrible place to be it's so your neck is so fucked up and there's so much pressure and the fact that your that your left legs isolating your heads getting pulled it feels like it's gonna break it's a fun place to be even for the fact of the way it's set up because it's not like it it's not like a fast thing that catches you off-guard it's a long road to it yeah so you know it's coming and you're like I'm doing this but I know how this is gonna probably end and you're doing some little defit yeah yeah there's a chance Hong Kong Korean Zombie you know I think he got the first ever one on Leonard Garcia I think yeah first it look at that and then I see the horrible dude that is so that is so bad that feels so terrible yeah and there that's a he then there's DEFCON 4 we need to take a rear naked choke grip from the twister position oh yeah okay that's just you just ripping dudes heads clean off it's horrible you know there's all those crazy you like catch wrestling neck manipulation those things to make my neck hurt just looking at them yeah yeah yeah yeah so anyway yeah that's that's why I think you know you can't always say look at things as good or bad but you know some situations I've seen referees and and that one I think is a difficult situation not so I've seen other harder situations but you know I mean like yeah it's an unusual one yeah I mean we've seen quite a few Bulldog chokes that put someone unconscious most recently Raquel Pennington against Ashlee evans-smith amazing fight crazy fight for cow paintings is so fucking tough I mean that was just that was a crazy fight man it was just war and chaos and then with like one second to go she chokes her out and then lets her go and she's she's asleep from the Bulldog choke and Ashlee evans-smith steps up covered in blood and he was fucking crazy that was crazy but there's that one didn't Chris light Lydell catch Tiki in a bulldog choke I think he did hey boys we're gonna garlic that's the side yeah that's the though yeah that looked really tight yeah go to forget that go to yeah that's the world of Carlos Newton chokes out Pat Miletich because this was for the title and he caught him in a bulldog choke and it is like that was that was we had a name for I think we used to call it a schoolyard headlock yeah then somebody called it a bulldog choke at that time I remember people were calling it Bulldog Joe how like they are it already had that I don't know if it had there maybe they gave it to but yeah it's a legit move mm-hmm I get so legit move I'll give you specially if you're a badass current type dude with that kind of grip right all right if someone's neck in that position yeah yes horrible yeah that was um that's why I say that referees have the hardest job because you're you're in that situation you do have to take those things into consideration what kind of damages is doing this guy's neck is he out is his arm went limp okay when do I still I gotta get I gotta save him like ya know that that is the tough part of a you know you were evaluating a situation as always there's different that you know and you're evaluating the threat to the person you're evaluating if there's a threat coming you how much how well can they deal with it yeah there's a lot of stuff going on there and you know we take it really serious I take it really serious it's to me it's um it's I feel that I have a secret trust I feel that it's one of these positions that like our athletes are not stupid people a lot of them could be doing a lot of things with their life and they've chosen this path to and they take time from their family they take time away from other careers where they could be progressing and all to meet their dreams and hopes and I need to balance that with their safety so it's something I think about a lot you know the main arm I'm even in the way uh I talked to my friends you know I mean to always you know I I'm always on I'm always working as a referee any time I'm out in the streets or with friends people are gonna ask me what do I think about this fighter who do I think can be better and I because of this job you're doing you don't longer have the the luxury of having the you know of talking about mixed martial arts in the fun way about who's gonna win and how's this gonna happen because who knows I might referee the fight right and everyone's gonna be on the internet like her referee in the fight and we're having beers yesterday and guess what he told me right right yes just you know so yeah I take it serious no you do it I'm glad you have that attitude what is this one right here oh yeah this is Chrome this is Carl's right here yeah yeah in the transition he grabs the neck and it's a crazy visual too because the photograph the frizzy the Brussels right there right there I'm daddy's crazy muscles and Carlos's arm and shoulder and neck look at Carlos Newton champion of the world right there that moment in that crazy Carlos had some spectacular grappling Rome early on man wild transition he was amazed it's ooh his uh his his explosiveness his agility and he was just he was so athletic he was doing stuff that no one else yeah he also had a really high-level submission game early on yeah we're like in 96 97 a lot of people didn't have that kind of a game and his submission game was tight the the Matt Hughes one was crazy remember that yeah yeah that was crazy that uh go choke where he had him up and yeah he's yeah that was he puts him to sleep on as they get up Matt Hughes like his you here's coroner saying like stand up you one you want he's like what happened yeah yeah yeah yeah double knockout yeah yeah I have that one I have one the king of the cage a double knockout is right here yeah this is look how guy takes him strong yeah he used was he was so fucking strong that holds him up there and Carlos is trying to so he's easy squeezy squeeze it so Matt goes unconscious he's out cold he doesn't know what's going on no one knows what's going on and they get they they so Carlos his head hit the ground when he went down like that and then knocked him out right right right and then Matt woke up from the choke and then like you won yeah what it's great that was a crazy scene that that scene was a tough one that was like what do you do there yeah well that was like the thing about this Robbie Lawler Pat Askren fight like Guzman was saying they got to run it back and I was like it wouldn't be a bad thing to run it back I mean well at the same time you know we got to be honest here like as far as running it back how many of the fights is that happen in the UFC are there because it's exciting what people want to see Joe most right so Brock Lesnar DC is a perfect example right so that's exciting as people want to see it end and some of the segment has been generated by throwing me under the bus but cool but ya know so yeah I think you know anytime that you know the athletes get to do what they do and people are gonna watch it again and people are gonna be excited about it you know I don't know well I don't think it's gonna happen now at least not immediately cuz Maz Badal and Ben Askren have a date for July they're gonna do that July show in Vegas that's a great fight I like that fight a lot right that that fights that's Mazda Dolls in a new place man you could really tell yeah he's something special right now he's something really special when he knocked out til like that I was like whoa we knocked out Cowboys like wow yeah no must with those bees he's so good man and he seems like extra focused right now you know I think he's probably like what is he 35 somewhere in that room huh how old is Jorge Masvidal he's either 34 35 he's coming on soon mm-hmm having him on the podcast soon 35 in November yeah so he's at that stage of his career where you kind of like look man how much more time do you got like realistically as a professional mixed martial arts fighter at 35 years of age you know if you're Anderson Silva you have like three more would he have like three more years of his prime two more years something like that right that's me 38 39 like that's kinda it you know unless you're doing something unless you're doing something to spice up the pot all right you know 40 41 42 man yeah tough to compete yeah tough to keep on the natch yeah that's a whole nother TJ thing's a bummer that's a bummer if you don't know what we're talking about TJ Dillashaw tested positive for injectable EP which is a serious performance-enhancing substance and in some circumstances according to Jeff Novitzky it's given people strokes and I had heard this too that like young guys doing like Tour de France type shit would have strokes because they were taking too much EPO because you know I could be supposed to take one take two fuck it anybody who's gonna do that yeah yeah that you know it turns your your your blood to paint and I think that's what I guess that's probably the discipline right how people were always getting away with things beforehand right is to try to maybe try to do it in a way where there won't get caught but I think that's like you know this much is good and yeah this much more is gonna be better and yeah and we know guys who've done that with TRT you know there was a few trt tests where they when trt was legal testosterone replacement therapy where you would hear about guys test in like 1400s 1470 like which is insane it's like superhuman no person has ever lived that as 1400 like is a natural walking around testosterone level that's crazy hyper human right but they just get these benefits from that well some of these people though who walk around naturally I wonder if they've never been tested though that's true yeah some of these people I see walking around like genetic freaks yeah that dude looks like he was born on Stewart yeah there are some freaks man there's some legit genetic freaks didn't I that would be crazy there's some people that just like Yoel Romero yeah what in the fuck it doesn't matter how many steroids you take it doesn't matter what you do like you do look like that you have to be a genetic freak yeah you know they're and they're out there it's not fair talking about he would say go to Cuba yeah go see the genes yeah but look around yeah what's his name mom fighter from France the heavyweight from France I mean he passes in Garland well yeah Francis in Ghana was a guy who used to be the one who had the the crazy fat would pat pat Barry oh you check Congo Cheick Kongo oh yeah Adonis yeah skull two Greek statue yeah yes always imagine like I want to go to where he comes from take a look around probably super athletes yeah probably a lot of meteors um the TJ thing apparently they went and tested his old fight pissed with Cody too and that tested positive for EPO as well and then Cody start freaking out yeah what do you do if they if they go back like what if they decide to go back hey and say fuck it let's test all the fights here and it finds out that he was doing it like five six seven fights what do you do well yeah and then what do you do if you uh but then it's a whole nother can of worms too because like all the fights and then what about all that because right like we get to test everybody yeah Brandon job and I were joking around last night and I was like test them all and he's going no test him all test everything let's find out let's know what it was let's know what it was and he's like what if they had piss samples from you know 10 years ago 15 years ago like what if they could use you sada style testing right today in the past I'm so glad that all these things are above my paygrade yeah yeah man if I was in the office right now the in charge of that program you have to really wonder where is the line you certainly want to test a guy for a fight that happened a week ago you certainly want to hold you know and check his if some new testing methods come out if there was a fight from a year ago you certainly would check that how many years back to you go though yeah especially if it's not expensive like what if it's easy and cheap today so ya know just run 500 tests on the last 500 championship fights and then you have like 400 fights that you now have to like change the result of yeah I don't know I don't know either yeah yeah that's night I was joking yeah I was saying test them all oh I was taking the the fun position test them all I don't know that I mean look we all know at one point in time performance-enhancing drugs were huge part of mixed martial arts and that's why the UFC stepped up and decided to institute this program I think is a big part of I think it's a big part of professional sports in general sure yeah and I think that um you know combat sports you know has a government oversight that other sports don't have so I think that work on we're gonna be it's gonna be coming up regardless anyway so I think maybe that's whether you you know the UFC took a position right I think of the other sports I mean guys get caught doing things but a lot of the other sports regulate themselves right mm-hmm yeah I don't know I think the NFL regulates itself what are the sport has what are the sport has a governing body like an athletic commission saying hey we're gonna show up and do this or do that I don't know what do they do with baseball I don't know I don't know maybe I don't know I don't know much about other sports but I didn't I've never I've never heard I've never heard of like a we all know about we you know that's something different in our sport is involved we have a commission but not not not like you seen a government Commission but they did yeah they're governing themselves the NFL would have a vote they hand down a suspension they're not fair from this this guy suspension of that guy's suspension and baseball they have like a three-strike rule if the first time is like somewhere in the 10 to 25 game range and then the second one is like half the season third one got for a whole year and if you do it again you're banned yeah but there's no outside and shows up and decides to test champion right just the baseball NFL in basketball aside what's the well let's say you have a big moneymaker in your sport mm-hm and then somebody outside of your company just comes along and says yeah I'm I'm a government by to have the right to test this guy yeah like what happened with John Jones yeah I mean that's that's a perfect example I mean the UFC did not want John Jones to test positive he is the biggest star right now other than Connor and Connor is not active and John Jones is fighting all the time he wants to fight all the time that if that's but that's the only way you ever find out what's really going on as you hire a bunch of werewolves and they just let him loose right let the go check piss go go out there check check every one they checked the shit out of people I was looking at this list of people that homes been tested more than like I think the I think Nowitzki might have put Oh steep a Miocic tweeted in because he'd been tested 38 times really yeah some people it's like in the 40s Cris cyborg got tested a lot yeah and Holly Holm got tested a lot huh yeah yeah Holly Holm got tested a lot a lot of people got tested it's just like you crazy numbers and a lot of them I guarantee you they're waking them up you know get em up like 6:00 in the morning that's what this whatever I mean I don't know what they go but I've heard conversations a little bit it doesn't seem like it I want to make sure you yeah air so they get there really early in the morning and yeah fucked up you're supposed to tell them where you're supposed to be where you're gonna be at and think yeah yeah the problem is if you're training hard that 8 to 10 is so huge you might get hit with a punch if they wake you up after like six hours or five hours it's possible that a punch might connect on you that wouldn't have connected if you got eight that's not precious yeah yeah yeah that's that's real that's real right real everybody knows when you how you feel good in the gym and everybody even if you just lift weights there's days you feel good as days you feel like crap make sure I showed up here well-rested you look well round and I'm hydrated I'm like can we get back I did I did hydrate yeah I don't know it's just it's it's just not smart to stop athletes in the middle of their training camp and wake them up yeah I mean I get the testing but I feel like the testing so sophisticated you could get to them at noon okay just you could get to them in noon you got good testing now just know we don't we I mean I don't know that I don't know that either I'm talking shit yeah because I think the best time right that the best time is that you know maybe at the earliest earlier the better right maybe I don't know the thing about this EPO apparently and this is a Shah was telling me was that they didn't it didn't used to be detectable now the way it is now they've they've got these new methods of detection and EPO is one two that apparently from what I've read don't listen to me I'm not a doctor they can absolutely tell that you injected it it's it's injectable it comes in the injectable form that's what's in the body so there's no chance of a taint or tainted supplement right right it's definitely EPO so that's that's fucked up because apparently that stuff has a giant advantage it gives you an anabolic advantage it also gives you crazy recruitment of powers so like you could train really hard and then be ready to go the next day what do you think the answer is because like for me like this is all stuff that like to be honest I don't really pay that much attention to it because I don't have i also it's out of my wheelhouse to deal with but also it's hard to have an answer like you said like do we go back and keep testing them with these new things coming sis what we do with the history yeah yeah it's just it's very interesting you know yeah what do you do with the history books that's that's what you'd say like at what point if you have samples that date back ten years do you do chest them all what do you do I don't know I don't know how long they keep samples or who has them or how they you know what's the chain of command um I don't know ma'am it's just but if you find out that TJ tested positive for the Cody fight - well Cody sure has an argument there and what if it's the fight before that what if there's a lot of that there's a lot of people who have arguments yeah there's a lot of guys yeah so it's yeah it's up to me it's a shame too because I'm a TJ fan and I think he's a phenomenal fighter and I am I'm a big fan of watching him perform but just it taints his legacy it just does there's no way around it when when you get caught cheating which is this stuff is there's no way it's not cheating I mean this is just cheating right I mean this isn't any accident it ain't your legacy right the guy had an amazing legacy you know two-time bantamweight champion one of the best pound-for-pound fighters the way he beat Hannon Burrell I was like holy shit so he went out and fought hand in Barela he was sparring right yeah yeah his stuff the stuff some of his fights were amazing he's amazing doesn't take away from the fact that he's amazing TJ's an amazing fighter but fuck man - tests positive for EPO and Henry cejudo fuck there's also crazy to watch the progression all the work he did and now you know he was getting better every fight and so he focused yeah but you got to think like how much like if you're on EPO how much does that really allow you to train extra time how much does that allow you to recover what's the Bennett like what is the quantifiable benefit it must be pretty significant because there's a lot of you know the cyclists a lot of a lot of heavy-duty endurance athletes use it and I almost want to try it you know they say that these executives are trying they're doing EPO and entering into triathlons and shit like that for bragging rights yeah just assholes I suppose with money or taking EPO like really I was reading the thing about an epidemic of really boost you that much like okay you're gonna take it and you're gonna notice that you're able to like like the other day you could barely finish a roll a loop around the Rose Bowl a three-mile loop and then you start taking it and you can get what five six miles energy I wonder I wonder I think what it does is it raises your threshold if you're already an elite endurance athlete too I think for them that's what it is it's like they're already looking for that extra edge so they're already in elite endurance athletes already in the Tour de France and they take that EPO and it's like wow just just jacks them up they could just do more work they have more oxygen they don't run out of juice and for a guy like TJ his style is so kinetic there's so much movement explosion some juice dances like he needs that juice it's not like a calm easy game where he's you know everything's fast fast fast fast fast it's crazy it's hard it it's it's a hard one to swallow yeah man so for me like I was like man I was gonna come on Joe Rogan show and see what was he to talk about to make me uncomfortable to talk about maybe some hard stoppages man I've talked about some hard stoppages give me what's the words well let me talk about what I made a mistake I don't want to talk about this I have no answer for it I don't understand that it's like all I'd wanted like I just doesn't feel like a good conversation because all I could do is just it just get like you said it's just gonna take away from what I've seen as then the more I imagine about it it's just going to be more take away and then anything I could say or think about I can't think of anything that solution or our sis yeah yeah yeah I don't think anybody I mean I think we're in this stage right now where they're probably looking at the data going okay what is this signify and how many more people should we test mm-hmm no once once they develop a new method of testing that's the whole reason why they want to keep the old samples anyway there's new more sensitive methods of detecting right are invented and you know about this stuff because I know that you you're a science freak and you're saying yeah dark especially when it comes to anything that can enhance the this life that we have on this earth so yeah sure you know a lot about this stuff well I've had a really amazing conversation with many people about it and David Sinclair was one of more recent ones who did this discussion about life extension and different anti-aging solutions and different things that they're coming up with but what I've come through with is at the other end this there are probably hundreds of thousands of people that are involved in either legitimate supplements or legitimate molecules or testing hormones on people or you know trying all these different things to try to figure out how to get the body to perform better some of them are legal and some of them are illegal and that's where it gets strange she get like the guy like the ball code guy right Victor Conte comes along just rub it on no one's gonna know shit they don't know what this stuff is yet and for a while yeah that worked and then but blah blah you know but while worked everybody's like hmm why is Barry Bonds getting so big you know people just started wrecking like come on man look at me Sammy Sosa look at me in the eye what are you doing you know and they all they're all like exhibited these obvious physiological changes were that you could tell them whenever they were doing was really effective stuff there's hundreds of thousands of people working on that right now all the traps all the time trying to get it bad there's probably thousands of people that are trying to come up with stuff that sneaks past this testing you know did you ever see that's why I just stick to Bikram yoga man it's good did you ever see that Icarus documentary I think I did it was about who it was the Russian anti dog yeah did you see that I didn't see that I didn't see that it's amazing it's amazing the guy who made the documentary the whole thing sort of happened by accident so a guy named Brian Fogle and his his documentary was on he was going to do a bike race and then he was gonna come back the next year and do the bike race on steroids and see what the difference was and so he was gonna document it all and he was gonna have this Russian anti-doping guy and this guy was going to oversee his program and what to take and how much to take and when to take make sure he doesn't get hot it was know yeah make sure he didn't get caught that was one of them I think I don't think they drug tested most of the things that he was interested in doing I think the thing he was doing he just wanted to see how good he could get okay because you said anti Russian anti-doping guys this is this is why this where it gets to in the middle of him doing this this Russian anti-doping guy it comes out that the Russians cheated at the Sochi Olympics and this Russian anti-doping guy spills the beans to this guy and explains the Russian state-sponsored doping program that they state-sponsored and doped all their athletes that everyone was on steroids and that they hid the urine they had two separate legs at a secret secret separate room where they transferred the dirty urine through a hole in the wall and slipped out the good urine and they put it back in place so they substituted clean urine for the urine that was collected they opened up the bottles they found these microscopic scratches on these supposedly on opening caps on these bottles but they ran him under microscopes they look look they were scratched these these things have been open the Russians had figured out a way to open the bottle without cracking the seal its debates they swapped piss I mean it was a super sophisticated stuff and this guy details all of it by accident just because he had hired this guy to give him drug so he could he was just trying to run a document let's see how much better steroids make me at riding the bike and when all this stuff broke he just came in at the right place at the right time and it's amazing it's amazing that's why Russia won like all these gold medals and the Sochi Olympics they were all Jews to the tits and you're saying all of them huh yes it's just for me like it's it's just it's one of those things like I just don't have no an answer to it I know there's always going to be people who are gonna look for an advantage yeah and I think as long as some but there's one person looking for an advantage then I think there's some people are gonna have the attitude that if there's an advantage out there I'm a fool for not taking it the people who don't take it are people who are are gifted in some way or have just a work ethic that goes beyond and it's a matter of pride that they don't do it you know like when you're a sharp kid you don't it's like a matter of pride to never cheat on a test whereas some people that they're go to you know yeah it's it's interesting it's like what is what's legal and what's not legal like what should you be allowed to do you should you be allowed to use cryotherapy but if it turns out that cryotherapy ramps up your hormones what if it turns out the cryotherapy speeds up your recovery that's commensurate with a steroid but why shouldn't you be able to use it you should be able to but I'm just saying cuz I think the basis of that is that some of these other things are supposed to be maybe dangerous for you EPO that sure is that that's the reason that's the base recently that I don't know that but I think that's our base reasoning right I think the base reasoning is cheating well no not just cheating because it's not cheating if everyone's doing it well but for sure I mean so there's supposed to be stuff so like hormones but I'm talking about hormone like you can use vitamins or anything or you can have good nutrition that's that makes sense anything that's going to make you better at what you're doing but there's ones that we don't want people to use because they're dangerous to use for those reasons is the I think that's supposed to be the reason right I do not know if that reason makes sense I don't know whether it makes sense or not yeah but I think that's supposed to be the because we're thinking that come when does it come around say well we don't want you using any artificial supplements vitamins we want you to get all your vitamins from your food what you're doing is you're getting some of your vitamins artificially and it's human being gifted so like there's a line that's being drawn somewhere right and I'm saying the line is being drawn at what is supposed to be safe one at one point it got drawn at that and then became something else maybe I don't know think if they were really concerned with safety they wouldn't let them fight well we're not talking what about all sport I know but I mean especially with fighting if you're really concerned with safety let's just cancel the whole event like someone's gonna get hurt yeah well there's a lot of things I said you know that we don't like the fighters to jump on the top of the cage because Larry yeah it's unsafe well leave just kicking each other kicking each other in the face get off get down off that cage are you doing it Ella Brayton yeah the celebrating thing is funny man let him celebrate yeah they don't like him to do a flip well one guy did he did a flip and landed on one guy did a flip and landed on someone so I get that but it's like man I trust the guy to get kicked in the neck but I'm not gonna trust him to do a flip he's probably done a flip before I don't know yeah I don't know either gage he almost landed on the guy his last fight yeah and that's what that's what that was a fuck somebody else gets hurt now then I get that what if he killed a doctor would get how long how much of a suspension you get if you kill a doctor with a backflip like for real imagine four doctors running in and just going into hell bang and it it would be the ultimate world star video would the beast with with Derrick Lewis would he have that on his Instagram would he keep that on his Instagram if someone died yeah that was a UFC what he might he's so savage his Instagram is pretty funny Graham the game if any you wanna see I saw one the other day of a guy on a motorcycle on his Instagram drove right into a fucking telephone pole guy wasn't paying attention there's something he went off the side of the road and hit a fucking telephone pole full on oh oh just slammed into this pole like fuck man I gotta stay off Derek's ya know I don't like to watch that kind of stuff yeah yeah you know like that guy's never gonna be the same he's either dead or he's never gonna be the same yeah like the one I saw what's that one we saw that guy was gonna do it jump off a house and to oh yeah yeah yeah I don't know what happened here a lot of them were dead I'm a dad man I've got something on my Instagram about the guy who got hit by a dolphin I just put that up there the day I saw somebody put it up hit by a dolphin yeah he was doing some paddleboarding and the dolphin was living life a little bit dolphin was doing his thing so there you know he's paddleboard out and there's a wave coming mm-hmm and then you can see the Dolphins you know they like to surf so they get in the wave they're doing their thing and I think the dolphin sees him he's the only one who decides to come out of the water and get a little air he's like cause it paddleboarder get a little air bow and he fucks him up Wow this packet oh that's 100% on purpose like it makes you wonder about dolphins like it does like oh what an opportunity is 100% I'm perfect yeah I had that I had to put that I had to post that on Instagram yeah that guy's alright yeah he's alright and he fell in the water he fell in the water but a Dolphins heavy yeah side check a little side check what are you doing that moment do you hit him do you hit the dolphin do you punch it you know I have respect no no I better fuck you I'm like this often got the air I'm like eh let you have a little fun yeah cuz how much does the dolphin way and it's his element it's a big animal yeah you got to get back to the shore that is pretty funny though yeah walk that one off walk that one off you know you know elbow it as it's coming at ya you know what a pissy walk you're in their neighborhood oh yeah and this is that's clearly on purpose yeah that's clearly I was like you fucking dummies get out of the way bitch yeah what are you doing you're not even surfing yeah boarding riding surprisingly hard I wonder if his friends laughed the other dolphins yeah he thought it was awesome yeah yeah yeah I went paddle boarding it's not easy I didn't think it was hard did you stand he was standing straight like this you know yeah but that was hard there was a lot of waves it was uh it was a little it was a little wobbly but I was like I thought this would be way easier I fell twice mm-hmm she was making following stop it bro yeah paddleboarding is one of those things where it's like it's you just used mostly using a core right yeah I'm I'm not an expert at I did it once or twice when I was in Hawaii you know hanging out with you BAM looks like if you got like placid water it actually calming mm-hmm you ever surf and I'm trying I'm daddy said I'm going to do this this year taking some lessons taking some lessons who did a little bit I have I've been up on some waves the water was pushing me but I can't I can't call it surfing what I was doing but I was in the water I was having fun that's a respectable thing to know how to do yeah right when you hear someone can surf like well no I've decided that I have to do it I've been living in California all my life I'm paying to be a surfer I live here I pay the the surfing town yeah the surfing tax but I'm not going to the beach and getting my money's worth I gotta go and get it yeah when we think about how many people live in LA how few actually go to the beach right yeah Beach is not that crowded now it's nice and how many fucking people of here one of those things that where people just take it for granted mm-hmm you know so would you you serve no you know I'm scared of sharks yeah so I started the quest last year so last year I took a couple of lessons so this gets a little warm when I'm gonna do it again we were thinking about doing a surfing challenge for sober October I was gonna be like time spent up on a board mm-hmm for the entire month I'm camper contest are you gonna be doing it yeah we haven't decided and I think the guys are they don't want to do the surfing thing if you do it let me know I'm gonna do it with you yeah yeah Oh yellow cold in October wouldn't it maybe yeah that's the idea pussy okay all right come on okay I'll freaking fear October barely it's like - September is happening with this it happens very fast the way I saw this is a navy you era French Navy man jumped off a boat to celebrate and as he's in the water here a shark comes after him it just comes out of nowhere they can't no one can really see it the most sudden right the last second they spot it they're like oh we should get the fuck out of the way it just nibbles I guess but it almost looks fake but the way he reacts I don't think this shit's fake oh it just happened all of a sudden he's just in the water yeah man that's how it goes that's their world yeah look at you can't even see anything in there that that's the thing that freaks you out the most about the ocean is the possibility it's like you're just looking down you don't see a goddamn thing and also the Meg yeah I like that Australian guy remember the Australian surfer and the shark was coming after him and he was just pushing him away he was in there when he talked about why he was looking like he wanted to bite me I decided I didn't want him to so I just pushed him away a little bit oh yeah yeah yeah you just fought off a shark there yeah I didn't want to be bitten so that's a good attitude key yes I'm not interested in this I'm not freaking out but yeah yeah I don't want to be bit yeah yeah you don't want to freak out right you freaked out they they probably can sense it she really spaz out in the water they probably know all this guys scared is fuck these guys smells like food they apparently don't like to eat us is this the guy right here 8 million views great white shark surprises solitary surfer I haven't seen this that's not the one I'm talking about women right obese Emma no don't look right behind him oh Jesus Louise's surf kind of thing no I think he saw it he's like yikes oh man but he's paddling his arm looking like a heel with every time he paddles the arm could disappear on how do you surf yeah but you're so helpless in their world it's like you ever see what happens when a shark gets beached I was looking for this video today we found that one where you were like what just pick it up and throw it out get in the water there's a video I saw of a girl literally doing that just like a chick in a bikini there's a smaller shark but she just grabs my tail Yanks it good for close it out but the problem was with the one you can't sharks don't just start swimming when they get put in the water they need to be it's like they can't stop moving really see they gotta have a little shove the it's hard to do to it they had to drag that shark out by a boat to sort of get it going to get water and its gills so it can breathe and oh okay that makes sense the water's gotta come this way cuz sharks are super weird in terms of their physiology like if they go upside down they go to sleep alright yeah and fuck it's strange and they have to keep moving I don't think they can breathe that they sit still unless they find a spot where there's a nice little dress this also happen to I can't show this one either cuz this is gonna get taken down but it's a girl getting pulled into the water she's trying to feed a shark off of a boat and it grabs her by the finger and just Yanks her and everybody freaks out also what kind of shark is it it doesn't say but also he's in Australia so it might be a great way fuck that yeah I understand why did she think she could feed a shark with her fingers I told her she could and that's a bad idea yeah that that is the worst you know you're probably right cuz you know like when you when you haven't done it before you're gonna make you're gonna ask a reasonable question can the shark bite me and pull it in and there's gonna tell you something in an expert voice like no he's not interested in you you don't look like a seal he's not gonna try to you know about you plus she's probably hanging out with like three or four dudes that want to fuck her they're all drunk yeah they want to show her good experience so let's give it her bad advice she gets half her finger removed walk then nobody's happy yeah you uh do you like going to Russia so much I do I do do you enjoy it up there yeah I do that's a lot of time I don't like it let me say um well I like I like traveling so this is a cool thing I've got to travel so much I've got to see a lot of really cool places and Russia is one of them I like all the different places I've been there st. Peters because Russian one thing is it's like America lots of different places wherever you are like you know this America to some people could seem like a different country and all in different states oh yeah so it's like that so I got to go to Moscow Moscow is one thing you know you get to there's a lot of history a lot of nice things to see st. Petersburg same thing do you feel safe when you're over there well I take everything at face value so as I that's the way I go through life because the files that try to always read some undercurrents or read what people tell me I'm supposed to experience I'm never gonna do anything like I'm a long time ago my travels my oh my I was gonna go do one a butter being show down in Alabama and my parents were like man you're going to Alabama man be safe down there don't be doing all that stuff he do you know it's gonna be different because of you know America and our history with racism and I went down there and I was you know this is what experience you might even tell a story yes this is a story so I went down there I was I was at the show and then some cops come up and they look like the cops from you know in the movies from the South that you're supposed to scare you and I took a picture with them and they're like and somebody else came to take a picture like oh look what we started oh no man I'm gonna do this one that's what I'm here to do I mean hang out with people and I'm in referee fights and you know talk to peoples they want to talk so I took a lot of pictures they were impressed they're saying that you know they've seen other people you know you know tell people know about pictures and the guy all sighted they're like hey um we want you to come out and pull people over with us all right no no I don't want to do have no interest in doing that you know I grew up in LA you know I really like they're like and they're getting pumped it like imagine like you're getting pulled over by Herb Dean bitch yeah yeah and I'm like no no I don't want to do it in these then one goes on some do something I didn't want to make this do something taze me or somethin hurt me so like he grabs us his taser gun and sticks the Taser in my hand she's impressed and I'm like so I started tasing them right he's like I'm like so then after the tasing his but one of the agents and one of the guys who's worked with me comes up and tells him he has some business to talk about with me I go away what do you want to talk about goes man I could see were so uncomfortable with what was going on that I just wanted girls like thanks so I get back to him I give back to my hotel room and I was thinking I was like man you know I'm worried about people prejudging and being intolerant I'm prejudging of these guys because of some history and these guys are really cool if I ever get the opportunity sees guys I'm gonna be you know man and and I did they came like right there and the phone rings I swear and they took me to an after-party and really like yeah they took it like and it was like the place looks like Roadhouse and you know I mean like the whole everything you see like in a movie like like you know some you know your wife's not gonna be happy about that and and I'm gonna catch you next week one of those type of things right yeah drove me to the airport with the lights on yeah I think I think I said the picture of me tasing him I could show it to you it was it was like it was a pretty cool experience so after that I was like man whatever I think I know about things I really don't and so so I take things at face value yeah I've had good times in Alabama I've had good times in the South I think the world's changing too I really do I think there's those parts especially this country we almost everywhere you could find cool peace oh so yeah so I mean if you know oh my god that is hilarious so that should put this on your Instagram can you yeah I can that they wouldn't mind I've talked to those guys about it don't you think he's gonna get in trouble though no he's not gonna he said he's fine he said it'd be all right I thought it would get in trouble sliding window yeah that's why I haven't paid on no you that's why I never did it but I've actually talked so anyway this um yeah that's a big lesson to me like hey don't ya don't don't think you know what's going on you know take things at face value try to be you know yeah you know when you go to Russia you take that attitude like let's just see what the experience are you have your own experience of what Russia's yeah I'm gonna have my own experience to not let it be what anyone else's and also I've been to Russia before I went in 95 I used to work for a company that made documentaries these guys and I ended up going along the help I'm outlets it was the first time I'd ever left the u.s. is a big had a big effect on me so um do you know how to speak it no no no I can do my I can do my instructions in and I know some words I mean I took some time to learn how to use the alphabet so I can get around you help me it's crazy yeah and so that yeah like Celtic like ancient so really is that what it is it's a guy named surreal so it's that I thought what house it's a really care but it's actually named after a guy who made it that's the Russian stuff what is that Celtic stuff that you know that you know oh yeah those those rooms the rooms yeah it's like yeah yeah the letters in Russia like why is it that why would they do it backwards like it's the same letter that we have but it's backwards right right yeah yeah that's a yeah you're talking about is that what it is he has the one that looks like a backwards are yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's what they that's yeah what does that stand for over there just means yeah yeah and we use it like I oh yeah that chaos so that's how you say I you say yeah what's up with that H what's up with that upstairs and H is the end what that's how you use it in oh my god so like when you so once you get used to read so you you always see Peck dopey everywhere you go right what's that lemon restaurant what's that upside down little h2 looks like a candle holder yeah right there that what's that yeah that's upside down H uh-huh what happened there looks like a why so let me take that H and dump it on its head but but it looks like H doesn't it yeah I get flipped it upside down it's a week the look at the e below that like what the fuck is that thing and so that's a yacht that that backwards are yeah yeah so you would say you would use it like yeah and say that word when you use it like a like just how we use i oh i and we use it like i and then we might use it in another reason too yeah Wow yeah so I mean it is kind of amazing how different the way we write is to the way Asian folks do that's right that's a real freak out that's and I I think you just have to learn it right each one of them you have to learn each and every one of those they're Demi it seemed it looks like it's pretty hard to learn well it looked especially if it's not completely ingrained in your memory as a child yeah because I'd up late in life I know there's some people who speak Mandarin but they can't write it yeah get right everything right yeah fuck it's alien yeah that's alien mean that the fact that a whole different side of the world writes that way in these little characters so I do have some help when I go over there I'm gonna tell you something I got married a few years ago my wife is Russian ah there you go and she speaks Chinese so I got Italian region right Chinese so when we go these countries read and write Wow in English or no yeah so we get along some people are good with languages man that's a curette or spanish is better than mine already just got here to have Russian which has its own using the alphabet and then Chinese uses another whole deal and English just does she have room in her head for anything else I know yeah hard drive would be full yeah yeah yeah languages three hard languages right probably the heart hurt the rush is hard and English I'm not gonna say hurt I tried to learn me trying to learn it it's hard there's so many ways to say something because they conjugate a lot I think there's a lot more than Spanish real and that's what I have problems with you know we all get Spanish words we live in LA but conjugating birds that you know she can do it easy because she's like oh because they conjugate so much more hmm yeah it's that's this might be the three hardest language to learn outside of maybe the other one other Asian languages like Japanese is probably pretty difficult I heard the Vietnamese is tough yeah and then you know you got those languages that you look at you know wow that's great and then you see like ancient Hebrew yeah you look at Hebrew language like the way they write like what I don't know I bet Arabic stuff Arabic it's gotta be time I mean how many languages are there if you had to guess yeah dialects and depending on like where you are even at Mexico there's different right yeah speak the same Spanish down there yeah in Spanish yeah like you can under it like because you know I took a couple of Spanish classes right but I can understand people from from you know Spain easier for some reason and I grew up right here it's hard for me to understand their the the way they speak Spanish my friend lives in my friend Adam green tree he lives in Australia and he has a lot of experience with like the indigenous people that live there because he works in a mining company and they deal with a lot of the Aborigines and they have the the groups of people they call the mobs that's what they call themselves instead of like a village or clan or the cause of a mob that's what that's what Aborigines use and they have different languages for different moms so there might be hundreds of mobs in this area uh-huh and they all have different languages so you drive I go how close there's like a few miles I go a few miles you know he would say kilometers mm-hmm it made me 20 100 kilometres like Seeger 100 kilometres and you got a totally different language oh that's all the different languages that map evolved up to exact maybe they're similar right areas of mobs I don't believe so I think they don't know what the fuck each other is saying right right yeah that's why we can't understand Australians right look at that that's crazy yeah I don't know who's documenting all this stuff and what whether or not they've saved these languages and they they have it because it's very likely that like little ones of them will just go you know if there's people assimilating other populations or move out like you might lose these languages yeah there's some what I like about going to Russia too because there's so many different cultures and so many people and I like that I like people like I guess I get the like I get to go to Grozny I've been got to I've been this Dagestan the Grozny is in Chechnya yeah yeah like it's really it was a really cool place I want to show you some pictures went to uh went and looked around well because it's for me what's really cool about it is the energy that people have about developing over there right now because the place there was a war there you know about that right yeah there was a war and right now and they're really building up and they're really excited about it so I think it's just uh it's cool to go and see people who are really a see like kind of a group mentality about moving forward you know so what where exactly is this and what was their war you heard of Chechnya yeah yes so they had a war with Russia a civil war that's what it used to look like yeah now you got a picture of it now right yeah so it's the ah they're rebuilding yeah and there's that rebuilt there they're energetic about and there's pride of inutes and it's cool it's a coded be able to go there and get to see it that is cool to see something in the middle of a rebirth like that right yeah that's beautiful and in that area a lot of places yeah there's a lot of rebirth energy going on oh wow so that's what it looked like right after the war god damn Wow that's a crazy image so you've been doing this now traveling around the world like this for how many years for a long time I think um let me think I mean I see I probably would doing stuff with MMA and traveling for the sport I've got I started probably traveling around to travel around internationally around two thousand three or four Wow and then but I got the trouble around the u.s. a lot before that so that was really cool got to go to places like you know you know that I would never go to an Indiana someplace in Indiana I'd never go or you know and and some of these uh I've got to go all through them throughout most of the states in the US because even before I was doing a lot of the UFC I'd refereed for king of the cage so by the time I got to the UFC I got the referee more fights than anyone I knew I think I met you at a Ken cage yeah way back in the day ken cage we met there I was like mm what I was probably 2001 or 2010 was when they were an Indian Reservation yeah that's probably 2000 because they started there in 2000 you were there at the early ones right yeah yeah when they first started hey Eddie was Eddie was working for them yeah and my friend bud Brett's been was yeah yeah yeah bud man but didn't like Terry decides to have me referee bud but how it was hard on me at first really oh yeah I love was rough on but now but then he start to like me love was rough he didn't want you to referee at first yeah would they Larry was about that's how I started refereeing Larry was Larry was a referee and I trained with Larry and everybody like rail areas or referees or really you know Larry's a really good guy and he did a lot too he went and when he started doing he went and did a little research and and uh you know talk to people from the commission from doing boxing and kickboxing and you know slowly put inspectors in place and things like that and that was my job at first I will go out there we'd bring our guys out and I would like kind of manage the inspecting team and then I think they ended up working me too hard one show I was like man I came in volunteering my time I want to be able to see at least a fight or two and I just come to work for you and Terry was like I'll make it up to you and I want to try ref I was like let me I'll try referee if I he goes okay do that and then I remember the first time I was like man I think when I was like wow I really signed up for something here yeah I mean you know yeah it was but yeah that's kind of how it happened when did you you you had how many fights a job I've had I think five and when did you decide did it was it because of refereeing that they decided there wasn't it was a conflict of interest for you to continue you yeah well see I was never like a real serious competitor it's like I like to train I like to do that and then every now and then I want something to train for you know I mean and so give me something to motivate me rod be fun to do it you know right and what happened is someone told me that it was a conflict of interest and that I needed to pick one or the other and no one's gonna miss me as a fighter so you know that's that's kind of how that worked out well you definitely one of the best in the world man I get happy when your referee in a fight so know that it's gonna be handled the right I mean I agree with you on virtually every single time you and I have had a discussion about what should or shouldn't be done the one thing that drives me crazy about referees and not you but some referees is breaks and stand-ups that don't necessarily need to happen when guys are working towards something and you can see there's like a battle the guys trying to defend guys trying to get out of half guard get in the mount and and then you'll see a referee come over and just separate it because the crowds booing or because they don't understand what's happening how much of a struggle it is right especially clinch work exactly guys get a guy up against the cage there's they're working for something they might stall each other out but eventually someone might break down I mean and this is how a guy like nurmagomedov wins fights against elite guys this is how Randy Couture won a lot of fights it's a legitimate tactic yes it doesn't look fun for you mm-hmm you know a guy beating a guy up against the cage just short elbows knees to the thighs you might think that that's not enough but that's that's a that's a good way to wear a dude out and you keep doing that until eventually you break them especially when you're someone likes deep eh yeah yeah I think and the thing for me it's helpful as I do my pre-flight instructions you know so I tell the fighters what I expect and what to expect from me you know I mean so I don't want to I want to interfere as little as possible yeah I know and so that's that's my goal and so I you know I give them instruction if I tell them you know hey work work or what I expect and you know I expect you to do something - I'm looking for big shots or advance your position and then they'll ask me like well how much how long will you leave something stay like oh well what is still if they're both guys relaxed that's still but like you're talking about even up against the fence in a clinch especially that's where a lot of things are really getting decided yeah and so we have to really see that play out you know especially a lot of the guys are you know if they're they're striking at each other maybe in some of the other weight classes you know then they don't have that one punch always you know some of the guys do but not everyone does and that's where things are going to get cited in that clinch and if there's attention if there's a tension there we need to see where that's gonna go and let it you know work itself out I'm so glad you said that that's the perfect way to say it and that's absolutely 100% agree and there's there's moments where it changes the course of the fight where it's really unfortunate you didn't referee tomorrow you semana Demian Maia did you and I don't think so whoever did that one we don't even have to pull it up but there was a moment in the first round when Demian Maia got ahold of camar√≥n was trying to take his back standing and he had like one hook in and the clinch and he was hanging on to him and the referee decided not enough was taking place they separated him I'm like oh you can't do that so hard to get ahold of I wasn't me who did that taemi am I about to get you back whoa hey no no that's not going anywhere that Sarah went crazy you know he has that um that podcast he does with Jim Norton uh-huh and he's like you just don't do that to the guy like he's got a hold of him like he might take his back here like yeah like in you know you saw what he did with lymangood when he takes your back yeah and Lyman Goods a beast but when Damien Maya gets a hold especially early in the round right fresh and he's got his back already and then any other a lot of interesting take down from there to while he's like he does goes back and forth with halfway taking your back and then one you're defending the takedown he starts taking your back and yeah when you go back then he's back working on yeah so no he works really he works at a real interesting pace there you know it's stunning to watch him go through guys like when he went through Rick's story I was like Jesus Christ like Rick story's a powerful wrestler yeah when he takes his back and he gets him in that neck crank and you see the blood squirting out of his nose like whoa yeah this is this is a heavy fucking squeeze this guy ass and then he did it to Carlos Condit who else he's done - it's done - a lot of guys he gets old you just said wheezes the life history and when he gets on top he seems so heavy Magni when he had ran through Neil Magny like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just such high-level jujitsu yeah that was on top he's just yeah just no air just smushes you it's um I'm such a sucker for a specialist whether it's a style vendor specialist was striking specialist or Demian Maia specialist I love watching the guys that are like at the tip of the the ability in whatever their discipline style bender man he seems to be getting better every time yeah yeah well for him it was just about avoiding takedowns like he was so high level as a kickboxer he's so clever like he's he's like in my opinion probably the very best in the sport at setting traps yeah he like gage you see what you don't know is getting some information yeah it's not it's not random and I like the way he deals with takedowns I mean he knows where he's safe and where he's not you don't see that he's panicking he's like ask a minute this cook a minute but you know I seen what I seen with this attempt looks like I see what this one looks like walking it through all right now my party's gonna start yeah here's a guy I talked to one of his guys he trains with I was refereeing some fights in China and it's one of the guys who trains with in New Zealand and this guy was telling me so much and showing me different things about angles they do and things that they set up and they're striking that I'd never knew or thought about and this was before I I saw him start fighting in UFC no I just what everybody was aware of him but he hadn't been in the UFC yet and man these guys these guys are really smart these the the techniques like this sport is growing so much you know yeah yeah that's what I was saying like when when you're seeing like really high level super technical strikers like him like who's a world-class Labine it's good he easily could be world champion in many organizations as a kickboxer you see him now in the UFC and see guys having to deal with that it's like okay this is like the Anderson fight it's a great example we know how great Anderson is yeah I still look pretty good against nyle bender but you could see why style bender was special in that yet did he I'd like another level of trickery yeah you know and I mean and stuff John Jones is doing mm-hmm yeah yeah but so well you can't call him a specialist because man he does so many different sounds right so that guy is really like a kung fu movie right where he changed out yeah yeah and then they do they do something yeah yeah well John such a good kicker - I mean that's that's interesting he started out as a wrestler cuz like how much of his style now is Kineo it's a giant part of his game his utilization of those long-ass legs right and he's it's interesting like how how much time he looks like he's getting information on right yeah then all of a sudden the atom then when he shifts gears it's like okay I've gotten a lot of information here's nothing to do with it yeah yeah he's gonna fight Thiago Santos right yeah and that guy goes for broke I mean he goes for broke it's it's interesting to watch him fight because you want to talk about like a wild reckless dude like Santos is dangerous with John John should and probably will be a heavy favorite but Santos he does he throw something hey make no no it's gonna be it's gonna be it's a great fight to watch yeah that guy's gonna go out on a shield no he and he puts pressure I think the interesting thing about well for me what's interesting when I watch any of the heavier guys fight is that you know they really have to understand where they're safe and whether or not that's something that John does really good yeah how'd it be in the pocket in the places where he's safe and what you know and where yeah he's the best Everett utilizing his reach no one's ever been better at controlling reach and then never letting a guy reset when guys try to reset bammy kick some Bama kicks him again BAM he kicks me yeah he's like he knows when you're trying to get comfortable when you're trying to settle in and that's when he kicks you I think he senses it I just starts battering you like he sees like no no no brakes no brakes no brakes no brakes no brakes like the angles no brakes what about a man max Holloway oh dude he's the king of no brakes pours it on you just keeps coming yeah it keeps coming what happened he pours it on you he keeps coming and his fucking combinations several high-profile fighters confirm for UFC 239 including michael Chiesa versus diego sanchez horrified shit there's one michael Chiesa pack a lunch bro mm-hmm in ghana versus dos Santos Oh Sanchez that's it that's a great one so that's Vegas yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah that's that's good yan blue ovitch versus Luke Rockhold that's a great fight to Rockhold's first fight at light heavyweight how'd you learn how to say that blue Hovick [Music] I think I listened to someone else say and I just repeated the noise I had I was a beat it's a beat muggle made sharp off oh yeah uh-huh yeah yeah that dude who he's nasty he's fun to watch yeah yeah he's fun to watch that did touch some nasty shit in there he's so technical so so crisp you know and again long range yeah yeah yeah but can take it two men mean he ate some bombs from Jeremy fucking Stevens who's one of the biggest bomb throwers in the division yeah Jeremy has some fucking weapons yeah I know that yeah yeah that was I remember when that fight wasn't on I was like man I couldn't wait to watch yeah that was a great fight it's close fight too close fight I mean I think the decision went is a beat and Jeremy disputed it a little bit but I never had a close fight very good fight but I think the decision was correct but the beat is um you know he's a interesting style right really a grappling crazy trip yeah yeah yeah huh a lot of crazy real old-school traditional martial arts kicks throws real kicks and 360 roundhouse kicks and shit right right right you know a little a lot of grace lot a lot of balance there yeah there's so much talent now I mean I can't remember a time where there was so many elite high-level fighters that were like so exciting to watch there's so many good guys that's like really good guys leave or there's the slipping through and this sport is growing so much and growing yeah growing all over the world some of these like that's one of the cool things about the travel is you get to go see and some of these some of these guys some of these athletes and other parts of the world have a huge following and no one's ever heard of them here this is one guy I'm marrying Akbar Akbar he he has I think like almost a million followers on Instagram really yeah no shit easy UFC guy no no no that's I'm saying he he's the guy who's never fought in the UFC where is he fine he fights in a ACA no kitten does the Russian organization yeah what's it called ACA yeah what does it mean what does it stand for absolute championship achma ahkamaat what does ahkamaat mean I think there is 1.6 million but look how handsome you know cuz I'm a referee to fight an either by John where he was at sea yeah heavyweight yeah yeah yeah how much do you weigh yeah he's a big heavyweight do you think he's a piss test you know I'm not living in the man's pocket so I don't know if anyone can pass a piss test I really don't know I really know that snot something I'm I'm not an expert on that I'd leave that impression I think that's he likes wrestling uh uh I think a lot of fighters like Preston right now they're seeing Ronda Rousey make that cha-ching yeah yeah like hmm I could do that do you watch Pro Wrestling I watched occasionally when Tony inch cliff makes me mmm why do you watch it no no yeah yeah I didn't think you would I go get it either I'm not yeah I was I loved it no when I was a kid I mean when I realized it was I'm yeah I liked it when I was six I liked it a lot and I then don't get me wrong I don't know that I don't respect what they're doing I used to work out in an Okie dojo and I did some pro wrestling workouts with him just to see what they're doing and they're taking those bumps and some of the stuff they would do off the like there's no way I would be doing that with my body so all respect to it yeah it's just that this doesn't catch me I feel exactly the same way they they should be respected as being incredibly tough that sounds very difficult child yeah athletic talented the guys are really good at it that make it look like you know like art yeah I'd like Jimmy Superfly Snuka when I was a kid I loved that guy yeah Bob Backlund remember him remember the Iron Sheik oh yeah of course I realize yeah yeah yeah yeah there was some fun times but yeah I prefer real things yeah I mean I get it I get the appeal you know but I it's like once you watch really good fights it's hard it's hard to give a shit about fake fights yeah and I just yeah I don't I don't get it I didn't know I didn't get it yeah yeah but you know what some people love it and you know that's the thing you know some people know every bit of it every stick and you know I don't know but I think this is probably you know who knows I might it might catch me because you know I'm always trying to get hip to stuff so if there's something I don't enjoy I like to do it with somebody who enjoys it so I can kind of watch them and kind of learn how to enjoy it you know I mean I like what's the part that you like about this yeah I mean or like I didn't listen to a lot of country music but then I I well I used to work with gladiator challenge a lot and Ted Williams was like you don't like country music so he gave me country music education what's the matter what you don't like tell you can say this ain't good muna I was like okay hey I got you what did you get into well I started when I start grabbing do I like the old stuff I like what kind I like um Moreau I like Chris Christopherson Sunday morning coming down yeah yeah and I like your boy your boy was on your Sturgill yes Sturgill I like Stargell so that's it is deeper a bad motherfucker yeah I Seton Jesus play with that song as well as a well written song man he's a trip of a story man he was like working regular jobs working on a railroad and his wife told him you can't make a living doing music she's like you know you don't suck at this mm-hmm so she told him to go for it and now he's like one of the biggest music artists in the world right that's crazy and then what didn't take long either man yeah yeah that that Turtles all the way down like that so that's a really cool song first time first time I met him like almost immediately after meeting and we got high as fuck into the podcast barbequed it's been a couple of times where you know he called me up after the podcast I was like man I didn't even know what the fuck we were talking about for the first 20 minutes because we were so high because if you live in Nashville like he lives in the Nashville area mm-hmm you go out there and get the weed they have a pretty good weed it's okay but it's not California weed like California weed is preposterous right right if you're if you're not used to that stuff and you smoke that shit and try to be on air like all of a sudden now you're on a podcast or on air and we're talking about like yeah I don't think I could keep up I was like absolutely gene can you keep up with a Joey no I went on his podcast man and he packed enough I think to get a village high he put it in this bowl was like and just tore it up emptied it out did it again and then ate a gummy bear was like all right started put on Pink Floyd he's a real deal man yeah you know I mean he's free Joey Diaz is free yeah you know I'm not that free man I'm not that great I wish I could be I you know and I have I have I I have respect for it just being like you said that freeness yeah yeah a lot of people are free yeah but I'm not as free like I think your boys lie your people seem kind of free like who I think Eddie Bravo seems I was a free thinker man yeah yeah and yeah and others yeah no it is that's why his jujitsu so creative yeah he's he's so open to ideas you know what's I mean he's he's also like he doesn't like losing so he's like oh no no I'm gonna figure out how to win I'm gonna figure how to beat this so he'll like Khan like he'll like look at a position and he'll have some weird unorthodox take on how to get to a better spot or how to control the position better or how to finish from there and like you see like damn like his now he's working yeah just everything you know if you have a conversation with him about about stuff he is you learn a lot just from every time like okay I know you do you gotta take away something from him dude he's I can't do one of the bits that he's doing but he's good he's doing stand-up now and some of his shit is really fucking funny man he made me laugh really hard last night really I would have to do the bit I would have to tell you the bit to show you like I've been someone who does that yeah I've seen so it's funny man it's getting really funny getting more and more comfortable doing it he was always funny yeah I mean he always used to make me laugh but he tried it way back in the day tried stand-up many many many moons ago like fucking 2003 or for something like that he tried and it just wasn't for him he was too busy with other stuff you just see try he was gonna try it and then get good at it but he got he bombed a few times he's like fuck this and then he tried it again I want to say like four years ago was it about that three years ago four years ago somewhere in that range and he's been doing it steady since he's actually pretty funny man like like like made me laugh like really loud because I've seen on social media that you guys have some shows where like he's on there you a bunch of yeah Sam Tripoli shows yeah a lot of Sam shows he does a podcast tinfoil hat podcast Sam and we're all real good friends and Sam is also a conspiracy nut so they get together and talk about the Illuminati and shit yeah I have friends like that yeah yeah yeah I go back and forth with conspiracies I have a love-hate relationship with conspiracies I love some of them some of them are fascinating some of them like okay what the fuck happened there you know but and then some of them work I can't do this anymore yeah I know when I was younger I used to think about it but then I think when I had a kid when yeah enough time for that no time for nonsense becomes very precious this becomes food how exactly not only you're worrying about the fucking Illuminati I don't even know what that means what's the Illuminati they exactly I'm busy I gotta go but I get how people get sucked into that rabbit hole mm-hmm you know ya don't know no I could see it I went into a rabbit hole the other day but with aliens I watched three alien documentaries in a row I watched this one on Bob Lazar who was a guy who claims that he worked at area 51 it's very compelling very interesting is at the top less than one you would suggest yes that's the one I would suggest it's called area 51 you have hablas are area 51 and flying saucers I think it's called it's on item 1 write it down it's fucking good because there's some things that this guy knew that it's almost certain that he worked where he said he worked that he worked at area 51 the question becomes he told all the truth about all these things that have since been proven to be true weird so he gave he gave first cut at those truths right yeah was a long time ago to he came out about this like 30 years ago there was a Nevada Bob Lazar he would he would he was worried about his life here's what happened apparently the guy was working in this area doing research for whatever the government wanted him to do at area 51 what he did there who knows he gets fired for his job and then takes his friends to this viewing position in the mountains where they can see them flying flying saucers he was telling them they fly them out of this base I'm gonna bring you guys we're gonna watch it he they videotaped this on an old-school VHS tape you can see these flying saucers flying around area 51 and he says these are not not being piloted by a by aliens these are being piloted by human beings but that these are real devices these things are real they're it's a real vehicle and they got this real vehicle from some other some other civilization from somewhere in space and they had nine of them it sounds like total horseshit when you hear it but then you watch the video and so the questions come like well how did he know that they were gonna be flying these things up there how do you know they were gonna do him on Wednesdays how do you know he could see it how did he know how did he know about the biometric data how did he know about element 115 he was talking about this element this man-made element that it's it's a real element that they've now identified but when he was talking about it in 1980 no one knew what the fuck he was talking about or 1984 or whatever it was when he was when he first got interviewed about this so when this guy is bringing this stuff up today and people are looking back at all the different things that he said that have since been proven to be true especially the existence of area 51 the the government had to at some point in time in the 90s they had to say that they owned the base and say that it did in fact exist so that they could brought in the top secret area or the do you know like there's a do not enter zone or they'll pull you over and arrest you if you get past a certain spot they wanted to broaden that area so people couldn't be watching their crafts fly around like Bob Lazar was and when they did that when they expanded the territory that's when they had to actually admit that the base was real so he was proven to be correct on so many different things that he said like he explained how they get him out there explained what the research was and he said that they had these things that run on some they manipulate gravity in some way and they're very small because these aliens are very small little creatures like a child like a eight ten year old child huh it makes you go what the fuck man so he talked about he said well he saw them he knew how they operated Wow the things that he knows that are true that turned out to be true that how could he have known them if he didn't work at area 51 of the most compelling aspects of it and the fact that area 51 was at one point in time by the government's take it didn't exist and then it was like a legend and this was when he was talking about it and so watching this documentary and seeing this guy thirty years later still basically saying exactly the same thing but with a bunch of things have been proved had been proven since yeah yeah that is intense it's a trip man I mean if the government really did at one point in time have some craft that it got from another planet what the fuck man but the thing is like how would we take that how do you think people would take that if they found out how do you think they'd handle that hmm if they really knew there was something that was so sophisticated that it could visit us from another planet it could be here in minutes she landed the White House lawn do whatever the fuck it wanted to you couldn't even shoot it with bullets how would people take that I think that people would just keep going on like with every other scare I think so yeah I think okay there's um there could be a meteor that's supposed to hit us right right I mean how people take it I mean that's what they're saying my sense would happen I think it would be a fuck fest in the streets yeah but that's what they say they say it could happen I mean right I know if you saw one coming yeah but no I'm saying not if you saw one company because you don't see the alien comin if people realize yet these guys could show up right I don't know I'm really conspiracy that well I remember I did remember that remember that when they would be like these booklets of like Xerox stuff corn like the one about AIDS and stuff like that uh-huh maybe that one yeah that one had me going for a while the AIDS conspiracy doctors memorandum oh yeah yeah people used to hand those out right yeah I tell people that AIDS was a hoax not a hoax that it was like all this of memories got yeah a government conspiracy yeah yeah that is right way out for a while yeah remember I was video I was mainly I was making copies and passing along guy that blew my mind well there was a one doctor at one point in time that was trying to say that that HIV does not cause AIDS and we had him on way back in the day early on was that guy's name Duesberg dr. Peter Duesberg yeah yeah that's what it is our Matt just remembered it he is a professor at the University of California Berkeley I believe I think he's a biologist mm-hmm and his take was that HIV does not cause AIDS that what causes AIDS is a compromised immune system that HIV is actually a weak virus and it shows up in the immune systems of people that are already compromised that's why you're finding it in these people that it's not the cause of their immune system being confidant compromised it's a symptom of it and that what these people are really dying from is their their whole system being fucked up by drugs that either they're taking AZT which destroys their body you know it was a cancer medication like a chemotherapy that was so powerful is killing people quicker than the cancer was and then they switched it over to using it with people that had AIDS because in in the early days they would call AIDS the gay cancer right there was all these different like they were trying to figure out what it was and what it did and early on this guy was saying this and we had him on the podcast and people got so mad there they were so mad that giving this guy a platform to spread his his propaganda and his lies and I was like wow but he is a professor right he has done like legitimate cancer research he's you know I mean don't you want to listen to him and I wanted to get someone on to debate him but nobody wanted to debate him it was like trying to get someone to debate a Holocaust denier like nobody wants to give them the platform and what he wants to talk to them which I understand but those those kinds of I mean it's very highly unlikely that all these doctors are incorrect and are hiding the fact that you know and then now the fact that they've got these HIV medication so basically they can take people and make them HIV negative now right like a couple people have tested hiv-negative after medications yeah I don't know I'm too stupid too stupid to understand what's really good yes that's that's for me that I know that I'm not like when I watch some of those things you know they some of them they'll like lead off with these statements and we all know and we know this I'm like I don't I don't know yeah I don't know yeah there's too much to know yeah yeah how did we get in the subject of AIDS I don't know we're talking about conspiracy theories oh yeah that was the one that I that one that one when I was out back in what lady nine or something 88 when those little pamphlets are going around yeah well marijuana and conspiracies go together what cookies milk yeah yeah yeah there's nothing like we that starts your gears turning and you start thinking that's why a lot of people start thinking conspiracies ER against them too right you get high and they start thinking of the world's closing in on yeah everybody's watching you surveillance but you don't probably don't feel like that when you get high no I'm okay yeah yeah so sometimes I kind of like it though mmm you know why I like it cuz it ends and when it ends you feel great it's almost like a brutal brain workout like you you go digging deep into your psyche and find out all the things you're scared right yeah no it's like it's work yeah it's worth a little work you're like taking a look at you so gone you know I never thought about me from that angle before yeah I like to do it I better clean up yeah yeah clean up your shit yeah yeah especially if you're I think if you're in a high-pressure job and you're very busy like I am I think those those little insights are very important because you can get caught up in your own bullshit and what you're trying to do and not think of the impact you're having on the people that around you right yeah yeah and then then that marijuana goes Wow yes yeah and you impact a lot of people to send people especially with you know like you know because I have things where like in my philosophy might change or a little thing and you're talking to a lot of people and like I don't know if I feel like that anymore yeah yeah you could switch right yeah you could definitely switch your opinion I do I switch my opinions I do too yeah well I don't know there's anything wrong with that either I think everybody should be more flexible with their opinion I mean obviously there's like rape is bad yeah murder people yeah don't steal obviously those things normal stuff that everybody agrees on but then you get to a certain point and I think we get real married to the idea of our opinions being right and we get real married to the idea of winning an argument with our opinions I think that's when things get kind of squirrelly because then you start trying to calculate an argument to make your position sound better right and that's in your position for what it really is and then also being just trying yeah always trying to figure out and learn a little something it's not going away from it not to be a knee jerk that's the thing you don't want to be a knee jerk exactly yeah you know when I won I went real back and forth on pretty recently is a universal basic income when I see this guy the universal being yeah Andrew yeah yeah he's running for president platform that's part of its platform right right and I had him on the podcast really enjoy talk to him really really smart guy very cool guy but when I'm talking to him and I'm thinking about it I'm like boy I don't even know if that's enough like what what they're doing the idea behind it like they're the ideas that automations can take all these jobs hmm automated cars grass start I mean it's gonna like wipe out a shitload of jobs apparently and the idea is that if we don't have some form of universal basic income there's gonna be chaos but having just some amount of money so that people have their needs taken care of you always have food you always have shelter just you're taken care of now go pursue your happiness the the real problem with that though was who was it that we had the other day where we're talking about meaning about people want it was it Nick Christakis so it was people like people need meaning yeah their life who was that it might be him I don't think it was I think it was someone else who was a bench peer oh no I don't think it was but anyway whoever it was we were talking about it we were saying that does that give people a sense of meaning though because people like like you for instance you you know your responsibility as a referee you know how significant it is you know you're one of the best in the world when you're refereeing a high level championship out when the fighters finding out that herb Dean's our referee they get excited like oh good one last thing I have to think about it's like you're you're you're putting so much of who you are into that job do we know I'm looking for a mmm no worse but I mean look that's that's gigantic right you know I mean that's I know that that's a oh yeah you take that very seriously yeah maybe that was it no I don't think so anyway you have meaning you know and what you do if you just got money to lay around mm-hmm and someone said well just go pursue your goals okay but I think what people really like to do when they're really happy is make a living doing something that has meaning but get in yeah to them I don't know if it would smooth things out if you just gave people money yeah I don't know how that would work I don't know how I don't dare that when I saw what he's talking about I don't I don't that like that one that's I'm not smart enough for that one to know how that's gonna work but he seemed to think that there was a lot of ancillary benefits like things like lowered crime rates lowered you know that you would have lowered instances of disease lowered instances of people were injured doing certain things like you if you had money and you made sure that people had a certain amount of money it actually might cost the public less money I can see where he would come from with that yeah I think there's something because there's there's a lot of people or probably you've met a lot of people who say that money isn't everything and there's these things that mean this but it's only once you get enough money where you can step off the off the little hamster wheel hamster wheel for a second to like start thinking about these other things yeah money is overwhelming then yeah I mean if you don't have it it's over I remember when I first got a development deal when I was doing stand-up and I got a big check and I just immediately felt like Oh like literally like a weight was lifted off my back there's some weight like I had a weight vest on I took it off whoo mmm like now I don't have to worry about food or rent or gas or anything for like at least a year right right I was like I don't have to think about it and then I remember I think it got it feels so free it feels so different because most people's lives were in debt most of the time they're they have this constant fog of pressure oh yeah yes around them about those song hills those goddamn bills are always there it's creeping on you and then you get credit cards and your max those motherfuckers you're still trying to live these dreams that people are given to you that you're supposed to have least like you know these symbols these status you know people trying those like it's really and that's even weird because you know I'm not really into that stuff but then again I'm on television so I don't know you know maybe that's why I'd like to think I'm deep yet nah don't need a Mercedes man I'm just you know I just drive you're just driving my car my 2005 you know that's not you need to get from point A to point B but you know maybe that's why I don't know I don't know man you see say you have a 74 Bronco too soon you must appreciate cool shit see that's what I'm saying but that's the thing I was about to get rid of it my friend said because I was like man it doesn't mean what it used to mean to me but I do appreciate it and now I'm like my friends like hey I'm gonna hook we're gonna hook this thing up ah so I was like all right I sent it to him he says I'm gonna give you a deal we're gonna get it all hooked up right and but it does I will admit that like before it meant a lot more to me than it does now Kevin Hart came over here was a Bronco the other day I saw his Bronco here's a red one his is better than mine doors is - his is dope his his makes me realize how cool the convertibles are when they're done as convertibles right like he's just driving around with no top on him like oh that's so nice that's what that's how I'm doing mine cuz I got in mind as a convertible and I wouldn't I got a top because I want to do a hardtop on it look at but if you're taking it on the off yeah that is that is a nasty Bronco you know he has his own car company that does this shit he does this shit with his own company he's got like a hundred businesses dude I never met anybody as motivational or motivated as Kevin Hart saw the I saw I follow him on social media and that man is yeah and I saw what he was talking about you know talking to you about - yeah yeah he's he's very motivated yeah he's the most authentically positive person I think I've ever met and look at that he's got an Eleanor Mustang that's a fucking beast man they made that at his place too so he has his own fucking car place that makes him cars look at that I mean the dudes off the charts but more importantly like his outlook like his healthy positive outlook in the way you know he just goes through life it's very inspirational just oh it's very positive uplifting mm-hmm like he's all just trying to help people and all these different facets of life help people with financial advice help people with motivation help people to get the bullshit of their life get the clutter out of their life ya know I I even like when I first started really like it was when he was doing that thing where he was meeting up with people to run like yeah I like that I like that let's much that travel and I used to like to run you know well you could always do that other people do that my friend Cameron Haynes does that all the time he'll invite people to run with him places yeah yeah my thing with the yoga is I've been decided to do it when I'm on the road so that's been what was I got to do it and um you go Atlanta this weekend no what no no no but didn't get invited what the fuck is to not won two world championship fights yeah yeah damn you didn't get invited to Atlanta are they gonna use it landed guys I'm not sure if there's a good Atlanta guy was a referee were like grace Blake Christ yeah yeah he's a good guy um there's um isn't that Matt gryce's uh brother hazy I didn't know that I don't I think one of the reasons they use what's his name who's old so sometimes they use what's it remember that fighter he used to have the black dude with a like a patch of gray here but that it's like it makes his hair look real cool what's his name Islam was a real good fighter his son fights MMA now he came from a kickboxing background on a while I'm drawing a blank on his hammer you drum this is embarrassing it's embarrassing because he's gonna be mad me like like you don't know me I know him a villain alright alright that's the weed hanging out with Joey Diaz will fuck your head up month's podcast no it was like it was probably a couple years ago okay but it was never recovered I'm safe yeah dude he'll change your life over in that weird room gives people those stars of death I don't know you have 250 milligrams of THC that's crazy 250 milligrams yeah that's crazy that is a crazy amount yeah that's not right yeah I know you are trying to jostle your memory in some way we'll come back we'll come back to it yeah there's a lot of guys who are former fighters that that I think Frank Trigg is doing revery work now you know mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah Frank Trigg is really good I would like more guys to do that and I was love would love to have more former fighters be judges you know who I saw who was really good who came took my course is um Chris Leben yeah mm-hmm good referee well he's doing he's been doing stuff in camo and he's he's coming along he's gonna get nice yeah he just won in a bare-knuckle boxer I saw I saw saw some clips of it it was dead I mean it look good yeah well it's good for him to like it with his style his crazy style that's that's actually a great move for him right you know but he retired from fighting cuz he didn't want to fight anymore I mean he just but I guess a little bit of time off and he's like fuck it mm-hmm you know there was two organizations used to be a different bare-knuckle boxing but they went under and when they went under they owe him like 90,000 yeah they cheated him yeah yeah that's rough in his recourses just let people know yeah these guys won't be mighty did you see the clip that Crooklyn from Brooklyn on Twitter put up of the owner of bare-knuckle boxing saying that a fighter didn't fight hard enough yeah I saw that yeah I and and he was proud of he's like this is the way we do it see if you can find her tweet yeah this is the way we do it this wicked Hey yeah like that was ridiculous I'm just gonna dock a guy's pay yeah so he took 50 percent of his money because it didn't meet there cuz it didn't meet his standards yeah I just a one when he said did the crouch air that's something so I hope not I'd hate to see that some of the crowd get your phone man who sees on coke look at him who's evil look I see you guys having fun the night make some noise but the whole Fighting Championship is a brand new sport and a brand new company and we're here for action and we want action and we demand action from the fighters mmm the man didn't get accident that last fight cause rusty Crowder wanted to run therefore he's given half this purse for Reggie Barnet make some noise Belov see this is how we do it at bare-knuckle you fight or you don't get paid [Music] that's not good it's not good that he thinks the zombie prophet wrote this can't be legal he would see what Steffi Hayes wrote Crooklyn Mme wonder how that works like she wrote what the actual fuck is this hillbilly hosted yeah I concur what in the actual fuck is that hillbilly bullshit now Friday's the doc right the yellow car was yellow card is a penalty like I don't you for being boring mostly yeah and sometimes irresponsibly well I I've watched some of those yellow cards Mike you crazy yeah you crazy take that back yeah yeah yeah gave that guy yellow car you can't fight any harder yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we can't engage is gonna get lit up these this moment's we have to try to figure out what the fuck to do you're on the outside you're trying to figure out how to get in right right now and you're getting lit and then the referee is like come on fight fight you're like but in Asia that some of they like some of them are I used to work a lot at this Korean show and they change their figuring out their style but man when I first got to they're like um so there's a yellow card any backward step a back step any back step you should want to give it yellow card lyoto machida would never make anybody some sin I don't know if I can do with that I don't think that's I mean you invited me over here for a reason I'm I'm just gonna do what I do and hope you bring me back but I don't know if I can do that yeah yeah do do you ever go to a place and the Commission's or a promoter will tell you hey fights go to the ground I want you to give it just a couple of seconds and stand them up I go places and people tell me what to do all the time really and I'm not gonna do it at the end of the day no one's gonna know that you told me to do it it's gonna be me doing it 100% yeah so I'm gonna yeah I can't I can't yeah basically so glad you just said it that way too because that's that's people need to get that in their head because I know that sometimes people do get affected by whether they want to please a promoter or please a crowd or and they're not doing the right thing it's such a trans responsibility yeah you're gonna be but you're the one who's gonna be for some of those choices you know those choices that they made they're making those choices with your name yeah yeah yeah it's like the backstep key Kevin Johnson answering the guy but this is a tweet from that bare-knuckle FC ok Kevin Johnson no money was taken from any fighters that statement did exactly what as opposed to what was supposed it didn't say to suppose and lit a fire under every single fighters ass from that point on giving you one of the greatest fights you'll ever see no no no no no no no no no no those guys fought that way because that's who the fuck they are right right yeah yeah yeah yeah it said no there's no nothing to do with that Jason Knight and loped off yeah yeah yeah yeah you can't you can't claim credit for Hinkler for Jason Knight do indeed and our Lobo fuck out of here they would fight that way in a fucking Walmart parking lot yeah that's how those guys would fight every time they fight Jason Knight though both those dudes are and what those dudes are so tough Jason Knight has my favorite nickname Nick Diaz yeah yeah yes yeah it's bad motherfucker yeah yeah he's a bad motherfucker that but it was tough looking at their faces man after the fight I was like man I might have to rethink my position on barrel look at their faces afterwards yeah I mean that is crazy you know it's a lifetime of cuts yeah all over the film look at his right under his nose like that is a crazy cot man is to stitch the fuck up all over the place that is rough man his whole face got lacerated I mean that is a lot of cuts yeah it's not that's more like a Muay Thai fight and it really makes you think but I can um that's got to be the most brutal right more time yeah I believe so boy type bare-knuckle would be like what they call it less way uh-huh they just they kind of like wrap the hands up in a hand wrap yeah it's not knuckle but it's um I think barren and bare knuckled Moines time would be the the hardest but to think what my argument was always and that's it still remains this that if you're not gonna pad anything else like you're not gonna pad the shins you're not gonna bad the knees or the elbows why are you patting the knuckles you're just giving people false sense of security in terms of what is actually effective we don't want we don't want to practice something that doesn't really work if you don't have gloves on right I mean if every time you punch someone you don't have gloves on your hand would break right okay we clearly can't punch people it's stupid you gotta use elbows and knees and right so in order to fight with your knuckles as much as UFC fighters do you pad everything you pad you put wraps you put padding over it boxing is like it's a different world as soon as you take gloves off yeah it's a different world punches get in that you can't block it's it's getting more consequence a lot more cuts but at least if now we know what actually works all right you're saying I wasn't thinking about it from that point of view yeah that is given people people are thinking that yeah you're right like people think that boxing well before him everything was the most effective way of doing things yeah but then when you MMA is a whole different from the size of the boxing glove all the techniques you can do and what you can't do and what's going to work and what's not gonna work yeah it's it's supposed to be the sport of fighting and you basically brought it down to a raw form but you're still covering the knuckles and padding the knuckles just because of perception and see the problem with that guy this bare-knuckle guard boxing Gandhi says some stupid shit like that is that it reinforces what people don't like about combat sports what people don't like about the idea of bare-knuckle boxing that it's brutal it's just there for chaos and right right right for action we're here to see action that guys don't think that about him a man yeah and and and I don't think that um I don't think that MMA athletes I think MMA athletes I think are the most honorable and well behaved and you know not because of fear anything because of what the sport is yeah you getting out like I mean people they know event you know that there it could because our aggressive nature is being put in a channeled channeled in an organized way to make sense I tell you one of the most aggressive I run around the Rose Bowl when I see the peloton come around that's one of the most aggressive things I've seen man those dudes are constantly cursing each other out and cursing everybody else out all the little soccer moms out there trying to run around the Rose Bowl but guys the end man oh but the guys throwing punches are never you know cursing people out so the runners no no what do you it's a peloton as the guys on the bikes but isn't that like oh I thought peloton you stand still I don't know I'm just making up that's good I'm talk about the guys at the Rose Bowl it's really the bike race no I'm saying they'll come they'll train there oh when they come on they train with a riding stationary bike so know you're riding together they're riding together and they're out there they're not racing there no there they're training and the you know there's some aggressive those dudes are aggressive how's it cutting each other off and shit maybe just maybe just to follow the rules rider just there's a word peloton which means a group of cyclists it's not the same as yeah yeah yeah okay so the cyclist counts awful because I didn't think I'd use the word properly wait a minute I thought I used a big word and make a mistake alright okay so these people their race and their cuts in each other round they're there they're all training oh so not racing they're just trained together on the signal training again well that's a rose bowl okay you've been to the Rose Bowl right yes you know that there's a running loop yeah you go and you can get in 5k around it really yeah those dudes are in Kent's really way more intense than I see er athlete acne well because this is not as much consequences you're right you know they're not gonna get off the bike compete each other's asses I feel like you talk shit really yeah I bet they are well it's like one time I wish one of them would have come back and easy it's like road rage right yeah you get the out rayji when you're in your car I was like a workout done don't do another left looking for you at the Rose Bowl okay and so they get mad at each other cuz they're trying to pass me intense its aggressive maybe because there's some runs to what I think I think there's like probably wait there's probably a lot of structure as to writing in that pack like that right and then also they're trying to get their workout in and they're on the end there and then there's other people out there trying to do other stuff and they're really serious about theirs I mean you know yeah it's aggressive maybe it's just shocking to me because it doesn't look like it would be that aggressive right because when you think about fighters like especially guys even training together it's rare that they swear at each other and talk shit to it like if two guys getting an argument like if someone a guy doesn't let go somebody tapped and people scream or something like that yeah and so that's the other thing I think that's why the respect has because they get better you have to put yourself in situations where you're gonna have where you're gonna be at a disadvantage of vulnerable and so you have to trust your training partners to have this level of respect and you're gonna have to reciprocate that yeah well things like leg locks yes exactly you gotta be really careful to let go quick and man this leg lock game that people are doing now in a day I need to learn it I don't know it yeah see that's the thing I know I used to think I was good at leg locks and he used to be so simple yeah yeah yeah and and then yes because there you know I guess you wouldn't take much to get it leg locks you just have to be willing to do them back in the day right everybody else like no no no it's the yeah yeah yeah so but he used to be like a simple setup yeah dive in he'll hook to having a toehold now very intense yeah and get others to get some some people will get it their word one of the things yeah like maybe the way they hide their feet or the way they do this well I gotta say that the first guy in modern MMA that started really wrecking people with leg locks with em inari yeah and then Polaris yeah who's Emma nari and Polaris those are the two guys I remember George grisel he fought in Minari and em and I ripped his fucking knee apart man and you know coach Elza Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt he was a very early in the fight in Minari just did that amon-ra roll you just dove on the knee and actually you wanna fucking inverted heel hook and then Paul Harris any dinghy you can't defend this like he's too strong yeah he's too strong so he can do he can do and way he's built he can do a lot of stuff that just doesn't make sense when we hit that guy against a cage on a single it's like nobody's worried about a hill a leglock from there boom invert it those legs grabbed it up not going anywhere yeah yeah yeah he was devastating he didn't let go and he would really really mangle your fucking knee right yeah so like that's what I remember when uh cuz I I got the referee him in Brazil before he was doing a lot in the UFC and so I kind of seen him and like I think one maybe in a tournament format and I've never had any problem but uh you know he'd usually he stopped when I told him to you know but there's one fight of his from I think it was from Brazil or he's got somebody in a leg lock and he's not letting go and and I think it's a leg lock see if you can find it but it's a it's an early fight in his career but it's crazy like they're like trying to pull him off the guy he's not letting you know like a pitbull right right yeah and you're so strong so strong and apparently his upbringing was horrific like I heard he had a tough of he's I'm you know it's weird it's like cuz you see that behavior and I always see him he seems like he you know some people have a cool energy when they're just around yeah it always makes me smile what I see yeah but I don't smile when I see that I mean you know I mean but he's one of those guys that's like soft-spoken yeah is he going yeah I think something happens to that guy when he engages you know when you're in locked in mortal combat it becomes just pure savage yeah and he I mean he does leg locks that no one else does because no one else is strong enough to do they have those legs that just when he yeah I mean he doesn't care of both legs or their arms in there anything that's all oh it's all strapped it's all getting trash compacted yeah you know um he had a very interesting grappling match with Gary tonin did you ever see that I did see that yeah I didn't know yeah I saw some clips of it like some bits of it yeah it really shows you how good Gary Tony ita√∫nas a mate yeah he's because Paul so much bigger than him I mean he's probably 40 50 pounds heavier than him he's much bigger than him you know and to watch those guys go back and forth it's really really interesting yeah well yeah Tony like he's McGee's one of those people who get you know you get a position but it's still just so hard so he can just move away you know well his grappling so elite and he's getting really good at striking now too and he's really dedicated to MMA and he's undefeated he's been fighting in one Fc which I'm excited right I'm very excited about one Fc I love what the Newland I love the attitude they're taking of making it about respect and martial arts and bringing it to like some old-school martial arts values they're fucking gigantic right now in Asia yeah yeah and they have the best fighter in the world they have Demetrius my team and what's really is what's really cool is because there's a lot of guys in Asia who are really exciting to watch at that weight so it's kind of exciting him get over there with all these guys that's that that's I'm really excited about well he got tested in his first fight I mean he won by submission but he got tested and Alvarez got stopped by that Russian dude Timothy what is his uh his last name the guy that stopped goddamn gonna forget his name the guys stopped Eddie Alvarez Timothy its Timothy not Timothy it's some strange Russian name Timothy no members last name but anyway he's a beast I say you can nest you can yeah yeah that's right nasties in his last name nasty you can the first letters of his last name are nasty Timofey nasty you can did you see that fight play the stoppage play the the knockout the far far right one no the far right - fuck that one right there oh yeah okay just play right there there you go this dude is uh this Russian cats a beast man he was very seasoned in there like really relentless with his pressure and super confident in his power and he stunned Alvar as a couple times in that fight I was pretty shocked I think there are a lot of guys that aren't in the UFC that are capable of fighting in the UFC I think what I'm saying so like now definitely there there's um I get to see a lot of those guys at those children Russia see I'm watching this cat and this is not like a freak knockout or something like that this guy's got real smart technical striking and he's also puts tremendous pressure on and he's also got big power and their amateur combat sports yeah that like you know combat Sambo and things like that they get a lot of experience yeah well when you see a guy like khabib nurmagomedov just run through people in the UFC and you know where that guys from you got to go well how many more of those guys are over there you know yeah the Dagestan crew then that does that beat - he's from Dagestan isn't islam makhachev as you need from that that part of the world as well yeah yeah that's where uh Keller's areas boom boom boom boom boom boom that's it yeah so I mean that's hoppers friend right yeah yeah yeah that's a warrior group of PBS a lot of man so I get to go there a lot I mean it's really exciting I get to see a lot of really cool this Dagestan like okay Dagestan was a blast Dagestan was fun really yeah I went there I you know was there with who was also at the show they brought over Verdun and and those guys weren't working for doing an Anderson Silva those guys were watching fights you just you know but I was working but yeah they took us around they showed us a lot of really cool stuff I went to like a you know school were some kids wrestling school okay like a lot of schools that were athletic with an athletic orientation and seeing these little kids maybe put this little kid up on a bar had him doing pull-ups man he was doing pull-ups I mean this little kid a little bitty kid did I mean it must've been at least 15 pull-ups and then I was like I mean he's a little kid like I've said nothing something like nine or something like that and when coach when the coach pulled him off he was mad you could see these men's like man I got more United mean he was mad like what was show the people what I could do but um and the crowd they loved him it meant so much they were like it was like you know what it was like it was like you were watch those videos of like the Beatles you didn't mean when all the people going crazy but it's not teenage girls it's like a bunch of our little wrestlers well that just packs like yeah I got pictures that from somewhere yeah 17 Wow so it's that popular over there yeah dancing now did you see the video of those dudes when could be beat Conor and they're shooting machine guns into the air oh I didn't see that but I saw the one of my friends from that area sent me some pictures that she was out on the street she sent some pictures uh to my wife of the Matsu video of guys uh like jet Ginga and horse racing had horses their horses down yes some video that was like oh you're a singing shooting guns yeah they're people were it was like people were so excited about that that's some energy there yeah Nikki imagine you're from a place that many parts of the world never heard of mm-hmm until I don't know how much I thought about Dagestan before to be came around and then now they have the not just a world champion but a guy who smashed the most famous fighter on the planet right one of the most famous fighters on the planet it's like him and Floyd Mayweather probably the two most famous fighters yeah yeah yeah it could be just ran through him so like he's a he's a huge huge star over there yeah no no yeah huge so there that uh ya know it's it's a fun place to go matter of fact I yeah I've got to see a lot of cool stuff look at this Dagestan explosive delight after Kabir defeats MacGregor they're all going crazy with their hats on look at people on the street cheering yeah Wow yeah man Conner's all this shit talk leading up to that fight men to that backfire like on some people it works and then some people it's just it doesn't work at all and it just makes him more relentless when Kobe was hitting him going let's talk now uh-huh let's talk now that's a down with him you know cuz he talks the whole time right yeah from the beginning of the 8th he starts talking could be does oh yeah he starts talking really what does he say well I didn't you hear when used to fight in Johnson yeah give up yeah yeah yeah you know I need that title shot give up and he got him in that horrific Kimora I was watching that Comoros I told she's a fucking tap come on man tap come on man oh I just feeling everything going pop snap oh they didn't want to tap man just a tough guy yeah but I you know that uh either the smack talk I mean that's what Conner does yeah yeah but this was a different level let's talk hmm is that come on let's talk now can we hear it yes my good Johnson you have to get up uh-huh yeah he sounds like you really cares about him too you know this night deserve it I have to fight for the title you know this I deserve it as he's beating him all right yeah and he's talking to someone the side Ron I smashed your boy might the scariest thing that he ever said was about Connor I want to change his face mm-hmm what change his face oh Jesus so I heard he's retired right Connor yeah you don't buy it right no I don't know yeah if you had to guess yeah he's fighting yet Hans mollenkamp you know Hans mmm-hmm from Monster yes yeah a picture sparring with Connor today also Connors training yeah I know how's he doing something who's monsters yeah yeah yeah it works for monster he's he's training he's gonna fight he's probably just fuckin with people you know I mean Connor is a master showman in terms of like how to keep people interested in him and I just think he just he got way out of line with all this khabib stuff but I'd like the way I like the way he takes his losses oh he took it well I like I like the way he goes out there and talk smack with everyone I think like as uh I mean like from a sports psychology point of view I think he's uh you think he's developed there you know yeah but I don't think the way to get another fight with khabib is to continue to talk shit after he smashes you I mean he doesn't have any reason to you can just talk shit like he he didn't just win he smashed and tapped you like it was there's only like one or two moments in the fight where Connor was taking control with some of the striking and the standout huh you know and that's another joke that's another misunderstood choke that fulcrum choke they've got Conor with that is it legit yeah neck crank yeah yeah and people that don't think to ollie tap to that like you attended to and if you didn't you're stupid and people like it because the chin was down there right there like you there's a lot when you're there's a lot of it generates a lot of force yeah get down hinge your jaw from oh yeah yeah rip apart yeah yeah yeah that that's legit that's a legit submission yeah especially with that yeah yeah exactly yes I'm back the the back of your forum against the guys back has leveraged you know we're just cause of that fulcrum yeah that's horrific it's a very powerful yeah it hurts bad man there's a lot of those net cranks are just like oh you watch people and you just go please tap yeah there it is right there like you see yeah with khabib x' arm the way you pressing against the back of conner and then also yank on that that is ripping his fucking neck apartment yeah you never yeah you you until you felt one yeah yeah um but Connor it's interesting that the ways posted up like that he's trying to get up and he's getting cracked at the same time yeah you got it kind of he was already had been smashed by then too you know he'd been hit and hit with so many big punches from the top he takes a great shot that I'll tell you that yeah but it's just one of those things where I think in order for him to really have a real chance at getting another shot what he's got to do is beat somebody big and say something that makes khabib considerate you know but not a no not in the way of what he's been doing in terms of you know talking shit about him and talking smack I mean I think the only way it's gonna be public demand like he's gonna have to get to a position where people want to see him fight forever I began to see that the result may be different this time mm-hmm and then maybe if he could just fucking communicate something to him say you know I respect you you know all trash talk aside you know I would like to test myself against you one more time and I think I earned it I think that's the only way he's gonna get it I think the only way he's gonna get it is to to win a couple of fights beat some real big-name guys and then make it so that's a something that could be he's actually interested in well okay so I don't know if that's the only way but it's the way that would be that I would like to see they already offered it to be even kike beep said fuck off yeah yeah most like that path that you're talking about sounds like a 1 then one that fits good for me yeah I'd like to see it that that way yeah do you think that trash-talking in MMA has gone too far or not it all right I mean well I think it's entertaining yeah for some people I think it's not well here it's hard well cuz it's not it's not always what I want to see and it's not I don't know it's not the type of person I am but not everyone's gonna be me that's not what makes the world go around right as a lot of people want to see it and also sometimes it does bring some energy and some you know when it's well done it does bring some energy and some excitement to the fight and to the sport and at the same time not every fight what's engine well I think what's really interesting and what's really excited about the UFC is that there's a lot of fights that people want to see that have no bearing on the title right and so there's something to that fights that just people want to see and I think trash talk sometimes makes fight that people want to see yeah for sure yeah it makes me emotional makes things intense it's great for selling things it's great for selling paper views but the question is like is it good for the sport overall and should it be something that we encourage well hey well that's for and that's the thing is how do we decide what's good for the sport in what way right how do we decide is it good for the way the sport do you want the sport to look as far as martial arts and being a respectful thing and people looking at us like that maybe not is it good for the supporters of the growth of the sport and for more opportunities for our athletes and for our athletes to become names that uh that draw attention from other people that normally didn't know about it I don't know I don't know either yeah so so I don't know I I'm torn mm-hmm I like both yeah I got a Machida type character that's very spec foam the house and never talks trash and fights like you know just a world champion caliber martial artist and I also like a guy talks mad shit you think it's funny yeah yeah exactly I enjoy it uh-huh it's like I like press conferences for that very reason where you know guys are talking shit to each other and they're just looking over at each other on the podium mm-hmm you know it's funny oh come on if some of them yeah some of it is hilarious yeah how about Connor when Jeremy Stephenson asked him for a fighter who the fuck is that guy no it was effective we got a when he got up with is like okay I don't have time to insult everyone so let's yeah let's get them all in one place that was great I could saw it everyone at one time let's be efficient gentlemen this comedy man when he was talking about where it's red panties night yeah yeah that was we made it baby we got that caught in a girl fight he's a fucking character man come on he's in that weird situation though where he really never has to fight again so you got to wonder what his motivation is you know like he has a hundred million dollars he has a gigantic whiskey company that proper 12 is murdering it that that place is killing it that that company is there they're moving into other countries now I mean they're killing it he doesn't have to do a thing ever financially right unless he wants to eat diamond sandwiches he's like basically do whatever the fuck he wants for the rest of his life and just live off interest but he still likes to fight yeah I think so yeah that's what brought him into the key B fight he didn't have to fight could be even but just you know how much does he want it I mean does he want it the same way a guy like style bender wants it or guy like Kelvin Kelvin Gastelum wants it and also I think that you know part of one unit is different to maybe maybe there's maybe people might want things on their terms to unser in terms of way you get it is way like it's like some people like all you'll want it I wanted anyway I can get it some people might want it and say well now I want it this way well he was gonna fight cowboy that was a fight that they were they were basically trying to make but it was gonna have to be a co main event and because of that I think Connor was not interested anymore he wanted to be a main event you know I'm like Jesus like is that really what kept us from Connor versus cowboy can you guys blow down all right right yeah under vs. cowboy make that a fuckin main event like make some malarkey title come up with some 160 pound title or some shit just come on man do it I mean they give out these interim titles left and right how about you come up with more excited when that was gonna help yeah yeah I was excited to see it 165-pound malarkey title just come on man the cotton versus cowboy for the title yeah make a title up but always make it yeah I agree I don't think it would hurt at all but a pair Dana says it makes a big difference in the amount of pay-per-views it okay yeah yeah but now that over at ESPN Plus is it really gonna be I mean how does that work now you pay every month and then you pay a little more for the pay-per-view is that what it is how it works how much more is it its psyche fight it's just like five dollars less or whatever it is okay so yeah well that's a good deal if you're into watching all those fights on ESPN plus it is nice they do have a great library but so does fight pass right where does that put fight pounds but fight past I can't see some of the stuff that oh yeah yeah way more there's only tie organizations and yeah fight pass is awesome for the gym I have a little home gym with an Apple TV on it and I always have fight pass on kickboxing watch obscure Muay Thai fights like right from the arena in Thailand you know it's it's really cool like a compound guys beating the shit out of each other submission wrestling - oh yeah yeah a lot of Abu Dhabi stuff is on there all Eddie Bravo stuff is on there all the Eddie Bravo Invitational combat Jiu Jitsu is on there yeah yeah Jiu Jitsu is in a great place right now - right I mean it's there's so many different martial arts that are really at the pinnacle right now I mean I think such an amazing time for yet so many people yeah martial arts yeah as it's a great time for martial arts well you remember when you and I first got into it there was I mean there was nothing not what it is now nothing I mean martial have been around for thousands and thousands of years and the level of martial arts since 1993 to today is it's indescribably more powerful today like the athletes are so much better the fighters are so much more well pounding and even in jujitsu if you go back to and watch old jujitsu matches from like 93 and of course you're gonna have like your Hicks and Gracie's and he get Machado's and jean-jacques Machado's who are at that elite level even back then where they can hang with guys today but overall the game is like so complain isn't on command but and also even just the athleticism you've seen it okay yeah I mean these dudes are some animals yeah yeah no it's incredible and I mean and really what's interesting to me is that you're really only seeing a small percentage of the elite athletes that are available in North America that even decide to get into it right right like if you talk about how many elite athletes decide to go into baseball or an NFL or NBA versus how many elite athletes go into cage fighting it's not even close right right all right let's starting to get some of them slow sounds really a little bit and some of them are starting to get an intra and jiu-jitsu is a reason why some of them are getting an interest in jiu-jitsu they train right like yeah for cross-training yeah you're doing it for something but just people want to learn it you know yeah I mean if you're a big guy I just fight a fight yeah that's got to suck big old giant guy doesn't actually know how to fight like fuck man but it learn some of this shit right yeah it's just for for those big athletes the really big paydays are at NFL and that's the other thing too is that a lot of those guys are bigger than 265 pounds yes exactly like they would have to cut a lot of weight to make 265 which is isn't that weird that we have a heavyweight division that you have to weigh in for ya know that I think that is it but I wonder what the super heavyweight division would look like it would probably be just a small handful of giant guys it would probably like the fly weights but in terms of like how feuless iceland they get those Iceland strongmen dudes they start fighting MMA have you seen no what's his name the Polish who Janowski yeah which he fights a lot now I like that man you know what I've been you know when I people were all were kind of you know give him a hard time about it but man Puja I have a lot of respect for him man fights hard he brought a lot of put a lot of eyes on our sport who danowsky I'm a fan he's still fighting he's gotten way better he's gotten better at least more he never makes any chumps no and he brings it in yeah and yeah there he is look at him look at the size of that motherfucker still even look at he looks skillful now he'd like he's moving much better and here's the thing this was always better got balls of steel yeah he fought tim sylvia that's ridiculous yeah I was like I could not believe that day's that's where they put him up against four is early in his career like I'm saying fuck the respect that's what I'm like I'm respect like molera I was like a respect you chose him yeah yeah it was ridiculous and he chose chose him very early in his career early he really didn't have the skills that he has now and tim is a world champion hmm and and and the type of body that's very hard for Putin on skis oh yeah long and tall long limbs wrestler who can put his hands on your hips and control your levers and the other they make you you know your muscles get fatigued make you gasp out yeah started from the beginning so you can see what it was like earlier for the weekend I mean Tim just start beating the shit out of him once he got tired but it's interesting because Tim has the opposite of pooja now his body right like he doesn't have the best genetics just tough and people think that that pooja setup is going to be but actually for it so very hard to fight somebody like Tim not very hard very hard but he's also got massive experience comes I mean he's fought literally everybody any good all over the world he finally oh yeah yeah I mean fought he fought the greats he fought under lossky when our loss he was a straight-up murderer you know Lasky was in his prime yeah Randy Couture you know when Frank Mir broke his arm when he tried to keep fighting yes you too right yeah yeah cuz I remember the crowd was booing like I was like you guys you need to look at this yeah yeah no that's a that's a that's me I will tell you about that because that was a fun story because like they arm I hadn't really there's one the first times I think they trusted me with a championship and he you know the arm broke I heard it I saw it and I remember you know I learned a lot I learned a lot about my job right then because I what I did is I backed off and I let the doctor come in and examine them cuz like you know sometimes when you're dealing with an expert you don't want to cloud the way you're supposed to get out of the way right like you don't go to the mechanic and tell him what to do so I my mind was thinking like that about the doctor and so of course he comes in she doesn't know what she's what she saw so he misguides her and says I think he's worried about this and then she was like hey no nothing's wrong and I was like oh man and my mind I was thinking it's been great being here but I'm not be doing this anymore great that's which already I swear I was like in my mind I was thinking that I was thinking about how to get out of there when they start throwing stuff oh Miletich camp but maybe you remember they're over there wrestling with the Samoan you guys trying to get in there people screaming people screaming yeah other that was that's another break it was an awful one yeah so then I was thinking about that and then you know but then you found it yeah you saved me like I was thinking that my retribution was gonna be like some kid on the internet two weeks later like I found out his arm was broken but you found the spot and so then I was watching the replay and I was like let's take a look at this hold on hold on what's that uh his arm I'm like that's a broken arm yeah that barn is broken look at that watch it one more time when I had the truck roll up behind and then I went into the Octagon and I remember saying immediately like you guys need to watch this like here we go let's play this here we go that's a broken arm so I'm gonna thank you for that right there because I thought my path would have been different it was one of those things where I felt an obligation to not just interview the fighter but to explain to the entire crowd like you gotta listen this is a I know it looked crazy looked crazy to me too this is a broken arm like this guy's fucked right now three places and Tim thanked you afterwards for saving his career because I said if you didn't stop that fight and that became a compound fracture fuck man horrible things happen when the bone breaks through his skin yeah happened I saw him afterwards and I said man did you know your arm was broken and he told me he goes yeah I know what was your plan why are you trying to continue so I knew I had a minute before the pain really becomes lame yeah here is and watch this part right snap right there I mean that is 100% a double-double break yeah both parts of the both bones of the forearm snapped in half and it's an unusual break because of where it is yeah just shows you how fucking strong Frank Mears armbars is how long-limbed he is it was all so weird this house arm went back into place how young and muscular I talked to the doctor they say that happens sometimes with athletes the muscles just put it right back yeah yeah yeah well he had a play put in there man forever it's still in there look at me a young wolf fresh-faced joe rogan man that was okay young Frank looks uh-huh it's crazy he looks so lean and young he's a big old giant dude now he was a fantastic commentator ya know he's a really good common really good commentator I'm amazed that no one snatched him up to do commentary well you know it's funny he was working for ACA yeah he just stopped though he was he was there he was there for a while his commentary what's weird is he always he's as a commentary when I like listen to him his commentary and also just talking to him he always comes up with an angle that I never think of and it makes sense it's worth hearing you're like I was like what's Frank gonna say about this I mean sometimes yeah he'd get some weird angles very smart dude very well-read dude - yeah really nice understood guy in a lot of ways but Frank was I think it was one of the Lesnar fight when he fought Lesnar either before the first fight of the second fight yeah I forget which fight it was he said he wanted less room to be the first death inside the inside the cage and the UFC was like what the fuck are you saying yeah then they pulled him out of the commentary for saying that he's like look I'm just talking up a fight and that was it he was doing WEC at that point member right right right yeah dude he was really good I remember listening to his commentary I'm like this guy he's it's I I'm a big fan of former fighters doing it I think they do the best commentary he does great company a lot yeah Daniel Cormier hey Daniel Cormier is fantastic he's really good amon ik you know who else I like I like Dan Hardy Dan Hardy's excellent yeah Dan very very he's actually kind of morphed into I mean he really is as solid as anyone as including myself as like is doing like professional commentaries as good as anybody well we're talking about that - oh Felder's good that won that fight that's where I learned definitely that when the doctor would the dealer that they don't know what we all take for granted that's the arm so that was kind of my fault for any of them now I definitely always tell them look this exactly what happened this is what I'm worried about this particular part you know oh yeah that's got to be huge for you because like if a woman gets into the Octagon or a man and they don't know anything about the sport they're just there because they're a doctor right I would have no idea what the fuck yeah and I didn't I didn't even I know it seems like that should be the first thing I thought about but yeah I didn't long ass time ago bro yeah yeah how many fights you think you've called no out of thousands men thousands that was a dead lot they had thousands I'm not crazy yeah if you really stop and think about all that experience do you um do you do seminars for young up-and-coming right I just did it this weekend yeah we're at in Pasadena oh so you know you can go on my website find about Herb Dean calm also you can follow me at a Herb Dean MMA it's on Instagram ester I usually do stuff we link that on the Instagram page wouldn't have posted the picture you would the blowtorch okay all right cool I'm ready to see this explosion of followers right it's common baby comes come and oh shit yeah no I I do it uh it's it's if I just did it it's uh it's a cool thing because I like doing it because it makes me better every time it makes me have to think about things as I look at that so we spent three days doing it so you see that about teaching anything right yeah yeah it makes me makes me a lot better and I always dread it went on what I'm going to do it because sometimes it just as a dread doing it and then I haven't finished the whole up part the other part I don't like is I have to say no because I have it's for certificate and the certificate is what you need a certificate to get licensed and so uh some people aren't going to achieve the certificate mmm so they can come and you know take the seminar but there is screening right yeah so the first day they they we we go over a bunch of stuff then they teach me some technique and you get an amine and so we understand that they understand what's going on in there and so as far as for judging how to evaluate what these guys are actually doing and then so when I say they teach you technique like this you you'll say to them hey show me how to set up your angle like I go to though so we we do it in um we do it in Pasadena so I do it at the at the Courtyard Marriott right there we got a classroom then I can walk two blocks down and take one block to the right and be a savanna serve on young fight academy go right there step straight onto the mat we do a warm-up or we get to see a lot of stuff okay yeah show me armdrags show me this we get a lot of information right there with you notes all right yeah show me a pass tell me that some of that then I have one yeah teach me a triangle teach me by the numbers teach me you know as it was taught to you or like and I don't care if you learned it on the internet but why do you like it and what maybe what do you do different to make it work for you and just talk me through it give me as much information as I can one guy this weekend took my course and he gave me so much and I met I couldn't wait every time I was gone it was really good he was a really detailed instructor but he was really good then the but I learned I got a lot of information from some of the other people who I thought was gonna be good because in the beginning we tell while we're here sounded like I had a high level class a lot of them weren't then know much about they didn't know enough about position and Submission how many guys do you think want to be referees but have no experience in martial arts well I think there's a lot I think it's common you know on my website it lets people know like hey a physical demonstration of MMA technique is is required to achieve certification you can come out and you know take the seminar if that's fun for you which is cool my hat's off to you you know because of the light slide you can do it your weekend but if you want the certificate you need to understand the techniques yeah at a level that you know that you teach yeah at a detailed level enough because you have to understand the details to make it successful and that's why you have to if you're gonna evaluate it as a judge you know you have to know why it wasn't successful you're gonna have to be able to talk it through why you gave credit to something or didn't give credit to something so this is for judging and reference judging and reference so the first day I do is judging and then the judge is the referees for my the way I do my certificate if you want to be a referee you have to be able to judge also because everyone assumes that you can and they'll throw you in the judges seat so all right judging training oh if you like to do a small show or something like that yeah yeah yeah small show we used to have this thing where Eddie Bravo used to score the fights between rounds it was an excellent it was good about it is Eddie would break it down on a piece of paper he would have like a write calm and a left calm like right Colin would be you left calm be Jamie and then he would write okay turb took him down three herb almost got an armbar herb landed five lathe cakes Jamie cried a lot that's what it would say no no it would say and then he would add it up and he would say this is why I think he won the round this guy had better position but this guy landed the big shots this guy got hurt but he almost got caught in submission so I gave it real close but I gave it 10-9 to this guy so you'd get a better understanding like Howard Letterman used to do it around just do it further off and I think that's a good thing like so that's one of the things like we don't really have in our sport like you know our the way we score around we don't really score it cuz we don't we don't have like a rubric where we're given a sign value for techniques as they happen so we don't that's not what we're doing and also and but I think that's a good idea for training it's hard to do it the way Eddie does that live to run around because who can write all that without taking her eyes off for a second right when you take your eyes off just for one second you know you missed you might miss something that was huge you know yeah and so so that's why a lot of commissions you know what Sogeti what he did was he had like he wrote kicks punch he has a shorthand system I guess right had X's on besides every time someone took someone down you put a little X and I encourage people to do that and so that's what I do like I you know well I tell them you know I show the mother like different people have different systems of shorthand to take some notes because in the back you want you're gonna want to have some notes especially when when the matches are done you know this they'd say there's a split decision or there's a split round there's an outside judge um everybody's going to be getting their their a game together their reasons why they gave it that way so that's you're gonna have to be able to talk about so that's a good way of scoring around is preparing yourself to be able to talk about what you actually saw and then what happened yeah in context to the scoring criteria that's awesome and then this certificate is from you is that how this is from me but recognized by certain organizations that are going to make it so that you can get a job so it's from me and here in the United States is recognized by the association of boxing commissions and if you're going to apply to let's say camo here in California you're going to have to have a certificate of training before you apply to the amateur or before you apply to let's say the boxing commission out in Tennessee to Athletic Commission out there or the Athletic Commission in Nevada they are only gonna hire people who have taken a course that's recognized that job does one as well yeah a couple other people do them that's excellent yeah yeah Big John's is coming up in June that fight week weekend does a big one June 6 and 7 I just did my um June 6th and 7th we're at you know where dozen avada and so if you look for it for social media UFC card that weekend yeah yeah this way does it then yeah I'm just giving given given a plug to my competition but it's okay yes okay the end of the day we want people to get some good training and get information well but John is not competition anymore now he's a commentator yeah but for my training from anyway he's never as competition as a referee yeah we we're trying to but as far as for my course I'm right I take my course but if they're not gonna take mine I wanted to take his he's awesome yeah I know that's yeah there's a few a few guys that I get very excited when I see that they're referring a big fight of my career okay that definitely Big John I know yeah I've always feel very comfortable damn he's been in there from the very beginning from the beginning I mean there is not a person alive that has more old-school credibility than Big John and more high-level fights oh yeah man yeah and he's seen it all the good the bad remember Murilo Bustamante versus Matt Lindland oh yeah he had to tap him twice yeah John stopped it and then Matt Lindland complained oh they let him fight again yeah oh you're gonna bring up yeah rig it up throw that over what about that he'd the other one too right Coenen and uh oh yeah saba in ja√©n yeah the Japanese made them fight again uh-huh on the same night when the fuck is that ever happened they've never been happening ever and that was from a punch to stopped from a punch right dropped down grabbed ahold the ankle Koel right but that's the way Sakuraba shoot yeah he shoots like this it looks like you know like he's going out yeah yeah and then caught Conan in an armbar in the second fight the second time they fought that night that night and that was like crazy we couldn't believe a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt could get tapped like what what and Sakuraba who's smaller than him right right and then we realized who Sakuraba yeah Sakuraba was he to me really carried the flag of catch wrestling the Karl Gotch style of submission holds more so than probably anybody else oh they were fought in MMA yeah definitely his style was all Kimora's and armbars and remember when he used to tape his legs I believe like the guy could barely walk yeah how the fuck was he fighting so good his legs would be mummified and he's doing submission wrestling now right he's fighting funny quintet right yeah yeah um yeah he fought uh his crew fought Eddie Bravo's crew right now my friend Richie tapped him my friend Richie more two minutes boogie man yeah okay yeah a lot for these bad motherfucker got to deal with yeah unless you're a hundred percent full-time grappler and boogies got nasty Darce chokes my heart minotaurs yeah and look you've got that all that breakdancing yes his flexibilities were dead it's rude yeah that's his dexterities word yes I feel like you know there's some people you say okay he's good then there's some people you look at it so like I've never got to you know roll with him but he looks like one of those people that like you don't know what it feels like until you feel it good me yeah yeah we look very strong yeah his brother is tuccio's very strong too but then they came from that breakdancing background where they just have the ability to manipulate their body so on you it's almost like a gymnast right right exactly they're cut but maybe even more so because they like do a lot of stuff where they're standing on one arm and bouncing around at the lotus position yeah yeah on one arm one arm handstand with their legs criss crossed up in the air and they're bouncing around it
