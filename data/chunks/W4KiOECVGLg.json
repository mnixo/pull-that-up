all right we're live what's up man how are you hey yeah I'm pretty good I'm excited I walked in on a pool game cuz I barely squeaked it out that was a very nice shot to end it though that's the way to end it so wow I've been reading your book man tribe I really enjoy it it's really good and it's so it resonates it's very interesting I will into the first chapter I wanted to move in with the Native Americans I was it was such a I mean it was a one of the more interesting aspects of it was something that I didn't know about which was the European settlers that had been kidnapped and we're living with the Native Americans and then when they were rescued many of them wanted to go back yeah or they would go into hiding so they wouldn't have to be repatriated to colonial society they wanted to stay with their adopted tribes and then there was also a lot of a lot of young white people particularly white men a young women too who basically absconded across the frontier into tribal society and they fled white society they didn't like it and and as Benjamin Franklin pointed out we have lots of callin colonial young Colonials fleeing to the Indians and we have not one example of an Indian as they were called fleeing to white society yeah that was one of the more fascinating aspects of it I didn't anticipate that I thought that there would be a lot of Native Americans so I would be like wow this is a way better look at all the food look at the houses and I mean they had plenty of food you know there are whatever there was success I was very successful Society in fact they were they had better nutrition than the whites did a more varied diet and a much much more egalitarian society than colonial society that was also interesting about it well I'm when you were talking about the women that had moved in with the Native Americans and were expressing how much more freedom they experienced yeah I mean the Indian society native society wasn't crushed by Christian morality so you could divorce you could marry as a woman you can marry whom you wanted you could get divorced you could do whatever you wanted it was very very gallant Aryan what they've shown is that the in societies where everyone is necessary for food production everyone more or less equal and in agrarian societies agricultural societies industrial societies you have large segments of the population often women who are not involved in food production and they're involved in reproduction and so their equality goes down Wow it's just it's almost like society as we've created over the last couple of hundred years is almost totally incompatible with with human genetics or with the human body or the the human spirit or whatever well if you look at I mean genetics are complicated I mean obviously on some level industrials modern society is very successful we have 7 billion of us but as wealth goes up into society as modernity goes up in a society the suicide rate goes up the depression rate goes up schizophrenia goes up in urban environments they're not good for the human psyche we are designed we evolved to live in groups of 3040 people in a harsh environment totally into reliant on one another for survival that creates a huge amount of equality within a group and loyalty within a group that's what we are designed for genetically modern society allows the individual to be independent from the group which is in some ways a great liberation and other ways it can lead to a profound alienation and depression yeah it's a it's just a very confusing thing it seems for people to be amongst so many people but to be alone yeah I mean we're not wired to be confronted with strangers all day long and I live in New York City and I love New York City but all day long you you encounter strangers and you don't and you know recognize anybody so you can be alone in a crowd which is not something that human beings have experienced until quite recently in their history yeah that was I think one of the more disturbing parts about this idea that these people were kidnapped by the Native Americans and wanted to stay with them was that whatever that Native American life was like however they were living that just seemed to just resonate with them it seemed to it seemed to be what was right well we're wired to want to feel like we belong to a group Native American society was sexually quite relaxed I was quite a gala terian in a hunter-gatherer society you really can't accumulate wealth very well because these societies are often nomadic so you can only accumulate as much wealth as you can carry which isn't much and in ultimately in societies like that as in a platoon in combat which is another part of my book obviously you're you're primarily value valued for your contribution to the group and that has been lost in modern society people are enormous ly self-serving capitalism basically instructs us to do so that's a whole other evolutionary imperative which is also important but in our society is way out of whack so we are wired to serve ourselves and we are wired to serve the group and in a healthy society those two those two are in a dynamic tension with each other and in balance in modern society there really is no group to serve and it leads to a really profound sense of meaninglessness for a lot of people yeah I also found pretty fascinating that when you were really young you when you when you were working I think you said you were working construction so what it was I'm trying to remember the story you're about to you were talking to oh you were just saying that you were talking to someone you were working with and they were telling you to slow down because some of us some of us have to do this for a lifetime but yeah I forgot about that story yeah yeah I was on a construction crew it was a highway department of my town and you know a lot of these guys are kind of lifers and yeah our department not a particularly challenging job in a sense but you were on your feet all day long in the Sun or whatever and so you know I was a young guy and you know I wanted to sort of prove my mettle or whatever I was I was we were digging a trench and I was digging like crazy and and an older guy came up to me yeah he's probably in his sixties and came up and clapped me on the shoulder he said son you want to slow down there you know some of us are gonna have to do this job our whole lives and he knew I was a college kid he knew I wasn't going to Brian and I said just slow down you know you know one needs to work this fast it's just it was really interesting that you were longing for something you were saying like almost to go wrong so everybody had a band together where there was a hurricane or something and that that mundane life of just work and doing things you don't really want to do well I mean the irony about modern society is that it is removed hardship and danger from everyday life and it's in the face of hardship and danger that people come to understand their value to their society and theirs and they get their sense of meaning from that and so what you have is when you know during the Blitz in London for example 30,000 people were killed by German bombs it was a horror show over the course of six months it was ghastly but people were sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder in the tube stations and putting out fires with bucket brigades and digging people out of rubble and and they were acting as a unified Society and the English government was prepared for mass psychiatric casualties because as a civilian population getting bombed to bits and the opposite happened admissions to psych wards went down during the Blitz and then back up after the bombing stop and and then afterwards there was an enormous nostalgia in England for the Blitz for those days as tragic as they were because English society felt people felt like they were together later I was I went back to Sarajevo where I had been during the siege of Sarajevo in the early 90s and civilians would tell me you know this is 20 years later 20 years after the war he would say you know a lot of us miss the war because we were better people back then we took care of each other I've talked about that with September 11th I went to New York City about I guess it was maybe six months after September 11th and I was there a couple times and the the before September 11th and after September 11th there was a very clear difference in the way people were behaving people seemed to be more more friendly more open they were really appreciative of first responders I was there once and a friend of mine she fainted and so they called the fire department came to check her out and and when the firemen showed up man you would think fucking superhero showed up it was amazing everybody was so happy to see him and it was in stark contrast to the way people used to behave and treat each other and it was directly because of having experienced this horrific event well adversity produces pro-social behaviors and people adversity makes people act well the lack of adversity safety and comfort allow people to excel fush Lee so after 9/11 the suicide rate went down in New York the violent crime rate went down in New York Vietnam vets reported that their PTSD symptoms went down after 9/11 what happens is people suddenly feel that they're needed by their society by their people and if you feel needed you are able to ignore your own personal troubles as one someone in England and an official and English official said during the Blitz in London he said it's amazing we have the chronic neurotics of peacetime driving ambulances and if you think about it in terms of evolution if adversity in danger produced bad human behaviors we wouldn't be here today another way to say that is we are the descendants of the individuals 100,000 years ago who acted well in a crisis the people that acted badly in a crisis and just took care of themselves and didn't take care of their people or their group those those peeps died out it's people it's groups that encourage a of altruism self-sacrifice of individuals for the group during a crisis those groups survive that DNA gets passed on to us and did you gain a deep appreciation for this because of your time as a war journalist did it sort of manifest itself in your mind because of that well I this book came to me in two so two-step process you know first of all when I was a young man I had a surrogate uncle figure in my life very important person to me named Ellis Ellis settled he was half Lakota Sioux a half Apache and he was born in 1929 on a wagon out west he lived an extraordinary life he was very very educated self educated and in one point he said to me you know it's so funny all throughout the history of this country white people were always running off to join the Indians and the Indians never ran off to join the white people and I filed that away in my mind I kind of liked the idea of it I thought it was I hoped it was true I didn't know it was true and then decades later I was with American soldiers on a remote outpost in Afghanistan and called Restrepo when I made a documentary film by that name with my colleague Tim Hetherington and there was almost daily combat there was no no link to the outside world no internet there was no electricity for a while they just slept in the dirt they got shot at every day we got shot at every day there was no women out there there was nothing but combat and tarantulas and palettes of water and MREs and Mo that was it for a year those boys were out there for over a year and they were very psyched to come back to Italy where they're based at the end of their deployment you can imagine they had some pretty good parties planned but after that died down a real depression set in and by the time I got caught up with him again in Vicenza and interviewed them many of them said that they wanted to go they didn't want to go come back to America they wanted to go back out to Restrepo and it reminded me of what Ellis had said and I thought what is it that's why is it that no one wants to come home like what is it and I realized it's not that they want war they they're not socio past it you know like they don't they don't want to be out there killing people and getting shot at they missed each other they missed the intense communalism of life in a platoon on a remote hilltop in combat and and that's an interesting in struck me I studied anthropology in college oh my god a platoon in combat effectively reproduces our human evolution right I mean we evolved the living groups of that size and in a harsh environment that's that's what a platoon is and so of course it resonated with them resonated genetically with them and I got to say as tough as it was out there there was a weird also a weird I don't quite want to call it a euphoria but a strange sense of well-being out there that I missed enormously when I left as well you messed it Oh enormous Lee yes did you try to rationalize it did you try to when did you sit alone with it and try to figure out what it was or did you just accept it I mean I you know I I've been covering Wars since the early 90s I started going out Anacin in the mid-90s I came back from from Restrepo you know we were in a lot of combat I almost almost killed a couple of times so I had some sort of trauma issues I mean everybody did my marriage started to fall apart that was not coincidental by the way I now realized that the timing was significant it took me a while to understand that and I sank into a real depression and it took me a while to understand that my depression was partly connected to the fact that I was no longer part of a group and and it took a long time for me to figure that out while I was experiencing all that I just felt like I was in some kind of that I was behind bulletproof Plexiglas and I was on the inside and everyone I cared about was on the other side of the Plexiglas I couldn't reach them that there were somehow inaccessible to me I couldn't hear them I couldn't touch them I was alone in this plexiglass cage and that's what it sort of felt like I was incredibly depressed and then Tim my good friend and brother and colleague who I made Restrepo with he was killed in combat in Libya and that was the final blow I mean I really crashed my marriage ended I mean I was a real mess for a while how did you pull out of it I I you know I you know I just I had a year or so in the wilderness I think psychologically and you know humans are evolved obviously to deal with trauma I mean eventually I mean if trauma was incapacitating to people for years or lifetimes we wouldn't exist right I mean our history as a species involved a huge amount of trauma so we are designed to react to trauma by protecting ourselves emotionally and physically for a certain amount of time for some weeks or months maybe a year or two and then to slowly come out of it and continue functioning that's exactly what happened to me what do you did you get something out of it I mean obviously it's a terrible experience to be depressed for that long and to go through all that but did you get some sort of an understanding of yourself out of it oh yeah absolutely I mean I some ways I mean I my marriage ended bye-bye you know moved out of my home I was living in a very sort of threadbare existence for a while I sort of gave up everything that that made me feel safe and protected in the world I mean financially no I just sort of happened you know financially emotionally I wasn't doing I wasn't working as a reporter for a while I'd stopped or reporting after Tim got killed and I just sort of hit the reset button on myself as a person and and and I sort of what when I came back from that I things I added to my life were very solid were very very good things and I sort of started from zero again and that really kind of worked and and I also study I mean I didn't have a drinking problem but I but I stopped drinking I stopped drinking alcohol and that the drinking alcohol I made me drink me alcohol made me feel good right I'm a really happy drunk and when I was depressed for a bunch of reasons if if I drank I felt great and so there's a real incentive to do that and I realized that that it was depriving me of experiencing my actual life like my actual life was filled with some very tough things at the moment and if you self-medicate your way through them you actually those things are taken from you it's your life your is their life you're going through and and it they were taking it you know I realize I might lose the experience of these things and you know my ex-wife and I are like quite good friends now and you know partly because I decided to try and experience the loss of the marriage as directly as possible and that involved not drinking did you during this time of depression did you consider or did you take any antidepressants or no just likewise like I I mean I I was you know I was talking to someone professional about how I felt because I was a little worried about myself but as I said to her I said you know if I was on antidepressants it might allow me to accept it might make me feel good enough to accept a life that isn't really working very well yeah that's as a person who's not depressed it's a very it's a slippery argument for me because I just an outside observer yeah and when I talk to people that are depressed and I always wonder like how how much of what you're doing is life circumstances how much is it actual some sort of a mental imbalance some sort of a chemical imbalance that you just are unfortunately born with I mean listen I'm not I'm not a shrink obviously there are people that encounter their first depression as teenagers and struggle with a very dangerous illness their whole life yeah I'm not talking about that kind of depression there's even that kind of depression I don't know why I mean is it circumstances genetics involved in that for me you know my depression was a very healthy reaction to some tough circumstances I was going through I was having a completely healthy self-protective reaction to what was going on in my life when you say you started putting like positive things in your life good solid things in your life like what kind of thing not a good relationship I you know I started working again I started being physically really active again I mean I just you know I just I started boxing actually and and and that was inspiring and stuff and that was incredibly frightening to me I mean just you know that kind of is very very hard and among other things and but all that stuff really was really really good for me one of the things that I've been dwelling on a lot lately is how important struggle is and for me personally I do a lot of things and I do a lot of things that I'm terrible at and I feel like the more happy I am is when I just get slightly better at these terrible things like that's when I feel like little bits of progress that is exactly how we're wired to react to success and if you sort of think about it I think about us as a species as an animal if you're presented with a challenge and you get a little dose of endorphins of dopamine or some feel-good chemicals when you do a task well that will encourage you to keep doing that task and keep looking for success small successes in your life which is exactly how people adapt and survive in harsh circumstances the problem with affluent modern society is it takes away all of the tasks of survival right you know no one in this room I don't think is having to figure out every morning how to literally physically survive where am I going to get my bet the berries I'm going to eat today we're going to go to kill something that I can eat how am I going to avoid the enemy like we're not thinking like that and which is an enormous blessing right I mean it's an enormous luxury to live like that the downside is you don't get this sense of mastery over your circumstances you actually don't feel responsible for your own survival you don't feel like you are earning your own survival in the world you feel like it's being handed to you and I grew up in an affluent suburb and I never had a sense as a young man that I was contributing in any way to the fact that I was physically alive on the planet well that's the that's that's very very recent in human history that young young men could afford to feel that way it's um again it's a blessing but also a bit of a curse it's the most disconnected amongst us are always spoiled rich kids that get handed everything to them and don't have an understanding at all about the consequences of their behavior yeah and and and that kind of life is correlated with depression yeah and I mean drug abuse yeah all that oh that's in the the suicide rate is rising fastest among middle-aged white men who if you listen to some people are apparently arguably the demographic that there are most privileged in this society yes doing the best with this civilization that we've constructed doing the worst biologically in terms of how they adapt to it and psychologically yeah and psychologically is a big part of the biology right and the thing about this this quest for stuff you know and one of the things that I thought was really interesting in the book we were outlining the key factors for happiness and that wealth is not the primary one but being good at something being recognized for being good at something being a part of a group like all these things were primary yeah I mean if you think about it and again in evolutionary terms we are safest when we are needed yeah so if you're in a group and the group needs you your status in the group is secure and it had better be because humans do not survive alone in the wild alone human in nature is a dead human right we're primates we're social primates a lone primate in the in nature is a dead primate and for most of the species and we get our we get our safety our protection from the fact that we work very very well in groups we don't have long claws we don't have sharp teeth we can't run very fast we can't climb trees worth a damn we're extremely vulnerable and we get our safety and our dominance and in the natural world from our ability to work in a group so if you're necessary to that group you're safe so people get very depressed when circumstances in their life change and they're suddenly not needed right when people get old and retire they're at very very high risk of depression and sometimes suicide when people lose their job and can't find a job they're an extremely high risk of depression and suicide so when the economy takes a downturn as it did in 2008 and the unemployment rate goes up the suicide rate immediately goes up it tracks the unemployment rate almost exactly and one of the points I make in my book is that a very small number of mostly men collapsed the US economy in 2008 and most of them living working on Wall Street and there was a direct I read an article in a academic journal on epidemics that there was a directly attributable to the financial collapse there were five or six thousand additional suicides in the United States mostly middle-aged white men okay and sort of professional prefer professional people and of all classes and and the and I realized that that was almost exactly the casualty rate from the two wars from Iraq and Afghanistan in other words something that happened at home economically killed just as many Americans as both wars did and nobody went to prison not one of those guys was prosecuted the people responsible for the collapse of our economy nothing happened to those guys and you could argue they killed just as many people as you know our enemies did overseas and there's a real injustice there I think most people aren't even aware of how screwy the whole thing was it is a great documentary that I always recommend to people called an inside job yeah fantastic yeah when that guy starts questioning those economics professors those the guys who eventually got jobs in the government and he or will went from there and got jobs at big corporations and you see them like folding folding under the weight of the actual truth of what they've done it's what was disturbing I mean listen they were I mean there were there were companies that were getting bailed out by the taxpayer to the tune of billions of dollars right bailed out and the the head the corporate leaders the corporate heads of those companies who had bankrupted their countries and asked the country to bail them out while they were getting bailed out these men were taking year-end bonuses of ten twenty thirty million dollars yeah I was stunning and then they were trying to put a cap on the bonuses like instead of removing it they were going to put a cap on the bonus a cap of 20 million right it's just it's insane right so you you think about that and in in and you makes you feel it makes me feel like we don't really have a country like an entity a group that isn't willing to defend itself isn't really a group right we were attacked by in some ways we were attacked by those people economically right the actions of those people the self-serving actions of a very small number of people cost this country 14 trillion dollars right there were no consequences for those people they were actually rewarded and it makes a person think like wow is there what you know we is there something is there something called America like the United States like in the Scent in the sense that we'll defend ourselves if we're attacked I mean that's one of the definitions of a country of a group and we didn't defend ourselves and so you saw in the recent election this sort of the confusion in the in the population about what it means to be an American like who like what what do we belong to here like what do we owe our loyalty to an enormous amount of confusion and and in my opinions it's increasing not decreasing right now in the current administration but it comes from some of those questions like we're in two wars that no one's paying attention to we you know we lost 14 trillion dollars and nobody blinked like what is it that we belong to yeah what is it yeah I mean we do seem to be in a deep state of confusion and I think one of the things you're seeing with people even like Trump supporters people that are these online frog people you know the little frog avatars I think one of the things that they like about it is that become they become a part of a troublesome little group Oh totally yeah they have a sense of purpose yeah yeah absolutely I mean why do you think people join Isis I mean he's European you know people in Europe joining Isis yeah they want a sense of purpose yeah and you know they've been taken in by the propaganda and all that they don't realize it's a completely bloodthirsty horrible criminal group but but they want a sense of meaning a sense of purpose there was a great band from out here about 15 years ago called called Queens of the Stone Age sure look amazing right and one of the lines aligned in one of their songs already quote rock lyrics to you but one of the lines is she wanted something to die for to make it beautiful to live yeah right something yeah that's a very profound insight actually into what makes people feel like they're leading a worthy life yeah instead of walking through a nerfed world yeah it's like what we're doing right so Prozac so if you walk around ask people on the street what would you die for like who or what idea would you die for I mean people would you know they they wouldn't have an answer for most of human history you know the immediate answer would be well I die for my people right of course like this thing this our encampment gets attacked by the enemy I would die I would die defending this place you know and and know that no one has that answer right and and which's shows that we live in safety and luxury which is lovely but it deprives people of a sense of purpose and meaning not just safety and luxury but this staggering change in what has been a normal way of living for people for thousands and thousands of years when you were writing this book and you were thinking about all the ways that human beings have altered the the environment around them did you like did you were saying that and I've read this before that genetics essentially we're riding on the same genetics that were ten thousand years ago from 2025 yeah are we going to change that like are we going to become more compatible with this bizarre and artificial world that we've created or are we going to get deeper and deeper depressed are we going to well okay so our society our culture is changing way faster than genetic change can happen right right so we haven't even adapted genetically to the advent of Agriculture ten thousand years ago that's pretty crazy right so right yeah and the only way genetic change happens in a population is that there is a difference in survival between people with one trait and people with another trait so so if you have a certain genetic trait and it leads to you having fewer children eventually ten thousand years from now people with your genetic trait will tend to die out because you're leaving fewer you're passing on less DNA to the next round right and if you have a trait that allows you to raise more children to maturity they carry your DNA and then they'll be more successful and that trait tends to spread so does human unhappiness lead to lower fertility rates probably not you know what I mean like I mean often depressions starts in midlife by that time most people have one or two children they've passed on their DNA so I don't it only acts through reproductive rights is something happened to us then there there must be some way where human beings are going to become going to become accustomed to this bizarre way we're living stacked on top of each other constantly in traffic we were accustomed to it I mean humans are very adaptive adaptable I mean you know people you can put people into solitary confinement in jail and they're not happy they're extremely depressed but they're it will physically survive for decades right so I mean evolution doesn't promise happiness it doesn't mean that will evolve towards happiness it means that we will adapt so that we can reproduce our DNA for the next generation that's all evolution means I've always just looked at all this reliance upon electronics and our fascination with innovation I've wondered if that's where we're headed if we're I mean it's almost like it's priming us for some sort of a symbiotic relationship with machines that were asked we can become more reliant on technology stack more and more people into places make it easier and easier to survive that's the one constant is that we're constantly embedded in technology yes I mean technology is a tool like the bow and arrow was and but you know keep in mind the the segment of the world population which is deeply intertwined with high tech is very very small most of humanity lives in a pretty simple and very very poor way so if you're talking about the human race as a whole I mean I'm not talking about Southern California I'm rational in New York City I mean the human race as a whole you know all this technology happened yesterday right it happened ten years ago twenty years ago in 20 years is going to be so you know whatever I mean who knows what's coming down the pike but that that's not even a blinking of an eye in evolutionary terms it doesn't even exist I mean it's I mean you evolution happens over the course of ten 20 thousand years now when you live in this life when you're a war journalist and you're in these insane places and then you come back to New York City what kind of like a decompression period do you have to go through well I you know often the the developing world that I've worked in I'm no longer covering wars by the way but but the developing world is often a very chaotic urban mix of you know poverty and cars and pollution and buildings therefore whatever I mean it is not necessarily not urban but what I what I would say is is that there's a there's something I would describe as a kind of disappointment to have the the if you wake up in the morning and your survival is a kind of question mark and you know that you have to act well and and and and with with sort of clarity and and precision and quickness in order to survive that is intoxicating right the challenge of that's intoxicating and you feel like you're sort of in a way earning your existence and when you leave that it's a relief but it's also a disappointment and because you're no longer earning anything right so it's a relief but it's also kind of disappointing and in that disappointment you can get quite depressed so I know that the depression rate like when people Peace Corps volunteers come back from two years service overseas they're not in war zones but they're in the developing world and living in small communities they're living at a much more difficult physically difficult existence than people in are suppose we belen our society when they come back to America the land of cars and everything you can want in the superstore in a supermarket and nice beds and everything that you think people want when Peace Corps volunteers come back to this lovely environment around 25 percent of them get profoundly depressed Wow so clearly what makes people feel good is challenge not ease yeah that's the conclusion I draw and not just challenge but challenge in the context of a community of people here we have ease in the in in the context of oneself or one's individual family by not in the context of the community and so you know if you look at catastrophes Hurricane Katrina was just in Mississippi and I was amazed not amazed actually in some ways to have people many people say well we really miss Hurricane Katrina we were all so close afterwards you know as a society with a lot of racial division and all kinds of stuff none of that mattered after Hurricane Katrina everyone cooperated everyone helped each other make people feel great that's what human beings wanted so what we've done by making things too safe we've we've we've dropped off the hills and just made everything flat and people long for those hills absolutely there's a group of friends that I have that are bowhunters and one of the things that people have gotten really addicted to is solo hunting where even regular bow hunting is not quite difficult enough for these psychos so they go deep deep deep 20 miles plus into the wilderness by themselves and one of the things they say about it is how profoundly lonely and sad it is and we even though they know they could walk those 20-plus miles back anytime they want but there's something about being out there by themselves that when they do return they just feel invigorated and alive and energized and they feel like they've accomplished something especially if they come back with an animal yeah well listen I mean that's an ancient narrative right I mean yeah the hunter goes out and kills the game and brings it back and feeds his people I mean that's a beautiful story and it's it has kept human beings alive for telford hundreds of thousands of years you know some hunting is well done in groves and some hunting is a solo enterprise depending on the animal and there absolutely is a role for that sort of solo endeavor Scouts are often work by themselves because I mean in a native native context like for example the American Indians the scouts often work by themselves because they were just harder to detect and if Terra I'm sure a terrifying endeavor what you're doing it for your people and so you you come back from that that's solo experience which is so frightening I mean we're social species so being alone in ending danger is terrifying you come back from that to your community you've served your community and you're among your people again I must be completely intoxicating I envy those people that experience yeah just having the experience of being in danger and then coming back and being at peace makes you appreciate that peace but constantly and consistently being at peace has a numbing effect that's right it's like constantly and consistently being well fed I mean I mean it's not bad to feel hungry once in a while and you really appreciate food yeah safety food warmth being rested or tired I mean you what we were adapted to to get through situations where we don't have enough of what we want what we need and if we if you were not deprived of those things we stopped appreciating them and those things are what make up life so we're actually losing we're losing our appreciation or enjoyment of the things that make life what it is there's a real irony there there is a real irony there did you feel compelled at all to come up with a solution I mean in deeply describing and just going over the various aspects of this problem that we're facing as a culture as a society did you did you have some sort of a need I didn't I mean listen if I thought if there was a solution that I was capable of thinking of I would have put it in the book either I'm not smart enough or there's no solution I don't know which it is yeah I think there's some things we can do around the edges that will help but we're talking about a systemic problem in society that has that has that got its start 10,000 years ago and really got its start in the Industrial Revolution and really they really got going in the technological revolution you're not getting we're not going to ban the car right the Amish in Pennsylvania don't use cars they have a very low rate of suicide and depression because they spend most of their lives within their community right that buffer is that from suicide and depression we're not going to ban the car right we're not going to burn down the suburbs live in lien twos we'd probably be happier if we did but we're not going to do it so but what can we do the biggest community that we have is the nation is the country and I think one thing that would help enormous Lee is to treat our nation as if we all belong to it and as if we all respected it and that it was meaningful to all of us and which means among other things it means insisting that politicians who denigrate who denigrate other other politicians who denigrate segments of the population who rank American citizens in terms of value in terms of being quote American whatever that means politicians who do that are undermining our sense of national community and I think that it has a trickle-down effect which is extremely demoralizing and makes gives you the equivalent of feeling like wow if you feeling like you're a child and a family that might what the parents might get divorced I remember during the campaign between Donald and Hillary I sort of felt like wow our mom and dad can split up like that's happening in this country right like okay you can argue but you guys are really talking as if the country's not going to stay together right yeah that's terrifying I think it's extremely demoralizing and unsettling for people well it's also extremely irresponsible like the type of person that should be a leader is not the type of person that puts that idea out there to the point where gets into the zeitgeist and people say well hey we maybe we really are in trouble well exactly I mean I think I think it fear mongering anyway it is and and you know these are ancient human behaviors and if you tell your people that there's a threat your people will rally behind you I mean it's a it's an adaptive behavior right the problem is as a politician if you tell your people that the enemy is actually the other political party you are effectively splitting the country in it right so you can act tribally all you want I mean tribal tribalism has a very negative connotation as well you can act in that tribal way all you want as long as you define your tribe as the country the entire country right and if you start slicing off group parts of the country demographic groups in the country political groups in the country say you know you're actually not really American like you really shouldn't be part of this when you start doing that you destroy the country you're way more of a threat to our democracy than Isis is then al Qaeda is I mean we're such a powerful country we are the only force that can destroy us no one else has Kentucky can hurt us so they can't really destroy us we can destroy us and we can and we can destroy ourselves to rhetoric it was one of the things that was most disturbing about the debates when donk trump said that if Hillary Clinton won he wouldn't necessarily accept the decision yeah absolutely I mean he was being completely what that was completely antithetical to the to democracy and to the to the concept of a country to the concept of a democratic country absolutely because he's a part of it so if she becomes the president she's his president and we're all supposed to look at the president as this is the one person we've elected as leader and what he's essentially saying it's either me or nothing that's right and what and what I really am I'm a Democrat I didn't vote for Donald Trump um but I really didn't like it when some of my fellow Democrats after he was elected and he was elected right I mean one way or another I mean if you can investigate Russia if you want or whatever but but the fact is that he he got the most electoral votes and he's our president and I really disliked it when my fellow Democrat said he's not my president he is actually and if you don't like that work harder next time and get someone else elected but he here's your president and it was equally disgusting when the shoe is on the other foot with Barack Obama and some conservatives started saying that Barack Obama wasn't really American or he wasn't really their president or that he was an enemy of the state that he was a secret Muslim spy wanted to destroy a Nigerian candidate yeah exactly I mean totally irresponsible and and it's antithetic the opposite of patriotism it's revolting do you think in that case that maybe it's good that we have a guy like Donald Trump and the president cuz he is kind of like almost like a human hurricane he's something to rally against he's a problem that's occurred where is the eroding confidence in the president now I mean it's palpable people know he lies he lies all the time I mean he just accused James Comey today of lying under oath when he talked about their conversations you know I I think Donald Trump is a very damaged and unhealthy person I think he causes a lot of pain to people around him and I'm guessing that he's in an enormous amount of of psychic pain himself the only thing that makes sense for all the hate tweets and all the thing he's constantly going after Rosie O'Donnell and yeah why I mean what I've learned in my life is that if someone's acting badly they're in pain yeah I mean it's a really simple rule right they're either scared or they're in pain I think he's both and on some level I feel kind of a kind of compassion for him but what I the what I I mean he said he already is and will be a completely failed president but he may actually help this country in his failure the GOP I think has abandoned all of its core values and core moral principles and decided that seems have decided that anything that will help the party is more important than things that will help the country and that is a very very undemocratic way to think I think if not if Hillary Clinton had been elected and these things were coming out the same kind of things about Russia etc coming out the GOP would be crossing her prosecuting her up to her eyeballs right so they have a complete double standard what I'm hoping is that the Trump administration is such a failure that the GOP to reevaluate its its policy of partisan politics as a way to win power and I hope it makes the entire country realize that the only way to really win power is through bipartisan politics and you can argue all you want but you have to you have to put the welfare of the country first I read an amazing book called our political selves I think it was called that about half of our political opinion is gin is genetically determined so genetically determined yeah so and it which makes sense so liberalism and conservatism basically liberalism is concerned with fairness within the group and equality within the group and an acceptance of outsiders as possible for possible inclusion in the group conservatism is focused on hierarchy and sort of law and order and a suspicion of outsiders and they're very very powerful evolutionary adaptive evolutionary reasons for both of those worldviews and they've done to us studies with identical twins that were adopted at Birth and compared them to fraternal twins and there's a far higher concordance of a political opinion in identical twins that were adopted at Birth and put in different kinds of families than with fraternal twins so that means that our political apparently is around 50% of our political beliefs are genetically determined which means that those beliefs had adaptive value in our evolutionary past which means that the argument I'm right you're completely wrong and you shouldn't exist is a false argument it that the country actually needs both parties very very badly and that a healthy society has conservatism and liberalism in a kind of dynamic tension where yes they might fight they might argue but they are they're roughly proportional in the population and equal weight is given to those two competing values was it taken into consideration that when these people are adopted that growing up adopted without your biological parents puts you in a certain mindset automatically and that maybe it wasn't necessarily a genetic thing but it was a circumstantial or a nurture well they compared identical twins who are genetically identical of course that were adopted to fraternal twins who were adopted you understand yes and fraternal twins are not genetically right but they still come from the same body they still come to know but their DNA is direct shorter individual yes right so both sets of twins were adopted right so they all went through that whatever that is that that process the effects of that whatever they are one all right one shared DNA exact duplicates of their DNA the other set of twins don't they're fraternal so the the twins that shared identical DNA were far more likely to have the same political beliefs than the fraternal twins in other words the genetic component was influencing their beliefs and the environmental component was not as much compared to the fraternal twins there's an amazing book and it really it to me it makes sense like both worldviews clearly were needed to keep our society healthy and strong and safe I mean god I mean a country that was run completely by liberals would get overrun by you know the enemy state next door immediately right a country that was completely run by conservatives would never get overrun by the enemy but it would be a heartless and brutal society right where the poor weren't taken care of and etc etc so you can't have one or the other you need both right kind of dynamic tension so it makes genetic sense that it works that way just like there would be genetic variations and all sorts of different aspects of people height and personality and all those different things yeah I mean it's or character traits right I mean they're partly genetic and they're partly determined by experience so right um you know courage or whatever generosity sensation-seeking right is a genetic trait but you can you can your since your impulse towards sensation-seeking is also determined by your experiences in life right I don't know what the proportions are but in terms of political belief it's roughly 50/50 your experience in life is about 50% responsible for your political beliefs and the and the other 50% is genetics we're always looking for one reason right we're always looking for nature or nurture we're looking for one of it we're not looking at this just whole soup of different entangled influences yeah that create a person yeah and is really interesting what I tell people that there genetics determine half of the political view they get really upset right they want to be completely self determining right I mean that people want to think that they are completely who are whatever they are they've created themselves and certainly something as emotional as political belief they don't want to think that it's wired into their DNA at all but you know that's that's the truth of it well just determinism in general I mean I remember the first time it was ever really deeply explained to me by Sam Harris I was rejecting it like almost instant I was like I didn't want to just be open-minded about it I wanted to go that no you could pull yourself up you could figure you do what your wits willpower you decide what you want to do with your life but not really necessarily I mean listen when I was young I was a really good distance runner right and I ran a half mile mile on up to you know 10,000 meters marathon whatever I ran for 12 for the mile was a pretty decent time it's very fast I really wanted to be like the fastest mile or in the world right and I trained as fast as anyone who's ever trained as hard as anyone's ever trained and I might my ceiling was for 12 I mean that was genetically determined mmm you know sorry like you can run 130 miles a week like I did for months on end and still not go to the Olympics yeah there's no doubt about it I mean ah as a mixed martial arts commentator the the big factor that you can't do anything about is power some people are born with striking power it doesn't make any sense they have they look exactly the same they look just like a person who can't hit nearly as hard as them right right yeah I mean my understanding is the sort of sequencing of muscle groups in coordination that result in that kind of power is amazing it's bone structure as well there's a lot of variables is actually the the the geometry of the shoulder like how wide your shoulders are in terms of the hips to waist ratio there's a lot of different factors kidding yeah that's why the reasons why men can hit so much harder than women it's literally the shape of the hips women's hips are wider the legs going word more it's a different sort of right we can call advantage which is probably connected to the speed you can throw a baseball at yeah I bet it the same skeletal yeah apparently boys and girls can throw pretty much the same until puberty and then it really splits and and so it's probably for that reason I will let that be interesting but let's see what would they do with Tran gender women - men who start taking testosterone I don't think it changes the shape of your pelvis no I mean the testosterone doesn't change you know is it going to change you it does change you it does have some effects on bone density and I think the width of the shoulders changes and certain character the face obviously changes yeah right yeah yeah and just the sort of muscle I mean explosive power of the muscles as you get old you lose explosive power as a man right so I mean testosterone is sort of key here I mean you're at your peak in your early 20s I guess yeah but what we're saying is that there really are genetic limitations there's no doubt about it and this idea of like a fair fight there's sometimes it's not fair it's just not going to be and with you is the mile with some people it's the the ability to hit hard it's some people it's just speed no I mean if you've ever seen like a Floyd Mayweather fight is incredibly clear that not only is he ridiculously skillful but he's got some stupendous speed advantage over most human beings yeah absolutely I also I was watching his fight of his it was sort of slow-mo I mean I sort of slowed it down so I could really watch and he got hit full in the face by somebody I mean right in the face and his his eyes never blink yeah yeah like he wanted to mean he couldn't get out of the way and he watched that thing come in and hit him square in the face and his eyes never close yeah it's incredible yeah really good boxers can do that as they're getting punched in their face their eyes are wide open and they're looking for the counter it's really incredible yeah it's amazing no flinch at all I mean nothing absolutely nothing amount of training you would have to do to overcome the end it's one of the more important reasons why it's so critical to learn striking in particular at a very young age the body develops some people can pick it up late in life and still be really successful at it but I don't think you ever really get like a real elite boxer that doesn't start training before puberty or around people you're probably right there's just something about the development of the body like your body growing and maturing with this task learning how to strike and move and explode with combinations well likewise for music and languages and you know that before puberty you will never be like at a top top top world-class level wow that makes sense I in terms of languages you will not be able to speak with a perfect accent really yep after puberty the brain is finished wiring itself and it cannot it cannot exactly mimic a foreign accent and if you learn French or whatever at any language at you know 8 9 10 you can sound exactly like a native and after puberty you can wow do you have kids yes I have a three and a half month old daughter oh well when they start talking to you man that's when it gets weird I have three a 29 and a seven and what's what's really fascinating is watching the the the traits that you know have come directly from DNA like parts of you emerge out of the kid and it and maybe one kid and then the other kid none of it you know and some of it it'll be your wife and it's just it's it's so strange too because you try to piece it together like what what are instincts right why or why our dogs barking at snakes they don't know what the fuck a snake is but they know something's wrong there's something deep in their memory banks that say this is an issue whereas a stuffed animal on the grounds not an issue right yeah that's right that's right we don't know what that is entirely well I tell you what it is is that the dogs that weren't in reflexively fearful of something that looked like a snake died more often there's offspring and so they'll bark in a Crooked Stick too just to be on the safe side and you know likewise humans are scared of heights yeah there's a if you're not scared of heights you're more likely to fall and you won't pass on your genes right Lucy the famous early early human skeleton in East Africa why don't I mean you know Lucy from yes dear science classes yeah um she died by falling out of a tree wow they just figured that out from the Dyk fractures and stuff in her bone structure Wow yeah yeah it must have been incredibly common it's just all the different things that people are afraid of arachnophobia Vidia phobia fear of spiders and snakes I mean those are directly related to poison and terrified of spiders so you feel its genetic like maybe someone in your past or somewhat well I tell you let me answer the the range of things that of the the common phobias that people have those those things have a sort of survival significance right so people usually aren't phobic of chairs because chairs were not a survival threat in our evolutionary past but Heights spiders snakes those kinds of things were a were a threat and so when children get phobias they're choosing something that makes genetic sense yes why I chose spiders I don't know I was probably just exposed to a frightening spider at the wrong moment in my insecure little life do you think you were exposed to or do you think maybe is it possible that someone in your past does some ancestor pass that through the DNA well I mean we're all predisposed towards being reasonably fearful of those things right right a phobia is a panic disorder yeah so we're all nervous around barking dogs snakes spiders Heights those kinds of things right be claustrophobia beings trapped in a small space there's all normal things to be worried about but when it crosses the threshold to a phobia that's a panic disorder and that is a function of something going on in your childhood where but is it absolutely in your childhood I mean phobias start in childhood yeah but I mean is it possible that someone could have a fidya phobia arachnophobia and not have experienced spiders or snakes it's one of the things that happened to me when I was hosting fear factor as I would see people that were pretty risk-taking yeah they would and they would they would be willing to do the heights they would be willing to jump a car off the top of a building they would take chances they were risk takers but you'd put him in front of a snake and they would freak the fuck out and it was a it was a deep cellular thing like you could see with some people that that they weren't cowards they weren't timid folks right but they would see that one thing whatever that thing is right well I you know I don't know I will tell you though that once I don't have a television but I was in Hotel so I like I watch TV when I'm traveling because of the I'm in a hotel and I saw Fear Factor and there and so keep in mind I've been terrified of spiders my entire life and there was what I mean this was actually quite traumatizing to me I mean seriously like traumatizing like it affected me for days there was like very hot young woman in a bikini and you put her in a glass like a glass box yeah and you dumped a 55-gallon drum of tarantulas on door yeah I remember that her boyfriend threw up it was so and she finally stood up with tarantulas fallen off her I mean she couldn't take it and I was like in the fetal position in the corner of my hotel room Wow yeah it was totally horrifying to me I mean it really messed me up for a few days it's just so strange that there's particular things that resonate like that like particular things whether it's a snake or a spider just I mean I really wonder if like the things that human beings have like and that also animals have these instincts if we just don't totally understand what memory is we don't totally understand genetic memories right yeah well it's all stuff that helped us survive those are all threats in our prime in our primordial past now you've got a documentary out that you're working on as well yeah why it's out now it's airing on Sunday it's um it's called Hell on Earth it's about the Syrian civil war and the rise of Isis and it's out on National Geographic Channel 9:00 Eastern 8:00 central this Sunday this Sunday um is it going to be available I mean you can obviously watch it at the time but it's going to be available on Netflix or Apple TV or something like that well I think I'll know that yeah yeah it's um I haven't even thought that far ahead I mean it's owned by National Geographic so I don't know quite know how they're I'm sure you'll be able to get it on their website at some point but it's airing on Sunday and what was your experience doing that well you know I was home writing tribe actually and so I wasn't overseas and you couldn't really get into Syria anyway I mean it was a suicidal thing to do and so what we did my colleague Nick the guy who was here earlier we basically sort of worked the border border areas around Syria looking for people who were living in Syria who knew people in Syria shoot for us and we found some very very brave people who documented their lives under Isis their lives with the Free Syrian Army there was a lot of combat and we accumulated about an hour a thousand hours of footage and interviews we did with experts and we put together hell on earth trying to explain how really quite peaceful democratic protests turn into violent demonstrations and finally into a civil war and of course it's the it was the repressive government I mean people protest in the street and they're met with machine-gun fire and eventually civilians are going to get some machine guns themselves and fight back and that's how you get a civil war how do you take thousands of hours like that and boil it down to a one show well that's it's very very hard I mean that's what filmmaking is and it's figuring out what's the 1% that goes into the film and how do i structure it how much time does it take to do something we had a really good I mean is the first I've made this is my fifth film most of the films I've made it was me and an editor and so another person in the room or whatever this we had a big team and so we had some very very smart young people who are going through all this footage and categorizing it like here this is a section about you know this material is about whatever escaping Isis and this is about trying to find food you know whatever they would they would sort of put it into categories and then I would start to look through some of that material and could gradually sort of build a build a structure the the situation in Syria seems to be from someone who just hasn't studied it that much but just looks at it from the outside one of the bleaker darker situations that we have here in the world I mean it's the tragic tragedy of this generation I think over 400,000 Syrians mostly civilians have died the equivalent equivalent death toll in this country would be I think seven or eight million Americans the equivalent amount of people and and half the country half the Syrian population has been displaced from their homes and millions millions are you know outside the country's borders in Europe and and and even in this country what did you take out of the documentary I mean it seems like no one has a solution for Syria no I mean civil wars are tough that way I think Isis Isis eventually is going to be defeated on the battlefield they're going to be eradicated and I hope they are because there are ghastly brutal group and Assad who is who's killed way more people than Isis he just didn't do it publicly like they did he's the the leader of Syria president of Syria he's propped up by Iran and by Russia and so he's not going anywhere I mean if you have those two countries as your allies like you're not going anywhere so I think what's going to happen ultimately is that Isis will be defeated and the country will be partitioned along sectarian lines and they're eventually there may be a kind of a delicate peace it seems like with all those Middle Eastern countries will move any country that's run by a brutal dictator as soon as that dictator is removed or as soon as somebody dies there's this massive power vacuum yeah yeah I mean that would be the argument for not trying to remove him I mean he's a guy who lead criminal and sadist and he's horrible but what was the argument for keeping Saddam Hussein in power was the argument for keeping Gaddafi in power yeah I mean basically it's sort of utilitarian argument it was from John Stuart Mill like what's going to what's going to cause the least human suffering or promote the most human happiness and and you know I sometimes I can understand the reasoning behind look the guy is a dictator but we should leave them in place because the alternative is a lot of other innocent people suffering when we remove him in the country collapses this country has already collapsed so the projects or the question is okay we make a tentative peace deal with him we'll leave you in power we won't try to topple you but let's stop fighting I mean I can I could support that yeah personally Wow isn't that crazy the idea of keeping that guy in power yeah so less people suffer you keep a brutal murderous dictator in power yeah and I'm better off that way yeah well I mean you know the war killed almost half a million people yeah if you want if you want that to continue like right yeah that's I mean those are the awful moral choices it's very frustrating for people though because they would like to see like they would like to see some solution like on the tape but that doesn't seem like a solution well well it's a solution to the violence right I mean I any P any peace deal is a solution to the violence so and the first thing that has to happen I think is that the violence stop so that people stop dying the pursuit of justice is a secondary it's important but it's a secondary matter after that I know you're running out of time here so just good what what brings you what brings you satisfaction when when you do something like this documentary or your book tribe I you I really like the I like the sort of game of ideas right like I like exploring a topic and starting to make sense of it and starting to see connections between things so when I was writing tribe it started when the central thesis of it sort of occurred to me and all these disparate facts suddenly align themselves in an early way and I felt like I'd shown a little bit of light onto the world and shown how it worked like that's totally intoxicating to me and likewise when you're making documentary you suddenly start to see themes and structures in the film in human affairs and then they sort of come out and and and when and when you work on that level it's incredible to me it's like an incredibly gratifying and because that means that I've now made sense of something there's a disorderly confusing world and I've managed to organize it in an understandable way and that means other people can understand it and then we can have a conversation about how the world works and how people work and that to me is the point of journalism it's the point of all intellectual endeavor and and to be even a small part of it to me is like incredibly exciting well you nailed it and you definitely nailed it and with this the thing I was talking about how when I'm just beginning the first chapter I had a real urge to get out of the city I had a real urge just like there's this thought like I live in the woods can I live in a tribal society like it seems it just if it seems like you were outlining like almost like a mathematical problem yeah um yeah it um or chemical maybe even a chemical problem well you know I studied anthropology in college and and and my understanding of humans is that we are social we are social primates that prefer to live in groups of about 50 people in a challenging environment that's what human beings are and to the extent that we depart from that we lead lives of dissatisfaction and in frustration and that's how I understand life how do you manage that in your own life I I mean I wish out you know I wish I was part of a communal group fighting to survive in the wilderness like I mean I had some taste of that with the platoon that I was with and that was intoxicating it has downsides obviously and you can't stay out there forever but it made me at least understand that the source of my dissatisfaction in life wasn't internal it was it made sense it was a that I was having a healthy reaction to circumstances in society that humans were not adapted for and even that was enough to bring a kind of peace of mind for me I also very consciously and deliberately try to live in places where there is the possibility of a sort of close communal neighborhood I live in a very poor neighborhood in New York City and which for some of the hassles at least has the sort of rich fabric of human connection that you just don't get in wealthy neighborhoods so you do it on purpose oh yeah what would I don't want you to say where you want to say where you live I live in the Lower East Side Manhattan and I mean I'm very very poor but it's a de minute it's a Dominican neighborhood have half the people in that neighborhood really don't speak English very well so what cities are there it's a very rich or ethnic neighborhood people are quite poor and I and I know everybody everyone knows each other by sight and we look out for each other and it's I mean during hurricane hurricanes when Hurricane sandy hit New York I mean a lot of the people that had young children had to leave because there was no light there was no water the power was out right to half of Manhattan was completely dark it was really actually quite dangerous at night in the dark half of Manhattan and where there was no streetlights and so this building it's a tenement building that I live in with my wife and and a lot of the people left and that they were worried about being robbed and these are poor people right is not a wealthy building at all it's quite quite a poor building and so they they organized a guard shift one of the people one of the women in the building had a machete and they organized guard ships at the front door with a machete and the young men in the building took turns like two hours at a time guarding the building with a machete whoa yeah and um you know I wasn't associated with the building at that time but boy would that it made me feel good to be part of that like that you know what I mean like that is what human beings that's what they are right it's that right and you didn't see that in a wealthy neighborhood partly because the wealthy neighborhoods actually in light right just seems weird to make the choice to live in a community like that because of those factors well my wife lived there and I moved in with her so but but what the REE the reason I was happy to move in with her one of the reasons I move in with her is precisely because it wasn't an affluent neighborhood like the honey Grubman that to me is just soul death right I mean it's just I grew up in an affluent suburb and it's just the most boring thing on the planet like it's just deadly to me and and I you know like had I not grown up like that maybe I'd be living in a neighborhood like that I mean I get it right but I did grow up like that and the one thing that I just cannot survive is that kind of complacent affluence like it just kills me it's so funny because that's the one thing that people try to achieve when they grow up in that sort of poor community they want to get out live in that big house the big yard look at their suicide rates their addiction rates yeah their depression rate I mean seriously you if you look at those alcoholism depression suicide in effluent neighborhoods I mean it's astronomical it's brutal boy but try to convince people to abandon that way that's where it's really odd it seems like so counterintuitive to them it's like no no you're going to live in a safe neighborhood no no you're going to have a big house you can have a nice car and a great job you're gonna do great well think about it evolutionary turns terms the impulse towards safety and luxury is a totally healthy one in a situation where nature doesn't offer that very often right right so we're programmed to go for those things right what we're not prepared for is to go for those things and have it happen all the time all right you see what I'm saying like it's only healthy instincts of course right but we didn't involve in a world where you could actually achieve that 100% of the time I mean dogs are programmed a lot of dog species our program will eat until they've eaten so much that they'll kill themselves eating right it's because there wasn't enough food to do like the programming to keep eating as long as their food is great if there's a scarcity of food right all right as soon as there's a plenitude of food that becomes maladaptive and the dog dies and you know likewise people put fat on very easily because in a harsh environment with a lot much food you have to be able to put fat on easily or you'll die now with the the reason there's so many obese people is because we have that impulse to eat and eat need and the food is there to do it with and we don't have the mechanism for stopping it and so that's why there's so many fat people oh it's also sugar that's a big yeah absolutely but our taste for sugar and for fat is programmed by evolution right right because there wasn't much of those things so now you can have as much as you want and suddenly people weigh 350 pounds right I mean it's it's it's evolutionary programming run amok in a world where there's too much of something that was is very good but was very scarce you highlight some really profound issues with culture in your book but I would wonder if how many people come up to you after they've read it and go what do I do like you're right you're right but what do I do I mean Here I am I'm this guy I have this house I have a mortgage I have kids I have a job that's good I don't want to leave it but what do I do because you're right I'm fucking miserable what do you what do I do like what do you tell those people um I mean I you know it's really a question of is a question you can't have it all and and what I would say to them is sell your house like move in a sell your car if you can move into a community where you have to be in too reliant with the people around you and they have to interact with them every day like that is what makes people feel good but the thing is people are understandably not willing to give up yeah the pleasures of an affluent life in order to have social connection I mean I get it right but but you really can't have both very successfully it's extremely hard to yeah I have a buddy of mine who lived in Venice in a real nice tight-knit community they had this cul-de-sac and everybody lived in the everyone everyone know everybody I live in a cul-de-sac I they're great and he started doing well and the first thing he did he moved out and you've got this really nice house in this big yard he fucking hates it he's miserable when we talk about because I fucking hate it he goes I don't know my neighbors he goes I have this big yardage to stare at it and go back inside my house he goes I used to know everyone on the block I knew everyone in the community that's right well that guy is I mean that lifestyle is correlated with higher depression suicide rates I mean he's literally a statistical risk increased statistical risk of suicide and depression because of that change Wow so you regardless of how much money you would make you would always move into a neighborhood where people are relying upon each other and stay tight to each other oh yeah I'm not yeah absolutely Wow I mean it's not even that yeah it's no way I like that's not even a choice yeah I mean I'm like me I just get instantly depressed in affluent neighborhoods wow that's so crazy yeah I crash I mean hard do you accumulate any material possessions are you one of those new eyes like a notebook and a couple of pairs of shoes I you know I mean minimally but yeah I mean we live in a very small apartment so there's not room for much but um and you're happy with that oh yeah yeah I mean listen the less you have the happier you are at the end of the day like you can probably make that as a empirically true statement empirically true really and I'm not listen I'm not talking about poverty lack of food lack of resources I mean I'm obviously course you're not talking about that I'm talking about material possession right stop the cars and boats and shit I always feel like once you get a boat you're probably fall falling apart you know you know I mean like unless you're a fisherman you know you're going out there and getting a boat it's like what you just you know what are you doing well you know it's interesting like that kind of mature those kind of material possessions also they I mean again evolution right like particularly for males in the society if you control resources you you have a reproductive advantage over males that don't control resources and you know girls will like you better right so when you're an 18 year old boy the instinct to get a car to get a boat maybe one day to get a private area you know with a private airplane whatever that instinct has huge evolutionary advantage because it gives you access to women right not all women but enough so that's a great strategy for meeting girls right right the problem is that once you're sure further on in your life and you have children you have a family if you don't have a community and what you have instead is a huge lawn and over powered boat and a ridiculously expensive car you have you have taken things that were that were that were a definite reproductive advantage at 18 and you have dragged them into midlife where instead of making you feel good they will depress you in my opinion like that's that's what happens to those guys so it's not that those things are still a stupid idea at earlier point in your life but definitely when you're 50 years old again I'm sure like you could Coral if you did up the proper study you could you can make a correlation between those kinds of material possession and alcohol abuse depression suicide all that stuff I wonder if that's the case with like rappers and people that grow up in these poor black communities that go on to have insane material wealth I've always been fascinated by the ridiculous hip-hop culture of just giant houses and 50 cars and throwing money up into the air and just this celebration of excess coming from a place of nothing and having this deep desire to achieve all those things that seemed unattainable look I mean I think athletes have the same problem too yeah you know and particularly I mean they have the fraternity of their team until they retire and apparently retired athletes professional athletes are a real risk of depression yes and I mean listen I met a young woman who had survived cancer and she said to me rather sheepishly she said you know when I had when I was she was on a cancer warrant you know all the other cancer sufferers survived sufferers on the ward and her family and her so basically her tribe rallied around her she didn't know if she was going to survive she was undergoing chemo and all that awful awful stuff and she looked at me clearly sheepishly and said no and I survived and now I miss being sick she missed the community of cancer sufferers on that ward and in her own community that rallied around her she was lonely now soldiers are missing war and cancer survivors missing cancer like something's missing yeah well there's a struggle that's missing for sure you know in my own life um I'm a very addictive person I dig deep personality and I found a lot of happiness in martial arts yeah and one of the things about martial arts is particularly in jiu-jitsu because it's one of the rare martial arts you could practice going 100% right and not really hurt each other too much because you're not you're not hitting each other right you're just choking each other and tapping each other out and stuff but this there's a camaraderie in a bond between people that choke each other all the time that you just don't see with other men or I don't see well yeah listen I hear you man I I mean I started when I when my marriage started falling apart I started boxing right and I just needed something I'd always been a pretty intense athlete when I was young and I was sort of smoked cigarettes and drank for a while and then suddenly on my life's in crisis at 15 I started going to a boxing gym méndez boxing in New York City so I have 50-year learn how to box yeah and I see I'd always had a pretty intense relationship with my body as an athlete right so I wasn't starting from zero who has been in really good shape and but I'd never boxed before never done anything like that and what I loved about Mendez it's an old gym in New York and as like Leeson's it's in Manhattan and what I loved about it is that there were some very tough kids from the outer boroughs right there was like suits that would come in from Wall Street at lunchtime to box there was women there was all kinds of people wealthy people poor people black white whatever was everyone's in there right what I loved about it is that no one no one brought their street identity into the into the gym right you were is just like a platoon in combat you were you were judged in they're not for whether you're young in black and poor or wealthy and affluent and white or whatever but how you act in the gym and there's no prejudice that I can see against the young black kids that are in there but there's also no prejudice I guess the wealthy white guys right as long as you leave it at the street you whoever you are in that space and you get all the respect you want if you act well and that is the deeper Galit arianism of a tribal society you're judged by how you act and that's it that's the same thing with your justice schools you're judged by your effort and how well you can perform on the mats right listen I'm in middle aid I'm a middle-aged guy right I mean I'm never gonna win a championship and I'm never getting where I mean what am I going to do professionally with boxing it's not happening but I worked out really really hard I'm not afraid to get hit like and I have all the I mean everyone in the gym knows me and I have all the respect I could ever want and through that struggle also you achieve some feeling of peace because you're struggling it's a brutal struggle boxing for people who've never tried it it's unbelievably exhausting III I mean I thought for twelve-mile was the hardest thing I could imagine I had no idea what a one-hour session like a really intense one hour training session was like much less sparring geez yeah not much left getting hit in the liver yeah yeah yeah I just I mean annihilating and and but I was in a lot of psychic pain and I needed yeah I really felt like especially physical struggle I mean there's a lot of people that are averse to exercise and like I can't stress it enough I think the body needs physical struggle I think if you don't I think there's an overflow of energy and stress that's unmanaged and it manifests itself in a very physical way there was a there was a study that I read of um I mean there were a few hundred gathering societies that are still in existence and the average amount of physical activity in subsistence level hunter-gatherer societies which of course is our evolutionary past I mean that's what we are designed to to do is something like two hours of hard walking per day like on average men and women moved like vigorously for two hours a day usually walking quickly right that's what our bodies are designed for and it's what we if we do that that were tuned up at that level right where our mind feels go to our bodies feel good and if you don't do that I mean you can't lay around all day but it will not you will you will experience a deaf I colossal deficit and a physical deficit yeah I think that I mean there's no way to make people do it but I think if you could give people advice that would be one of the big ones oh and you know in Western society the older you get the more money you tend to have a more sedentary you are and there's a corresponding decline in testosterone levels in males right what they found in these very mobile physical societies is that testosterone levels and males really didn't decline until the 70s 70s to 70s I mean decline slowly but it didn't go off a cliff like it does in our society at five or whatever it is like it was a gradual decline and if there was a cliff it was in the mid 70s and that's because I mean the theory was that it was because that constant intense physical activity testosterone allows for it but that activity actually keeps those levels high and brought a symbiotic relationship now completely makes sense from one of the things that they prescribe to middle-aged men is Sprint's you know run up hills like carry heavy things do squats do things that stimulate your entire body right yeah we're boxing yeah we're boxing yeah all those things listen man I've taken up enough of your time and I really appreciate it and I'm really enjoying your book and I'm looking forward to documentary and it's
