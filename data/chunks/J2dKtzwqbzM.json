right 3 2 2 1 boom and we're live my man what's up baby first of all how the fuck do you punch so hard I've seen hard punchers man I've been watching boxing since I was a little kid you've got some freakish power man yeah weird you got weird power almost definitely we always said I'm a freak of nature I definitely got some type of freakish power um I always tell the story that my grandmother said I was anointed by God she was always like if I got suspended for school and stuff she was always like God is trying to use you you're the one you're chosen you know she was very big and you know she was being an experienced spirituality and Christianity you know so she's always be a teacher you know she wasn't really a discipline disciplinary type of woman she was a teacher she wanted to teach you tell you certain things used to always say oh I was annoying she won't even let my parents wouldn't me well not in front of her that's how serious she were she like she like don't you been out with him he's gonna be the one to bring you up he's gonna be the one to bring you guys up don't whip him you know somebody tells you something like that at a young age you might believe it well you know just being so young you know just being you know we wit we we did as children do you know I didn't really think too much about it because I didn't understand what she was saying you know I didn't start understanding until you start putting away childish ways and you become a grown man he started venturing out in life and experiencing life on your own and started seeing certain things and then even even when I got out of my own you know I really there's a lot of things I didn't start understanding to I was thirty you know I'm just too you know cause certain things different things would happen in my life you know and that's you know sometimes you just you that you you deal with it and you handle it the best way you can help but there's certain things that starts to happen he was like my grandma said something about this art you know it's just yes you know and that's how my life been but it's amazing how I can come in at 2:09 and father God is coming in at 260 and able to drop him like I did like it's crazy but we are I've always been stronger than my than what I would look it's interesting that the cruiserweight division doesn't get any love I mean the last time I got love was when Evander Holyfield was fighting in it yeah that was really the last time people cared about the cruiserweight division now it's a forgotten division kind of a yeah yeah that's true you know you know my brother's just starting in the cruiserweight division hopefully can bring some excitement you know to it because you're so right you know it's almost like they don't even talk about it it doesn't make any sense because the light heavyweight division gets a lot of love you love watching light heavyweights always gets lots of attention but the cruiserweight division is always like people look at it like why are you here yeah well add some weight go up yeah yeah it's true it's true because the heavyweights always overshadow yeah those guys did you really weight 209 the night of the fight I waited to uh behind the fight I was out when they came in the way me and I would just want to get an official weigh-in and see see where you are so I'm all confident and like I like I know I didn't went up from 212 right and I get on the scale and it says to or now like I like what you mean you Tim I lost three more pounds you know I'm like how did I you know how did I do that my manager you know he thinks it's come from stress and a lot of different things or whatever the last couple days right before the fight that allow your body just just overall a lot of stuff was you know a lot of stuff going on he thinks is because of that you know because your body your dependency your your body and all that stuff like that but I really don't know I really don't really care about weight because majority of my fighter the majority of fighters that have fought me they've all waited me like almost all my career you know so I always say I rather be the park then looked apart because I've been in many situations where I've seen guys looking the part but then when it's when they get to the nitty-gritty they're not depart well you look the part too don't get it twisted right yes you look like a giant Tommy huh yeah you know when Tommy was in his prime it's just uh it's what would make sense though is that you keep that power in the 12th round where's those bigger heavier guys maybe because the Bloods got to push through all that extra muscle and all that extra body tissue maybe they can't keep that power the way you can because in the twelfth round first of all I don't know how the fuck he got up I do not understand I remember watching it on TV I'm like wow he knocked him out in the 12th round that is crazy that is crazy and then of course you played that thing on your Instagram which basically shows that you did knock him out what no I definitely not the morrow he definitely didn't get up in time right he definitely didn't you know but it's his job to just get up at 10:00 it's not his job to know exactly when ten seconds is correct correct no Jerry stephannie had delays on that count I don't seem to fight like six times and yeah definitely got to eight you know eight was a very long delay eight these are no you know like I said not nine out of ten jurors would have waved at all you know easily specimen you've seen the guy rolling up his head and he and him hitting the canvas and his his his whole head meet penetrated like like it started getting tight the muscles in his getting tight in the back and you know but it's it's so much with that I know how he got I didn't understand how he got up either you know God is a good god well he believed it that's what even he believed it yeah look he got up man and he got up and he boxed well yeah he recovered you mean you came after him and you hit him with some more big shots yeah and he kept moving but then he started getting his legs back on German and he started landing there's also other things as well - you know he's still a gypsy though yeah you know you know they believe in a lot of things yeah right so you never know you know he's looking phenomenal fight those epic it was amazing to watch most definitely I watched it by myself your family was Gandhi went out like this is great just me did you watch it on mute no I'm saying did the commentators man it was horrible yeah it was horrible I felt there was very biased it was a lot of things they was point out what fear was doing but a lot a lot of things what I was doing it just even when I knocked down in the knife round they had all this to say but when I knock down a knife round it was so quiet and it wasn't even a devastating knockout you know I was getting hit behind the head but they wanted to call out meeting him behind the ear but how many times I got hit behind the head never was revealed it was like even just just just at home you know build up to it you know he sold the story he saw this coming to America and you know any comeback sport it did with emotional you know emotions you know right people got emotionally tied to it people a lot of people could relate to his story you know certain things I could relate to and then you know when when you you you capture you know the world and you capture people that that um they get emotional involved they want you to win right now just because of the story and stuff like that and the commentators you know especially Paulie especially and got very emotional with it a lot of the cast as well too just going back listening to them and saw the fight six times you know I definitely had it you can see a very better look on the fight immunity v you know well I've listened to the commentary but you know I do commentary myself or the UFC so a lot of times even if I'm listening I'm not really listening that much I'm just watching watching what's happening it's like I'm having a conversation in a room with a bunch of people right I was watching what was happening what was interesting to me was you made adjustments you know and one thing that you made a big adjustment is when you landed in the 12th round you shorten everything up he's shortened that right hand up it wasn't a winging punch at all it came straight down the pipe and then that left hand behind him and the fucking timing because he was already going down through you already hit him clean he's going down then that fucking left hook man whoa yeah it was what was really crazy that he got up from snapped him around like The Exorcist it was when he went flying and then flatlined and laid back I was like it's over I can't believe he knocked him out in the 12th fucking round cuz all fight I was saying all this guy needs is one punch like you got that scary creepy power and then BOOM what you could say that all day long but if it never lands it doesn't mean anything right look at it landed and the way it land there's like holy shit a toll fairy I said you're gonna have to be perfect for 12 rounds not only had to be perfect for a couple of seconds yeah and that's one thing that I did hear the commentators say they said that he's proven that he doesn't have to be perfect cuz he got hit but I was like E but he didn't get hit clean he got hit one time like pretty solid behind the ear mm-hmm but the big one was in the 12th I'm so impressed with both things with you being able to land like that and with him being able to get up ryder's that was probably one the best heavyweight fighter fucking ever seen it was a lot of pressure on me that night you're not sure I'm just the heavyweight division has been there for for a long time and then we started with last year or something we just started religious progressing and people started to talk about it especially been dead in America I don't know more time when no one knew who who was the heavyweight champion of the world were you know European guys and stuff like that so I always made it my business like I want to bring it back I'm gonna do it like I lead it and a lot of the other former champion just did it where people with new way understand the sport of boxing then who was the champion and stuff like that I always thought I had that that duty to fulfill even when I was in the lipids because a lot of people don't even know I was in Olympics right you know I was the only American to medal in the 2008 Olympics as well and just from that point is feel like I had to be the one to bring it back and to come to LA to bring out all the stars and like I got everyone here and you meddled in the Olympics quit pretty soon pretty young in your boxing career from the time you started training correct like what how long was it in until you were fighting the Olympics I made the Olympic team in a year and a half I started boxing I started boxing at Twitter whoo you know how fucking crazy that is so a year and a half a boxing you make the Olympic team and you went a bronze medal mm-hmm that's that's insane you know that II have my name written on the list of the one that's gonna be on the team you know they always say I was I just came on knowhere came out of nowhere yeah you know I remember being in a in a tournament and I'm had this elder man you know he's seen these kids like year at the year at the year and I'm he I remember him saying I said who are you I said I'm Deontay Wilder and he looked at his the guy next to him you know he were you from I said I'm from Alabama Alabama he laughed at media because they'd never seen no one from Alabama you know you know we was based out of football and basketball and stuff like that I didn't even I was surprised it was a gym in our number when I did start you know I was like wow I can't believe like I'm in a boxing gym I never thought one would be here we didn't do that you know we just heard about it but I started because of my daughter that was born with spina bifida so you know I couldn't play football or basketball anymore because you had to go to school for that I needed money right now you know so I was looking at a way of making money like right now and you know I had a friend in college we was always talking about what we want to try to do and what are the things we're trying to do to get to that point because you know talk is cheap we don't always saying what we want but if you're not applying any type of action towards what you with your words you just it just is just talk you know he said he thought I said box he thought I should start boxing you know I thought it was a great ideas where to he thought it he thought I should start but only for the simple fact that I handle myself well streetwise you know nobody ever seen me just lose or get beat up streetwise I was this quiet guy I tell people I never looked for trouble but trouble always found me for some reason and and when I did release the anger when I released like it was it was even back then was dramatic you know kid you not even back then I believe you know and I couldn't never calm down don't worry at that point I was like the Hulk I couldn't calm down it took me a lot to come down even if I would see blood I still went calm down and it used to be scary for me because I you know even back then I had power but I was just I had a lot of aggression I had a anger for some reason I never know why you know and and we thought it was a great idea I like you know what I'm gonna do it you know I can't lose what can I lose you know and just went to the met up with the guy went to the gym you know I've been Tuscaloosa Alabama and I walked in there I kid you not I feel like I heard the bells I mean I heard the sounds the heavily said oh I swear I hit when I walked up in there it was just the speed bag and a heavy bad being hitting the conversations and then the guys sparring and my eyes is anyone I never been in so a place like this before ever you know it is just it's like new to me and I like I felt like this was it this is my last opportunity to be someone to be a professional athlete and be able to make money for my daughter I didn't know I came in as a journeyman jennasmith that's what I wanted to be I didn't wanna you know I didn't know nothin about amateur and I knew about Ali and the what you know what he did his journey is amateur but I knew that I didn't know the term of an amateur like what what is it you know sir so walking into the gym my whole mentality was to make money for my daughter I like y'all let me learn just the fundamentals and she stick me out of there but then we also we had this conversation in the gym about the Olympic Trials in the Olympics so I remember a briefly like we started talking about me and my trainer now we started talking about it and then it just became a whole big team discussion everybody stopped doing what they were doing just to get in on this conversation we didn't know how to get there but we knew that if we kept winning that we'll really get to that point so I just kept knocking guys out I just kept winning kept winning and then that's how I got on the Olympics team and then I told my daughter when I made the Olympics team my metal and did all that and then I turned pro shortly out there and I remember telling my daughter when she was 1 years or said that is gonna be a world champion he's gonna be able to support you beyond your belief you know for me it meant a lot for me to say that to her because I come from a place for unfulfilled premises you know you ever had someone promise you something you wait for years and years it doesn't happen you know you still hold on to that promise that they told you especially being a child you know you still like alright you know until it's just don't happen no more or you see that certain thing that was posed to being given it's no more there is it's gone you know and that really hurted me you know what I'm just coming up that's why I'm a man of my word now you know if I sell someone something you can take it to the bank you know it's gonna happen you know it's just you know god it's on time God so it don't come we want it but it's always on time when he's involved and when I'm involved when I say something I try to make it it's gonna you know I'm a man of my word no matter what I say see walking the gym you have this feeling you you know this is where you're meant to be and you just how far away's this gym from your house at the time this gym I'm still in just a little poor that's about 30 probably about 45 minutes not too far you can go ahead and get there and how often you going there every day every day every day a new change life yeah you know what I was still working for but wiser I was driving the truck for Budweiser so at times you know anybody working but wise to know that you you got a specific time to come in but you don't have a time where you get off you know sometimes you can work from five hours depending on if you have a bar bar route which is the easiest and then you can have a 17 hour a day which I don't had before but you had to go to way deep in the south way deep in other cities or whatever I used to have a stop that took me two hours to get there before I even be you know two hours to get there before I even can work my first stop and you talking about having 17 stops on you're on your list to do young me on your to-do list and your first stop is two hours you know I mean that's I was a hell of a ride just to be able to it's depression it makes you depressed just because you gotta wait two hours just to get started you ready you want to go home as soon as possible I remember times where I used to drive the big truck to the to the to the gym so you have a big butt wash the truck every time the light outside did you hear and you'll see me out there used to be times where I used to sleep in my car right there at the gym you know I really wanted to get it I told my daughter that would be a world champion and I was devoted to the sport which I still I'm still to this day but it was a lot of sacrifices I had to sacrifice for my daughter to really just be here to be able to support her with spina bifida because I knew I knew nothing about the disorder I'm 19 years old you know I'm just trying to a father a loving father just trying to support his daughter that's amazing yeah you know that's that's um that's a different kind of motivation man named Ben in Alabama we had to scrape up money to go to other states because we didn't really have too many heavyweights here you know something had to go find sparring elsewhere by trying to tell the story to this day you know how we had to scrape up because you get a lot of people want to come apart be a part now whatever he always said well sure how we were scraping up the change and and you know we you know we had to scrape up money for gas and something to eat and stuff which is all true you know we all had to scrape it up now did anybody ever teach you to punch before you start a boxing did you ever have an uncle that held pads for you or anything no now we're not nothing you know I didn't know then about boxing right you you definitely knew how to punch people of course you learned just from watching TV like you know I just live streetwise you know me I mean the best thing the best thing in life is is is is experiencing it for yourself life teaches you everything you know sometimes you can get knowledge from books but it's nothing like real life right real reality so you was the same trainer that you were when you first started I wanted a few steel with the same one that's amazing - yeah so how long did it take before it started feeling right to you it took a while it took a while because I had to I had to in the Olympics I had to play catch-up I'm always I always was playing catch-up got these guys they've been biking ever since they was young little boys and stuff and you know that's how I learned really about boxing and how I would take your life away from you you know I'm looking at I'm looking at these young guys they coming up and some of suffering some of them cannot go to school because I'm boxing you know some are mad they tell me how they've missed birthdays they've missed holidays they've missed classes from school just to fulfill the dreams you know it could take it'll take everything away from you now I've seen some help graduate high school you know and that's a great accomplishment when you in boxing to graduate high school you know because it's so much it's something in tournaments and so many different things called boxing the year-round sport you know I mean so it's so many different things that were thrown at these kids you know these guys will try to you know make this team make that team go to this trip go to that trip just to get their spirits and I'm listening to them tell their story and Here I am you know just coming from Tuscaloosa Alabama just picking it up playing catch-up I'm listening to everyone's story and what they come from and how they do this and I'm studying them on certain things like it was amazing to be able to just go to the Olympics and just do what I did to compete with these guys I was the least the least experienced guy in the whole tournament of course Olympics you know do not be a year-and-a-half and you're probably the least experienced guy to ever metal ever yeah probably so even come close to that I bet if you went over the Olympic records of guys who have boxed and meddled I bet you're number one with a bullet probably close that's crazy a year and a half in it was yeah it was it was amazing spiritual just to be there you know me yeah if it wasn't for boxing I probably would have never been able to travel outside the country you know yeah boxing showed me everything you know well what's amazing is one of the things you said that the the heavyweight division which has always been the glamor division right when Tyson was the champ and Holyfield was a champ but all these different fighters to the Holyfield riddick bowe era I mean these were gigantic fights I mean everybody in the world was watching it was a big deal but then when Klitschko won I remember I was on a plane with a buddy mine as a comedian and I said you know who that is he goes no I go that's the heavyweight champion the world he goes get the fuck out he was it's a white guy I go isn't that crazy Russia and nobody knows who it is because it was a weird things like everybody been that Tommy Morrison days people there's always the great white hope dudes always wanted a white guy to be the heavyweight champion Gerry Cooney I was in high school when that happened everybody was hope that a white guy was gonna win and then when a white guy finally won nobody gave a shit because he was kind of he's got a very effective style but it's you know it's not the most fan friendly he wouldn't jab and grab you know he'd grab ahold you he could knock you out if he hit you clean he knocked a lot of guys out he was a big fuckin guy no one cared it was weird it was weird that because he was a guy living in Germany and he you know huge in Germany and speaking Russian and English and everything out I'm he's a really smart guy but nobody cared it was weird it was fucking weird I know I remember cuz boxing was still huge people are still paying attention to Floyd Mayweather and Canelo Alvarez and many Pacquiao meters all the lighter weight classes are still getting all this love Bernard Hopkins yeah people were watching all these fights nobody gave a shit about the heavyweight division it was strange they said you know what you don't have an elite American heavyweight you know it dies down there they said where goes to heavyweight division so does boxing yeah and it's kind of true in some sense but but if it if it didn't happen that way would they have a weight division died down a lot of these guys they got a lot of shine one wouldn't have gotten no shot he's a heavyweight force probably yeah well maybe it would have just made the whole sport bigger because you know there's just this is a good time now for boxing there's a lot of really high-level champions is a fun time to be a boxing fan to watch but to look at your record like when you went into the wild or fight or what you sees me when the Tyson Fury fight you would be with 39 you know there's no chaos okay 40 you know with 39 knockouts crew that's a movie record like you put that's like a guy fighting someone in Creed right if you looked at that that's what it would be like what he's 40 like this is the guy you're fighting he's 40 no or 39 knockouts blood like that would be a movie see you'd be a bad guy in a movie just designed to fuck people up but the fact that no one you know was was looking at this as this is this was a gigantic cultural moment this wasn't just a big heavyweight fight between two of the tallest guys and odd big tall but move good both you guys move real good man Tyson four two four six foot what is he 969 256 and he's bobbing and moving a lot and he's got the weird herky-jerky style yeah he's a trap man it's very unusual well have the two he guys together to me in my eyes this was like a really heavyweight division in pop culture it's like everybody was finally paying attention to the heavyweight division in boxing like finally this was it and I was like gee this is a big fight this isn't just a big fight but you need two guys who are undefeated who are at the top of their game who you know Tyson didn't lose his title he had it and you know they took it away from him but he was still undefeated so that was a giant cultural moment and when it the fight went down and turned out to be one of the best heavyweight title fights ever I mean fuck it's amazing even just to listen to you you know describing this stuff I still feel those those excitement I'm sure little a like it was amazing it was amazing you know I'm just ready for the rematch and like if people was excited and enjoy now just imagine a rematch you know gonna be amazing it's gonna be incredible and it puts Anthony Joshua on a terrible situation I'm most terrible he looks awful are they big you know he looks terrible he's gonna fight some other guy no one gives a fuck and it's like your title whatever title you got there bullshit yeah everybody knows this is where the real title is I mean this is a gist uh it's a wrap now yes yes they definitely begin now yes he's trying to reach out all of us are now his management has been you know trying to reach out to Mars as well you know but he could have had this opportunity he had the opportunity he could have fought Luiz Ortiz yeah he could have fallen me he had a chance to fall in fury as well I kept playing it safe over on that side playing it safe but no people but you know people want to know who's the best now you know I'm saying it's I still have to send etherion this very fine you know people want to see who's the best yeah and I'm trying to I've been trying to show people you know who's the better I always said the best I'm afraid ever say I'm the best until I get defeated you know and right now I'm in a candidate for you know fighter a year and also you know fight uh fights of the years I don't had a cane I came back with Louise Ortiz that was an epic one and it came back with fury another epic fight and then we're gonna hit the two again that's the thing about you that makes it interesting is that you're not just a guy who knocks guys out but you're a guy who can take it you know you can take it and you're a guy who figures out a way to win because there's a lot of guys that when it's going bad they don't come back I'm still doing good they win forever but when it's going bad it's hard for them to come back but you figure your way through bad situations and you make adjustments even even when something is going wrong with my body like I've had seven operations on my arm you know it's like surgery breaking you know just breaking my arm turning my bicep break um breaking my hand you know many times in my in my fights I've broken my hands and still fought you know tore my bicep come in third-degree burns you know all that stuff like I'm a true warrior you know I always think I'm like if I do something like if I break my hand or when I told my bicep in the ring my whole mentality strange changes to what am i forgot to fall off that's why I gotta keep fighting I gotta keep going I'm a warrior you know and you can never tell you know because I still throw it with bad intention you know I'm still you know landing and hitting it's just like with the Chris every other fight when I broke my hand and tore my bicep my account my team knew I broke my hand but I didn't mention I told myself because I'm like why I tell them I don't want no one to panic I'm not worrying about it I'm gonna keep throwing it I gotta keep and Chris was so surprised that I did all these things were still able to throw it it's just a mentality when it comes to come back like my mentality just overall it just I feel I'm the best and if you're gonna come and beat me you come and beat me this is not gonna be easy that's why most of these guys when they fight me they bring their a-game every last one of them you know because they know it's gonna be tough and they also know I have the power to get them out of there you know and a lot of guys you know they're afraid of that because I mean over and over again like you said my power lasts from the 1st through the 12th round you can never be like too comfortable with me because of that you know and and that's big for me to have you know I I've always sat back in like saying you know I've said the same question myself like well you you got all this power like and you know me being the person with it I felt many times when I felt dangerous I felt like I felt like at time it could be too much power because I get scared of myself at times because I know I got that potential to potentially to hurt someone seriously you know just dealing with it just looking back and seeing some of the guys I've knocked out and seeing near the reactions and you know the island broke God's arms I didn't broke the eye socket shot him you know put them in seizures you know almost killed spookin New York you know he laid that for for a while you know I didn't even see him breathing you know and so forth and so on you know it's been amazing to have so much power but still trying to understand it it's well - you know in that fight with fear I couldn't like it was crazy I'm I couldn't I couldn't constrain my right arm this thing felt like someone stopping me from really really just throwing it straight into the end for some reason like it was it was because you were trying to knock him out so I definitely was trying to knock I was very anxious of knocking him out but it was something that was holding like I couldn't strain it out I kept going back to my corner why why you can't throw the right hand it's right that this dude would bend down like right here in slow motion it seemed like to me I've seen this look many times I'm not guys out many a time than inspiring any competition that put it right there because you have your you're able you have your temple exposed and you know when you get hinted at a temple in je veux Librium off you know you can't get your body's not responding like the mine is and he'll be right there and it's like I still over over loop my punches our Telegraph and I'm like it felt like someone's stopping me or something like it's great that's why I said that you know me I kid you not I kid you not kid some gypsy man come on Willie I understand it I understand it now you know I understand everything but you have to give some credit to him he's he's a phenomenal boxer if he is his style and his movement I mean and to see him pull that off and be that fresh even in the 12th me had to have that kind of endurance to get up after you knocked him down man yeah you definitely I definitely take that from me it was it was it was a great fighter that night you know he definitely brought his best and that's all you can that's all you can bring is your best and put on the perform thats why you know when we made this fight happen because it didn't take long for us to make this fight him he was just we both he reached out to me and said you know you know I feel embarrassed for what what Josh were dealing doing to you and you know I want to fight let's make it happen let's show the world who's the best who's the two bits in the division of labor let's make it happen you know it was just like that awful conversation I like to build up to the fight to because both of you were very confident and both you were talking either you're gonna beat the other and knock each other out but at the end of the fight when it was over it was nothing but respect it was nothing but respect and in this day and age man it's just there's something nice to see about two dudes who just went to war for 12 rounds and it turned out to be a draw and even after all that nothing but respect right most definitely and that's what it's all about you know two guys can beat it be at each other and you know they say we want to hurt each other even to the point you say you want to kill each other you know me it's just the build-up is part of the sport you know it is up to us to be as professional as possible when it comes to that cause we're not gonna really punch each other in the way in so we mess up our money when we try to support our children right you know a lot of things that happen in the press conference though was because of others everybody else wanna push and shove the ones that don't really matter they're not gonna be in the ring everybody want to push themselves so it makes it look worse than what it really is when you got two guys that really that matters that's getting in the ring you know but even you know a lot of people that are they smiling at each other they're doing this like that don't mean nothing we still got to get in the ring at the end of the day and punch each other in the face and that's the big thing about it he wanted to put on a great performance and support his family as well as I you know especially cuz it's been in my country I felt like I had the world attention now I've been waiting for this moment for so long it's like I gotta gotta make it got to make a great stand and you know that with all the the pressure and then so anxious this is I was anxious to do something that I already does and that's in fights and devastating fashion I didn't have to force them and I know that if I force it never happens like I want it you know me but it was just it's just overwhelming to have the world attention yeah you know how much they really feel then a regular fight if you're just it was amazing it was amazing I swear it was just to come out there and just you know come on and just feel the energy of the people they were so anxious and I'm like I already knew who I was certain people's coming because we were you know but it doesn't matter who was there is just the point of just having the the center of attention I didn't have to fight against no other sport and then like because you know it's hard here in America it's not the make it in the world America every time I fought I've had to fight against other sports and certain things you know and it's always always been difficult especially every fight I've had to promote it by myself cuz these guys are scared to talk or then some you know we're Ortiz you know he spoke Spanish although it was a big fight he spoke Spanish and some time I had to do something to Spanish TV you know for my because they wouldn't do it like you know just to get it out you know but we're Theory I knew I had to write there as a partner well it seems for you that considering how recently you actually started boxing I mean what do you it's with you 11 years in now how many 11 years that's fucking crazy like you just still learning yeah which is insane you're getting you're getting better I mean as you're the champion you're getting better that is uh I mean a guy like Luis Ortiz is an epic dance partner for that yeah because you deal with this guy who goes through the Cuban amateur program he's a southpaw the big motherfucker you know who good boxer man real over 360 some amateur fights you know that's a lie if I had that minute that much experience you know you just never know and he's another one you knocked out late in the fight yeah yeah for sure I think he had the most difficult style anyone I fought thus far though just being a southpaw you don't really get too much training guys with southpaw not to me and not too many around this heavyweight and and he's a very slick and fast counter puncher that's what he waits on and know we'll fight him I really really really had to think about my next move were going in what I had to do you know um so Ortiz I understand why a lot of these guys don't want to fight on TV yeah they say he old but they don't want to get in there they don't want to go against his old man though you know he's not too old no he's old but he's look phenomenal yeah you know I mean he just he moves good his jab is outstanding and he's so well schooled you know it's like you see the little stutter feint that he does pops out jab and look he's always reading you looking for your reactions he's a beast yes he is and I always gave him credit for that until I see someone just come in and dominate you yeah you know we even with me in him we had we had a connection between our daughters you know cuz he's got an ear daughter as well and as well as I that's why when a lot of stuff start coming out with him you know sanity he did drugs and I passing the test the divided tests and stuff all that I still wanted to fight him I still wanting a blessing with that opportunity because of his daughter because I can really to him just like just like I say this the store we're free reselling with the the mental illness and stuff like how people was mostly tired like I got emotionally child to Ortiz because he was a father that dealt with a child with a disability as well as I so I know how hard it is to take care of children with disabilities and I know it takes a lot of money you know so yeah I'm always for him you know I've been talking about him ever since that time we fought win lose or draw I would have still been talking about him because of the the emotional ties that I had with him I understand them and when you understand a person you root for that person no matter what no matter whose side you on or whatever when a person has something you feel like it's worse than the next person or you can relate you know you you want them to win yeah you know now that's beautiful man and I think that having a guy like Ortiz as a an opponent that's one of those fights that I think for a guy like you who doesn't have a lot of amateur experience when you when you fight a guy that's that seasoned and you get to see like what it looks like you get to see what it looks like when you're in the ring with a guy who's had just as you said 300 plus amateur fights yeah overall that's a I mean that's an amazing learning opportunity right almost definitely most definite and um you know I just just had the confident that I was that I was the best I was no matter what he had I always going with that confident though I blocked everything that his accomplishments and we knew what we was up against you know but you know they was calling him to the Boogerman of the division and at that point of time I still needed to prove myself because you know people still doubted me they you know I've been doubting me from the start on my career and I was like since nobody I want to fight them I want to bless them with this opportunity so these next moves that I made was to burn to then Ortiz in theory well there's two Verne highlight knock I was one of the most ridiculous of all time when you stand there with your hands down how you step forward and you it's like he was a comic book scene yeah it's like the way you knocked him out like I said about like you being a bad guy in a movie it seemed like you were a bad guy in a boxing movie didn't make any sense you were the guy like if I was say if there's someone was I was a coach of a good guy you know sitting ringside and I was watching you do that we'd be like shit yeah I can't I'm gonna tell you man when I stood over him like that I was outside of my body I could see me and him standing there I mean like I was a third person I can't explain it you know and then when I started throwing the punches like I went back into my body and start welding on them or whatever I can't I can't explain that that feeling there's so many different things that happen that was a big one too because I got shared so much online yeah that was not honest millions and millions of people saw that I'm lying there like what in the fuck is just gotten his yeah and that's when they started who is this guy what we haven't heard about this gospel yeah yeah yeah it's like everybody's waking up to the heavy weight and it was the perfect convert there it is I did dude play it for the beginning Jamie here it goes you know straight boxing skills you know I got boxing skills you know when when I first bought them I showed order and I stayed disciplined I didn't abandon the game plan you know and I show people like a box yeah and he today was probably only time I just really just stay super disciplined not this fight but this first this part right this one right here I went outside of my body right here I was standing then I came back I kid you not only what the hell was going on with me that was ridiculous no you did yeah he was he was quite upset that's the strangest little concoction he's got on this dreadlocks there yeah little a tape yeah that seems like that we're getting away to keep it up you know Haitians believe in it mm-hmm that was that was sweet too and then the referee you got me riff I don't know it would have been funny of the rebel to let go he rolled to the other corner movie yeah that would have been but you know that fight right there was the real start of it all you know in terms of public perception exactly exactly I knew I was really going sore with that especially when they went viral and then coming back with the RTS may because people made it that much more interesting yeah you know to see what I'm going to do now because people tune in now whether they they love me or hate me they tune in the seeking I'm not the next person now yeah I know at this point of time you know because a lot of people didn't know I was Olympian you know you know people I don't really even get recognized for really being the WBC champion you know other people eyes is just that motherfucking that'll knock you out now it's different Isis fighters you the champ I mean yes you you it used to be I mean obviously the the belts are fragmented because there's a lot of sanctioning organizations but it used to be there was Anthony Joshua in you but people are not paying attention to Anthony Joshua right now no it's just it's like he's literally been forgotten most definitely and that's the that's a great way to put it he's a really beautiful guy he's defended his title since the Klitschko fight how many times twice maybe three I'm not sure I remember the Parker was Parker after yeah Parker was a Miss Parker what's it to tackle was tackling before oh well what is interesting is if if this continues you know if you and Tyson have a rematch and then you eventually get to fight Anthony Joshua if you guys fight in Europe mmm I mean you might be able to fill up some giant fucking crazy House soccer arena or something it's gonna be crazy I mean if you if you go over to England and fight him there that would be insane cuz he's a giant superstar over there most definitely and I definitely would definitely be able to go over there you know I get an opportunity to go over there you know even in Philly with joseline even if it was somewhere I want to expand out there as well too but um we definitely get a fight with Joshua out there and then probably bring 100 hundred thousand the Plus you know the only thing about the UK allowed a lot of people think that's what the money is but that's not true you know they got a cap on their money you know and like it ain't like here in America America always be will be the mecca of boxing anything pertaining to that because the money is here you know how they say their pay-per-view and how we sell ours is like day and night they'd $20 we go from shit the cheapest 50 some own up to $100 and people pay for people you know it's fascinating and people think because you see more people equals more dollars but you know and that's you know it's a cow it's a calculate you can only make so much over there hmm and that's it if it was that if it wasn't that fact and you'll see more people from America going to the UK to fight right now well the casinos in Vegas are there they're probably gonna want to do this fight next that's what they want because they want all that extra gambling money and restaurant money and show money right that's where I would like least I would I would say it's likely gonna wind it it could be you know got a lot of places you know how am I going back to New York as well buy a garden yeah you know you got so many diverse people there you know a lot of people look at travels and stuff like that you know all those be busy and stuff you know people want to still to be easy access see Vegas Vegas makes it easy for people right because you know the airport is right there and if I've been away you on the strip and that's what most of the people be in and stuff but you know we'll see when the time comes you know I'm open for any any any place many guys talking about a rematch maybe we're looking at April May June somewhere I'm in there you know and we see what happened I'm excited though you know he said he back in the gym he said he hit me up he sent me a video saying how you back in the gym and stuff like that and I just hit back likewise because it's crazy because his mind said it's it's being back in the gym and mines is the same way you know I've been I've been traveling a lot talking about this fight like it's been like I'm already you know in in discussion with certain outlets whatever it's like we've been boosting up this necklace rematch fight like it's it's almost here it's been crazy though it's what my career needed as well too you know so I don't mind I've been from LA but to New York I'm just getting from New York now I'm back here and I wanting to go to my original hometown I got some things I got to do out there in Georgia the holidays I'm gonna take a vacation with my family and then once I get back on back into the gym myself well boxing fans hardcore boxing fans already knew who you are but this was the breakthrough fight for the general public this is a breakthrough fight where people know about it now and the next fight the rematch first of all you couldn't ask for a better dance partner when it comes to promotion I mean Tyson's fantastic on the microphone he's hilarious got that great accent he's fun to listen to him talk so do you guys promoting this and getting ready for whatever it April May June whenever it takes place I mean this is gonna be probably one of the biggest heavyweight fights if not the biggest of all time oh man I'm just so excited you know me because I could see I can visualize it now I couldn't really visualize how big this could become I knew it was gonna be big but you just don't know how people are you know people are funny especially you know you know people always have things to do you know you nailed it there was nothing else competing with you there's nothing else there to watch it was perfect it was a perfect storm and then it was in LA stars came out it was a big deal man it was amazing I never forget it you know like I said I've been waiting for this I've been waiting for that moment for so long you know they don't have this problem in the UK because no matter you know no matter what they love boxing it's their second nature sport they don't have college sports and professional sports that they had to deal with boxes like I said the second nature sport and you know you know they don't have as many as people we have here at the hair like we're maybe sixty six million something like that Alabama and Mississippi they can fit UK and Alabama and Mississippi combined every other but I can fit the whole state in in in Texas and still have space which over here we got so much we got how many colleges and professional sports and you know boxing is like probably the last sport you know on the list you know I'm probably you know exaggerating with that a little bit but it's definitely seem like that we definitely you know in the back and there's so much to compete with it's so it's so hard and then when you when you finally get that shine you know that's what it comes from you know yeah when I'm in it when you're in it and you understand it it's like how is so hard it was to get it to get to this point you know down there 11 years you like to get to this point and then when you finally give you is like in the big time yeah and you think back when you're driving that Budweiser truck I just I appreciate every job that I had you know I appreciate every everything that you know that it happened to me in my life it may allow me to appreciate you know who I am now allowed me to appreciate just the smaller things it allowed me to just be myself you know I'm a type of person that I don't really care about friend I only want to be caught the celebrity you know me I want to be able to live my life and do what I do I want to be able to enjoy just the smallest things of life I don't want people to take that away from me you know me being able to go to a movie or a grocery store whatever spend time with the family you can't shit cuz I like cooking I like going to the grocery stores The Fresh Market pick up my fruit and stuff that I want to put in whatever I'm preparing for that night and stuff like that you know I'm a people's person as well so I don't mind being bothered but you know it can get great I've seen other people get get crazy for that you know and they've said themselves like they don't they wish that they could do certain things normal things but people people people take it to the next level you know get all in your bit especially after this fight like I've had to cut some people you know I had to cut some people because their teachers was already wrong they seen the potential I put day to see the opportunity and they try to make moves on me you know already yeah you know and different that that's why I said lonely at the top you know because you get to the point you don't know who to trust you start down everybody around you you know I'm an energy person so I'm always real refreshing the filling up the energy let me see what it feels like like you know that I always allow me to meet certain people to be around certain people because if you change your presence the energy that you just it will change as well too so it changes it shifts the way you feel when you're around them then all sudden you feel like they're looking for angles and trying to profit off of you the true need to do things yes you know hey you know I'm a strong-minded person I got a lot of strong minded men around me I always tell people we speak positive we think positive and we surround ourselves our positive you know positive energy you know and then our results is always positive only time you ever see me you know acting now I would say if someone come and break that piece you'll never find me and my brothers you know out you know mess with someone starting anything I'm not I'm not I'm not just I'm not the one that start anything because I want peace I don't even want to see a fight outside if it's not in the boxing ring I'll walk away if I see it on the outside because I feel like they don't know what they're doing you know means then something can happen easily you see guns being poured out nowadays and so you know any little things so I start to stay away from confrontation as much as possible that's why I think on it on my home body you know if I'm not here I'm at home you know because they said when you had to find when you have to you know find things to do when you have to leave home all the time you don't have a peaceful home and I believe in that you know I don't understand when it's busy you have to work and stuff that's one thing but you know when you just man let's go here let's get out dude see I don't wanna I don't I don't put myself out there to be a risk for no one you know my risk is at home if something don't happen then you know Deonte was at home you know I don't I don't put myself out there to have SH and chances out the chance of what people look down and slay a let's do this let's do that to him or I try to because I know what I'm capable of doing you know me and I like being me I just like being laid back down the earth get along with everyone I'm a people's person and a lot of people will never know it because they only see the perspective of me in the ring or they see me on you too and yeah your interviews yes but you're a very mellow guy like right now i'ma lay I'm just I'm the coolest under this you know and it's gotta help to the train a lot so you know yeah this must be training constantly right yeah I mean I get my times in you know if I'm not with my friend I love my family you know I love I got some beautiful trees and I got a beautiful woman and I just I love being around them I love being able to see my children grow being able see them smile you know tell me good morning I'll kiss me just on free will without me having to tell them or ask them just come up and kiss me and say how much they love me and stuff it feels good the only way you want to if you want to see me cry deal with kids you don't even have to be my kids it can be others as well I love kids it's nothing and what hurts me so bad with kids is that to see some kids have to have to grow fast faster than what they they normally would have to you know have to be a dog fast because I I think your childhood years are some of your best years of your life because you don't have really no responsibilities and when you get out into the real world that's when reality hits that's when it was like oh this this this this is real you know so my heart goes out to a lot of kids I love I love children and they're what keeps me strong in this sport you know do you worry about getting more famous do you worry about the consequences I don't think about I don't think about getting more famous you know I know it comes come with the territory you know and even if people know everything I just want people just you know don't don't don't hold me don't don't look at me and someone that holds me hard and then you know people have high expectations for you and right when you do something they think the you know the biggest thing in the world that happening or right you know you can do the same thing as a being that work at mattdonna does but because I have the name and he doesn't then it makes it even more you know worse than what he'd done you know right I'm like we are human we gonna make mistake we're gonna do things you probably do some things that you don't supposed to do you get in trouble with doing you know this is part of life you know and I never I never make myself seem like I'm better than anyone you know I'm a type of God I'll talk to a homeless man and if we cut the conversation live we will - we'll go I'm a people's person my mother was a people person she determines she never met strangers I never meet strangers because you can never know by me interacting with a person do I know that person or not because of the how we're interacting with each other and that's just me I'm a people's per could you just never know who you may meet right and what they can give you what advice or what you can kill them you know to make that day better you know hug I say man I love you man you know that's that's the final things like that's what like football all about it ain't all so much about who you are and how much money you got because that can be gone tomorrow you know it ain't about that you know it's about treating people with respect you treat me with respect I treat you no matter what what you are in life because you're a human being and that's what I'm all about and then as you get more famous though you're gonna get more the numbers just that's where it gets unmanageable people start waiting for it like you ever see what it looks like when Manny Pacquiao's training know when he was in his prime especially when he's training the Philippines it was insane like Freddie Roach was there with them and you know they'd look outside and people be holding their phone jump just waiting for him to look outside the window just hundreds of people everywhere he goes and you know he lives in the Philippines so it's he's this superstar in this incredibly poor country and he's a really humble guy too but it's it almost see he handles it in an amazing way I don't know how that guy does it but he's very chilled - yeah well he'd had to have you know he'd have been knocked down I had to be give and it'd be brought back up right like life teaches you lessons and and um and God bless you sometime with second chances you know when you do get to second chances you know how to handle it better than the first time you know hopefully you don't never have to go through nothing um dramatic you know or not too severe you know - to learn a lesson yeah you know because he definitely he probably would tell yourself you know there's a lot of things that he was doing that he had to correct you know I had to get yourself right what up because it can take you away you know if a person do well someone not saying Manny did this but just talking in general if a person doing so much on you know being famous and people loving them and knowing them and stuff like that like it can take that mind away from their their become this type of person that's when people say oh you've changed you've changed you know and then I make I've seen that firsthand I've seen a person with no money and then when they get some money they don't know they changing right no it's just something that's happening and people will say you changing yeah I'll be like no I'm just okay I think they just still you know saying right but not in reality you know so slowly but surely they're changing this stuff like and I'm I'm a type of person that I'm not judging mental old people lives I'm a type of person or whatever you doing your life you chose to do that I mean Who am I to judge you I don't judge people because I don't want them to judge me you know me whatever I'm the type of person that whatever you get involved it with it's a consequences that you is its consequence behind your action that you you're gonna have to face whether you do the right thing or the wrong thing you're gonna have to face the consequences behind it yeah and only you gonna have to face it you know at the end of the day and that's why I respect people you know whatever you do you know that's you it's your life have fun with your life you know we make mistakes to correct the loan we learn from our mistakes then hey we're all human you know now coming to this rematch what would you do differently in this rematch what I would do differently I would I wouldn't abandon the body I heard him twice in the body I should have kept going with the body mark what kept telling me to keep going to the body going to the head go to the head go go to the body and I bended that whole thing I would probably jab more and I definitely be more calmer this time around you know when you you know though when you when you find the guy twice you the first time you get to experience him the second time y'all kind of know each other a little bit better than the first time and I really felt very brought his theory about the best of theory but it definitely wasn't the best of Deontay Wilder and at this point of time we know what the train for because I don't think he's gonna change nothing up he fought a great game you know a great fight and I don't think it's you know nothing that could be changed up maybe he probably lose a litigant in the gym now he'll he'll be a little bit lighter for sure and that could be me that could mean a little bit lighter on the feet don't you have him but we're definitely gonna adjust make some small adjustments and uh I can't wait it's gonna it's gonna be explosive now when you do a training camp for a big fight like this how many weeks you prepare for this fight was three months three months and so do you start up and start slowly ramping and who sets your schedule in terms of like what you do everyday with um with camp my my longtime trainer Jay he sets up like all the sparring partners and stuff I got strength and conditioning coach and different in shelves and stuff like that so we I got all that underhand I got all that you know also some hairs all your foods when you prepare your diet yeah yeah for sure for sure that's why I was surprised I came in so such a low way even at you because you know in camera stuff man I got such a high metabolism he just I just never know I don't I don't really just keep up with my weight I'm not the type of guy that I weigh in all the time or whatever I think because I've gotten gotten by with this power for so long it's like you know it's just it's just an image you know I can't gain weight like I don't understand you know I may have to do that blood testing thing and see like they got it where you can take your blood and they can do a test and see what types of food would make you gain weight mm-hmm and I think I'm trying it out but you want to gain anyway yeah I want to get a liberal I always had a goal of being 245 with my six seven six seven frames but do you think that being 245 you might get tired or in the later rounds no you see you gain you gain weight and keep the speed so is it you know as you gain and you can find into work keep your speed that's how that's how we always wanted to to go edit because we we had a lot of guys that you know specializing bulking and stuff by then we didn't want that we didn't want I didn't want to bulk up right you know I mean I wanted to gain weight and keep the speed you know but just as much as I gained weight it much does not work out and my tablet lives I'm so high so it's like it's like I lose weight in my sleep how many times they have you eaten a day we was eating about three three times three to four times a day what kind of foods special diet yeah we was eating steak fish and chicken you know a lot of lot of low carb potatoes okay no Louie you know I definitely have us with system in the south you know I had to have me some greens and cornbread you know we was doing a lot of damn getting know we had mashed potatoes yeah a lot of hoppin John's how bad judges like um like pinto beans and rice together with onions and stuff like that you put up squash do a lot of spinach we have spinach I was doing a lot of tuna so just Whole Foods very yeah most definitely very very happy fool you know I get all my stuff from the whole food they have you supplementing with vitamins or anything like that correct I'll using the vitamin C stuff I'll use the vitamins I did the vitamins I did the whole nine with the vitamin thing like I really had they they would bring me a kind of holder for the peels and stuff for each day of the week and stuff like that and still like I wouldn't gain with the Ortiz for I didn't gain like Steel like I'm like what the world going on with my body I don't know what type of freakish body I have you know because I try to put on the weight we're gonna try another method this time I might actually try to eat through I'm trying to eat every three hours or so like that I'm gonna have my assistant with me and whatever so here framing protein shakes and you know being able to all right it just eaten something right I want to put it I want to see what this weight thing look like you know we're gonna like I said this next fight is gonna be good but the problem is are you're doing so well like our no if I would do shit different yeah fix it if it's not broken terms of that I know your the thing about you is your endurance is so consistent when you're in the 12th round your endurance is very consistent it's not like a lot of big guys they drop off later in the fight and you see them leaning on each other more taking more time in between exchanges you know trying to pace themselves out trying to restore that energy you've got that energy in the 12th round and part of that might be because you're walking around to 12 to 15 and you're fighting 209 and might that might be up a real big positive because obviously the power is not an issue so why else would you want any weight you know like I was telling my you know some of my my team want to see it yeah they want to see certain adjustments or whatever and they know they know that I'm only gonna do what I want to do I know they know they can't make me or watch me doing it but I am a team player no you know I'm saying I am the type of person that if everybody in agreement some something no matter how I feel about it and like all right cuz we're a team we always been this way like we with my team I got I got a great team you know we never leave I just discussed without agreeing we just never do you know no matter what it is we always come to agree on some something and with this situation I told them I like alright I'm gonna try so what do they want how much they want in the game they haven't said how much but they wanted to put some weight now put some weight on your strength and conditioning coach is this your management and effort stuff like yeah yeah everybody in agreeance so you know I could easily say now I ain't doing this my power you know you know I which I've said before I like well I really don't need to wait it's just like what you were just describing I like I was saying the same thing I mean my I got power and I got true power you know but I just started thinking I would like I'm a team player as well you know I'm never feel like although I'm the fighter that's gonna be in the ring they're not gonna be fighting but we're a team you know I'm a team sport so how much I'm a team player and you know they have you doing weightlifting everywhere yeah we're gonna do weightlifting are you doing what you're doing it for this camp most definitely what kind of stuff we live for strength so we do a lot of stuff living dead lifts cleans that kind of stuff all that the ropes you know pull-ups different things like that but um I'm gonna go back to not only lifting for strength but for balance as well too you know we just do a lot of things with the balance ball lifting weights with the balance ball and then lot of stuff with the man's ball I used to have this training that I loved you know he was amazed what happened to him when I had my title fight you know I think he started listening to people you know think he should he saw potential he thought he saw he saw he saw opportunity when he he felt like he can make a lot of money off of me you know and it wasn't the case it's like we were short cutting here we was he was getting paid the right amount of money but you know how people don't understand boxing they think it's more into it or you can get more he tried to get rich off for me really you know I for one client I'm like bro it's many of his men ease-of-use yeah you know says it's very fuse I mean you know I'm saying yeah it's like we won in like I miss him though I miss him and and but when you when you when you when you when you when you look at me like a piece of meat and trying to benefit more than what you really try to do then you know you didn't you don't cross me you can't be trusted upon but he had me right he said me right I loved everything he used to do I we still talk about him to this day and we had to move on though you know because we know what his intentions were hmm and just imagine now you'd let them back in you know they may do right then they may not you know you just you just never know but that is a problem once you have conflict once you're all is you start having conflict and you continue to have conflict escalates yeah and then people always do think that they're worth more yeah is it sad though because I'll talk about he used to have right everything with oh man I just know this is a thing that I think that you there's a lot of good trainers out there yes I mean mmm all you have to do is kind of explain what the guy was doing and how he was setting it up and you'll find a guy especially when you consider all the dish I mean it's not just for boxing but there's so many guys that do that for pro sports and now they're adapting to boxing and MMA seen a lot of this as well you're seeing all these guys who are organizing these programs that you know they might have been doing NFL or NBA now instead they're doing it for boxing correct for every night it's a it's a lot of things that in strength training that then we do is a lot of things that we didn't do because you know I'm getting away with a lot of things there's a lot of things in training that I that we does that a lot of fighter just don't do you know I'm saying it's like the you know most time when I go in I'm hitting you know when I have a camp it's mostly just hitting the speed hitting the mitts mm-hmm you know hitting the medicine and going on for different things I barely going in hit speed bad I definitely don't do no jump ropes you know sometimes hit the heavy bag you know some because of the power that I have a certain thing we're trying to get coordination down and timing you know me because I know if I hit any man they're going to sleep you know I mean we know this and this is just a lot of things that that I just I didn't do because I'm getting away with it and I'm still I still get away with it you know me but at this point in time in my career now we have the world attention you know I want to better me I wanna new me it's a new Deonte coming you know and I'm so serious about it that's why when my team talk about certain things I'm like yo I'm down for let's make it happen I see what happens we can least try that's all I could get into benefited I although I may feel a certain way because I'm still I'm the one in there fire but like again like they did we're a team so mmm I'm at least can get it on benefit of the doubt and and put forth for effort into trying when you're going through a camp how many days a week are you doing strength conditioning and are you running in the mornings like how are you scheduling your workouts stress rating is three times a week you know we go light on sparring days because you know I got all big guys in there and stuff so I need some strength for sparring but we're going three times Monday which is and Friday so on sparring days you go light or you go light on sparring sparring days we go light with the weights life stuff like so there you have energy for sparring career right and then our days we're not sparring then you hit it hard correct so so somebody organizes all this stuff for you now when you do strength and conditioning are you running as well so we do today we we don't run without like jogging I don't do that jogging you know we do everything fast we want to act we want to activate the fast twitch muscles you know I'm saying we do everything with rapid speed and from if I'm doing anything consist of me moving my feet is sprinting and stuff stuff like that now I worry a 45-pound vest on me as well too and all my exercise and everything that I do they have that extra weight on me right mm-hmm chin-ups every squats or everything everything I used to do that with this the trainer I was talking about you know we just do everything with this dude you biometrics like that as well not someone we lost you do every now again every now again but we're gonna do a lot of things we've in a way from the enhance it Oh like I said I'm here I feel like I'm here and I know just being regular me just doing things that I would normally would do got me to this point but now I just feel like I'm on a whole nother level now hmm I just feel like right now it's time to apply the things that need to be really done and not the things that you know you can do and get away with right you know I'm saying and that's just how I feel at this point of time so come to rematch they will see a new Deontay Wilder well that is one of the things that's exciting about you like I said is that if you're only been boxing for 11 years I mean you just starting to really touch your potential you're still putting combinations together you're still putting your footwork with those combinations and learning new moves I mean that you're not talking about a guy like Louise Ortiz who's gone through just as gigantic amateur career and professional career and he knows what he knows right he's not learning he's maintaining you're learning almost definitely that's one things it's so exciting about you in this stage of your career being an emerging as a star yeah most definitely you know just just to learn I always said when I when I when I when there's nothing else to learned and I want to be in this sport yeah you know I want to be a know-it-all do you have an exit strategy do you know when you want to get out um my goal is to unify the division whether it be one champion one face one name be the undisputed the undefeated the unified heavyweight champion of the world I want to defend that for a couple of years maybe until I be all the top guys in the division even maybe in it in the second tier and then once I complete that I'm like I'm done to make my god more years I said I say I have ten or less but I'm more on the ten-year I'm on a less lesser over the years to anything I just want to accomplish my old man and uh you are you're a 13-hour 31 33 33 33 yeah started at 21 you know I don't take too much punishment you know me that's it I always tell you know I got a great team outside of boxing you know one day I will get that phone call and they would say mr. Wilder you don't have to work no more in your life you know I built four four four generation wealth this is not just for the moment in time or just you know just right now what I can do it's all for my children and it always be for my church and a lot of people can come in with different stories about themselves doing this is an S but when they're dealing with your children you know you always want to see them I'll grow you you know so with that being said they got a long life to live and it's up to me to be able to provide for them so they can be able to to do what they need to do I wanna I want to be able to to do what I need to do but what definitely not do not just sit on the ass but they don't want have to do neck line and into that business I if man it's always been hard for me you know me no opportunities ever really been given and if it has been an opportunity given its smaller what I had to create opportunity side of opportunity has always been like that for my life but don't you think that's also part of the reason why you have so much power behind you not just physical power punching power but determination yes because you've had to overcome adversity you've got to push through and that that gives you that will power almost up and you hit it you hit the nail right on it now are you a boxing fan outside of your own career do you enjoy boxing I do I do I try to attend as many as fast as I can you know I have a you know I definitely have a lot of stuff that goes on try to give me out there even more so you know we definitely be working on the outside of boxes but I'm definitely yeah I definitely enjoy the sport you see other guys do you when you think about yourself as being this heavyweight who is you know at the top of the division now and you look at all these younger lighter weight fighters you know like guys like Terence Crawford Loma chenko all these really fantastic up-and-coming fighters do do you do you try to apply any of this stuff that they do no not necessarily you know it's good to look at and stuff like that but I'm just me right I like my style and you know I never I never I never look and see what those what those guy does and try to apply - mm-hmm - my style you know our past heavyweights no no pants have ways either you know my ultimate my all-time where my idol is Muhammad Ali you know I love Muhammad not only just what he did in the inside of the ring you know because he's lost many at times he you know he could predict certain things but then sometimes perdition don't come true it was basically what he did on the outside he was he knew who you were he knew what he represented he knew what he stood for you know and that was strong for me because I'm the same way you know to this day I Know Who I am I know what I represented I know what I stand for you know and that meant a lot to me just to see him just especially in those time and days to be so strong and just paved the way you know like Jack Johnson paid the way from my home lining you know and then Muhammad Ali paid away from us and so forth for so long with all the other great fighters but you know we have tried to add certain moves you know Evander Holyfield used to do this yeah step step back like a counter punch here trying to come in on you and then when he gets you to react he'll step back and try to kind of punch we got certain coals that we will this is like baseball or whatever we got certain things that we could say you know and then I'll know what they saying just so it won't be like it's just regular box all right do the one two or stand like this okay I understand what you're saying but if you lose it in terms I give it nicknames or whatever we try to do that or whatever but how benefit how beneficial would it be for you to work with different people I don't know I don't know I don't I love my team you know I wouldn't say ever not have your team right I mean but I feel like a guy like you you have so much talent it would be fascinating to see you just you know take a day with Virgil he'll take a day with this guy would you get together with different people just it just seems like you have so much possibility so much my only thing is my only thing with it is that we'll what they egos you know be able to handle mines you know a lot of these trainers have big egos not saying that these you know not saying that the guys you name have them just saying in general I know you know I never worked with none of them but you know when the egos come together when the trainer feel like they you need him you know I'm saying and stuff like that and that's when things go wrong yeah no I'm saying cuz I'm trying to like you need me you know they feel like if you don't have them then you know you're not gonna be successful you know gonna have guys coming you know yeah you know and with because I'm very dominant you know if I don't see it that way you know I'm saying not saying that not saying that I would not do it but I will put my input into I'm not a type of person that just if I see it somewhere you see it a certain way if I see it some way then you know I'm not going to hey I'm not that type of fur they're just gonna be quiet and just go along I must press my opinion I'm gonna tell you like nah this is how I see us well - that's why my team is so great like they can see it and I can see a whole nother way but we put it in together we kind of make it mix working working like art I'm trying this and I see it I can see I can see one thing is we're two in the ring you know and we just make it work together why things is that you don't have any conflict in your team mmm that's you know giant that is like jake is a fucking distraction when you see fighters that aren't getting along with their coaches we're going along with their strength and conditioning trainer or whoever the fuck it is man as soon as you have issues with management you hate your manager I want to get out of my contracts like that fucks up so many fighters careers it puts him on the sidelines for a long time Ron's reward I know so many put him on the sidelines for a while my brother Malik Scott you know there's Mike Rowe closest one of my doubts he was a great fighter but because of management and stuff like that he wasted so many years yeah it's very common it's very common so that's the beautiful thing about your arrangement and you seem to have everything in order right most you know I got a great team man you know uh Mark J you know I got cuz you know I got I got a great team of guys and uh they understand you know Jay never been in a situation like this you know my longtime trainer I'm the first to come out Alabama to do certain things that I've done so we both have learned on the way you know especially been in the spotlight well you got more breathing you know to time Walter Wade champion lipid 84 Olympic gold medals stalks off it's amazing how I can hear him though yeah well it's amazing too that you got marked because mark when he was a welterweight was a phenomenal knockout artist and similar to you and I he was long and tall and marks always been like a very like even-keeled intelligent guy you know so it's really interesting to see him make that transition to a trainer and with you I think that's like a perfect fit yeah most definitely most definitely you can understand them you know he talked so soft but you know I've been with him for a very long time so I could like I can be a thousand people in I remember back in the day man when when Mark was in the Olympics man yeah I remember watching him fight on ABC Wide World of Sports I remember when he fought Marlin Starling I remember those days yeah you know he's a great guy you know the one thing about it is just everybody got positive energy you know that's big for me it's just like you say like when you get management and stuff you hate you hate them or you know don't want to work with them you know it'd be it'd bring avoids some type of avoidance in a group like you you don't want to do something you don't like you like you love going to train but because of this certain person you don't want to be there you know it's just knock your energy level down like I said I've never dealt with it but I've had friends that have dealt with it before I've had my brother he dealt with it before you know and so I've seen in you know firsthand you don't have to go to court and can't do that that you on the Shelf because of this is like I'll do it over and over and over again parts the crazy good lawsuit just trying to figure out how you get out of your promotional content oh you know sidelines a lot of guys yeah there's a lot of distractions make you not want to train because you'll feel like your career is not going nowhere well needs guys because that becomes their primary focus instead of just getting better and preparing for the next challenge you're always thinking about this legal issue you're going through exactly yeah yeah no you're fortunate in that regard you know most definite no matter what people you know look up on the mass because a lot of people like well you need another trainer is it but the thing about it you got to look at it we didn't made it this far yeah no it's what other what other guy in the sport is knocking every guy out you know yeah he's definitely making them hit the canvas like me you know 14 over 39 cats just not I know I know I got power but it still it still takes more than that you know I mean just you still got to be able to throw the jab and set it up to throw the right hand and throw the hook behind that and stuff like that I got great trainers especially a mark you know he's a great trainer he teaches me ways to throw the jab in different ways you know although when I get in there and I I look at it and take my own judgment but I also listens to him as well too and at this point in time you know it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot more you know listening like I see certain things because one thing I never want to do is if I hear you I see or hear what you're saying but it's not right there at that moment in time and then I started taking what you see and then I wouldn't been getting hit in the head or get knocked out now I just never want to say well I'll listen to you when you you got me put on the ground but still listening to myself and getting putting on the ground you know I mean but you know I love my guys a lot more guys and uh I can't wait for this I can't wait for the four they get back in the gym it's gonna be a new a new mean I can't wait and watch the rematch man it was a phenomenal fight and I really appreciate you coming in here I'm a big fan I was a big fan before that fight and I think the world is a big fan now so best of luck to you sir Oh blessings thank you so much oh thank you so much please Deontay Wilder ladies and gentlemen the bronze bomber [Music] [Applause] [Music]
