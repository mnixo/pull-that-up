the Joe Rogan experience what do you think about these old banning bossy retarded stupid it's never gonna work it's me it makes me angry it makes me angry that you're pretending that someone's feelings are hurt because you of the word bossy eh I said the word bossy means leadership it doesn't like I have a few Nace's and I won't say which of them one of them's pit bossy and when I mean bossy it's not like she goes okay you said over here we're playing this game yeah she's like don't touch that that's my toy she's just a bit of a cunt yeah they don't like kunti so they're trying to get rid of bossy which is a substitute for hunting they're trying to remove themselves from criticism everybody was coming up with that they're either trying to silence free speech yeah or they're trying to remove what they think is criticism they faced many times and it's you know a lot of them like what where's it coming from most likely feminists well what are a lot of feminists a lot of feminists are very strong women who like being able to tell people what the fuck to do and what what would be a criticism of that well she's a cunt she's kunti she's bossy yeah those are they're all in line with what's what people don't like I will ban bossy get the fuck on their advert or the program the woman was there going do you know that men own 99% of the world's property right and I and then I thought of it do you know ninety-five percent of the homeless are also men there's plenty of bossy bitches kicking cunts out of the house I live in red free are you ban bossy you won't get women that are headed corporations most bossy women that I have known in my life don't have jobs yeah and probably would never get to the head of a corporation because that requires a lot of people skills it's not like they've been held back bicycling bossy I'm there paying the rent and they still fucking bossing me around you know ya know this the idea is ridiculous the idea that all these women want to have fucking want to be the head of corporations ridiculous to a lot of women don't want those jobs either they're not working towards those jobs the idea that they're completely banned from those jobs there are women out there who run corporations is it fair I'm not sannen is but there's a lot of shit that's not fair my life is not fair will my what there's a good chance we'll have a female president next or possible yeah yeah there's just very different characteristics that men have and women have these very different personalities almost inherent to having testosterone and a dick that you don't have with a woman and this is nothing against women when they have a kid I'm not saying because they take nine months out of the workplace although it's probably a problem I don't give a fuck when they have a kid their mind does change a little bit they become less career driven a lot of them not all of them yeah but they do start going I want to spend time with this and done and then a man has to step up a little bit more and work a bit huh I sometimes begrudge the amount I have to go on the road and be away from my kid so as I can support the family you know I feel like I miss out on something there I'd rather be home all the time with him right I know Zach which man yeah um I think everyone has a role and that everyone's role is different depending on the relationship depending on where you are in life depending on everything but the idea that it which should be even for men and women is ridiculous the idea that anything should be even is ridiculous yeah the only thing you should ask is for no discrimination yeah no discrimination and that someone will be proved they would be promoted based entirely on how well they do what they do yeah I do hear that yeah but the idea that like there should be an equal amount of men in Iguala women in the same position that I don't buy that doesn't make any sense to me because there's a lot of jobs that men do better than women and a lot of jobs that women do better than men just a fact and they've got Beyonce and Condoleezza Rice and who is the other bird that got Julia garner is on the campaign as well and then like Beyonce's they're going going I'm not bossy but I am the boss I'm the queen what is it with black women and wanting to be the queen Queen Latifah but man the queen of the night meant men are always the king black man like there's a lot of fighters that call themselves King black all white men will call themselves the king of the castle I had the King in my home that's a universal my own thing we want to be the king black women want to be queens and white chicks want to be princesses right they don't even want to be Queens the I wanna be the child the early white chick that wants to be the queen is the queen that's probably a right every time you made it go it's all of it I'm a princess because I want to be taken care of and black chicks are like I want a fucking iron you cut I'm the queen well that was the thing that black men like there was a big thing they used to say it was that that we used to be kings you know black man used to be Kings you know before we were slaves working they only had little villages and they didn't travel very far it was easy to be a king when the population was ten and it was you in the other part and you're like I'm queen the mezuzah or whatever and if I can you go out with your spear and you think I'm the king of this little toy because it's still now they've got guys that are driving taxis in the UK it was like I'm Prince of Dubai boo boo boo right and you're like I'm fourth in line for the throne and there's so many fucking kings over there that's hilarious and it's so true if you really stop and think about it like the amount of people that's probably directly in line we were talking about we were talking about being famous that you don't want to be the king of a place that's too big yeah you know like you don't want to be the you don't either head of Rome there's too much shit going on you and all these other countries a lot of people die to throw you too much stress everybody's looking to kill you all the time but if you're the king of a fucking small village yeah like you're probably doing pretty good you get all the fish yeah you're good you got you know ten wives or whatever the hell you need you go occasionally you can go to a guy's house and just take a gush yeah it's a it's a tribute it has to pay but if you liked a head of England god damn there's a lot of pressure on you well then King Ralph I love you know I like about King Ralph King Ralph is a movie where you know they've worked backwards they've got all right this is the prep even can't with movie ideas whatever you got movie ideas you think of just the broad strokes so someone's gone okay American guy is the King of England and he's a slob but he likes 10:00 p.m. all right that's what I've got and then another guy's gone how do we get rid of the royal family I'm fucked I'm thinking all right and then what happens gone I've got it they're all standing in a puddle and get elationship they're all take a photo of the entire royal family at once they're standing in a bit of water the camera goes falls over a light falls into the puddle and they all get a like provide the death electrified like you did and then obviously they go through all the family I can't find a single relative until they find a fat guy from Milwaukee called Ralph I don't know if he's from Milwaukee it sounds like he was King Ralph
