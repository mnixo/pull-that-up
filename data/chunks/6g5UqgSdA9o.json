Oh in Edwards ever the contrary and shows up with an Android phone drinking some french fries and Danny brought that were made with clear animal Jamie you were there what you see French fire - yes appeared a melon listen MGM steakhouse Dan cooking that fuckin those french fries and anything other than animal fat guarantee they're too delicious I didn't see it I didn't see it even in McDonald's if you get McDonald's fries apparently they cook them in some fucking disgusting fat well that's what makes them taste so good what does make McDonald's fries taste good they're pretty good but they're not my favorite I don't know I get confused when people say they're better than in-and-out fries what I like fries that taste like potatoes oh yeah even in a now fries a far superior I don't like fries that taste like potato fries better than McDonald's I do personally feel like you know who I had beef with that about where candy Alexander from Newsradio she was the first person to like we went and got in and out like for the holes the whole group of us and she got McDonald's fries she went got McDonald's problem why'd you get McDonald's franchise fuck those bullshit fries those in-and-out fries but what I didn't understand they can be okay but they're so hit-or-miss that they can miss bad to me they're remarkably consistent with Five Guys fries five guys are the king of fries yes there's two options they have kid they're real they have the fucking potatoes and bags sitting in their goddamn store just to let you know bitch we're using these potatoes and then they taste that bag and shake it in there and cut it up they have cajun fries mmm so they win you have another option you got spicy fries that are goddamn delicious I have to stop by there and then you don't have to crack Hackett's to get your ketchup they have a giant tub of the ketchup he squirt that bitch a nice little cup a little paper cup you can shower it and have that and ketchup McDonald's had that homeless people would be under it squirt mustard I'll tell you what man since Starbucks got in trouble for being racist there's a lot more homeless people at Starbucks like they understand you just go it's really it's really that's so funny kicked out they can't get kicked everybody's afraid dude it's a it's a hundred percent different one hundred percent different in some spot like which ones are you going to the ones in Hollywood they know how to handle it for the most part yeah airlocks on everything I went to a shifty one in downtown where they don't even have a bathroom like how are you serving coffee you know have a bathroom cuz it makes you shit and piss yeah this is ridiculous but I realized they didn't have a bathroom cuz the homeless people there was homeless people that had like this guy had a port and he was charging all of his devices he had everything he had like a phone a fucking iPad a long night ahead of him but they get free electricity there and he's oh he's got like a bag of his stuff like he's got a little camp in the corner of the Starbucks I'm like wow on one hand like hey how's a guy supposed to get some electricity I'm right I want him to get back up on his feet maybe this is the way to do it maybe it's through that iPad uh-huh on the other hand like hey don't give me a disease you fucking Instagram account yesterday I don't street people of Los Angeles which it's got some very interesting content is that a naked person yes it is make a person just change it on the stranger on the street that was actually in San Francisco I think I remember checking that post but wow this has got some interesting stuff these guys were like cooking underneath the tree on a lot with like a live grill right somewhere but there's a Tommy's in Hollywood sorry good times oh and there's always like a bunch of young homeless people cooking in front of it like there's a bus stop they have a lit fire like caveman like like like fear of the walking dead style campfire like outside of the Tommies on Hollywood Boulevard like on a daily basis how weird it's just weird that that's okay like if you just wanted to start a fire on the side of the road would that be okay no but can you start a fire to cook apparently can you or did they just not get busted probably need a permit yeah I think you need something like a to be like a grill street vendor type of permit if you wanted to sell what if you just wanted to give food away you can't do that you can't but you can eat it yourself I don't know can you offer it something it seems like you could offer it to somebody like you know if they allow you to cook and you and I were sitting there and we're cooking so would you like something and you said yeah yeah that looks good that should be okay it's like a donation now some places they don't charge you to get in but they accept a donation but if you plan in advance you say hey all of us meet on the corner of 3rd in Santa Monica I'm gonna have a cookout we're just setting up right here on the concrete yeah those do people should just go to a park that has those grills that Griffith Park is not far right Griffith Park is like people with homes cook there yeah you got free grills yeah you could just do it up there anybody can cook there yeah that is one of the nicest parts of LA by the way and if people don't know that is a fucking wildlife area that's a legit wildlife area there is a real predator-prey fucking law the jungle thing going down right now in Griffith Park it's mountain lions and deer yeah it is going down and coyotes day and coyotes you are doing all your stuff it's a really amazing place right because here we are we got Pasadena and Glendale Burbank and LA you know beautiful fucking BMWs driving by these cool people are jogging they got ear pods in the jogging in Griffith Park they're jogging right near a war zone yeah here's a war such as rustling sometimes cuz I live around the corner and I'm like like I'm I'm on I'm stay paying attention hundred percent we got a giant framed picture and headed to the studio of this mountain lion that was photographed by a camera trap you know the camera trap is know they set them up to monitor the numbers of wildlife and to just try to get an accurate assessment of what's in the area so what it is is like a camera that's the photo camera that operates on motion detection so as this cat this probably hundred and fifty pound super muscular grown-ass mountain lion with a fucking collar on his neck his name is p22 that's what it said to say up there yeah about 119 pounds as of May okay so it's not quite that bad so it's still big enough to kill everyone in this room with us we're fucked yeah but look how muscular it is I mean that is a look at the size of its goddamn forearms those are Franco Columbu forearms that is a animal and that animal lives around where all these people are jogging it's a really strange situation I'm never going to Griffith Park again fuck yeah fuck the people S or P 1 to 5 look at the Hollywood sign behind it though it's so perfect that is almost like a fake picture that is so close to me yes I closed I went to the park it more like a block and a half away from that joint do I run with a knife oh yeah I do I run with this fucking half face blades knife it's called the shpos subhuman piece of shit that's what the name of the night then with look at that he's got blood and bones he's eating something that must be like a deer leg fucking a that is madness and he's digging a hole in the ground to stuff it in there to save it fuck man because you know what the deer around there are really comfortable but that could be a kid man right 100% could be a kid but I know why he's dead because the deer in that neighborhood like they walk around in the daytime like they're tourists too because there's no hunting around there so they're like all comfortable you should probably eat them too yeah so then now the line that's like oh let me track these motherfuckers over to this area and I'll just have a feast it's a buffet night look at this shit I'm all on Drive there's an animal Holland Drive there's a grown-ass mountain lion with a collar on that's got a giant deer on the ground a buck not giant it's probably hunter pound deer on the ground dead on the on the set on the side of the city street civilization and this is a cat that's killing deer with its face that's where we live and not only that we know where it we have a caller on it we're playing this game you don't affect with us anyone fuck with you and they won't fuck with you for the most part the problem comes when they get old when they get old to get real dangerous because they get desperate mmm they can't catch a deer anymore so they go for the easy kill for people people are easy right yeah your kids are easy I'm gonna go hiking with somebody slow that's move yeah go hiking with a small slow person someone who just doesn't look like a challenge at all hey man survival of the fittest those smoking with someone who's smoking the meat makes it more attractive so there's what we eat affects how we taste it's got it right so maybe maybe like people who are in really in the junk food they'll be more attractive yeah sweet taste to them yeah a bat right if you just eat candy all day I bet you taste delicious yeah the human skittle attack the human skittle over here leave me alone that fucking cat is so big man imagine just seeing a hundred and fifteen pound cat in the room with you you'd be like oh Jesus Christ like my dog is probably maybe 75 80 pounds somewhere in that range he's up Marshall yeah and if he wanted to kill me he probably could right I mean he's a golden retriever they don't kill anything other than squirrels mm-hmm but if he wanted to I mean I don't know if he had that mentality he really was like crazed like like 28 days later he got that rage virus in on her and he just went after me he's got giant ass fucking teeth right I mean I assumed that I would kick his ass because he listens to me right because I'm his daddy uh-huh you know what I mean like there's no he's never I had pit bulls that growl at you a little bit and you gotta kind of like hey motherfucker I'm the one who gives you your food kind of shit and then they'll give you their paw and then they're sorry and you play a little game with him a little dominance game especially when they're teenagers and they're like one and a half two years old they'll test you just as it's natural for them all right it's natural for dogs Golden's don't ever do that he don't growl at anybody they're just obedient see the worst guard dog of all time you come over everybody he loves everybody he loves you I love he he loves people like he's her like not not like he's never met them but like he can't believe he hasn't seen them in so long it's like a lose their long-lost friends everyone's a long-lost friend hello everyone everyone is a long-lost friend it's like with him he's such a love sponge I would be jealous if I if that's my dog I'm like so I'm not special just that motherfucker that's how dogs are really friendly dogs every new person is another opportunity for a new person to love them too mmm so they they get so excited to meet people smart do when people come over the house he is so hilarious everybody loves everybody can't believe it you hilarious but if you wanted to you probably kill me I mean if a rat was that big I would fucking put my money on the rat on the right right and dogs dogs kill rats all the time even those little dogs like Jack Russells those little tiny dogs those are designed to kill rats hilarious my ex had a dog right and I was holding the dog so and she got into a car right across the street and moved it and then got out the car walk and the dog acted like he didn't just see a jump in the car he acted like she went away for two days she just went to just moved the car across to you we watched her do it do you remember when we had a mr. foster Arian Foster on the podcast and he was talking about being able to kill wolf correct we're gonna go press stop this don't I know you're a beast but come on man where people were made out of like smush yeah everything's mushy it's also soft yeah yeah something that wants to bite your tit like of a wolf decided to bite your tip the amount of pain you'd be in be unbearable I know you feel like one of those buns that they give you at the steak house that's what your flesh feels like exactly like a steak house bun bread Arian Foster spent four hours on Twitter explaining why he beat a wolf what he's hilarious allure isn't he doing a podcast now he's got his own podcast he started doing music which is really good you just released some music under I think he knows he's a very he's a running back yeah he was retired a began running back he retired young and he's fucking super smart man just except in control when it comes to yeah yep when it comes to wolves I think he's trolling a little bit he's having a little fun it's being smart yeah there's a a wolf you could get not any wolf oh yeah fuck Lord one with no teeth a grandma wolf old one that doesn't have any endurance anymore hmm he it would be a battle though even then before we get too far off of this I just there's pictures on the yacht Google Images sent me down this this is just north of the Los Angeles Zoo so there's a I think this might even be that same chap we just saw so this sharp cougar has some food its eating and then next picture the Bears show up to take it and now wait a minute or even the fucking food instead of the Cougar oh my god this is 30 miles away I believe in closer so bears steal deer from Cougars this is what happens when liberals run a state listen folks I'm liberal I'm with you I know a lot of you think I'm not there's a lot of knuckleheads out there the thing I'm a part of the alt-right or something I vote left on fucking everything but you you got to stop anthropomorphizing animals we got to be careful we are montine people I don't want these animals to die but I also don't want to go out to my fuckin swimming pool and see a bear in there and they they have that in Pasadena you seen that shit and Pasadena this family went outside and there's a fucking bear swimming around their pool there are bears in Pasadena bro big ones like 200 pound bear swimming in this motherfuckers pool do I live here I don't how do I know this shit not only that you got a take over man if they decide that this is their spot look at this shit hilarious there's a few of them we've got the whole family I God how many bears are in there three I think oh my god dude these are these things are no joke the problem with bears is to once they get a spot where they know they can get food more than water or they can get something they're gonna come back to that spot they get habituated that's why they have a real problem with them with people at Yellowstone used to feed them all right you know people would pull in and then I actually did that over there when that happened when I was a little kid I went to Yellowstone my parents took me when I was probably like seven or eight years old mm-hmm and I remember it's just thinking this is so crazy you're in your car and the Bears are outside they're right there they don't do it the same way anymore though now they discourage human bear interaction they just didn't understand it I think as well which is kind of crazy not that long ago I was looking the 1970s I just don't understand people's like for ferocious animals like I don't want to kill them but I never want to feed something that could kill me well I think people have this really distorted idea of wildlife because of movies mm-hmm if you thought about like what The Lion King is you would never want a line to die you know lion is noble and make sure there's a few bad ones but overall the lion Kings the peas the sweetheart is amazing you think about Yogi Bear and think about teddy bears kids have teddy bears I mean we have this weird thing we take polar bears which is the most vicious of all bears and we have them be our friends selling us ice cream in coca-cola they're selling Klondike bars yeah we cartoon them yeah and then people grow up watching these cartoons and think oh let me go pet this friendly thing yeah that was drawing but that's a I wish a ferocious beast yeah I wish it didn't have a history if we just thought of it as a thing like a Wolverine right Wolverines don't have any there's no one no one feels about a Wolverine the same way they think about a bear because there's no like cute Wolverines mm-hmm there's only the ones that you see in like you know x-men like Wolverine dude is this one yeah yeah but he's like a person his name's Wolverine there's no like cute Wolverines cuz they're so fucking ferocious such a monster of a little animal one Wolverine will fuck up a big bear over - they're fucking ruthless they chase wolves off dude how big our Wolverine not big man forty pounds fifty pounds geez they'll fuck up everything they fuck up everything everything runs away from them they're just ready to die all day all day ready to die and they're super strong and durable for a little tiny thing you see you know what a Wolverine looks like and now I think I don't know up a Wolverine baring his fangs it looks like a fake animal look like a super jacked little giant rat bear thing with fangs it's like a it's like a super badger badger another vicious fucking vicious that's a Wolverine geez bro I mean look at the teeth on that thing look at its face and that's it's smiling yeah that's a good day those motherfuckers were ready to go to war all day make weird noises they're terrifying like if that thing wanted to kill you you would be fucked look at those claws claws and the teeth now imagine that that thing is hyper aggressive and it's a predator fuck that shit is built to survive fuck man that is a crazy little animal they are ferocious and they they are ready to go at all times I mean they'll try to get the fuck away from you the animal scientific name means the glutton that's a pretty apt description four feet tall weighing 22 pounds for females and 40 pounds for males this fierce creatures are the largest members of the weasel family the fucking weasels bro as vicious weasel still they're small compared to some of the animals they compete with for food but a Wolverine has no problem standing up to wolves or a bear when a meal is on the line and that crazy 40 pounds the way bears are to us is the way or but we are the dogs you know like an 80 pound dog probably fuck you up of your 150 pound person mm-hmm that's how Wolverines are the Bears forty pound Wolverine might fuck up a 200-pound bear there's like dams ain't worth it when I die I want to come back as a Wolverine yeah it's a vicious animal the caribou the hares and rodents as well as larger animals like caribou that are weak or ill but will also scavenge from any carcass they can get their claws on they also leave vegetables and berries for meat isn't a deterrent their upper molar that sits sideways at 90 degrees lets them rip into ice-covered carcasses their teeth are so sharp and strong that they can even eat bones whoa damn once they got food they often bury it to save for later mere hours after a meal they'll go on the hunt again ferocious ferocious little fucks ugly as shit too yeah so we don't have a cutie put one of those alright we've liked the Wolverine hi mr. Warren I'm here to help you and our junkie the forest now they're here to eat your kid I'm waiting for some woman to bring one on the plane as a support Wolverine oh yeah for sure yeah it's crazy it's always a woman yeah and no is one that's like over 50 and on all kinds of medication if you're a dude and you bring a Wolverine on a plan that beat will be at your eyes um has a Wolverine ever killed a person there's some women that will get offended by that why does it have to always be in women is it you it's not you right right I'm not talking about you all right why get in person why don't we be gender specific I'm saying like if if I'm saying uh it's probably a woman doesn't mean he know women it means is it's probably really a woman right yeah I guess because the peacock person that was a woman that was a woman and then the but in the P in the defense of women a guy you got an emotional support alligator recently I didn't it was a guy and he's an idiot but I hear about that I wonder how many of those people including the peacock lady are doing it just for attention because they know that people talk about it I think people that have like I've saw this girl and in San Diego La Jolla she came to the restaurant with her micro pig that's not real you know that's not real they MIT they made those yeah well you're Cummings explain it to me you know she adopted a pig and they kept it and then fed it and then drove some ungodly amount of time like two days to Texas drop it off at a pig sanctuary that's how crazy for animals Whitney Cummings it so through Whitney I learned that pigs are just pigs there's no micro pig it's just a pig that they don't feed Oh for real for real so they just starved and it decision getting big but not giving it a lot of food that's not cool pawning off on a sucker it's a pig exactly it's gotta eat exactly a greedy little pig yeah I mean they're famous for getting fat that's what they love to do so they'll pawn it off on some person and then cuz they can't afford not to feed it now the person doesn't know any better they think they're getting a micro pig oh it's give me small and cute forever now you're gonna have a thousand-pound pig if you give you fetus everything in one state it's gonna keep growing damn how did my Pig grow big there's no micro it's like micro people I'll give you a look at people from like the Civil War day there was 125 pounds well why was that cuz they didn't have any fucking food right the same guy today probably 200 pounds yeah the Colonel's and all that stuff and everything in it oh yeah what even just eating regular food no just like real meat and potatoes and vegetables and shit you're not gonna be a hundred 25 pounds like I was probably starving yeah they probably didn't have three meals a day back in the Civil War no ever and snacks I read this book by this pool hustler it was a McGirt e-life of a billiard hustler I think it was it's a really interesting book because it was about a guy who survived by traveling around on trains like a hobo gambling playing pool and billiards um in the depression but during the Depression who's talking about almost starving to death like a people that would knock on people's doors beg for food all right and you know people would just come out with a plate of food and give it to them like everybody was like on the edge people had to really rely on people they didn't like rely on people for food there was no fucking jobs there's a lot of people back then you know with looking at these homeless folks and like for the most part my opinion is you're looking at people probably have an undiagnosed or untreated mental illness yeah it's a lot of that it's I think it's a lot I don't know what the number is but I would think it's a lot and then there's also people that make mistakes down in the lawyer and then people that you know had terrible childhoods horrible abuse sexual abuse violence the evil parents you know parents die leave them alone foster care all that kind of shit like it's not their fault alarms and theirs as humans we should do something to take care of it but on the other hand yeah we just don't know who's who out there yeah exactly who's mentally ill who just needs help and the mentally ill people man they need help too but like how do you force them to you know how do you force them in a tree how do you just get them real help so that because yeah the way they do help people with pills and all that stuff some some of it works and some of it doesn't work mm-hmm you know what I mean and some of its just like creates a dependency on something yeah so it's just like the the system just from the beginning needs to be fixed right and not just like pills and like have you ever been on any kind of psych medication no have you ever taken adderall no you do Jamie gave me a little bit of adderall once allegedly and I didn't take it I looked at it I don't do it my scale speed you know I think gave it to because I haven't taken it either had it for a long time I just I've known so many people to do it and they get real weird they get weird and it is a it's it's an amphetamine and when you take ham feta means especially if you don't take amphetamines responsibly really strange things happen and one of the things happen is people get really paranoid they get really weird they get they start having delusions of grandeur they start thinking that what they're doing is very important that a lot of people are out to take them down mm-hm and you see that with people that do too much adderall they don't follow the prescription they just start chewing them all day whew things can get real slippery like slippery it's like Matt I'm f slippery that's all right it's like because they s they get immune to it so they got to take extra oh yeah then the more you take yeah the worse it gets yeah tolerance is a real for everything yeah I assume I mean they even have tolerances for snake venom you know one of the things that snake handlers do they'll give themselves a little bit of venom every day um selves immune to snake venom right your body is an amazing adaptable thing which is why vaccines work all right so why these crazy fucks you don't want us to vaccines like listen you know we gotta be real careful with claiming expertise on this shit we gotta be real careful with getting fucked over by pharmaceutical companies we got to be real careful of that too but we also got to be real careful of not listening to these doctors and researchers that are struggling to find the ways to cure these horrible infectious diseases because they've got a lot of them nailed through vaccines it's so confusing out there you can make an argument for any team sure anything you can so it's tough to figure out I know a lot of logical intelligent people that that think that vaccines cause autism and I'm not a doctor so I I don't know know if you know that mmm yeah I think I think not a doctor no but I've heard logical intelligent people argue that that vaccines can cause autism like man you're not a scientist like how could you say that because you saw it in a documentary I know it's interesting when you see something in the documentary that sounds good you want to relay it as fact I'm as guilty as that as anyone probably more guilty than most I'm guilty of doing that a lot but just recognizing that over time I've gotten to this point where I'm like maybe I should just shut the fuck up about something that I don't actually know about and try to figure out what it is instead of saying what it is what they what they do know is that vaccines have stopped the spread of a fucking bunch of awful disease has saved a bunch of plague small blocks that Lindsey Fitzharris woman who's been on the podcast Jamie she sent me some image of some people with smallpox a bunch of stuff about some small pox is horrific right just horrific with how it kills you horrific they knit that shit in the bud with vaccines maybe maybe they've chain some vaccines do get people autism that guy's back looks like and maybe some bactine vaccines do give some people autism but overall most of the time it helps everybody like there's gonna be some things that affect pee well differently hmm but then that but that means you can't stop taking it or giving it to everybody that's knowledge happen right it's no consolation if you get autism from it or if your child write autism from it yeah but it's one of those things that's but everybody else take this grows up without it right you know it's a messy thing about being a person right right like it's not it's not like clean print like are you pro-abortion well I'm pro-abortion up to a point right right when it gets to be like seven months it's that seems to you know it gets longer in the pregnancy that seems like we're talking about like the first few days yeah what is that I'm BRE so I'm pro-abortion if I get the girl pregnant yeah it's um it's a weird you know with many many many subjects right there's like a weird well it's not exactly well it's this mm-hmm you know if there's a vaccine court for a reason vaccines have done damage to people yeah people gotten injured from vaccines where at during the injection site something happened Peter Hotez was talking about that he's a doctor that's specialists and infectious diseases and vaccines and he was explaining that there's five environmental factors if they think or five factors they think contribute to a child possibly getting autism they've narrowed it down to these things but the most current research but they're all during the womb it's it's contact with things during the womb or in other genetics of the mother they think that's it has something to do with the developmental process while the child is in vitro in the woman's body not after birth right they don't think it occurs after birth but I don't know that I mean they could be wrong then but keep it current and then they could change that opinion a year from now they can find new evidence that shit happens all the time exactly it really does it happens all the time but what we have to do is make sure we have fucking people that are working on this shit trying to figure out the way to stop diseases because otherwise some Spanish flu type shit comes rolling around so simple shit and kill everybody that Spanish flu killed millions and millions of people in the 1920s yeah it doesn't sound lethal at all it's just Spanish flu it's just like how did that kill people sounds like a drink yeah yeah bring that full circle back to downtown LA that where typhus outbreaks have happen same thing as typhoid fever I think but it's very close it's a new one it's a new one it's a new typhoid that they don't have a fucking vaccine for I was down there the other day just trying to buy doughnuts downtown it's the the allure of downtown has escaped me everybody everybody thinks it's amazing with Jamie and I talked and we've been talking about this forever we wanted to get a loft in downtown like I'm high and start filming podcasts up there uh-huh because I think that would be the coolest backdrop right like for YouTube like you and me sitting here behind us you're just all building by some Times Square TV show nights and shit like that would be an amazing backdrop for a podcast green-screen that now be safe yeah I can't do that if I was gonna green-screen something it would be like current events shit it would be like Melania Trump slapping Donald's hand away I'd like to see that shit like that would be what I was I wouldn't pretend I'm in the savannahs I mean everybody sees me no no I'll be sitting in Griffith Park behind me is a mountain lion on a leg I was meditating in Griffith Park oh do you like one morning and I hear rustling in the bushes and it was a coyote like just waking up they bite you yeah and I was like I can't do that anymore close my eyes in Griffith Park yeah you go camping out there they'll bite you look check that you might be dead right yeah you just lie in there maybe just recently died by you yeah they really will do really well they're predators the whole thing is so strange he people are so strange how we just we think it's cool it's cool to be around bears a mountain lions and shit and we have urban coyotes ones that like you'll see walking down the street at night yeah my neighbor had two little dogs and one of them was really old so then she had to walk them one at a time mmm because she saw a coyote one time coming up on him and she couldn't handle both of him so she takes or she used to take each dog out to walk at night one at a time take a gun that fucking rotten dog right in the face it's hot that's what a coyote is a dog not her dog I was talking about the coyote but actually it's a wolf it's a small wolf too small wolf yeah coyotes like a particularly durable and resilient form of wolf a shitty wolf it's a really interesting wolf mmm this is a great book called coyote America but Dan Flores he I learned about him through my friend Steve Rinella I think he's his professor and one of his one of his courses but he is a guy who spent an extreme amount of time studying the history and the science behind coyote a really really interesting book but one of the things they found out is that when you kill a coyote they just make more coyotes that's why the Saudis yeah like they know they spread out yeah they when they yell out they'd yell out they communicate in a lot of different ways they yell out when they kill something sometimes they yell out when they're trying to figure out where each others are they also yell it like a rolecall like out there they do that that's what they're doing and when one is missing they the female there's some sort of a chemical or biological reaction and her body makes more puppies like we're fucking tonight yeah I didn't hear Jamie we're fuckin tonight they make larger litters fair so if I can normal litter would be like four pups if someone's missing they'll make six or eight some along those lines and now we can't kill him well they spread out two went in the 1700's and 1800's you know when people's first started going through the West you know they were around but then when we started killing them they spread to the entire country there also he was a single-state so they weren't like down this way no no no they weren't everywhere they're a West animal they're a Western animal and then they went brow there in New York City oh shit for real yes for real there's coyotes in New York City they have little packs of them running around Times Square get out of here dude for real dude there's little coyotes that are wandering through Central Park listen I get that there's mountain lions in Griffith Park I get that this urban cut but New York City I might have made up the time square part but best bananas definite York I know they're in New York as there was uh they probably came from upstate they've seen him in buildings during coyotes and abandoned buildings where they've decided to make a look at NASA and abandoned build they're all they're all over downtown LA mmm Central Park Central Park BAM coyote motherfucker damn bro on the streets coyote okay on the street so I was telling the truth they could go to Times Square easily yeah everywhere I look I'm almost like a tourist reading coyote that is a small wolf that's what that is and there we've were infected with them and here's the thing this is what you have to be aware of that's the gentlemen that go back what's his name Justin Brown yeah Justin Brown was on the podcast he tracks coyotes all throughout downtown LA mmm he's biology a wildlife biologist that works for the state really interesting in downtown LA so instead of like being at a ranch outside of Bakersfield and tatty mountains this guy is look there's a coyote same camera trap got that yeah get a picture of that too young Jamie order that bitch up make a note yeah why not right we should have coyote picture too we can't just have a mountain lion that's rude let's show all the crazy shit that's wandering see if they got a bear in the next camera trap hopefully they get a beer I like how the Coyotes are so used to being around that the way they walk down the street is just like regular yeah like no trepidation whatsoever look at that just wandering yeah yeah whistling walk I remember in 1994 the first might have been 93 first time I ever came to LA and I was staying at the Oakwood gardens oh yeah Oakwood Ourense yeah on Barham there in in Burbank there furnished apartments where it's where you stay when you first come to LA you don't have a spot you don't have enough money to get up and you don't know if the show you're on is ever going to last yeah so I stayed at these oakwoods apartments and I was driving up the street to the apartment and I saw a coyote I was like what is his dog doing just walking right I was like oh shit those are coyotes I couldn't believe it it's fine I pulled over and I'm looking out the window there's three little wolves isn't it funny how that moment when something you've never seen before you see it and it takes you a second to realize it what it is and then you the word for what it is comes to your head right away like you knew it was a coyote even though you never really seen a coyote before I was in denial he's in denial yeah I was thinking it was a dog like it was three dogs and then I had to pull over and I'm like I remember people telling me that they had seen coyotes mm-hmm but I thought it was like I saw a mountain lion like if someone saw a mountain lion you're like holy shit you dead that's pretty rare right right have you ever seen one no I've seen two alive yeah see two live ones why are you like out here yeah and what happened one of them ate my dog yes we lived in Colorado yeah and you was right there no no I was this mountainous case in the house I think right and we saw it in the woods at one point time mm-hmm and then another one I saw in Santa Barbara in Montecito driving through a neighborhood I saw this animal run across the car in front of the lights and I saw its tail and I was like holy shit that's a cat I take it back I have seen some mountain lions really you know faizon love yeah he moves all over the place but one time he lived in San Diego meaning Hugh Moore went to visit him and Weez at his house hanging out and at night he was like look out the window in his backyard and it was like mountain lions in his fucking backyard more than one yeah there was like two or three of them and all I'm thinking is like how the fuck were we go and get to the car and he was so casual about it and I was like wow yeah yeah it's time to move son yeah Jaime did you ever see that video from Colorado where a guy looked out his window there was three mountain lions on his driveway like super clear iPhone footage this guy or Android phone I don't know yeah it could be an Android he was saying this week any more shit for using an Android phone than for being a vegan yeah for being a black vegan comedian yeah yeah you get more grief yeah forever an Android it's a weird little battle right it's like republican-democrat type shit yeah it is it is like people with iPhones really ain't trying to have it but it's not just that it's like there's teams it's like the fucking Orioles are playing the Yankees yeah you know people get on a goddamn team and the iPhones are the Yankees right now it's weird man phone the phone thing is a weird thing it's weird that people are so they're they're really like so tribal all right they're tribal with their phone yeah they made a tribe out of phones people could make a tribe out of anything hmm and what's really crazy is the biggest company the ones that's the most desirable is a company that also makes computers and they they make their own shit they make their own hardware all right that's what's really strange about Apple like they make everything they make the software they make the hardware they the only one you have different models but there's only an iPhone you get an iPhone rxr whatever the fuck it is X excess max but it's only an iPhone that's all you get you don't get it you don't get anything else whereas Android you got hundreds of brain yeah see there's so much variety everybody yeah but choose from Jamie's like that but you gotta have you got to be able to deal with that green yeah fended by the green bubble I have friends that I go up but maybe if they're smart and your bubble comes a green it means something you know it doesn't look green to them their messengers pretty cool looking yeah all my text is when they come in like they're all will they look like yeah see if policy well I think mine are oh they're blue they are blue so here's come in blue anyway so it looks blue what do you have a note yeah Galaxy Note 9 yeah that's the shit I have one of those yeah see that's my other phone yeah you told me yeah that thing is badass yeah it's a beast of a phone that screen is amazing there it's so big and you like you get the whole screen yes no cutout yeah and it goes down the side and sure mm-hmm I got it just in case like I'm on the flight and I want to watch something on it or just somewhere you want to watch something on it you download it and you have a full screen yeah instead of having like a getting an iPad on top of that right as people have just too much shit do you ever use the pen know that pen is useless to me yeah I just like like signed the document today like yeah like Shan Zhai needed a w-9 signed a w-9 form for me I just like downloaded it signed it and then emailed it back yeah I've never used it yeah maybe it's just me I draw dicks on people's head that's the perfect use for it but I also feel like a rebel when I use my Android fucking I'm crazy man fucking trans out here whoo when do you use your Android like like so you have your iPhone yeah so when you need more more often I'm transitioning out of one phone number to another which I have to do often okay yeah so you have two different numbers okay getting used to it play what I play with it a lot got a new one that's coming out there's a new ones coming out that looks amazing do you know ten No ten yeah it's coming out like in a couple weeks yeah I try to hold on to I don't try to get every new phone I try to hold on to it for a minute so I feel like they didn't rip me off and it may be three or two phones later then I'll get the other one but if I buy every phone I feel like um I want to be a rebel within the rebel mold yeah yeah I got some old shit you're not gonna get me like in this loop but just by and by and by comparison yeah that's in a weird thing like that phone they could stop right there that phone's perfect like it does everything yeah what more do I need they take pictures makes videos yes get on the internet asking questions get any answers send emails what the fuck else do I need don't you don't you know it does everything unless they come up with some new shit but if someone said hey Ian I'll give you about million dollars but you gotta use that phone only for the rest of your life would you say yes this one yes that's crazy yeah breaks will replace it but that's your phone forever I know it was I know it'll slow down well Apple phones will slow down because they engineered them and that means sick that that almost made me stop using Apple stuff I was like I can't believe that you guys are attributing this to battery life that that's in dis ingenuity well they admitted it but they said they did it so that it would give you more battery life because your battery degrades over time so the engineer net that is a convenient yeah they also must have understood that people were gonna get frustrated with the fact that it slowed down considerably and they would give them an incentive to buy a new phone to say that they didn't say that like come on you guys are so goddamn smart you make iPhone right they figured out everything yeah but not that you didn't throw that out you figured that out on purpose yeah you also one of the most successful businesses of all time Apple has billions of dollars cash just sitting there they have so much money I got Pablo Escobar buried money they got so much money Apple has something like how many billions of dollars is Apple have 225 billion Apple has so much cash cash that they could they could probably wipe out half our debt looks like this is what they could buy right now it's not 25 billion left over they could buy Nike Ferrari ham Twitter the Manchester United franchise and the Manchester United Football team and still have a home which left 25 billion left I say football for people like yourself to the aficionado thank you sir I didn't say soccer appreciate their do they say soccer um where you from like originally in England yeah no not in England and then it's football you're only in America they say soccer but before the like where did it where did it become football was it always football in Europe who's always football well why why when it came over here did it switch over no idea why didn't they come up with another name for football base hardly ever kick a football I think I think they were playing football like the soccer football and then somebody picked up the ball and started running with it and they started tackling each other like I heard some story like that oh and then they kind of created football and it evolved from there but then they never changed the name is that weird they like footballs called football when the only person kicks it is a guy who can't even play the game it's the least significant person on the team as far as getting pussy when has a championship yes yeah and you're not allowed to hit him right right and you're not allowed to hit him yeah that's crazy you can't hit him it's not while he's in motion of his vulnerable person they try to be safe oh so you can't hit him on ones legs up an area well that's what block the ball and you can hit him yet but in the crazy that that's football it's only one time it gets kicked right how is that football why what what a silly name right does it make sense but I'm not mad at it you know it's like fine it's whatever imagine if they called you know baseball what would they call it foul if they called it foul we're playing foul well it's something that happens every now and then this game has nothing to do it running around the bases is it's it's about touchdowns you should call it touchdown yeah play touchdown because it's just yeah baseball it's just like we're trying to get from base to base yeah if they baseball touchdown no they call football touchdown touchdown the ntl national touchdown league we're gonna what we're gonna play touchdown run through an explanation of why we call it soccer and it's more confusing than we carry when you go back to England if you're from England and you talking about it to people do they resent the term soccer like how does it work some people do like I used to present the term soccer really yeah but I live here and as I get over it you know I'm saying as a person I got to get over it because it was my favorite sport growing up yes I just got over it and then now I even call it soccer my podcast says soccer I don't even say football but when I go to England I just or just when I'm around four or soccer people I say football I get it yeah it's like if I if I was talking to someone they wanted to talk about pool but they want to call it bumper pool okay the woman's World Cup they won the World Cup in the United States did for soccer mm-hmm and but it's not you know it's football to people like yourself it's the World Cup like how can they call the World Cup soccer to appease the one country that gives the least amount of fucks about the sport right now weird yeah that's way that's that's how over America that's crazy I really stop and think about it we made them change the name of their thing yeah we're not gonna get in there well come on soccer okay we're out of it but we're calling it this they call it do they call it football in like Argentina yeah everywhere in football you know but it's football they state their pronunciation and spelling of it but in Australia they're the rebels are the rebels oh yeah they have their own rules they have Australian rules football yeah they changed the rules right for more ruggedness yeah cuz they're too you know what it was over there they were too used to rugby like those New Zealand savages yeah yeah they're fucking Savage you can't play that bitch-ass game with a helmet these guys are running around biting each other in the dick and the scrums right that's the most rugged game anything to win that's the game they should play in America all the CTE problems they're having you'd have a little bit of that with with anything contact sports you're gonna get injuries mm-hmm but I think you'd have less with no gear so both those things confuse me I don't know the difference between rugby on Australian rules football and I think in Australia they play both yes just I'd be just confused like what is the difference well the ball is different right they both seem like what's a rugby ball look like literally look about the same is it no different not note there is slight differences but they look about the same it's like a football with more rounded edges and it's a little more plump as far as I know they could be playing with a round ball I literally don't even know yeah I have no idea what now it's kind of like it kind of looks like an American that's it it's a cross between a basketball and a football yeah yeah it's like a fat football yeah so that's an Australian use football though it's similar to a rugby ball okay so that's not a foot rugby ball but it's close so there's probably like football Australian rules football and then rugby ball right what is the rules what can they do yeah what are they doing different it's also sometimes referred to in the media as the round ball game but the world game and international football strenuous football referred to as Australian football hmm I think I think yeah it's a little more like fluid like the game doesn't stop as much as less stoppages they kind of just keep going okay it says it's a little more fluid where players can pretty much run around where they choose they still have a specific end side goal to score but it's more open in between another main differences that the game is played in 20 minute quarters not halves hmm I was trying I told you a couple while ago they're adding three versus three basketball to the Olympics coming up and the way that that game is played is so different than traditional basketball like it's just a running clock the once you score you just take it out throw it back run across the line go score again it's a very fast-paced city so they're bringing like pong ball to the Olympics I think so it apparently it's very popular in Europe it's not like that big three basketball that sort of started here it's not that same basketball but it's popular I guess when will Harris was in here will Harris has this show called anatomy of a fighter he's a videographer and he went to Dagestan to watch khabib nurmagomedov who's the UFC lightweight champion fucking animal man he's just don't he's one of the rare undefeated top of the food chain fighters in MMA they play a game of basketball in Dagestan or they don't dribble the ball at all they just like wrestle each other to the ground and they even choke each other and get each other in arm bars and shit so this is it they just practice in jiu-jitsu yeah they're well look they don't they don't dribble at all they're basically playing like football a football type but they're shooting at the basketball hoop but they throw each other to the ground and khabib oh fucking hip toss dudes because they they have it right next to the wrestling mats uh-huh so part of what they filmed was he was in a wrestling match with his dude when they were trying to take a player out so he's a hold of this dude and when he grabs a hold of dude he drags him to the ground and gets him a Mack gets him an armbar get some gonna remake a choke it's crazy makes the guy tap and he doesn't let him up like here goes look look he grabs him mm-hmm like they're allowed to do this the guys lives through he gets him I'm there sir they're grappling first of all the grappling on the fucking hardwood floor on full-blast clack grappling and then he takes him to the ground this is serious this isn't playing around the dudes back now they're on the floor again they're on the hardwood floor and he's fucking choking him out just Conor McGregor doom and then they keep going and as they keep going he's getting the guy in an armbar later this is this is this is basketball for white dudes that can't dribble that's all this is just like how do we but yeah I don't know man I think it's this is the most effective way to use wrestling with basketballs I think they just wanted to make something that's like a really hard workout that's very competitive I think I don't know if other people are doing this in Europe or if this is just something that Dagestan figured out but look these are some of the most savage fighters in the UFC it does look fun it looks fun it's fun yeah I get to be bond you're back yeah they just don't have access to a very good basketball on pump to keep it pumped up and the floor how they're not good to be dribbled on so they just figured out a better game to play it stead of dealing with that fucked up ball court that's a ridiculous way to thank Jamie these are world-class fighters they travel over the world they have all sorts of gym equipment they have mats they have weights they have already some skin on it that's a city basketball I played with lots of basketball is my life you would never even try to dribble that it's like American football slash jujitsu / - like if you have a dead spot on the court you almost only want to play on it but dude they could get another ball they all have brand new sneakers on and leggings and shit I mean it's not like Dagestan is in the middle of nowhere I don't get Goods there they could but they might just like this game better there's like fuck it we're playing this because well better at this that I think I think it helps them I'm saying that your leg made you go one-on-one with the basket maybe I did not understand the rules they make him up but you said it was like I was swearing for no reason oh they're like they're they're talking out a dispute how do you argue with Kobe B you can't that's the top dog that's the Beast of the fucking crew but yeah which it's weird what what people like get really into like cricket cricket is one that the Europeans brought over to India right they brought it to the West Indies abort it to any country that they colonize and all those countries love it and they play it oh so it's a colonization game yeah and then now they have like almost like the equivalent of like World Cups of cricket in all the countries Australia's big cricket country because they unite so it's a big thing West Indies and everything strange-looking game too it's just boring yeah takes takes days to play sometimes days yeah yeah days yeah for a week I think sometimes yeah yeah yeah how many hours a day too many Oh Mike it's too many mana okay I used to kill me it was fun to play in the backyard cuz you can just get some sticks and stick them in the ground and then put one across the top as a wicket this is a game I have no idea I couldn't even draw you a picture of what the stick looks like three sticks like three sticks and then you put like one on top across the album Senate when the you're out when the guy who's pitching or bowling and you swing and or if you don't swing and it hits the wicket and they knock over comb kind of like bowling sticks then you're out but yeah and then you get you're trying to protect the wicket protect the wicket and hit it so far that you can run from stick to stick you and your partner who is batting at the other end and then the most amount of runs you can get that just adds to the score can I see that I want to see that that sounds so weird pull up a video of dudes playing cricket I don't think I've ever watched it go yeah I think I've seen like highlights on television maybe you know I what you never seen cricket not a fucking get no no chance I don't know see I'm already stunned by their outfits yeah this guy doesn't have nothing on some dudes are covered up in gear those the guys with the helmets because the ball is hardest fuck I got hit by a cricket ball by the strongest kid in school on time oh then I was like um because the way they throw it this was so weird well the guys in the outfield don't have anything because I just catch the ball bare hand is right there barehanded you and I feel like they should have met Wellcome he throws it he runs at you mm-hmm he runs and literally tries to hit you with the ball that's crazy and it does it have to hit the ground first is that the deal yeah I think yeah it does that guy's from what I remember cuz it seems like it but the dude like runs across the line and this is a bullshit game number seven ball shit game like I'm not a big fan of baseball I used to mean it I think it's kind of boring yeah my wrestling coach used to say it's not a sport it's a skills game just kills game it's not support you ever see a baseball player so fucking tired he had to push himself to push Murph coach Murphy wrestling coach in high school is also the same guy tried to get me to play football when 135 pounds or crazy asshole yeah maybe saw some natural athlete shit in you know I just thought it was mean oh yeah good be good put havin a great safety probably just people I would get crippled that's what would have happened was dude on our team his name's Bob Baker he weighed a good solid 300 pounds oh it was so big maybe not maybe I'm exaggerating but he was 250 he was our heavyweight and I was like how how was he how are we gonna play the same game where he could just run me over with what did you want you to play I don't know we didn't even just didn't get that far you're crazy I was ready fighting to I was doing martial arts and wrestling at the same time like look man I know I'm not doing that I'm already doing shit that freaks me out physical shit scares the shit out of me all the time I don't want to get scared by even bigger people at least to learn martial arts and wrestling was confined to your own weight class you know if I had a wrestle some badass dude at least it was my own weight class right you know yeah this is like the weight scale is all over the place on a football field yeah man it's all over the place and the athleticism is all over the place too you know you get a guide like Hershel Walker and you know if you're in high school and there's a Hershel Walker in high school and he's on some team that you're opposing good luck fuckface these people that are just superior just superior it's not a damn thing you can do about it they aren't the people like that in martial arts like when you're wrestling oh yeah yeah this thing's like that and outliers you know there's outliers in all sports and a lot of it has to do you know with what you did growing up sometimes people do things grown up like a lot of wrestlers and turns out like working on farms as a king is a great way for wrestlers to be super strong you know who make good restless cowboys oh yeah because they they you know they steer right to the ground they do it all the time they practice on them yeah yeah for sure we're also they're tough yeah cuz you're gonna get banged up a lot and a lot of it is like mental toughness yeah you know but people who have to count like there's a dude in Matt Hughes who's like one of the greatest Walter White's of all time and he was ungodly strong right dude from Illinois because he broke enough arm wrestling animals I was a party one time right as a party one time and he's thrown by these rappers are you right on this show lyricist lounge so one of the rappers master fool dude from Brooklyn was friends with these cowboy it's a great name master Franz the fool he was dope too he's like he's like the Flavor Flav of the of the rappers for that group and he's just like he just talks to everybody so he became friends with these Cowboys they came to visit LA for a week and live in the house with the rappers and you know they were real cowboys they like have their last zoos out on the set and shit like that so then at the party this black dude with dreads got into an argument with one of the cowboys and like we're not gonna fight in the house so everybody walks around the corner to the street and in five seconds that cowboy had the black dude with dreads tied up with his pants just just twist it tied his body and had him on the ground bleedin Jesus and then it was like I let him up in the start again and he got up and he just did it to the black dude again and I was like I'll never fuck with a cowboy if if a cowboy is a wrestler if he knows how to wrestle - both of those things yes wrestlers are so goddamn strong you don't realize until they grab you you realize how helpless you are so weird feeling and even if you you can wrestle if you like I wasn't a good wrestler in high school but I made it to the States and I remember when I was wrestling this kid who eventually became friends with because he used to come to Nautilus Plus which is a place where I was teaching Taekwondo and we ran into each other when we were both like 20 like probably 20 or something like that it was really cool he was a really nice guy his name is Murphy - I don't remember his first name might have been that might have been his first name a lot of Irish people named Murphy yeah that's like the most common name amongst Irish people probably but uh I was like doing pretty good in like regional shit but this guy got a hold of me and I was like fuck sure made me realize like this is another level of wrestling he had been wrestling all of his life I've been doing it for a year he just ragdoll me around I was like fuck damn and he wasn't even like like a champion yeah I don't think he won the states and then whoever did when the states didn't win the Nationals so I was like this is like tears intervals and then like a national high school champion ain't shit compared to a Division one NCAA a mayor all-american college wrestler and those College wrestlers are off the chain and then they ain't shit compared to like Jordan burrows all right something they're not shit I should never say that about I'm just saying that in comparison because and I admire them almost more than any other athlete because there's no professional venue for what they do one of the more amazing things about wrestlers is that go into it knowing there's no professional sport there's no perfect other than you know pro wrestling's difference it's entertainment but there's no professional 135 pound wrestling 180 pound right there's nothing that they just loves it they just love it and it's the toughest thing to do physically they're fucking animals and then when you get to the top of the top of the food chain like a mole time world champion like Jordan burrows he had a wrestling match with Ben Askren and he just ran him over just rolling over and Ben aspirins one of the best grapplers to ever compete in MMA and he was also a two-time olympian wrestler yes and he ran him over there and Ben Askren runs most people over when he wrestles was here yeah levels levels levels never ends with speaking of aspirin is he awake yet he's awake he's uh he handled it like a champion all good yeah he went on Ariel Helwani show and talked about it and she said yeah it sucks the guy's a douche bag like sucks losing to him uh you know I don't like him he said you know he just what can he do he's right he's not gonna read the comments he's a smart yeah he's a very smart guy but he took it like a man to be able to go and do an interview right after you get knocked out like that it's very admirable but that's who he is that's how you get to be a guy who's as good a wrestler as a guy like Ben Askren I can handle a loss like that what do you think of the I forgot I can't I can't pronounce the guys name who beat him Jorge Masvidal Maz without what he said after the fight he said he would smack him if you saw him at Whole Foods yeah I think I think it's just a little too much u1i but I don't know their history the history is rough excuse me it's like ten years of them giving him a hard time or if Ben Askren given miles at all according to Maz Vidal a lot of talking shit which some people think is friendly in Maz Vidale Street Jesus doesn't fuck around all right jeez talk shit Street Jesus he will fucking make fun of you after he flatlines yeah right and that's right did he flatlined him in five seconds made him the fastest ever ko in UFC history and then mocked him afterwards and said he would smack him if he saw him at Whole Foods but see we're talking about it so Maas Vidal is smart this is a yeah yeah this is a amazing marketing ploy I mean he's he's become in one fight the most talked-about fighter in the sport because he did something in the sport that's been around for a little bit that nobody's ever done before Ben Askren was undefeated yeah undefeated and Maz Vidale comes out flatlines like that and talked some pretty vicious shit after the fact and even mimicked him laying on the floor yeah which would look scary the way he was out mm-hmm yeah monster doll say calls out easy Conor McGregor I want to break his face yeah that would be that's a rough fight that's a rough fight for Conor Maz Woodall is a big fella too I mean he's he really belongs at 170 that's where he's fighting he fought at 155 but really tortured himself to make that weight right he's a big guy you're talking about a guy who knocked out cowboy Cerrone knocked out Darren till knocked out Ben Askren I mean he's knocking out big welterweights big Darren till is a big welterweight he's big he's not a guy coming up from 155 pounds he's never making hundred kabhi he's way 55 155 sorry yeah so he's one weight class heavier and he's really running into like the last few fights he's coming into his own he's really becoming something special he had a real close decision loss to wonder boy I wish I could remember how that fight went down I just think it was a decision I don't know if it was a split decision or unanimous decision but I think it was just wonder boy out pointed him I don't think there was any knockdowns right now smiles oh yeah I was monster doll but wonder boy is a particularly difficult guy to fight that especially for three rounds Pettis recently knocked him out but pet it's just hit him with a perfect punch and that can happen to anybody and Pettis timed it and Pettis is a beast oh this is Wow yeah he's a wild man here he's a fantastic fighter losing to him it's like yeah you lost him one of the best fighters ever and he also like he's a guy who dropped Tony Ferguson I mean pet is knocked out cowboy Cerrone pet is knocked out Joe Lowe's Omelas crazy head change that is his a monster hey this is like he'll win one and then lose one win one yeah yeah well it's it's a crazy division man it's filled with murderers just murder after murder both divisions 55 and 70 and I think Pettis is probably gonna do real good at 70 because he's healthier you know I think he went down to 145 and kill them it was just too much man he had nothing in the tank and then max Holloway beat him up he lost two I think he lost it Charles Oliveira mm-hm I think so I might be wrong he might have caught Charles Oliveira hmm I don't know Pettis has the most legit crazy look in his eye there was he had this one right choked him right getting choked yeah that's right that's right I'm confused he lost to someone else at 1:45 who else did you lose it to at 45 Oh Barbosa was 55 Dustin Poirier I don't think that was 54 and he lost a toe that was 45 you Petey doesn't say what we plot their fight then he lost her Tony right yes he lost it Tony broke his hand in the fight yeah that stuff but it was a great fight I was a great wound up dropping him okay so Charles Olivet sin Barbosa and then Oliveira I think that was the thing that was 55 I think max Holloway was 45 I don't know man I'm not sure though and then he went back up to 55 yeah the Dustin Poirier fight that was that was he got injured and that was at 55 as a catchweight they fought he is yeah he missed the wait oh he missed the fight with max yeah so he's trying to get down to 45 so featherweight debut was against Olivera so he submission all they're submitted Oliver and his featherweight debut okay so he had two fights at that way that way it was torturous for him he didn't make it for the max Holloway fight and then Jim Miller is definitely a 55-pound fight and all the other ones 55 till he got to Stephen Thompson and that was the last one wonderboy that was that was at welterweight yeah yeah that was a amazing fight I mean so I think sometimes these guys is just too much man it's just too much he beat michael Chiesa says he beat casa and Kess is another one he was fighting at 55 and now he moved up to 17 yeah that ended up being a catchweight fight he estimates these fucking guys man they're killing themselves that weak cutting no imagine if that was the case with soccer like before a soccer game everybody had like you had a certain amount of guaranteed weight on the field I imagine like Ian you know your whatever position it is you have to cut down to 130 pounds you like fuck right right so you got a drain your body and a sauna and then everybody ways and that everybody rehydrates and then the next day you play this grueling ass game and they'll be ridiculous right fighting is the most tiring yeah Bing it would totally compromise the game wouldn't it yeah first imagine football players had to do that imagine football players only had like you want okay guys whatever the team is it has to wait 4,000 pounds that's it no more and so you have to decide hey you know Bob can cut lower than 260 we checked his body fat Joe you're gonna have to get down to 180 Jamie when we were kids playing football we had to weigh in and that sort of happened we like oh yeah because if you were a certain weight like you had to have stripes on your helmet it means you could only play like on the line you couldn't be carrying the ball cuz you'd be fuck nope no kids could tackle a ball oh so there was like definitely a limit I remember I did have to wear the trash bag and like cut 5-pound or tried fucking not much I way but was so I could be a tight end and catch the ball I was a little I was like on the border dude that was so bad for kids I had a friend in high school my friend Steven he's all of his brothers like 6-1 6-2 he's like five six he never grew and it was because all throughout high school and junior high school he was cutting weight and wrestling I guarantee you it had something to do with it everyone else's family is is tall boys are and he was tired or his dad is not his real dad oh no his brothers look just like okay he ever he was always tired he'd be walking around the hallways like this oh because he do wrestling camps he would do the whole thing so he's always wrestling who's always exhausted always it's a terrible thing for kids the fact they still have kids do that is fucking madness it's madness people didn't know any better my parents didn't ask me when I got on the wrestling team daddy now that you're not cutting weight are you they didn't even ask me all right they had no idea did you just listen to the coach coach tells you to lose weight you gotta lose weight fuck so bad for the body it's so bad for your your brain too because Ord hydrates your brain and then you're in class you're trying to listen in class you're fuckin it's worse than being hungover that's true because all they tell us to do now is drink water mm-hmm and stay hydrated and then you're doing something that's like you can't put anything in your system you're just trying to drain it out there's affect you mentally yeah yeah well you get dehydrated your brain works like shit all right like they say that's one of the things that happens to people in the desert when they start dying of thirst they can't think straight right they don't they don't make good decisions yeah I've been fatigued like it's soccer practice and you just like out you'll be wearing an opposing player shirt and just from fatigue I'll just pass it to you just to not have to have the responsibility of this ball you know I'm saying Carrillo's I fuck it and I'm trying to make the team at the time I'm like making just blatant mistakes I'm just so tired man yeah fatigue makes cowards of men Vince Lombardi's lon did you did that to me in college were you following Adam green tree at all his stories at this point in the video said he hadn't had water for like 18 hours and he's still climbing up hill and needs to find it yeah great that's insane well he had to get rescued I don't know if he broke his arm I haven't chatted with him but he thinks he broke his arm - it is if you go to my friend Adam green trees Instagram Adam green tree he documented this hunt that he went in for a thing called a Himalayan Tahr that lives in New Zealand and it lives in these Alpine mountain areas oh no its Alpine mountain dangerous slippery mountain areas and he got stuck out there and they had to get rescued and fell into the frozen glacier River was freezing to death had a climb into his a sleeping bag soaking wet yeah really dangerous foul thought he broke his arm yeah it was worried that he might have broke his leg they plot his camera and film half of it to probably I don't think he filmed much of it he felt filmed some of it but he was having a really hard time and then he had to get rescued and he had to go somewhere where the helicopter could land so they could winch him and and carry him up and rescue him and take him to the hospital fucking dangerous shit there's a lot of these guys like Adam who's a good friend of mine who loves to go on these like Vision Quest solo adventures and so he'll go to the mountains and and camp out by himself for 28 and he films it and puts it up on Instagram right always talking to himself and tottery like hunting elk he's like mountain areas and last year that's his campsite last year he had a one-on-one encounter with a grizzly bear oh and he had a pistol with him and he's documenting him trying to hold off this mama grizzly was standing up in the background she made several charges at him and he didn't even know that the pistol was jammed the ammunition was the wrong size so the the lever like when you cock it it couldn't it couldn't fit another bullet in there so he had a dummy gun he's pointing a gun that's not even real yeah because so if you pull the trigger nothing would happen so then he realized that that was a problem when he I guess he tried to fire it to make sure it does work okay so then he had to realize that he had to put he could put one bullet in the chamber but he couldn't reload he could reload musket style yeah so he had one bullet essentially one bullet you're the wrong ammo for the pistol yeah and you only get one shot with one of those childhood you don't even get one man you know when they're running at you you are shitting your pants you can't believe it you're gonna miss half the bullets if you have ten bullets if you hit it once you're lucky it's madness because you're not gonna shoot when it's ten feet away from you you're gonna shoot as it's running towards you and you I don't think you're gonna be able to hold that position it's too crazy what is the bear doing when it's like making charges at him but not coming at him trying to get you to get the fuck away from its babies almost always almost always the fuck away from my babies it's almost always a woman female bear rather protect the neck oh yeah that's there there you don't fuck around some asshole that might be a hunter you might be hunting bear you might want to shoot my baby oh they don't know yeah you might just be a uh you know they don't think of humans is a good thing humans are dangerous right you know it's our fuckin day they're predators yeah I'm I'm surprised bears don't attack humans just more often based on that like how do they distinguish who's a hunter and who's not they don't think of hunters as being something they should attack they think they should get the fuck out of there because when they see guns go off and then a bowl of bullet hits a bear right next to them that bear kind of explodes mm-hm and screams in agony and falls to the ground they just want to get the fuck out of there and not have it happen to them alright so if they've seen that ever in their life they've seen a bear get shot which if you're in a places where bears get hunted it's very likely that they have seen that they just run away they smell people they run they want to get the fuck out so bears look at humans like predators only in places where people hunt bears all right the problem is when people don't hunt bears bears have zero fear of humans and then bears one of killing people all right this is what you see in Yellowstone because those bears are grizzly bears and the only place in America where you can hunt grizzly bears is in Alaska and in Alaska they have a different attitude they're starting to open up grizzly bear seasons I think there was one that we're trying to do in Wyoming and there might have been one somewhere else where they were trying to do they do it in Canada but they recently banned it in British Columbia and the reason why they banned it is not because the people that live near the grizzly bears they're encouraging it because these things are fairies coming today and dangerous it's the people that live in the cities or the most people like this the biggest population center in British Columbia is Vancouver right it's all urban so that's the giant mass of people but the people that live like where my friend Mike Hawk Ridge lives those people don't have a say and those are the ones who live with bears right they have wolves and bears all over the place up there and the black bears which you can hunt and those are not even dangerous I mean they're dangerous but not dangerous compared to Grizzlies all right frisbees are fucking dangerous those are girls in those cities making those decisions can be even conservative people that are animal lovers and just don't understand what a bear is all right they're not kill I mean the ideas that they stop trophy hunting because you see like Cecil the lion that kind of shit max disgusting and it is it is a lot in a lot of ways like wanting to go and just shoot these things just to stuff them and put them on your walls there's a lot of weird shit to death but I totally understand your feelings on it I get it but the grizzly bear things a different thing those are the people that were raised on the cartoon and they're like hmm stop killing these cartoons yeah the cartoon version of the animal that they saw growing up so they I have no idea well even in Africa the exact area where Cecil the lion was killed they had a recently killed 200 lions because they're lions yet because so many Lions had survived because there was no hunting they came back they came back up so weird it's not good it's not ideal situations not ideal because it's so so bizarre and twisted the animals survive because people pay to kill them that's what the African wildlife model in these encaged areas is so they have like 10,000 acres or some shit like that they put it in fences right and then inside those fences you have zebras and giraffes and all these different animals and you can come over there and pay and you can go and hunt these animals that's that's a lot of the area so this guy who that Cecil guy who shot that lion he paid like fifty thousand dollars to go and hunt a lion and there's probably one a day to a day three a day so those hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue coming in this revenue comes in for these guys that want to kill lions and what they do is they use it to raise more lions and they use it to pay hunting these people call professional hunters are basically game wardens to keep out poachers and to make sure that these animals don't get like rhinos don't get their horns chopped off and murdered just just for their horns things you know elephants for their tusks things along those lines so they need to hire people to protect against poaching because look in Africa there's a lot of people that especially in these areas where they have these hunting these vast rural areas people are extremely poor right and they want animals to just to eat they're gonna call that poaching and they have to put so then it gets even squirrely there it's not it's not an ideal situation by any stretch of the imagination but because no hunters were coming in now because of all the bad press after the Cecil the lion shed they had to kill 200 lions because that many cook that many like got born and yeah open because they have a real unnatural situation over there alright well they're breeding these lions and then they put them in like it's um every place does it a different way and some places are free-range where there's no fence at all that is true there's some places are like that all right but some places it's all fenced in the whole thing's fenced in it's like as like a fake Wow yeah yeah it's they took the wild and they made it fake I just put a fence around the wild and then they kept introducing food and then they have lions that they keep in very specific areas and they feed them and then they'll transport them to the middle and then the hunter comes that day and they tell them where the lion is boom shoots the lion and poses with the lion it's perverse yeah it's kind of banana perverse yeah on the other hand these animals that are in there particularly the antelopes and blackbucks and not not nilgai and all these crazy wild fucking antlered creatures they're in greater numbers than they've ever been so it's so twisted it's like the numbers are so high because people want to come in and pay to hunt them right but then the numbers are high so people can hunt them it's not like so that they can keep the whole wildlife ecology free in Rome and look how vibrant Africa is now that we've stepped in with all these conservation dollars not really no it's fenced in and then people drive up to a spot get out boom take a picture it's weird we fuck up everything great job it's weird great job people yeah we're the best I'm reading an explanation of a person that has gone to this Park in Zimbabwe to go see the Lions and they've done this in the past and they went back more recently and this is hilarious read this thing here then our host gave us our safety orientation he told us to speak to the Lions in a calm voice approach slowly and to pet them on their backs only then our host handed out skinny sticks to each of us he explained that if a lion approached us in a threatening manner we should switch the stick back and forth in the grass distract them what there's a Jesus Christ this is that they thought they were gonna go see like child baby get cubs okay definitely not they're like 18 months old almost you know a little bit older they're probably sure they're adolescent yeah like this big I saw this video like there's a tribal or what part of Africa but like if a cheater or like a like a cat like hunts down an animal and kills it like these these these people from this tribe like they track the hunt and then once the animal or the cat kills the food then they'll scare off the cat I saw them take it and then it stinks and they have these little sticks yeah and then the fucking cheetahs and whatever run away from him and I'm like it's so crazy I saw that I watched a video of that I'm on someone's Instagram yeah well you gotta do what you gotta do when you're hungry yeah you take a chance and then I mean unless they have a really good weapon it's hard to get an antelope you got to get fucking close all right but a cheetah can just chase it down if I'm a you would think it's it's just crazy that a human could take a cheetahs food yeah it is crazy yeah they do with lions too yeah they do with Spears they run up on Lions with Spears I've seen that too like a female lions just roaring at people where they drag away their food there's Robin a lion lion she goes back to her to the to the house and the husband's I where's the food I got robbed well what we do here in cities is so recent and so unnatural it's not like anything that anybody else has ever done before in terms of like human beings up until about ten thousand years ago and he's never been shit like this supermarkets and stuff like that yeah yeah hold it and no interaction at all with nature all right you know our interaction with nature is reserved to you know squirrels fucking pigeons and shit Birds yeah having a dog even fucking pigeons are weird they brought over here is food no they were yeah and they're everywhere you could kill you could eat pigeons they're delicious I never had one I don't think a lot of people like they look at they just don't look at pigeons as food no yeah most people yeah 99% they have pigeon seasons actually maybe they don't have a season pigeons might be like wild pigs where they're like they're considered invasive species mm-hmm they're not supposed to be here they're not from here they brought them over here for squab you ever heard of like squab when people eat squab no squab is like a fancy word for a young pigeon all right it's like lamb lamb is a fancy word for a young sheep how does a pigeon taste you had it never had I never have I said had it no I had squirrel house that is if someone told me it was chicken I would believe him no fur around yeah tastes a lot like that which is a the most cliche shit to say about taste how chicken how do you know if you catch a squirrel if it's rabbit on that if you cook it you don't catch anything Oh will you soon that's a good question I don't know the answer to that maybe rabies would die at a certain temperature yeah squirrels are not well ground squirrels I was gonna say squirrels are not omnivores they're herbivores but ground squirrels I'm pretty sure I eat meat because I've seen videos of ground squirrels eating a mouse all right Dan locked up it seems wrong anything eating a mouse is wrong like when you feed a mouse to a snake or some shit like that well it's even more wrong because it's holding in its hands dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated and kept under observation for 45 days Oh what if the oh can you get rabies from eating squirrel small mammals such as squirrels rats mice hamsters guinea pigs gerbils Chipmunks rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies okay and have not been known to cause rabies amongst humans the United States okay so rats can't give you rabies that's interesting rat Eaton's about to go up good Joe biting the head off of her rat it's fucking nasty what was biting the hand of a right guy a gun man we're an Asian man I don't chew in the whole fucking thing it like right off an episode of fear factor said it was it was wrong that's funny I think it was dead and you didn't see it moving before but it was funny you would have been able to do fear factor in certain countries there to be like where's the fear right didn't like where is it well we eat that I got a lot of friends at our Filipino especially back in when I was doing fear factor so I was playing a lot of pool some of the best pool players are Filipinos it's huge indoor pool with pool rather but they were laughing at me because they serve believe they're like we love balut dude is this weird duck embryo it's like a delicate but people on fear factor were terrified of it and these people like no we pay for that right we like it yeah it's great okay look at those people wasting the balut you know whatever it is they the beak in everything man but is weird it's an embryo it's like a little it's like a little baby duck it's very strange I wonder if you'd even be able to do fear factor today I mean I know Ludacris is still doing it but they're doing a different kind of version of it right have you watched one of those episodes just didn't check it out no no that's like watching your ex-girlfriend get bangs bang badly would you want to swatch her get burned badly seal I was better that's it's weird to take over someones gig because if someone did it for so long they had a certain style and how they did it please pimp my mafia factor Ludacris right when like when who did pimp my ride that was a what's his name it's right yeah whatever happened to that dude yeah he was the pimp my ride guy yeah there's a huge show how the fuck did that show go away that's you know I know that feels like yeah it feels like that could be over yeah yeah yeah it's like one of them of pawnshop shows they never have to end yeah just keep punished yeah do it in different countries yeah yeah yeah why why would the end pit maybe exhibit was like done I can't deal with these people in their cars anymore they're making all these other shows there's tons of car shows now and all those other channels pimping shit yeah but that's the best name oh yeah pimp my ride that's the best name most of those are undriveable y-yeah I've there's been a lot of like reddit they for people like asking for like have you ever been up hit my ride tell us about your experience or whatever and like they did so much shit to those cars that would be like hey by the way when this is over go ahead and take half that shit out so you can legally drive it down the fucking freeway if you would have every time but some of the times had to do that if you had one of the names cars now from pimp my ride would be a huge collector's item should be like worth a lot of money if you still kept it I think they started bringing it back but yeah I'm series an article what really happened in the Carson pit my ride I remember deaf remember a couple the guys said that they had to stay in contact with a few of their like in-house mechanics because they had to keep getting something fix right I believe that like they had to constantly drive back to Hollywood or wherever the fuck it was right that make sense he's trying to find well a lot of those shows like my buddy bud who's been on the podcast before he used to have that show fuck what was it called was that show where they would steal someone's car and rebuild they would meant to make them think their their car was stolen I can't remember his fucking show god damn it it was Chip Foose Chip Foose would would redesign their car and they would get this fucking amazing car what the fuck was the name of that show but uh but Brett's Minh he used to have the show rides that was a show where they built my 1970 barracuda overhaul overhaul and that's it that's a shout-out to bud and Adrian who was the host they would take a car and they'd they do it in like a really short amount of time mm-hmm and then after it was over they would have to like tighten it all up and when they do it build a car they have a shakedown period where like they'd drive it for a few hundred miles to make sure there's nothing goes wrong everything's working right there's like this period of time to make sure that everything's dialed in right they don't get a chance to do that in a week right so that's probably what they're talking about yeah the September I think I'm reading through it like some of the contestants said they had to dumb up like they had to completely just play the game of this is a TV show exaggerated let's dump a bunch of cigarette butts in your car to make it look shittier than it is hey when we show it to you please be fucking happy when you see this we can have a good like reaction for TV kind of thing that's disappointing yeah goddamnit my rod that's every show though yeah that's ever show any like like HGTV shows oh yeah or just hoarders yeah like we're gonna have to hold your place up even more probably right yeah like like Preppers those people prepper might make them extra crazy I haven't seen purpose what's that about people were prepping for the apocalypse oh yeah we know you're crazy but we're gonna make you look even crazier even down even crazier yeah or intervention you know what's interesting to me it's typically right-wing people who are in favor of like if you think about any time someone passes a law that's bad for the environment right if they want to drill in Alaska if they want to do something over so it's usually I mean it's might be generalizing but usually thought to be a right-wing thing right right it's like more concern for business than concern for the environment right people that are on the left are the people that are always like the tree huggers those are the environmental so the people that are like radical environmentalists you would almost always think of as being people on the Left right but the people that are prepping for shit going south are almost always on the right mmm the right wing people are the ones are prepping the world yeah so those are the ones carrying bullets and they're fucking digging tunnels in their backyard you know what you're doing you know you're destroying the earth by digging for oil and all that shit it's not them it's usually the bigwigs right right the big but they're voting and they're in favor of all those decisions that the bigwigs yes make inadvertently because the bigwigs have connected themselves to Jesus all right that's what they did that's what the the wise thing they did good fat old fashioned Family Values and Jesus they figured a way to connect it to a thing that everybody can't argue against all right the connected right-wing ideology with God and left-wing with a portion killing babies right the lion The Sands been drawn Ian if you're prepping for the end of the world right you gotta secretly be hoping for the end of the world maybe a little bit of end because did you try your shit yeah just to try your shit and to say I wasn't crazy right and wasting my time so you got to kind of be rooting for the end of the world like you don't want to you know do all that shit in vain right you know what I mean so that's kind of a weird Ness to those type of people that's a good point you know me like you started doing comedy and there's people like you're never gonna make it you want to make it to be like you are wrong and to just the relief of knowing you were right well I think that's a problem with cops I think cops want to shoot people sometimes you have a gun and they almost want someone to do something fucked up so they can chew them not every cop not everything not every cop right but there are certain people that should not be cops right sorry those people that become cops and it does happen and we all know and I'm not 100% supporter of law enforcement but even law enforcement they know it they don't want to be surrounded by some weak fuck who's also a cop who wants to shoot people alright there's people out there that want to shoot people and you give him a gun if you give someone a hammer everything looks like a nail it's amazing yeah I remember the video and this was a white cop shooting a white guy there was only one I think was that in the hotel yeah that guy that guy's like how did he become a cop how did he not go to jail yes they let him off the hook for that one they always kind of let them off the hook they'll give him a slap on the wrist and just get them out of here in the instructions he was given this guy was telling him to keep your hands away from your waist cuz his pants were falling yeah and the guy was saying that to him too yeah and he's just crying and crawling towards him like helplessly the guy reaches because his pants fell down and grabs ahold of his pants to pull him up like that fills his back up with bullets him shoots him in the back on the floor crawling you guys of no threat was yelling making the situation even more chaotic he's also telling the guy to do something and why are you making a move tell him to lie down yes his hands behind his back you handcuff him and then not he was ordering the guy to crawl towards him yeah it doesn't even make sense did you see this video earlier this week this is from July 1st yes yeah the guys are crazy this is crazy this is what's called suicide-by-cop this guy was coming towards this cop screaming with a knife and the cop was begging him to please stop please stop this is after they already shot up yeah I mean I know but meanwhile he wants up tackling this fucking guy this is crazy this guy's already been shot and he turns on this cop and tackles him right here taxes him look at this the guy's filled with bullets and the guy's reaching for his ghost he gets his back and he takes him down he does not the knife anymore does he yeah I don't know I can't tell what did you see the video of the black cop walking towards a guy with the machete yes I did see that and he just like walked right into it this Perry dand flipped him over yeah yeah that is crazy I saw another one that Eddie Bravo sent me of a was not a cop 1 but do two dudes are having a conversation this guy's got his hand behind the back and he pulls a knife out of his pocket and the guy doesn't even see and he just in the middle of the conversation just sticks him in the stomach and the guys standing there he moves back and he's like holding his stomach you can't believe it and the guy comes towards him again follows him and the guy who got stabbed ones up knocking the dude out you know coming towards him with the knife again saying I'll stab you again the guy hits him on the left hook rocks him and then hits him on the right hand and knocks him out these were regular dudes regular dudes looks like regular dudes but the dude who got stabbed knew how to fight luckily for him but he still might die take a stab in the stomach that is fucking very dangerous man very dangerous yeah what are we talking about what are you doing find a video that guy getting stabbed that was not so much this just saw a lot of shit so much to just freak you out I don't even look at some of the bad stuff anymore a lot of it yeah like like I saw doctor beginning of that video when it came out like last week I I'm watching this I turned it off yeah you can't watch that yeah there's so many videos you'll get convinced that that's happening everywhere in the world four hours a day it'll fuck your head up yeah exactly yeah yeah it's easy to get freaked out yeah I mean there's a lot of free Keable shit out there there is this is as good a spot as I need to talk about this we I want to make sure I clarify something because there was some there was an operation this is a guy who was a billionaire diamond guy who wound up getting a dick enlargement operation and he died because the anesthesia and it was in another country and we pulled out we were saying somehow or another it got connected to this company that does that in the United States it had nothing phenom phenomenal I had said like he was getting a similar surgery and that this one that one only the pannu my only happens in the US but he was getting something done in Europe so it was like different well they reached out to me to explain first of all the guy died from anesthesia you can get in you could die from anesthesia from any operation had nothing to do with the the penis enlargement operation to use the more correct term dick enlargement but he didn't die from that and that's just as safe as getting your nose fixed or getting your knee meniscus operated on right it's just them any surgery where you have anesthesia carries a certain amount of risk but apparently this dick thing works they actually can grow your dick bigger now well if you were risking your life like I don't work well you're risking your life if you go to the dentist yeah I don't know what you wonder like anytime you get put under right if you if you if you anything you're doing with anesthesia there's a very small chance that something could go wrong but nothing to do with this dick operation so I just wanted to make sure that people know that if you look this up I don't want anything any incorrect assumptions to be out there and I carry no ill-will towards us these people that make this it apparently it works I just want everybody to know that it carry no ill-will towards this company that makes dicks bigger apparently it actually it's a weird thing right like for a man to do that there's certain taboos that are involved in even admitting that you have an issue like a little dick is a weird thing right because it's one of the rare things that's unfortunate that you can make fun of right like you can't make fun of a little person all right like if you make fun of a person who's us you know you're not supposed to call the midgets all right let's call them little people right you make fun of a person who's a dwarf or a little person you're a cruel person right but if you make fun of a guy with a little dick sometimes we deserve zit or some shit that's a weird thing that women are allowed to do like you're allowed to make fun of dudes having little dicks we should there should be something in the same vein yes to protect little world world world from cruelty but because if you have a little pussy that's fantastic yeah but he's excited we're not crazy weird situation but a big dick is a sign of virility right so we salute you Ponemah that's the name of the company we salute you for helping men live larger dicks yeah and I almost died from anesthesia one time I thought you were gonna say from a dick and life when I was like a teenager and here's the irony I was going in for an operation that you're supposed to go in in the morning and leave in the afternoon oh it's just a quick thing and then it was literally for a circumcision I was like you were getting a circumcision yeah what were you doing I just had sex with this girl like I was a kid like seven like say 18 and and somehow it pulled the skin of my dick back I couldn't get it back to clean it I couldn't get the skin back right over so then I spent like an entire night with like a roar boner with no skin cover night so I went to the doctor then he got it back over and he said you should get a circle decision so one time operation is going and you'll have to worry about this shit happening again but it only happen once right yeah but you were furiously beating off though right no no I just pull the skin clean to clean it yeah yeah officer I was cleaning the gun shot my neighbor no it's clean it if there was shit under there yeah so then I went in and they gave me anesthesia and then when I woke up there was like a hose down my throat and people were frantic around me and it was like nighttime is way past the time I was supposed to come back come too and the the anesthesia gave me pneumonia ended up spending like two one-and-a-half to two weeks in the hospital and the first few days was in intensive care oh yeah Wow the anesthesia did not like wake up holy shit yeah you almost died getting your dick operated on yeah just I was almost that guy and but for the most part listen you talking to someone who's had a bunch of surgeries mm-hmm I've had my nose fixed I've had my arm broken my hands I've had my knees operated on three times I've had three knee surgeries I've been put under quite a few times it's mostly safe yeah it's really about the anesthesiologist hey Jamie just somebody at the door try to try to figure out okay why is he doing that wandering around like he's got a plan a chair that must be hanging out up there today I don't know people weird man you never know you know when you get an uber do you know that they how much background do they do on uber so let's try to explain them you're asking the other day I was like to get the like approval on your app to be like yes this car can drive uber is one thing but once you have that anybody you know can be behind that they don't like scan your face when you're in the car every time or anything like that just yeah I got the uber bro use it you know so if you and I got an uber like I conjure over it I could drive around pretend I'm you you could get caught sure but like people definitely do that all right how many people had caught driving over now not fucking long Yeah right right whoever saw that coming rideshare being it remember when you were kid nervous kid taxis who ever thought man I could have my own taxi please to have a shit called gypsy taxis and they would arrest those people yeah in New York yeah they would arrest them for trying to do the uber thing why don't they get it uber why would they be a gypsy cab I box this is before de it was a year and then I lived in New York that some insane number of gypsy cab drivers got murdered insane Oh for real it was something like 40-plus in a year got murdered so it was almost one a week they were killing gypsy cab drivers they would rob him and kill him did they ever catch that guy I don't know if it was just those people they were they were just deciding that these gypsy cab drivers I think this was you know boy we're talking like probably like 1990s 1992 or some shit like that like there was no there was no internet and there was I don't know people were paying ever with credit cards or cash it was all cash yeah so if you're a gypsy cab driver they saw you as being someone who had a wad of cash on you and then you can't report it to the police because your gypsy cab driver so you shouldn't even be doing it yeah but they would just kill him but if you're a criminal yeah it's a great crime yeah I guess it's a smart crime like I'm gonna rob somebody that shouldn't be doing what they're doing for a living so they can't really report them report to the police that I'm robbing you yeah but that was shoot'em in camera the thing is they would just shoot him in the head there's like they would be consider like maybe these people were illegals maybe these people didn't have a lot of documentation maybe when they killed them it would be a dead end because I didn't know what to do maybe they were here by themselves maybe I figured the cops don't care about they would definitely figure the cops don't care yeah and you know because it's cash and because it's not it's there's no meter all right so this is like there's no record of everything right how many do you find it in about that quickly just google that there was one I found a story for New York Times 1983 there's a weekend where 11 people were murdered but this store just has a story of one guy that was found in the front city of a gypsy cab murdered could have been a shot coulda been nice it was the 19 okay it was the 1990s it was definitely why I will move there I think I moved to New York in 91 I think I live right there from 91 I lived back and forth in 92 please rest away from 1990 a sixth cabbie is slaying in the Bronx but it's New York Times it was just a ball thing yeah this one was killed yeah I think there was a there was a long stretch where it's hard to become a big deal but it's I mean if there was 40 Wall Street guys murdered murders Italians originated the creation of pirate taxes it's kind of the article about it I ain't seen a 180 drivers since 1990 hundred 80 drivers have lost their lives while on duty in the streets which average is more than two per month wow that's crazy I don't know if it's regular canal I don't know either it might just be cab drivers but you know because gypsy cab drivers how do you prove that guy was a gypsy cab driver you just got a dead guy in a car well bullet in the back of the head all right and then you have to ask his friends was this guy gypsy cab driving maybe it was it was a certain style of car too because so that passengers could identify it as a just cab so that they could take it right and it's like if you're taking a gypsy cab you have limited amount of money and you don't want to pay a cab but you want to get to where you're going you have to be identifiable here it is cabbies risk death daily in New York jungle under siege crime hours are long in the mortality rate high so far this year 32 taxi drivers have been killed by armed robbers posing as customers yeah and I think that's just regular taxi drivers yeah that's a rough gig man yeah now when we were living in New York imagine if just now you go there it's just overs everywhere everybody Zubrin everybody's just using their phone standing out like the Comedy Store has become a fucking disaster trying to go yeah yeah that's a pain in the ass and they just pull up and block the driveway they don't give a fucking no one stops them yeah and they're just going in there left and right but just blocking everything dropping people off picking people up yeah it's never-ending you can never get in there it's weird it's like a new thing that no one saw coming what could be that like let's let's play Gary Vee here what's next what could what could we get Oh on the frontlines of someone's cooter stuff is crazy there's like a one-year pilot program I think they're calling it for Los Angeles County that's why they're more and more I've popped up I think they're just sort of saying we're gonna do a year figure it out no one's gonna be like taken down for doing this for like it they were trying to Santa Monica to get rid of them for a minute mmm the bird scooters and whatnot they've ramped it up completely there's all sorts of electronic bikes now there's at least I want to say six or seven different companies just in Hollywood where I live they're just everywhere laying all over the sidewalks but that's what they're trying to figure out is how do you leave them around where are you gonna leave them is it successful I don't know how much taxes they're paying and how like much my the city gets brought in but yeah I don't mind them but it's just dangerous walking it is I was walking down the street one day and I was about to just you know you're just walking but you just change your stride a little bit to go to the right and I almost got hit by one and it was coming fast and I'm like it's the sidewalk you know what I mean like you could it could be series every problem in LA is that you're supposed to be on the street with those it says do not write these on the sidewalk but it is a hundred percent not safe to be on the streets of LA on those because people are getting run over and okay I don't know if anybody died but I like downtown LA somebody driving 50 miles an hour ran over someone on the side well are on the scooter like why the fuck you driving so fast downtown also well there's people that are crazy and hit and runs happen anyway they happen all over the place and then there's assholes you know people gonna shoot cab drivers are gonna run over scooter drivers yeah they're everywhere though it's weird to see them and they've started to ban them in certain places right some neighborhoods have tried like West Hollywood you kind of can't look anywhere but I think there's cities the West Hollywood city yeah but I mean outside of California you know other cities have said no more yeah you know Vegas you can't no fuckin way could you have them in Vegas get more drunk people right yeah oh my god drunk people on scooters drunk people on scooters and drunk people driving well your honor a hooter yeah let's fight Plus we'd now we'd yeah good was Vegas it was a good time is a good time yeah it was just fun you just had me thinking about what could be next though yeah what could be next if we didn't see scooters coming we didn't see Hoover coming what would be the next what do we what do we need what do we need we need protection from the ocean the oceans gonna rise up and take us it's good we're mounting the IceCaps gonna fucking we're gonna have to move to Tucson boats they're making more subways here right now use those for the 2090 yeah we're gonna throw our shit down those tubes like I wonder man I mean there was some shit that I was reading today about the ice caps melting at an accelerated rate it's always it's never good news whenever that it's like ice cap melting news like hey and we just found out we actually have more ice than we thought we're good all right don't worry about it does that mean Vegas can get water now no Vegas gets their water figure they figured out there's so much money in Vegas they just steal it what do they get it you're from a hole in the ground no idea is there a well out there all I know they got good water pressure in every hotel I've ever been in it's wonderful yeah look that's a human ingenuity and they building more shit yeah and if the ice caps do melt it'll just bring it closer to Vegas all right Vegas to use it yeah the water would be like real close yeah I mean we just move inside to the middle like this is what people have been doing forever this idea that you're supposed to be able to keep your fucking house on the water in Santa Monica nice and crazy decided build a house where the beach is your front yard that is so nuts you think those cliffs were always there it was different decades before so keep on thinking is gonna be like that all the time yeah if you buy like a seaside house in like Marina del Rey or someone really nice you're getting making a gamble like over the next I'm only gonna be alive for 40 more years right over those years I'm gonna let's let's hope all right that this water stays over there exactly stays put let's hope Mother Nature yeah that was what I wanted to do yeah I just I'm gonna spend seven million dollars in this fucking house with literally no backyard it's just ocean was gonna hope it stays like this I just can't wait till my crib becomes beachfront property and then I could sell it I've rented a beach house a couple of years ago when my kitchen I was getting my kitchen fixed and we rented this house in Malibu on the water it was beautiful man you would wake up you eat breakfast then just be sitting there staring out over the water and the water would literally come almost underneath the balcony so it looked like you were sitting in water right you were floating and while you're on a boat I was like wow this is so beautiful so it makes you feel so good yeah it does be about ocean but what a gamble yeah even though it's the that's like you sound like that's the ultimate infinity pool yeah you know I'm saying good yeah I don't mind like la jolla you have the condo right by the beach and then and you go to sleep at night you could hear the ocean your way home but then I'll be like what if it's this is the night this is the night where your noms in here just takes the building down and rushes it out there mountains I mean that's happened so many times in history yeah all it takes is a earthquake or an asteroid hits the ocean oh yeah oh my god if an asteroid hit the ocean we wouldn't even be safe here we wouldn't be safe we'd probably wouldn't be safe in Arizona it would go deep in Arizona asteroid hit the fucking ocean just outside of Malibu mmm just a big one everybody in the Midwest be laughs and they'd be laughing all right say we had the best property all the time yeah so we had to duck hurricanes mm-hmm they have the scariest shit I think tornadoes are the scarier shit yeah those things are so random and they happen every year right every year it's not like earthquakes happen every year a hurricane you can track you know it's coming you can prepare yeah you could just leave a tornado it's just like did you show up hey man I'm here yeah there that's the scariest yeah but that's just something that people deal with when they you see they wipe out entire towns yeah they wipe they take towns off the map I feel like they just always aim for these small towns well I think it has to do with uh with agriculture if I'm right I think it has to do with like flat areas and the type of weather that they have and I don't think they take place in areas where there's a lot of trees and forests mmm is that true it's more like they don't really happen in cities right as the heat structure and it creates like a before the pressure air pressure starts it's a hot cold air pressure system that kind of starts worse so because of the artificial concrete yeah although stuff that's why tornadoes almost protect above it does happen in cities from time to time more like on the outskirts but like it's very rare to see one roll through a downtown but does one ever go through like Colorado yeah I'm the man looking one up right here so as you're saying trees I got a video of one like just ripping trees up in Texas so like mmm but it does mostly - for sure on flat land Texas Azzam yeah yeah well Texas and Texas is a lot of crazy wind but so close to Oklahoma Oklahoma is like tornado alley no I swear around there there was one that was on TV that was mad it was hitting this area where they had these oil trucks and it was carrying these semi trucks in the air I don't know if there were oil trucks no semis like you can't like it's you know like a 16-wheeler like fucking truck in like that it was flying in a circle in the sky like a fucking newspaper you know a page from a newspaper gets caught in the wind I was flying around this this fucking tornado was carrying trucks like that hmm that's mostly new stuff yeah but there's a video of the El that's it right there that's the video this is a video what you see look at this y-you see the trucks as they get closer you can see inside the fucking thing that is a truck flying in a circle if this is the same video I don't know if that's it after no that's that's the same way after I lands I mean that might not have even been it but it was one where there's probably so many fucking tornado of it yes but it was one where these trucks were literally flying around in a circle like it was carrying this gigantic semi and just floating it in the air like a paper airplane was it from twister though was it some fake foot no no no it was real it was real some news footage from television seems like then it's hard to catch that because all these are just already on the ground yeah no it wasn't from a distance but there was some news footage anyway just speaking around but even that was special oh yeah coming out Friday at midnight on Comedy Central oh shit why did you decide to do it in that style it's kind of interesting you did like a TED talk because there's so many specials out there and I get to do my material when I do it that way but add a little twist and an extra layer to it and that'll make people be more interested in it than if I was just gonna do it like just a regular stand up that's why you clever bastard lives once in a while I got an idea you know saying and you got the microphone on a regular microphone just sitting on the stool in case you change your mind well the last bit I use the mic you noticed that yeah yeah yeah the last bit I do with the mic what is in your hand the clicker because because screen like just like a TED talk any talk you click thing picture represents what you're talking about and then you keep on going I I've seen people do that before mm-hmm with with with TED talks and I've always thought that would be a good thing with calm oh yeah yeah because like even you look at your stand-up you take on a topic you dissect it yeah and you give people an alternate view of that topic just like a Tech Talk and then you move on to the next one so like comics like you and me and other people it's a perfect format for our stand-up yeah are you doing that when you do when you headline we do headline kick no no maybe you should maybe I thought about doing that all right yeah you did yeah I did about it at one point in time but I'm too lazy yeah yeah I don't have merch or anything so I don't bring a merch I don't want to have to make sure they have a screen or transport one and all that shit and that's jenna gets cumbersome well I heard the Kevin Hart at one point Tom had pyrotechnics like Hewitt hit a punch line 20-foot tall flames shoot through the sky in arenas I'm like man that's when that's you you add to the standup right it's like props but way better right like I feel like props are the rare one of the rare things where you can't do many more because Carrot Top owns that whereas when I was a kid man there was prop comedian yeah there was a lot of them right Jamie you don't know about my yeah yeah I remember a lot of ventriloquist's and some people that were doing little prop things but yet no one really had that truck full of David be the comic that show up to the mic yeah with a briefcase yeah and then afterwards he has to gather stuff like a stripper yeah duffle bag yeah it was a guy that was he was really funny man a guy in Boston they used to do that he's like I'm blanking on his name but he had glasses and he had a real similar kind of act but it was kind of like science-based he had a bunch of weird shit that he would know where Alex's Irby nope okay no it was a long time ago you ever seen chips Cooney chips Cooney I've heard the name yeah he had props but he he was a fake magician really so like remember the name of that Tupperware that's right that's expanded yeah like that was one of his fish all gooey but he was funny like you know and then pull it out that's the trick and this keep going on to the next goofy thing there was a guy named Lenny Schultz and he Harbor but never crazy Lenny uh-huh yeah he had a bunch of props here I watched Steve Burns documentary on the amazing Jonathan that he just put out is really good was it yeah I liked as a younger kid I loved I liked him just because of his zany crazy right shit he did but watching the documentary was awesome so job doing that what is it yes shout out Steve burn what is it basically about he lived in excess yeah it's definitely about that sort of like his rise and maybe I would say fall but then sort of how he came back and was died so long - about this fan that became his manager and sort of he helped him and guide it to him along and apprenticed him a little bit and just about the relationship and footage together it was just interesting is there interesting guy Wow yeah those guys from the fucking 80s went hard man that was the Kinison era you know yeah if you wanted to be a wild man you have missing cord yeah coca-cola's snort coke on stage he's just like make a joke about it it's supposed to be fake hope he's really ruin it Oh like a lot so he made a bit yeah huh that was not a prop that's a real shit yeah I bet people have done a lot of Weasley shit like that like just put something into their act they'll pull something off you know like I would think okay it's a one of the cool things about comedy is also one of the weirder things that it's so open-ended the club just like you get booked to the Brea improv right right you show up like what's up being how are you meant you know and you're like hey there's my opening act they shake hands everybody's cool they don't even ask you what you're gonna talk about right they got everybody sitting there people paid money they've sold tickets they sold drinks and they have not a clue as to what you're gonna discuss and you just go up there and say whatever the fuck you want America loved it crazy yeah what a weird way to make a livin and then you do the same thing for like a TV show or something you have to type it out yeah send it to them I gotta look at it that's a beautiful thing with Netflix Netflix didn't say shit they just say hey we want to do we want to do a special with you I said great all right let's do it I said okay let's do it it was that easy thing we did and they said okay great you did it we'd like it put it up boom I had to send Comedy Central a proof of concept yeah I got to shoot the set like in a small club sent it to them and they're like alright okay yeah well the good news is they proved rights on TV and a special is always in my opinion really just an advertisement to get people to come see you right exactly live right so I'm glad the advertisements out oh yeah this is me too I've said it before I'll say it again why are you here you won the best comics in the world the shore listen I so many times people come up to me Rogan was talking about you like how don't you have to be on the show like Rogen is talking about you and so like people will come up come to a show because you just spoke about me let's go man you and I've been friends for 20 what 28 years shit something crazy yeah it's a long fucking time but you've always been one of the best comics in the world you know and I thank you too brother your new shit man oh yeah you're doing it's not even special yeah I was crying this weekend it's that new thing that I won't say god damn it's good it's really good man I love that you know I love the transition between when someone does a special to writing and working on new stuff yes and you just get this new angles and and having to write shit it's like I've been trying to tell this to Bobby Lee who's another God and is one of the best comics in the world and I'm a fucking shame that Bobby Lee doesn't have a special and he doesn't you know it's like his thing is like we know now I won't be able to use that matte material exactly like yeah but you'll write better stuff you'll be forced to I think he's shooting a special oh yes he's talking about it yeah cuz he's DEA he asked me who directed mine Simon is Bobby about to shoot is special but he'll see how what you've seen and what I'm seeing now that how great it is to like come up with a new set of material which is very terrifying yeah I've had some of some amazing mediocre Sif's Jesus I feel bad I know when you just first trot out new stuff it's like you don't know yeah you just don't know and then you said something the other day when was in Vegas he was talking to Ali like we're all in the back after the show about how you had a joke that was new it was working you wrote it it's new he's working and then you broke it by over fixing it yeah then you had to take shit back out and that's happened to me during this new set of material to I started the joke created it and then broke it by overdoing stuff to it and then I have to like figure out what part that I put in there that threw it off and take it out and fix it back well it's always interesting to talk to someone that's really just a few years in the comedy because then you gotta go over your own process and think about it well yeah yeah the one of the things that happens in jujitsu is in jujitsu you get better when you teach it's real strange like a lot of guys that wind up getting a job teaching jujitsu to like beginners their jujitsu jumps that jumps up several notches it's really interesting and I think sometimes that happens would calm me so when we're dealing with something like a leash I'll tally makovski yeah our friend Ali she's only been doing comedy for what four years somewhere for five years and she's just coming into her own and she's what was she twenty-two all right twenty-two twenty-three twenty-two or twenty-three very funny very promising and she was gonna come down and watch us she came to San Diego and to watch when Tony and Andrew and I did that of that giant Arena down there because she's because she opens up for me all the time at the improv an economy store she's getting to be around all these assassins and she's getting to see it from the outside but that was her first time opening right and I was like it's cuz she said she was gonna come down to watch this did you want to do a set and she's like I was he really hoping so she opened she did 10 minutes in front of you know it's like 1,200 people it's a lot of people right for her first big show in Vegas on Friday night she murdered actually they're good she did great yeah super relaxed and but when you're talking to someone who's up-and-coming like that I love that I love it I love talking to like hey soos hey Sue's trio or like you know Frank Castillo or any of these young guys coming up because you get a chance to talk to them about how you formulate stuff and compare notes and sometimes they have interesting ways that they do ever considered you know and sometimes people have interesting ways of thinking about their materiality to think about I'm gonna go walk their dog they'll play their set in their ear or they'll you know when they go on hikes they'll just go on a hike and think about one joke and try to work the joke out while they're liking you gotta find out yeah I've learned a lot from like talking to younger comics too so I get that completely you also the the thing that's happening to you right now is the thing that happens to them except the fact that you're far more skilled at it it's like they're trying to put together an act but you've already done it many many times you've already put out specials and records so that when you're doing this it's like you know how to write jokes you're always writing nutrients you've been doing comedy forever but it's still you're starting from jump yeah when you start from zero from Ground Zero and then you try to put together an act that you hope people want to pay to see terrifying yeah and then there was a part of it in this new set of material that I was doing wrong like like just the style of joke that I was right and and I just felt off like even when somebody bits were working and then I was in Atlanta a few weeks ago and then it just hit me what I was doing wrong I was the Laughing Skull yeah I was gonna laughing slow-ass yeah it's a dope-ass club it's helped little real and it's a great room to go headline and when you're like got new material need to just work out yeah I say about those rooms like the belly room and like the Laughing Skull like that's where you find out what's bullshit yeah and I found out what was pusher sometimes you can like song and dance your way through it we hundred-seat room trick them like enough people start laughing together other people laughing but and then you'll kind of go along with it and with your delivery and you can kind of make funny out of it but no momentum with 70 people yeah you have to like really make them laugh it's got to be real yeah with 70 people mm-hmm you got you know I did Jeremiah Watkins show stand-up on the spot on Tuesday that's the best example that because you're also there yelling out subjects all right you know and so you just get to and you find out and find and but that also like constructing a new set what's interesting about it is that you get a chance to figure something out and make it real what like Bobby Lee is doing right now is working with tried-and-true material mm-hmm tried and proven he kills every night knows it's gonna kill if it didn't kill he be stunned right he'd be like what is my shit I've been killing with this for four years he knows what he's doing yeah he's just a funny machine so if I don't know how to describe it just is it's just him it's just a funny a nice fucking yeah so funny and people don't not enough people know because most people know them from podcast and that helps for sure and from television shows that helps for sure right but there needs to be something people could see of his stand-up yeah so we're we're getting them he's listening it's like he's a slow but he'll listen right the take a little time he listens getting in there it's getting in there too good yeah it's too good the other ones Owen Smith yeah yes Owen Smith good yeah too good has his own style fucking funny he's murdered yeah man he's a top-flight headliner not like a good headliner like a top of the food chain headline yeah like if someone told me Owen Smith was selling out arenas I'd be like good shit been happening long time exactly yes you know I'm and as much as Kevin Hart or fucking fill in the blank whoever can sellout giant ass places Oh in Smith's material is as good as it gets in those places 100% yeah 100% and sometimes these guys they just don't do they don't do enough road work or they don't do know they got writing jobs or something takes them off the path where people don't necessarily see they do a lot of acting yeah that's all different little paths that kind of deviate you away from from stand-up right and I think I went knocked went down that path when I was on fear factor oh yeah no was on fear factor I didn't really tour much you know it's mostly just being around LA because it was filming so much right film so many episodes and you guys traveled a lot to different places yeah yeah I said is exhausting man exhausting yeah and it was exhausting too because he'd be filming all day be out in the heat mm-hmm and then you would come back and you know after that I would do stand-up at night and I'm just like I'm just gonna just do the store and then go home right I wasn't gonna travel anywhere I did a little bit but not much so it's like things can be good where it's like it's great to have a good gig all right but things those things can be bad cuz it ultimately takes you away from your stand-up yeah man Louie CK said that to me once he was in the period after he stopped doing his show yeah just stopped doing it for awhile and I said I haven't done anything other than standing up for a year and I said what wouldn't what made you do that he was I just wanted to really concentrate on stand-up he said I don't think you could be at your best while you do other things right he goes I think you could be good but I think at your best you really have to just do stand-up yeah I think he's right no he's right even if you don't do much in that day and if you just write one line or one tag or something mm-hmm as this it just counts so much towards the whole thing and by the end of the year where you where you end up is gonna be way further than you would have been I think it's not an even formula though because I do think that there's some value in taking some time and doing things as well right there's like take there's value in like vacations yeah this value and experiences yeah and then there's also you have to do a lot of stand-up this is like both things are true because if you only do stand-up one of the things that does happen is guys lose their point of references all right because their whole life revolves around traveling so you get a lot of airplane jokes right and it revolves around drinking because people drink at clubs and you don't have enough experiences yeah you got to live a little yes yes to put it on the paper yeah I think that's that's something that gets missed but it's like it's not a perfect formula it's also like how much enthusiasm do you have like sometimes the more enthusiasm like it when you have you feel good about it when you take time off and it makes you better right you just have to know it's just like an athlete like like in England the soccer season is over right so the soccer players go on vacation but while they're on vacation you got to get in a month or so you got to get back to training in a month or so but you can't go back to camp out of shape so there's a point where you have to be with a trainer while you're kind of off for the season getting in shape so that when you go to camp you're not out of shape and you're losing your spot on it it's just this is a delicate balance of everything yeah that makes sense we're also so insanely competitive right and there's so many people lined up but you take your spot yeah you can't get fat when you're on vacation it's always comedies like when you shoot a special and then the guy that couldn't follow you it's killing because he still has his material that he's been had and you're like not doing as good because you're working on shit it kind of it kind of fucks with me a little bit yeah yeah you know what I mean just a competitiveness offshore and then I say hey man this is just the natural order of things just keep doing what you're doing and and everything is gonna be fine you figure it out you're growing again nothing wrong with that whenever new bits come to life and they start to really work I go okay it's just trust in the process yes what happens you trust the process keep grinding mm-hmm but you have to do that if there's no if you don't put in that time if you just decide oh I need a new act but you don't work on it I'm not gonna just show up let's see you have to you have to make that that process is a real thing right and there's gonna be some sets just a man yeah yeah you take one old joke go on stage yeah and this butter it add to it but one thing that's true for sure for me scent when someone like you is writing new stuff and that new stuff kills like last weekend that makes me excited about writing new shit I go home I cut there it's out there I gotta find it I gotta find the bits right there out there look you just found two giant juicy gold in San Francisco yes go dig it it's golden them in our Hills I always see you go find new material so it's always good like like we both had new shit this weekend yeah and we're enthusiastic about it and exciting about it so it it adds a different level to just going out to do a show that we would normally do we get to talk about it afterwards with the excitement of how new the material is and and how it's coming along and it just that's that's the level of fun right there you don't experience unless you're out there writing and growing yeah there's no other way around it and I think that's a metaphor for life I think the people that get stagnant in life things cuz you're not taking any chances you know anything new you're not growing yeah you got a mean and artistically with stand-up it's one of the rare art forms where you cannot do the old stuff you don't mean maybe Jim Gaffigan people want to hear hot pockets but they also want to hear our and new shit right you may be Bert Kreischer they want to hear the Machine story he says they get mad if you don't he doesn't televisions tells the machine stories to take a shirt off the mat his clothes when he starts taking his pants off and then just put them back on hey fucking pants on why are you pants on bro how dare you that's free okay that'd be his new shirt partying pants free hilarious yeah party with no pants or party and pants free party pants are pants for you yeah Bert Kreischer there you go that's an maybe new special party and pants free just you fat fuck with boxer shorts talking shit about sober October how do you want way better tidy whities go all in yeah but boxer shorts when he moves funny is dick hole will open up a little bit and get a period well how about the speeders how about Bert on stage and speedos on speedos don't seem like a comfort move all right seems like a bad decision yeah that's not someone who really wants a dick to be caressed and cradled he does it like you're punishing your deck fuck it's like you're it's like a tent in a storm and nailing it down partition it or showing it off right yeah you've got a hog yeah getting a penis enlargement by speedos yeah just put a just take your circumcised dick and pull it all the way down so it's a full erection I ran and then I put a ring a rubber ring around the base of the balls to contract all the blood or constrict all the blood yeah that's a weird thing that someone figured that out right cock rings yeah hmm how do I uh how do I stay hard here he's gotta be away put a rubber band a prettier girl yeah yikes yeah that's a one thing that if they do ever come out I used to have a bit about that if they ever come up with a pill for how to like a boner or a dick enlargement pill that actually works it'd be 30 seconds later the first dude would die of an overdose all right yeah just take one you're gonna find out how many give me a stroke yeah how's a question one Jesus Christ yeah I had a whole there was a whole sequence where women would evolve because people just are sex but the dicks would get bigger in the road would develop these flying squirrel pussies they would just jump off cliffs to get away from dudes who were chasing after them with their big dicks and shopping carts and fell there they grow wings why women growing wings just a Fed so people could mate yeah yeah if you could grow a big like have you ever watched a porn and said that's just too much yeah yeah yeah comes a certain point time we're like how big do you want your arms right yes you want a big arm or do you want to arm where the bicep touches your fingers when you go like this all right do you want that oh you can't even move that's crazy it's too big Yeah right does that mean you can never do this do anything like this now you probably can't even walk yeah you're just too heavy you probably water one everywhere you go you weigh 600 pounds and you're 5/8 how the fuck you doing that right there's a size too much you can get too much yeah I can get too much dick to get a body dysmorphia with their breasts ah yes girls go crazy like they have triple ease and they need them an F they get nuts it's crazy they don't see it like the way you're saying it that's how it happens with anorexics bodybuilders yeah yeah and it's goddamn bananas it is the dick thing is a it's a weird one right yeah that will definitely it's definitely gonna happen since women overdo it with the breast size and like you say they can't see how weird it looks yeah it's a normal thing with humans yeah have you seen those guys that inject their muscles with oil it makes their muscles swell up like balloons it looks so fake but they don't see it there its body dysmorphia yeah I think that an anorexic gets when they don't recognize that they're there look like a skeleton when was at the airport in Vegas and waiting for your pool thing there was this chick and she had like a weird but poor girl and it wasn't real and you could tell only she didn't know that it didn't look real she probably thought it looked amazing right yeah she was walking around like but never your confidence yeah at that bit yeah yeah people get strange because the butt thing is treated differently than the boob thing mmm like a woman with really large fake breasts is still hot yes but a woman with really large fake butts like come on yeah that comes off crazy yeah yes and fake lips it's another one that's crazy - yeah yeah we have rules it's weird yeah fake lips it's like what am I supposed to do just pretend this is not happening in front of me right now well it's also it fucks with your apparently we have and when we see a certain person wouldn't see people's faces we have an expectation to where things are gonna be and based on where things are all right that's all like the Fibonacci sequence like the golden ratio the way your face is designed like like Ari Shaffir if our I should figure out a tiny nose you'd be like what is wrong with your face your face is a big nose this is like how you're that style of face yeah it's supposed to come with that style of nose yeah right if it doesn't it's weird but then you look at a guy like Greg Fitzsimmons his little nose mm-hmm you know if he had always knows you like what is that nose doing on your face right crazy it's like you fuck with that when you do something to make something bigger or wider horse you know with your face you know people get tattoos and different things like suppose people start enlarging areas of their face you just like getting my hairs bigger nose is what if big ears come in the face Dumbo yours is well how about those holes where people stretch they do there are edges and they pull their fucking ear hole out to put that earring hole at the bottom make it giant yeah like a hoop that's bananas yeah like what are you doing to your ears yeah like I don't want to fuck up the chance of me not being able to hear some shit I don't think it does work it's just I'm not doing anything personally that that's close to anything that I need yeah I need this for what I need this for I'm not gonna do anything to it that might jeopardize it in any way I always feel like that about cauliflower here too mmm they go to all the years that I did you just - I don't have cauliflower here because I always worry your guards right it's like if you fuck with the shape of your ear it fucks with the way sound goes in there ah okay like take your ear and then talk go blah blah blah now put your tip the tips of your fingers on the top of your ear and then fold them down la la la la la la la it changes the way sounds are Changez sound like this helps they sound these are speakers these are bows right you know yeah you fuckin with your bow it's the shape nature figured out a shape to collect all that sound and and get it inside your ear holes yeah but when you're outside of your ears like a rock like a lot of these wrestlers and jiu-jitsu guys they have it's all calcified so that with that cauliflower Iran if you ever touched a cauliflower you know it's like a rock under the surface very calcium rock that's what it's like because the it's what it is is the break in the skin it swells up because it bleeds and then that blood calcifies and hardens and the only way to fix my friend Brett had his fixed mm-hmm Brent yeah Brent I found Brent had a fix they had to cut his ear like a fish they had a fillet and then they had to open it up and scrape out all the the hard tissue and then sew it back up together and he couldn't do jiu-jitsu forever because if he did jiu-jitsu again after the operation it would break open and start bleeding again Pam yeah I was looking for a picture where a guy gets this part I've seen people with a plug and a hole on the inner part here oh I've seen that yeah but this guy took it [Music] that definitely fucks with his hearing a hundred percent oh yeah he's got a giant gauge hole in the bottom and a medium gauge hole in the top and then big ones on his nostrils where his nostrils he has like the bottom hole where his nostrils are and then above the nostril he's got two huge holes we could see the septum he opened up the side of his nostril quarter-sized hole easily I can't say that dudes real happy I just don't see it I don't understand that look but hey hey man what are you gonna do Ian Edwards will be with me with Dave
