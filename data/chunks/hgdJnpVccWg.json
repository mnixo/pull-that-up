a young Calvin yes said we're live Lauren Callen we're live we're live we're live we are live I've been listening to radio lab on the way over here and they have a new episode out about the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs yeah holy shit man right apparently they tell me if I'm right about this before you tell me more because I want to see if I have a little knowledge there is an under like there's a very hard layer of rock that covers a large part of the earth right and that is proof that somehow there was an asteroid that hit and it got really really hot and the rock gotten that is as a morons version of the science that they clearly laid out this rock that got melted this was under the ground undeniable evidence of a rock of from the space there's a layer of the earth the crust of the earth is super hard because it got really hot after an asteroid hit everybody not then they found dinosaur bones in it yeah bro they source because I'm you know I have something called the Bible at home some people don't believe in dinosaurs do you know that right this flatter of folks dinosaurs are fake why is it that most flat earthers from my experience are generally super good at like a discipline that has nothing to do with astrophysics like jiu-jitsu like they spend a lot of time on a mat but then they have really strong political opinions about central bank's I think it's just a lack of real education and then you know you get caught up in these YouTube things that show you a secret and it's very attractive it's very attractive to look find out about some hidden stuff yeah like oh my god I can't believe they did this they hid from us the fact that the earth is flat Jesus Christ space is fake too bro space is fake satellites aren't real they're low-flying planes they're planes there constantly beaming down these information from the sky satellites are not real nuclear bombs they're not real yeah I'm not really just big bombs but then the problem is when you break your legging you have to set your bone or you get staff and you have to trust Big Pharma to cure it or you use your your iPhone and it works and you're talking to somebody and that's a big one so but why is that technology something you trust your fucking iPhone has a global positioning satellite chip and a stop chorus it links up with the fucking one that's in the sky and it tells you where you are on the map that's why your Google Maps works jesus fucking I think there are probably only five or six flat earthers no there's a lot yeah there's thousands of them well okay that was me but that really means only five or six I think the problem with all of them is that they just got married to the idea and then they're fighting it and if you fight it with someone who doesn't know what they're talking about not that I do know what I'm talking about but if you fight it with like a Sean Carroll or like a real a real science study they there's so much evidence that the earth is round and no evidence that the earth is flat it's one of those things where it's just like what are you guys doing you're chasing your tail yeah this is crazy too busy I'm busy YouTube I'm too busy for Bigfoot ideas yeah that's roughly and that might have been a real thing it was a real animal there was a creature yeah there was a real creature called Gigantopithecus it was a real animals like eight foot tall bipedal hominid it absolutely existed probably yeah a giant a giant gorilla didn't exist imagine seeing a gorilla right like Jesus Christ what the fuck is that thing six foot six hundred talking huge hairy black beast with a giant chest and enormous arms and pounds on his chest runs on all fours and you're like fucking fangs yeah when they fly through the air each other in flash Chris mash into each other and fight holy fuck man if you didn't know that was real right now and you ran into a gorilla you'd be like what the fuck and shit by the way they didn't know mountain gorillas were even a thing until the early 1900s there were legend yeah yeah when was the discovery of mountain gorillas don't they think those giant chimps in the Congo are our hybrid no they don't anymore because they have DNA they they're the only chimpanzee species or subspecies I guess you'd say that they found that has a crest on its skull like a gorilla 19:02 bro damn yeah a German explorer Captain Robert Vaughn bear Ange the mountain gorilla was named the gorilla Baron G in honour of the captain yeah fuck look at Majan that thing how about those hey that guy who is an anti poaching agent he helps protect gorillas from poachers yeah and he got them to pose standing up in a selfie and even better there's video of him tickling the gorillas and the grills laughing yep laughing like a person yeah it's crazy so was there a Bigfoot fuck yeah there was a Bigfoot yeah it was a real thing that's why there's so many stories about it it probably died off a hundred thousand years ago or something right you know - gorillas ever eat meat or that just they're just not gorillas no yeah gorillas are we are closer to chimpanzees than chimpanzees or gorillas is that true yeah Wow well III think it's interesting in Goma where those groups of male chimps expand their territory mm-hmm they kill other males in others and then move their women and children into the area that they annex yeah isn't that crazy misha s' they just as groups fall down fall on the smaller you know tribes of chimps and decimate them there are so many so many similarities to humans yes so many yeah but these um bondo apes they call them this is the the giant chimp there's decent they nest on the ground too like gorillas are they as violent as they live in large communities like chimps the the locals have two names for chimps over there they have one that they're called tree beaters those the regular-sized chimps and the other ones they call lion killers damn they're so big they've they've got videos of these things eating a leopard what yeah they don't know if it yeah there are enormous chimps so they don't know if it killed the leopard or if the leopard died and they're eating it they don't know but they do know one was eating a fucking Leopard so you gotta think yummy kitty cat when they're standing up they're taller than me I'm 5/8 there's six feet tall you're six feet tall yeah so that your height yeah your height but a chimp and a jack jump oh god it's probably 250 300 pounds well they say that 400 pounds the ones in the zoo they have something I don't think in the city zoo no I don't believe they do I think they do no they have two giant chimps if you look at his big chimps those are just big chimps they're huge they yeah they've had chimps that are over 200 pounds they've had some enormous chimps but they've never had one of these did they live in a very specific area of the Congo but they've seen them yes they have video of them they have photographs of them you can see videos and you see camera trap photos they're a real animal it's a really big animal man it's a really big chimp it's amazing you imagine see it a six-foot chip no dude no no they eat you're facing your genitals no thanks just imagine standing there you turn a corner and there's a chimp as tall as you looking at here disaster yeah I have to go low have you ever seen was that the word they had a there was a traveling circus where they had a chimp and they would muzzle it and they'd have any man the biggest man that just to hold the chimp down for six seconds if you could do our three seconds and no man has ever been able to do it they just there's just this is hotter than 50 pound chimp yeah and you wouldn't even even if it was muzzled man it could still rip your arms off like what are you doing yeah you're made out of jell-o I'm here held I've held a small one a big one as hold it was playing with my puppy and it was I was this back felt like would would ya like it's perfectly described that's exactly I can't Henderson probably yes exactly he's got to be part chimp yeah but I had a two one two year old one once on fear not fear factory news radio and when we're on the set the scene actually got cut out we never wanted of using the scene but there was a guy was like an animal trainer and he had a couple different animals with him and one was a baby chimp in diapers and this baby chimp got on my back and beat beat on my back a couple of times and I was like what the fuck yeah it was like you hitting me yeah I was like wow this fucking little tiny thing just wailed on my Jesus they're so strong - yeah their little bodies emit just just hard like corded no-neck take crazy punish now but that thing in the Congo ments it's apparently in a very difficult spot to reach it's very dangerous to go through there you know when justin wren goes through there he has some hair-raising stories about being held up at gunpoint you know people thought they were gonna they were gonna kill somebody yeah a lot of the people a lot of the apparently a lot of the sort of soldiers and people who committed atrocities from the the war in Rwanda kind of wind their bands kind of moved into the Congo and lived in them in you know in the jungle who knows who Justin is a lot of crime justin run that's a saint yeah guys he digs wells he's a legitimate saint yeah really is Gauri he's got malaria three times visiting the Congo and building wells it was amazing yeah he taught us some amazing stories heartbreaking it's amazing the cash app which is one of my sponsors also sponsors fight for the Forgotten they give people money to give five dollars every time someone signs up and uses the code Joe Rogan and they've built it they're building wells right now because of that really yeah they they who was the latest number I forget what the number was they sent me an updated like very early on they were they had built two wells and they built a bunch more and provided water to a shit ton of people down there I don't know those exact statistic I wrote moonwalking with Einstein the hell's he it's a book about memory and stuff really smart guy he lived with the pygmies in the Congo for a long time no that's what Justin wrens doing yeah and said that they smoked copious amounts of wheat is that the book yeah Joshua for four interesting what a name yeah we are for yeah and I said never seen what is it you know these are people that truly have been almost untouched by Western civilization he's like well no I mean they died of stupid things like you know you get an infection you know and you just you know you don't have antibiotics well a lot of bacteria and parasites and stuff to get stomach parasites from water skin diseases and weird things like that yeah the jungles not even if you've evolved to live in it's not a very I spent enough time in the Indonesian rainforest I've never seen bugs like that in my life I've never seen anything like it it's so loud it sounds like it take the loudest Street in Manhattan and I'm not kidding that's how loud the insects and birds and everything are and then you have to carry out the bug spray does not work never tell you this the bug spray you got to carry a sulfur coil yeah good luck with the mosquitoes bug spray they'll laugh at your fucking at your bug spray you got to carry it you have to burn a sulfur coil and just carry it hold it that's crackin when you wake up did they just they're all over the pier was says that you were doing this I got I was 21 did they did they have thermal cells back then I don't think so yeah thermo cells with shit if you ever use a thermos oh now what is that oh my god they're the fucking game changer really yeah yeah it's um it's a device that has like a heating coil in it and some fuel and you ignite it and the the heating coil it heats up and you put this little pad across the screen and this little pad has this stuff in it the mosquitoes hate it's probably terrible for you yeah chemical but the chemical wafts up in the air and I'm telling you it creates like a 10-foot bubble around you where no mosquitoes is great yeah and eat look even if it's a little bad for you maybe it's like smoking a pack of cigarettes yeah better than good fed on yeah I'm not using it every day I wouldn't recommend using it every day but if it's a difference between like enjoy like if you're in a place like Alaska yeah exactly we're more - what about Edmonton up there yeah same thing came back with like oh that just like hit the pox they'll fuck you up those mosquitos man yeah they're so aggressive because they're only alive it's like three months you know it's so cold up there yeah nature could give a fuck about you I love people are into nature and they're like listen man they don't even know what nature is go try to go exactly go try to raise crops in South Africa when animals when elephants were everywhere yeah and lions and leopards well now yeah even now these poor villagers that they they're poor and they build these crops and they they have this farm and they they have all this food for their village and then elephants roam and plenty elephants go hey man and that's a wrap yeah you can get the fuck out of here stomp on me they mean and then people get mad when people shoot the elephants it's like okay I get it but I don't know what you want here like they have a lot of stories about elephants have this mystique in South Africa there was this guy was a farmer and he had a donkey and it was tied up and the elephants came into his property and he shot guns and got him the hell away from there and then the next day the elephants came back and stomped his fucking donkey into mush whoa just stomping the donkey was on a you know rope and they were like really gang gang Cain then of course the other the neighboring farm when the elephants came she she laid out a bunch of food for them and the I and and they spared her her crops there all these elephants have this mystique which is all by the way maybe the biggest day holes in the world Helen they hate everybody but they were so nice I was in Thailand I was yeah there's a Thai elephant sir the different African elephants you're not you're not taming an African elephant good luck mostly elephant you see what is this jaimé okay jaimé is watching like this little Buffalo gets up oh my god yeah elephant came over and rolled it all about you trying to stab him yes oh he does he's killing so he's killing a baby that's half that's probably a full-grown buffalo that's just a giant elephant well she's fucking up this Buffalo they're so dangerous look it up yeah elephant stabs and kills Buffalo okay Jesus Christ well that's why they have tusks yeah I mean that you know it's really crazy when Lions take a chance wow that's the other video I didn't pull those three elephants killing a lion that elephant just raising shit they just kill crazy what's crazy is lions will take a chance on elephants I know which is just so nuts they will take a chance to try to kill an elephant they'll jump on their back they'll try to jack them well when you go to a game reserve in South Africa you can't yeah it has to be big enough to sustain lions because it's super expensive because they're just a pride of lions will eat everything just so you got to keep replenishing the animals because they just they're just too effective well you know after that dent just shot Cecil the lion it became this international outrage they banned the lion hunting and because of that people didn't want to go back and they weren't getting the money from it so they wound up euthanizing like 200 lions I know because they're undulate population was getting devastated but what made me think when I heard that it was like how many Lions are they killing like how many people are going over there to hunt lion its it brings them good money how many weird is a huge part of South Africa's you know that like part of the conservation areas are that you know big game on you can fuck you can hunt the big five or what do they call it yes that's exactly the call but it's but it's a lot of money it is a lot of money and it brings them a lot of money and it brings them a lot of money for conservation and all that stuff but why a weird activity is there an activity that's more human in that like we are so conflicted and so weird that the only way we have animals that stay alive in this part of the world like weather and record populations it is to set it up so you can kill them yeah so I like that we figured out some weird loophole look we don't want the Rhino to die hey we don't want the runner die either so let's go ahead a bunch of them and we can't like one a week yeah come on yeah and if they could get enough rhinos where they could make a case for that they would be doing that I mean they're doing it with lions or doing it with everything the gazelles I mean all the different animals that you think of plains animals in Africa their record numbers they're right nilgai they bring back to Texas they're all over Texas yeah there's so many animals there and a lot of those annals were on the verge of extinction but they're there because people kill them like what up fuck it he has my drum it's weird well the bigger issues is unbroken migratory range yeah and the habitat the Masai Mara is one of the few places where they can roam for thousands of miles but most of Africa now is broken up into I think there's an area in Cameroon or whatever but most of Africa is broken up into I mean in South Africa it's all basically with the exception of Kruger Park it's all abandoned you know cattle Lots mm-hm and then they just there's money in it so you buy that lot and you just stock up with animals and then you drive around they they it's a sustainable ecosystem but it's yeah you got it yeah you got it you still you do have to call they run the you know elephant population and lion population when we think about Africa right when we say Oh elephants are going extinct in Africa like Africa is so big it's crazy it's so big you've seen the map worth of stuff all the countries inside of Africa never good that was so shocking to me I know I couldn't believe that so there could be an abundance of them in one area and then in another area it's like saying like they have a black bear problem in New Jersey what do they do okay do that yeah they do but that doesn't affect us here yeah California yeah like people just start shooting black bears you like hey man there's not that many of those why you shooting them you know but it's a mountain lion yeah well you know one just died a famous one just died where I got a text from a note out here he ate some rat poison oh shit yeah it's a real problem with rat poison man rat poison doesn't just affect rats yeah you know there's like there's secondary and my dog almost died that way yeah and what it does is a rat poison I think stops you from producing vitamin K in your body which is a which is how you clot blood well so they just bleed internally so my dog yeah yeah load of it and they pumped his stomach gave him charcoal and then he had to take vitamin K supplements for a long time Wow yeah yeah the people they poison their rats then things eat the rats you know yeah this uh mountain line is a famous mountain line collared you know wandering tracking yeah out here a number yeah rinoa talks to me about it then I looked into it oh you got it there which number does it say he 47 P 47 is that the one that they spotted it thought not no I was only three hey we were gonna get a photo of that right yes yeah let's do that oh yeah we tracked it down yeah what did what happened it's expensive yeah let's let's do that all right let me know after this right yeah which one you wanted artist proof whatever we got yeah at that detail yeah because that one photo they caught of it have you seen that photo of the lyon with the hollywood sign behind it now it's amazing it's one of the best it's an again it's so fucking human cuz this line has a collar on it like it's got bling on stand in front of a Hollywood sign and it's as big as fuck it's all that it's like a hundred and fifty I'm out oh that's amazing that photo that looks staged you looked staged by the way look at the look at the muscles look at its forearms yeah that's a ridiculous animal that's one thing that people don't I don't think you've realized like that's not a svelte thing like a house that's a lion sir they have enormous forearm that's a lion coming out that weighs bring down an elk I bet that's 130 pounds yeah maybe 150 think about how big that is that doesn't seem big but you see a Rottweiler a police dog like that's a German Shepherd 90 pounds yeah good luck good luck that's an ad add another 60 pounds 40 pounds of that's a big animal man yeah it's such a big animal and they just wandering around our neighborhoods effective killers I'm having a guy come on who's a mountain lion biologist at a Topanga Canyon oh really yeah and I might actually go and trap one with them how many how many do they think there are oh there's there's quite a few this one went 150 Wow damn the one that died Wow 150 that is a big Jesus like three years old Jesus Christ three years old just living on deer yeah go look around for deer in California good luck yeah don't no deer out here there's so few deer if you're a deer hunter in California your sad face all year round you're not looking forward to yeah I see a lot of deer in Topanga yeah you see how few they're drawn to me oh I feed them are you um it's my alpha energy they feel safe with me but is the do you have a connection with them do you think uh to be honest with you I run with them have you always been like this they flanked me they would never go past me they flanked me and when I do my gongfu in an open field they surround me and they bow until I release them and I go ha run this is my favorites are people that think that they have some sort of special couch like a dog my friend's girlfriend we're all sitting around my friend's girlfriend so hot so hot is one of those girls like were sitting there and she goes and I was I was meditating and I saw a deer and it looked at me and the deer gave me love and we're all like I'm just looking at her tits yeah I was a young amazing she's so hot so she's such an estrogen you know and my buddy of course you know you had those horns and can't let it go just let it go dearly let her have her thing my buddy goes why gave you love explain that shit to me explain why I got a biological well you know what you're close-minded and you're on a to it if I'm really intuitive and it became that into it it's my favorite thing yeah I love that shit but those people that claim they have some special connection with animals like animals just recognize yeah I am they know my name you know kind of schooled me Megan Fox I was doing a movie with her and and I assumed she started talking about signs and I was making fun of like psychics and signs and Megan goes well maybe you ever think that maybe your little close-minded and I go no not scientific minded and no I'm not and I think all psychics are liars and I think astrology is bullshit but then like Megan literally went into her knowledge of science and geology and everything else and I was like oh you're a fucking oh oh wait you're a really hot intellectual and you know a shitload and I made a judgment on you it was very it was actually embarrassing isn't that interesting that you would automatically make a judgment on someone who's hot like oh your lives been easy as fuck right and she's not like that like a judgment that you would make on the son of a rich man like if someone correct grew up and is in the family business and his father was a very successful man but he's taking over the family business he would assume this guy's a bitch yep right yep most of the time most of the time you're wrong so often yes it's such a bad yet yeah cuz like if a great if a great man has a son yeah most like he's gonna teach that son school shit and the sons gonna have to like live up to a certain standard right well that was the thing with Megan I would notice after I had that interaction with her I've known her a little bit cuz I know her husband really well and then uh and then I noticed that every time we wouldn't be shooting she'd be reading a book of substance like that's what she does when she's not on set so I was like well what are you doing you're laying an iphone next to your head what am i doing their iPhone next to the other side of your head and you have these weird conversation see that I do that's my favorite thing you do I gotta start doing that again do it those are so funny but I do that or I talk to the stuntmen and ask them like how much they can bench well no way you're a Navy SEAL so when you shoot the problem with that is it invariably ends up someone pulling out mats and then you start you start rolling I had Paulie Malignaggi he was at my gym and then he kind of knew he goes wait a minute I just figured out who the fuck you are you think I'm lying oh he's freaking out so so I take that opportunity to ask him like I'm just asking him like put some boxing questions next thing I know he's giving me a boxing lesson how fucking cool is that that is cool yes it was three days he really gonna do that bare-knuckle boxer is Artem furious yeah and he's taking it personally yeah but man you don't want to break your hands you don't want to get your face cut up has he done fighting like boxing but he looked like he was in shape he was like and he was givin people pointers he's very he looks he seems I listen to him a lot on you know Showtime something he's cerebral as hell I mean he knows the game he's very smart guy he doesn't get hit a lot no ya know and you think about a boxer that can talk as well as he can as articulate as he is and ya understand I mean if you watch the way he fights like watch his fights with Adrien Broner like he he knew how to figure out the puzzle yeah that's burners hand speed and power punching and he punches in volume he's always in great he's showing me patterns like just basic things that I was like damn I really want to see the actual sparring match between him and Conor because all the UFC released is Conor tracking him I know it's a long one it had to be there had to be some fun moments in that yeah well also I think apparently Pauly got off a plane and then he hadn't wasn't even really in he wasn't even working out that much then they I was gonna train with them yeah they go we're going six rounds or something they just filming what they can film it yeah that's something they use it as a promo right I think people are you breathless bro the idea that if they weren't gonna use that is more ridiculous come on who are you you don't understand how this business works they're promoting F they're promoting of he's a Brooklyn kid he's a smart guy listen they're promoting a fight that is going to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue you think that they're gonna spare your sensibilities they're gonna spare your feelings and not show edited versions of you getting popped but my problem is so that I have a problem with that all across the board because because I feel like when common decency Fairplay you know on contract and sort of a contract you and you enter I'm coming out to help you out yes and what you're gonna do is use me go fuck yourself like it's not believing it I understand I understand it's a business believe they paid him I'm sure they did I believe he signed paperwork over well I'm sure they did but that's a sneaky move it's fuck yes and I and I I have a problem with fuck yes in general I I just don't like justifying anything because it's going to be good promotion I'm always uneasy you know how people say hey man bad press but you're talking about him yeah but fuck off I completely agree with you however put the play devil's advocate yeah if I'm mr. businessman mr. moneybags yeah actually just went in one ear and out the other I don't know what you're talking about that's a video of some shit that actually happened you hate the truth the view if you hate the truth I can understand why you would want to show in that video right Connor did drop him and it's gonna be a great fight Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather and ironically might have been good for Paulie in terms of it creating this fight with arts you're talking about him yeah although I think I think Paulie Malignaggi stands on his own yes sir yeah I mean he's he's got a real name and he's an excellent boxer it seems probably the better commentators in the game if not the best oh yeah very very good 100% him and Andre Ward Andre Ward far my favorite and brought John jr. for our Jones jr. is outstanding at it too yes Andre Ward just like brilliant brilliant brilliant guy I just watching him like figure out Cova left to right especially in the second fight believe yeah in fact that you know he dropped Kovalev with a body shot and you know Coppola said they didn't give him a chance and that they just stopped the fight yeah it didn't look like he wanted to keep going I felt like that way with Aamir Khan like mm-hmm if people were like listen yeah c'mere Khan has nothing to prove he has an amazing record he's fighting a genius in Crawford and probably and there's no shame in this he was supposed to fight Kell Brooks and he kind of went you know what this guy is he's time is on his side and he's gonna he's kind of figured this out he's bigger and he's gonna connect he's gonna hit me and maybe hurt me here I don't feel like doing this anymore if that was the case I forgive him for everything it's like I thought it was a smart decision to find and maybe he was really hurt he's Miller the cattle and I'm not saying he's not but the Kell Brook fight would have actually got americon more money it was uh he want to test himself and he decided to take the fight against Crawford it's a real fighter if Crawford's not the best pound-for-pound fighter on earth he's number two he's one or two I want to see how those girls pants well him Earl Spence is fantastic too but I think the the argument of pound for pound is lomachenko and him that's the argument you guys are number one yeah who do you think is number one I mean I think that's you talking about Crawford Crawford I don't know I don't think Crawford's fought enough competition like when he fights Earl Spence and the III think that Loman chenko has probably had more fights and you can really get into this conversation because he hasn't hears less everybody that he said he's won the world title with like four fights oh yeah or was it how many fights it was like something ridiculous like that I mean he fought a world-class fighter his first time out though when I saw him fight Jorge was a amazing Mexican fighter or somewhere like that who is the guy lost record here 13 and one in Crawford's 35 and oh yeah Wow big difference but boxing is tricky that way right so what's what's the level of competition as they bring you up slow well the difference is lomachenko had an extensive amateur yeah internationally but so did Crawford Crawford had a great amateur background to look Crawford the the difference is Crawford's way bigger that's the difference if they were the same size it would be really interesting to see what would happen but Crawford's a lot bigger than him he would yeah I mean it's not a good fine now it's just to watch him take riggan now and all these amazing fighters were gone do Oregon deal I thought I was written down I don't think so I think he knows I think the way he pronounce it in French is rekindle Regan doe if he can gun Dale but yeah he he just Manos people his footwork is unparalleled but Terence Crawford meant first of all he's probably the best switch hitter ever next to Marvin Hagler he might be better yeah I mean it's hard to say he can find a game plan for that is so good Orthodox then so good southpaw but to watch Linares that's a jorge lanata thing is a sikh fighter and to watch him he knocked low manchego down mm-hmm but then again like this guy figures you out he just he goes I know what you're doing now yeah and then you're done well so does Crawford yeah I mean the best I mean that was Anderson Silva in his prime to he would just figure out your timing yeah figure out what you do how you enter where the gaps are where the holes are okay I see how key to the castle let's rock right and then somewhere around the end of the first round Anderson would start switching stances on you and fucking doing some Bruce Lee moves and the next thing you know he's got his foot in your face yeah that's nice figures you out it's exactly right these guys are just the really elite of the elite fighters they're just the best at solving the little riddle that is what your skills are now how do you solve that riddle that is cubby they're gonna that's a different riddle yeah cuz that motherfuckers not on the outside boxing you and he called her Connor for a while Connor for a while you know he's gonna take you down but what it looked like Connor for a while was isolating he had two hands on that wrist he was stopping him for a long time from closing his his hands and and that seemed kind of effective for a while I mean good luck it's a long road that's like saying um you're running a marathon hey you know he beat me in the marathon but for the first hundred that's what it's like it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter doesn't matter is a five-round fight like okay keeping me from grab my hands for now your hands tired yeah yeah how you farm no I'm gonna take I'm taking you down he's just gonna take you down that guy's so relentless and the skill level and the endurance level he has to pursue that pace yeah for five rounds like I don't think I even appreciate it I mean I can only intellectualize it and I could describe it but I think when you're in there with him like when when he fought Edson Barboza and he had Edson Barboza up against Cade come on buddy it's mine give up Edson has this no that was against Michael Johnson is this thousand-yard stare where he's getting mauled it's just like he's like breathing he's like oh fuck like this is this is a different kind of human being those Russians are that's a different kind of human being August Annie's so tiny they grow up fighting from me cept I'm he's a baby yes culture they were there suffered a great deal that's look he's like Jesus Christ what the fuck did I sign up for skin mauled and I love I love Coby looks like his legs body looks like you know guys see at the pool kind of works out maybe a little it just doesn't it looks pretty fit I don't know that guy looks fit Barboza's really muscular he was jacked man really he's just Jason show up photo of could be like making like a most muscular pose or something he's fucking pretty jack he's just not though he's just a freak no not compared to a lot of dudes yeah go down there look at that you know cuz he's not you know he looks like a really strong grappler he's full you know he is but really like look at him like shut your mouth yeah that's pretty good there shut your your dirty lies he's pretty what about that one right there how about that one cut the shit when you with your on sinner TRT yeah but when you were young it's basically the same if I was in there I would you would call it steroids you were always like that yeah I was always like that yeah when I first met you yeah I didn't even take vitamins now you were just jacked I remember first time at TV you were jacked out of your mind yeah I knew it was just cuz you lifted weights well that was when I was just getting into jujitsu so I really started lifting weights because I was tired of getting mauled yeah so I really got into lifting well okay I am weak I'm like yeah cuz I'm used to striking striking is so different than different in terms of the demands and your muscles and your fatigue yeah it's so but and it was works the other way too because I remember I had done any striking at all in like a year I had done none zero just to Jitsu and then my friend Jamie and I start doing them Jamie is a trainer and we were doing this training session and he had me hit mitts to and like just hit and mitts for like a couple minutes I was gassed out as like as possible I roll all the time I'm in good shape right now sparring is that way when you get guys who are triathlon leads or whatever they come in and Wayne McCulloch shoutout to the great Wayne McCulloch my trainer I love I love that guy he's the best I fuckin that's one of my favorite people in the world like whenever I see him all is right in the world he's just a humble ya silver medalist in the Olympics world champion and nobody asked some questions in the gym it's like he that you have this gold mind this guy here who's who beat Morales who fought Prince Naseem to the distance and nobody knows it and he never tells anybody and I'll see these guys hidden and I'm like wait why don't you tell them and he goes they don't ask me I don't bother them he's just the most humble doing the world like it drives me fucking nuts but lost but anyway yeah it will get like triathletes people are in really good shape but if you if you're sparring and you're afraid to get hit you stop breathing and so in three minutes in two minutes I don't care how good a shape you're in the minute you get punched once you're like yeah it took me literally it probably took me three years to get over that in a way because I have no confidence as a boxer and I shouldn't boy he's getting punched in the head what is going on with you I'm not getting punched hard how hard I mean sometimes there's a my buddy Chris from Boston is a giant and he'll by accident sometimes you need to get connected and stuff but now you know you learned how to kind of keep your hand but you're getting older you worried about that I'm insecure bro but are you worried about your brain I sure am rattled I was a little cloudy I stopped for a little really yeah so you're getting cloudy from getting hit I don't know I said to Brendan I said you know he has no time for this shit he gets so mad at me he just goes you're older what are you doing oh you're getting look like yeah that's right that's what happens so keep that shit up man he storms off yeah well he he came to the realization you know he ducked he ducked yeah he was oh I don't know he was fuckin Shane Carwin Oh Marc Gordon all those guys and and throwing up after after his training sessions and he played football forever yeah I'll be all right yeah well he quit though at the right time yes really did yes he did I mean he's fine yes he he made it out at the right yeah I'm so invested in him like he's my my brother so whenever he talks about Sarah T I'm I'm like CT I'm like now you're okay don't worry about it because your doctor I go you're fine I promise it's not gonna happen I don't like to think about it well I mean he's he's honest if he wasn't doing good he'd tell ya you know if he wasn't feeling good that's very true I think everybody needs someone who they trust implicitly that they that can pull the cord on them and to tell them hey man yeah you got to stop getting hit yes and for a young fighters man it is such a hard decision to make I've talked to several guys who tell their fighter several trainers and have to tell their fighters to retire and it's never easy it's never easy and subscriber identity the fighter will leave and go with a different trainer and be successful and and the the you know and this one case the trainer was like I wish him well I mean I'm sure he can still beat guys that's not the problem the problem is he's showing some obvious signs of deterioration mentally neurologically the way he moves yeah the way talks and a good person who cares about you is going to go okay we had it a lot of fun it was a great run you're fine right now like you can talk and we can treat whatever problems come up apparently CBD is fantastic for that I've heard for a lot of people with brain issues and a lot of you know inflammation issues because of trauma there's a lot of stuff they don't know a magnetic stuff that he had Zingano did doing down San Diego in soldiers or they put that electron guys doing that right now steel guy you know but I I am I don't think I've ever met a fighter who is retired who doesn't still feel like they could fight for the belt oh yeah they all won even even Chuck Liddell when he did fighter and kid was like I'd like to throw my hat in there I guess John Jones I'm pretty good wrestling like he was already 48 yeah you never lose that part of what makes you a great fighter and a killer is that that's sort of yeah love of the game if you ask Paulie Malignaggi right now I guarantee I guarantee if you're like could you fight for a title right now because I put my hat in there fighters are like that of course that's why they're I mean that's why they become successful in the first place if you think about how you are when you first start out even if you're like real athletic you're fucking terrible you know you're hitting the bag your feet are off even if you hit it hard like you're doing something wrong you're clumsy you're wide open afterwards there's something that someone who's really good will expose and then eventually you learn skills and as you learn skills you see those holes you tighten all those holes up and then you become far better than you are but the only reason why you're you can do that is because you think you're a bad motherfucker from the jump right but you hit that bag hard you look yeah I'm gonna fuck everybody up and you just start believing that yeah and then as you get skills like Jesus I'm glad I didn't get into a real fight with a real fighter early on because that is one of the most insidious things that trainers do they'll throw their fighter to the wolves like they'll set their fighter up with some young up-and-coming phenom who's just smashing people and it's hard to get them fights and they'll get this guy to fight them you know because there's a few guys that'll just fight anybody oh my god they've only been doing it for like a year yeah you're gonna take that fight against these guys 60 nano Diaz brothers when they went into the into Andre Ward's camp in Oakland I'm they they were banging yeah and I'm sure from day one yeah cuz I was talking to Nate Diaz I was like but you guys go light he goes no we bang bang yeah I talked to Joe shelling about that the first time you ever met Nick and he's like he's talking to Nick's friend like Nick's like okay you got a cup got your Mountain and Joe said the next friend goes we fighting he goes yeah all right we're just fight she just knew like this is gonna be fighting this is not is like are we sparring are we fighting yeah and then why not fighting you ain't really I think as you get better and better at it it probably becomes addictive and it's just a sure cuz every time I go in there and I go I'm not Sparra but then there's somebody and then you say we'll just move around yeah but then well the UH salt they're also testing each other too right yeah like Nick is world-class fighter Joe Schelling's a world chance a whole boxer strikings evil Joe showing his evil story yeah he fucks people just to be standing next to him too he's also just big big long and athletic he's just like oh god it's doing very well in MMA now is he really nasty fucking ground-and-pound his last fight man really when you got a guy that that good at slashing people with elbows and punching people and you get him on top of you yeah good there ground-and-pound is on another level you know because they can generate serious power and short distances like a lot of grapplers have a hard time with like do you member when cro cop got on top of gonzaga and and opened his face up with an elbow moves horrific but it was inside the guard yeah but you're a real good striker a short amount of distance you Brendan said that's the strongest guy he's ever prokop yeah it's strong motherfucker math powers those ridiculous legs yep those those legs that belong on a fucking and a font and it Funday you know also going back to this asteroid impact oh sorry there's a layer somewhere around 66 million years ago that indicates that the earth got hit by an asteroid that's what I mean did I say that yeah I think it's the layer is high in eridium I think an iridium has it's very rare on earth but very common in space and there's a bunch of other indications that that's the time that it hit but what they're saying the radio lab one is that the current state of understanding is that the dinosaurs and basically most things died within the first couple hours like all the dinosaurs they were all apparently there their bones and their fossils are in that iridium layer a lot of times right I don't know maybe yeah they found a lot of they find him before - right they don't just don't find any after it's crazy think yeah they think that their blood boiled in their body they think it got so hot that during the few hours it got to like 700 a thousand degrees 1200 degrees I just got insanely hot dude trying to get better at stand up and stand Shey now I gotta worry about fucking that's a full-time job raise my kids that's what we really should be thinking about not just how bad we're fucking the earth up but how bad something could fuck the earth up from the sky yeah that's what we really should be paying attention to and Senate paying attention to so many nonsensical things that people concentrate on there's a real chance that we could get hit in our lifetime with something that ends civilization like that yeah 100% can happen yep yeah I had Graham Hancock on last week and we were going over his new book this book isn't it right here Jimmy it's right there it's fucking it's excellent and Graham was talking about it's called America before it's the evidence of civilizations in in the Americas in North America's particularly in the Amazon that they think that there was millions of people living in the Amazon but when the European explorers came over here the game smallpox and wiped out everyone yeah then they came back hundred years later and there was nothing yeah like the the entire civilization made it amazing I think I feel like in 1492 where there was a I think when the Spanish came up through the Mississippi Delta the same thing yeah same thing yeah they wiped out 90 but they a lot of people think that the genocide of the Native Americans was just European soldiers and people and settlers killing Native Americans which did have yeah but if the ones that 90 percent of them were killed by disease ninety percent like the entire population well they even had they even had certain government policies where they're like you missionaries are going out there and trying to convert them to Christianity you're giving them your diseases they knew that back then they knew that they were like you'reyou're there getting sick and they're dying of you know that they were all of a sudden they were like we're getting these colds and people are dying they didn't have any resistance to that crazy if those dirty Europeans with their shit water shoots outside their house and all that fucking vermin running around that was War of the Worlds remember one of the world's the movies how'd they die they weren't ready for pathogens that's my whole philosophy on we all try to be tough one of the things about all of us as men or anybody is we hate to be vulnerable so you know I trained and I I stay in shape I eat well yeah forever I don't think there's anything such thing is I don't think this you can be really ready for a situation you know in a bar I guess and then you get bit by a tick or you get a flesh-eating disease yeah and you die sure so I don't know shows any way to give mercy to yourself well I mean you can't protect yourself but you are ultimately very vulnerable but then what this radio lab was freaking me out about was that there's so many of those things floating around the sky I mean it's what Graham talked about in not just this book but in previous books that they think that something slammed into the earth somewhere in the past that ended the Ice Age probably wiped out a giant chunk of the large megafauna on North America it led to the almost instantaneous extinction of so many different animals and so it goes yeah and so it goes and it can happen again there could be a supervolcano there's all kinds of stuff like that all these fucking things it makes you a lot of an asteroid was going to hit Denver NASA was practicing that this week they've done this before they've had like a practice run using a bunch of the different here's the practice run get in the boat go to Australia exactly I have to go pee oh my god you gotta go to us talk about me being I'm talking about you Miami yeah May 9th 10th 11th at the MLB there yeah and then Orlando talk about complicated okay promote me okay Bryan Collins gonna be in Miami at the improv and in Orlando if you go to Bryan count com it'll have all that stuff I just ran across this to on the screen on Twitter what happened in that Koontz head my god I have an affair with a woman and her husband came home early tried to escape through the window but ended up falling on a metal beam Oh oh my god it went through his head how'd they get the beam off their ii saw the brahma probably a holy shit though and i just saw the picture there what the fuck is that holy shit oh my god he's alive yeah and then it says pictures and it's happening in the past to jesus christ i got on one eye because of it oh my god i went through his head yeah it's weird what would people how people survived from injuries lobotomy yeah like yeah when they stopped doing those I mean we haven't really talked about too much but I remember looking it up it just would dig a hole right through your eye and scramble your brain the metal piece of metal and they did that because you were just too annoying I don't know why I think people were crazy they would just do it they were doing them up until like 19 in the 1900s I know I don't know if it stopped like the 50s or 40s the exact time but what do you think they're doing now besides circumcision that people are gonna look back on like that and go what the fuck were they thinking what do you think they're doing now I don't know it's just we keep learning different strategies to fix stuff yeah that's true but this the but the lobotomy is not even a strategy to fix stuff it's like chaos and worse though in some cases it my stuff how did you have but maybe it stopped them from being super violent or something controlling people would probably be boys I mean I don't know why do they give someone a lobotomy look what is the what's the chief reason forgive it someone a lobotomy what would you guess psychosis crazy stuff yeah that they didn't have an answer probably for pharmaceuticals back then so they just said fucking scramble the brain somehow it's fucked up to me that it's thought your brain would still work it's a neurological treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing the connections between the brains prefrontal cortex you made it too big most of connections to and from the prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain are severed what did they do that for Brian because when you had a personality that was when you were crazy they would take out the part of your brain I guess that was reactive and that gave you essentially a personality so when you were lobotomized you were really kind of a normal person have you ever seen the movie Francis they gave her lobotomy lobotomized a little carrots a lot they did it to a little kid yeah horrifying little kid scramble your brain tarah home remember if I remember right there is one guy he was doing up to like 70 a day or something like that that's three an hour yeah I think lobotomy would help you you know I'm reading a that this guy David Epstein oh but there were people who you know they had electric shock therapy and they were they were crazy and they would try all these things I had atomic schizophrenia she says she has yeah look at her smiling sixteen months later they would try these things so before and after at 16 so it worked the lobotomy works she just smiling everywhere yeah but she would smile she saw a baby get run over by a car she'd smile she saw girls catch on fire yeah Jesus I made nice look on the brain sort of like that guy David Epstein he wrote he wrote the sports gene we're on the fastest people in the world tiny part of Africa the people that run the farthest which is the highlands of Kenya really fascinating book he's a Sports Illustrated writer and then he there's a new book coming out called range and it's about how when you teach a kid or when you when you learn a lot of different disciplines so if you're some of the best violinists some of the best athletes whatever they didn't specialize it's very it's it's it's probably a bad idea to specialize from a very early age the exception is like Tiger Woods he compares Tiger Woods and Roger Federer Tiger Woods was raised to be a golfer from the age of two his dad was already having him he was watching having him watch how he swings and everything and Roger Federer greatest tennis player ever was playing in the music playing soccer at plan anything with a ball and didn't really get into tennis didn't really find his love of tennis until he was in his teens and a lot of musicians great musicians who are innovative so whether it's Duke Ellington or whatever those do great ones who make original music a lot of them are self-taught and a lot of them played a lot of instruments until they started to focus on that one instrument that spoke to them and he uses all these different examples of how how Jen realizing and doing a lot of different things in forms essentially informs your ability to become really good at one thing when you finally decide to do that that's a really kind of cool because a lot of parents are specializing a lot of parents like you can play baseball that's we're gonna play camp and everything else we're just gonna practice that bad idea bad idea according to this with the exception of very few skills like golf but everything else is you want to really expose your kid to a wide variety of things because for whatever it does with those that you know all the neurons and stuff you you are you're able to get better at something when you're practicing another thing well that makes sense to me it also makes sense to me that you'd want to get your kid exposed to a lot of things to find out what they actually enjoy cuz sometimes you enjoy something and go all but I don't enjoy it as much as this finds a new thing like that's even better I'm sure you went through things like that but a lot of parents like a lot of I was talking about Tiger moms they'll say you have a choice but you're playing the violin and your planet piano and you're not playing any other instrument yeah well the problem is it doesn't it stifles innovation and you become really pedantic and good at following instructions but you're not gonna be very innovative you'll be really technically good but you also tends to the naughty and you want a sack of shit like yo-yo ma he would try he tried a bunch of different instruments until he finally said I'm gonna play this yeah you want to be naughty you want to fight it yeah you want to fight mommy you know and you probably have some weird mommy porn bookmarks uh-huh uh-huh there's amazing amounts of stepmom porn really it's all stepmoms well porn hike mom your father's gonna be so mad at you long-long well mom mom or a derivative of mom is I think the second most typed in word in a pornhub what sister you look young born to hit something the saw something to do with young but but mom is nothing cranny porn is huge in Kenya and the UK do you know why they think because you're raised by an older lady or an older man your headmaster they're in a position of authority and as your excellent to well as you're coming to and you're formulating your point of view in the world and making sense the world you tend to sexualize whatever's in front of you I guess that makes sense you wouldn't print so-so gilfs and you know that's kind of hot yeah grandmas I'd like to fuck what kind of world we live in my friend's wife he catches her watching grandma porn for a gray old men banging gals she's into that she's into old dude she's an old guys like like real old like your body looks like warm cheese well I understand well how would they like that I don't it's who the fuck knows that is a weird thing though that you hear that some women like look really old guys you don't hear that from women from men rather yeah what is it saying the world's news photos of old and yeah I bet she was hot as fuck back in the 80s 100% yeah what are you gonna do listen man old hos they're just hoes that got old look at that one I had a friend from a guy who was super macho my friend you didn't show that on the screen did you Missy you son of a bitch who was that some no don't don't poor lady it's grandma with the ridiculous fake boobs my friend my friend he was he was from Ottawa super macho and he was like he I didn't have a lot of money and he had like he was kind of a gigolo he was having sex with this woman is she's old she's very old I said I go what she look like when she's negative it's a disaster like I say I can't look to her why'd she go to the bathroom I have to look you know go over here because yes it has to be no light because it's a disaster why did you buy he goes he goes by you know why she looks at me know why she's young she sees me I come like this you know young the ice are ice did make me hard and I forget I was like well some people into people being really into that yes he just wants to be admired I've known some women like that who were into dating trolls I mean because they've never had a woman like that and they're like don't fuck and they're just my sister had a friend like that her friend was only into guys that she knew she could do better oh it's fantastic she wanted that she wanted them to worship well there's a there's a apparently there's a psychology where a lot of men will over feed their wives and get them super fat so that they don't step out on them there's a lot of there are subconscious behaviors that go on time why are people so goddamn crazy I don't know trauma you know that Carl Jung is it the Carl Jung fucking the line that says that which we don't work out in our subconscious we will act out as fate in our lives how about that because you will relive patterns you'll relive trauma you will relive these patterns and you'll do it on your own terms and you'll wonder why you keep far why do you keep dating the same person why do you keep falling into the same problem why after two years does this go bad what what is that well there's a way to actually creatively at least sit with that and observance and be aware of it that's what therapy does yes you made the unconscious conscious that will direct your life and you will call it fate what a great quote Wow until you make the unconscious conscious yeah I mean there's a lot of fucking strings going on it will direct your life and you will call it fate knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people yeah well that's you that's what I like Nietzsche Nietzsche's niches idea was like look man you can have these false models of life which is a lot of times life is a bitch right and you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to computer you don't want it so what you'll do is you'll go it's okay meek will inherit the earth that's alright now you have money but is he happy is he happy you know there's a lot but we make all of us do this we make excuses to not live our best life and he was like nah live dangerously and try to be the best you can be just work your ass off and if you have to die if you have to take risks and die leave a good-looking corpse is the idea of turn your life into a fucking circus do you think the meek will inherit inherit the earth you think if that was a prophecy that they would be talking about technologists they would be talking about like the people that run Twitter and Google and Facebook and in the internet tech people which is if you think about like the amount of money that Facebook has the amount of money that you too so like these these enormous ly influential tech companies even Amazon right yeah like who who are they who are they these are nerds they're nerds very aggressive nerds and they're very thoughtful they're very competitive the nerds so I don't consider them the meek I think I think who's the meek so I think the meek the philosophy behind that and and I and I and I think the United States also works on this premise in a sense is the American dream so what keeps the masses from rising up and taking the money from people who have nots from taking money from the haves and especially when the haves you know are rather slim in number in comparison to the large portion of the population that's a nice five hundred dollars in the bank well what's great about the United States what's always worked about the United States the means we don't have these the French Revolution in this country is because the American Dream is about potential there is a potential I may not have money now but I may and I will because I know I will because I'm an optimist I will be in the 1-percent eventually I got an idea bro I'm telling it's a great idea and people need that hope will you take that hope away you take the ability you take the idea that there's no way I can ever esteem out of my condition you better be careful that's what that's that's Oh potential the potential to be better the potential to be wealthier that think about how all of us a lot of us as we're as we get older anything that's what the meek will inherit the earth man I think it's in that era that people that aren't creating war was probably the people that were left over I think it's a wacky telling apiece no I think it's it I think it's a way of getting people to at least live with the fact that I'm a serf I'm a peasant I have no way to esteem out of my condition but at least I have the afterlife at least I know that if I live and I suffer well and I suffer quietly and I suffer with dignity there will be a reward after this what is the conventional definition or the conventional meaning to that statement the meek will inherit the earth like what our how to scholars interpret that well religious right right but I mean how do they how do they interpret that like what is I think it's in the same vein is it's harder for a camel to pass through the and I have a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven right so so that you know that the famous story where when that's a Christ said you want to follow me to the rich guy he said give up all your money and the rich guy turned the hung his head and walked away and he said poor guy it's so hard for the for the rich to get to give up their life of privilege is very difficult do you think Jesus was a real person historically I think there was probably a rabbi named Jesus of Nazareth that that's what that's what that seems to be the conclusion among a lot of historians and he was a radical rap he was a radical man because he simplified Judaism it's really what he was he was simplifying Judaism to say look you know you could follow the Book of Leviticus and all the rituals it takes to become a good Jew which is there's a certain way to quarter a calf and there's a certain way certain things you can't eat and you have to bathe and you have to all these rituals and he said way too complicated we're never gonna spread the word this way he said just make it simple do it rabbi Hillel said in the Old Testament do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and hold only one God as your God you know the father so that we're all of what the idea of a mom of a monolithic God is that there's a there's one father we're all brothers and sisters that way we're all the same moral worth that way I can't judge you that way I don't know what you're worth only God does I don't know I don't know where you have I don't know what your value is you're a human being I can't quantify that I think I think that's a beautiful thing I think we all benefit from that religious and that judeo-christian idea whether we know it or not and if you want to replace that my only issue with atheists is if you want to try to replace that irrational idea that irrational idea that we're all the same moral worth because you can't prove it but if you're mathematically or biologically but what are you gonna replace that with rationality you want to try it you want it you want to run a society on rationality you can't do that well if that's the most dangerous idea works best it's still the most dangerous idea in the world because ethics have to be predicated there's got to be bedrock the more you can work idea in the world well cuz let me give you an example it's very rational mathematically to suggest that anybody who is mentally handicapped is draining resources from our gifted children and I'm telling you now in a lot of societies around history what if we live in abundance it's around here people to take care of the people that are handy because abundance doesn't always last and you can't predict abundance it's here right now not really not for a lot of people right here be it'd be very easy to justify if you were just prayed to the god of rationality it'd be very easy to justify it and people have done this in history which is where I worry about sure hey let's get rid of all the people that are draining our resources because they're not they're hopeless anyway people on breathing machines people who are severely retarded whatever there are severely handicapped they're draining resource I know you love them but listen we need this money for over here you're in a hospital you're taking money the very old the very inform so you think we need religion to keep you from taking people off life support well I I will say that I think religion and specifically the genero Christian ethic and I include Islam in that and by the way I mean Buddhism is all talks about the sacredness of a sentient being these these religions are there because and I think we benefit from it I think that all of us do too I mean where does our justice system is predicated it's predicated on the idea that all men are created equal do we benefit from it but there's also real problems with it of course it's real problems with any idea I'd be careful in what you take away stan is why you think it can't be replaced with logic and reason because logic and reasons has pitfalls but you're a citizen alone you see assuming that logic and reason doesn't also have compassion so like you you wouldn't have compassion for the people that are mentally handicapped oh it does it does it's too fickle what I'm trying to say is this there's something very irrational and and very religious about the idea that all men are created equal then we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal right yeah and Yubel Harare talks about this brilliantly in this book which is that you cannot prove mathematically or biologically that that the idea that all men are created equal does that say Xian's or the new BSA pians is israel right so so because we're not again LeBron James if you standing next to me isn't we're not equal he's my chocolate avatar right so but we inherently know that our humaneness our human s you're not equal physically he's a super athlete but I'm funny or I had my own gifts that suck yeah if he went on stage and murdered but there are views like Eddie Murphy 2.0 there are people that are better but what about suck though yes if he was LeBron James and he was funnier than you well he's not a bad actor I'll tell you that I shouldn't imagine if he was really funny like if you couldn't follow him that's when I give him my girl imagine that though I would present him with my girl what six foot what 11 he's 6 9 ok 6 9 6 foot in 265 bill like a god faster than everybody in stronger than amazing and murders on stage at the store and when you eat the mic you have to go like this to get the mic that's right bring it down to you cuz you have to go on after him that's when I say to him he's got in the mic stand it's fucking seven feet in the air yeah and I go mr. mr. James I'd like to be your travelling concubine I'm probably not I don't want that I'm not your type no and you're useless I'll take corner I'll take common eggs let me cook for you know he's got people that shut the fuck up that carry the back polish your shoes you're too annoying man what are you gonna do you'll stare at his dick can I ask some questions about what a man he is yeah it's weird what are you squat leave him alone okay I'll just be in the cool some write better jokes it's just sir I'd like to be a gimp that would be so embarrassing like if a guy was that good at basketball but then it was like a natural at comedy there there murder in comedy like or like a fighter like what if Terence Crawford tell her to be the funniest fucking dude in the world his marriage imagine you know and he not just fucks people up in the ring but then Terence Crawford starts doing sets The Comedy Store and murdering and he's got a Netflix special and he's murdering and you're like no hope he goes so good at these things I don't know man yeah yeah but listen there are people that are better at everything sometimes I mean there are well there's definite look but we eat on musk is a good example that how many fucking things can that guy do it once but at the same time what I'm saying is that you can't quantify a human being because you don't know what their potential isn't you don't know where they're strong like I was like it's like if the Bron James murders on stage he's not better than you it's not robbing me he's better than you and everything fucking Bert following you you got to follow him he's gonna murder and then the King has left the building ladies he's gonna drop the mic and walk away yeah be a problem then you gotta go on but you can't be that good at two things right I mean who want me to be wise nice do you put it like three times my flats listen to me what if he puts the kind of effort that he puts into getting good at basketball and he couldn't good at stand-up muscle yeah one muscles lazy one muscle doesn't really write and work and like for the amount of hours that we work on our craft versus the amount of basketball players to practice different lizards always murderous isn't this is Blake Griffin he's been trying to do stand-up in the off season last couple years more when he was living in LA he got traded to Detroit now so it's a little bit harder for him probably but into doing good he's good yeah I mean from what I've heard from I've heard people have seen it that's hilarious videos of it there you go motherfucker yep so you can look at 610 doesn't matter stand-up doesn't care it's a long road yeah see in 10 years it can work though some what if he does it look what I'm saying is like you take a guy who has the kind of discipline and work ethic that an athlete does at the highest level of the game yeah apply that stand-up comic I bet they'll get further than a lot of us it's only 30 ah only 30 maybe what are you gonna do Blake Griffin's get out murder in front of ya it's a weird muscle stand up some weird muscles Joey Diaz isn't exactly like Joey Diaz is high by noon but he's funny as fuck it and he's way before noon yeah comedy is a weird thing comedies are very there are some Joey Diaz Mike in high all the time that mother father fucker works on an act Joey works and it's a mindset you're always writing you're always Musa Joey Diaz is a pro like people see Joey and they see that you know he smokes a lot of weed and he's crazy and theythey just gets up there just rants and raves no no if that guy always has new material always work always working on something yeah he's I think that's what it takes to I think that the this kid was younger and he told me he hadn't written a joke in two years and I went well you're talking like a loser you know you you can't I think stand-up is relentless especially if you don't have the follow if he if that's where he's at he's probably depressed there's something probably wrong with well we talked about that too but that I'm saying that you know again you know a depression is a very real thing but I always said it kind of younger people who've seen like they're in a rut I do I have a huge believer in just just take the steps of getting better at one type of language start it doesn't matter if it's a guitar it doesn't matter just just get better at one little thing just start practicing it'll motivate you to do other things I'm not saying depression clinical depression is a very real thing I don't know enough about it well the thing is it's it is real yeah but it's different with every person yeah it's like it's one of the rarest of diseases in that like you really can't put it on a scale yeah like you use a spectrum you feel like shit or you don't feel like shit you're depressed you're not depressed yeah but what what level depressed are you are you suicidal or you just like kind of shitty could you fix it with like running or do you need like real chemical intervention and in do you know do you know the difference like what what's your community like what are your friendships like yeah what is your family like huge questions huge question and by the way how are you eating how are you exercising what is your community like these are things where and people who live the longest and those societies what is its pain I heard I don't know if I'm right has the longest per capita lift people right now and yet huge alcohol and tobacco consumption but they are connected to community they're there and they do a lot of that getting it in yeah take and see us this long lunching and yes hanging it out yes the end drinking red wine whoa yeah enjoying them and dancing sensing salsa dancing how about thankful to was this Spain to lead Japan and global life expectancy go us continues to slide yeah cuz we're eating shitty food and we're getting fat we're also isolated yeah well you know there's a price you pay for as a capitalist as a capitalist as somebody believes in the free market there's a price you pay for the praying to the god of consumption and progress there is that and it's it as we as we are we're ruthlessly competitive Americans rural Americans are fucking ruthlessly competitive and insanely aggressive football is a game of war it's simulated war your your your it's a you're capturing territory and everything else it we are so aggressive that way and look it makes us a great country we also pay a price for it no question about it like I get I do get sort of the notion that we need there is this idea that we're the left a lot of the left says look man this this capitalism stuff that seems to be creating isolation and depression like how is it going is there is there a conversation to be had about how we figure out how we structure our lives where community takes more of a precedence where job security takes more of a precedence all they say well ISM I start to freak out no I just I know what you're saying yeah but here's the thing about socialism socialism in general sounds like a terrible idea because a lot of people are lazy and because it D incentivizes people from action and there's a certain thing that people should have motivation to succeed they should have some Drive and they get some satisfaction out of achieving goals and those are all things that I would not want to deny any young person from I think those those are really important things for happiness and and one of the things that they've studied when they've studied happiness and people people that are goal oriented and that set they set goals and achieve those goals it's one of the best markers for happiness and it doesn't necessarily mean money you know the problem is we like to think of it as money as it's a money thing but in athletics in art when people without finance attached to it at all when people set out to do something and then do it they achieve a sense of self-worth and happiness yes and then understand understanding of yourself as who you are this is what's missing from a lot of people and and and again I'm not a clinical psychologist I don't really understand depression I don't I don't suffer from it but i I've known enough people that have to know that there's a lot of different kinds of it it's all different and I think some people just have the a broken brain there's something wrong in there and it would be nice if there was a chemical that could fit into that slot and fix it and sometimes there is for those people and sometimes it changes their lives and then I've known people that were on the wrong medical Akari was on propecia and it was fucking with him it gave him depression you know and sometimes people they'll change their diet and you know one of the things that uh Rhonda Patrick was she posted something I think it was on her Twitter account how inflammation led impulsive decision-making led to cheating on your diet and led to poor decisions in terms of like overall lifestyle just from having higher levels of inflammation so eating shitty food not getting enough sleep drinking all those things lead to inflammation accents all those things caused you to make more impulsive food choices shitty food choices bad dietary choices bad left lifestyle and rest choices like they're all it almost like information wants more of it here it is study finds an inflammation even at subclinical levels in healthy participants may provoke impulsive behavior and an inability to delay gratification is that amazing yeah it I start to pull back with all this stuff and I always think to myself like I think I think what you and I are after like what when the reason I'm happy and the reason I feel so fulfilled is I'm able to express myself really fully like fully like I told you the other day like I certain development in my life like I was like I I want radical honesty in the sense that I don't have to lie about anything I don't want to lie about anything I want to be very honest you and I haven't always been so honest with each other right and well that's why we know each other's so yes do well yes in the minute we start fucking bullshitting you're like oh well I do what but that that's what you have your friends that hold you accountable because they know exactly who you are and it's very important exact but that so so what that allows you to do is to express yourself fully and completely the original self expression is my whole my credo my idea but but so if eating well if eating well see I don't want my body to get in the way I don't want it to get in the way so I investigate how to feel optimal so that I can just not have it get in the way and I can do the things I love yeah that is a form of expressing myself fully I always wanted a box up so it was such a mystery to me and I'll be I'm nervous today because I gotta go spar some fuck how long I've been doing it know how many years almost five years now but but but but I don't care about you know that kind of enter you know I'm not gonna Wayne wants me to fight if I'm wants you to fight yeah but I'm not gonna do I wanna I want to I don't want to be an actor who takes fight as hilarious twice and we're doing that to you because he's a fighter and he's a maniac man you've got to get in there lace up the gloves at least one time right you could fight throw the old left right left yeah and then I put on headgear and he just puts in a mouthpiece and yeah it's yeah he puts his gloves wherever he wants well which is annoying but my point is that I I feel like I'm expressing myself in that vein I was just trying to do it those shoulders they're like ripe pomegranates really you're okay I have a beautiful body doesn't bother you at all boxing doesn't injure you it's jiu-jitsu and CrossFit that shit'll if you're not careful yeah yeah I'm old now I have warm-up boxing can definitely still injure you do you um do warm up with like bands what do you do you know I just you know what I really honestly what I do I have my my whole dynamic stretching routine I do in the morning when I walk in the gym I a sum up and I just started moving very slowly I wore my body up I start hitting the mix really lightly and as I go I hit more and more and I'm a meathead I see those mitts and I want to smash that's what happens that's what happens then your back is how people have to tell me yeah tell me don't start slow start slow it's warm up warm up yes nice Jesus you okay yeah all that cocaine mom you doing coke now yeah but just a little bro if you take the edge off nobody did and nobody ever did a bunch of cocaine and shit got better well I wonder if people chewed a bunch of coca leaves and sugar dosing coke I don't hurt anybody trying that Thanks selling the problem is a cure you crash you do blow and you want to start a business with your friend all these fucking you can you microdose psilocybin because there's no real crap I mean there's a weird feeling after a mushroom trip but there's no like devastating crash that I hear people report after cocaine cocaine apparently when you on the comedown you just wrecked yeah that's one of the roller coaster ride like a lot of people they do the cocaine and then they have the crash that dopamine levels smash and then they only feel good if they're doing cocaine again because their body's so fucked up that was about why you lose your house like in three years a buddy of mine had that and our other friend worked in a rehab center he was trying to explain it to us what was wrong yeah it's no joke who's sad sad shit I had somebody describe he emailed me and he described what we were talking about my friend Michael McDonald best friend committed suicide and he's on the podcast talking about and he was got emotional I was heavy shit and uh somebody I know who comes to my shows emailed me and I guess he suffers some serious depression and you know he described the like when was so we call I say well how did they how could they commit suicide that children I mean how what happened like it makes no sense he said for me it's like being in a sauna and you know how you get too hot you get so hard you have to get the fuck out cuz you're into and he said only there's nowhere to go you don't have an exit you know I was in the song yesterday and I've been in the song lately at higher temperatures because Gabrielle Reece she was on the podcast and she was saying her husband you know Laird Hamilton that bad ass surgery he cranks his sauna up to 225 degrees and when when people like he's like who's been fuckin with my song I like it's like it's lower than 225 and I'm like Jesus Christ she's telling me this I'm like 225 fuck so I put this on up to 200 yesterday and I was thinking now while I'm lying there I'm like what if this was the world forever it was 200 Ruiz from now on forever the world's 200 degrees like how happy would you be with your children could you still laugh I was thinking like hum I couldn't I can withstand that for over standing for 20 minutes that's what I do right but what what would I do if that was like that feeling of hot if it didn't kill you that feeling of 200 degrees out would you be willing to live through that like how much would it's sad in your life yeah how much would it weigh on you a lot of course what I'm trying to say is move out of Phoenix Arizona folks that's so impressively hot it's not worth in the farmer god get yourself a Colorado Mountain home in the width in the summer I was just up in Boulder Boulder it needs to be a little more aggressive like I was just in Boulder and it just me like I I see a grown man in the middle of the day with a beard balancing on a handrail I'm like you're an able-bodied man and it's Friday at fucking to go to work right now before you know there's another dudes just sitting cross-legged with a small little flute you know who you played an elementary school dude just so unaggressive this is paradise though wow whatever I want a parrot they had a sale on Clauses a few hippies bro what it just makes aggressive I went percentage of those people are there if there's a hundred thousand people if they're ten the whole place okay is there ten people that are playing the flute they put they put they put there's nothing about white really wealthy white people that put caffeine and and comfortable Footwear at the top of their essentials yeah comfortable Footwear what's wrong with you I don't know man my feet to her yeah put up fucking put up a leather sole in your fucking foot it gonna work another so I have your toes pinched a hard wooden heels there you go I want yeah I like that and have your toes pinch a little bit you got it and whirl and wear some wool what's that call when you get bunions get one of them things whatever go manufacture shit drink your black coffee but don't you think it's nice to have a community like that well they're just all about yoga and Sadhna sure I guess it's comfortable until the zombie apocalypse hits and then I'm not fucking relying on that live you don't want to live through the zombie apocalypse why you don't Boulder is impossibly relaxed that's what I watch The Walking Dead which I don't anymore uh-huh yeah but when I used to watch it all the time for the just annoying me to the point where I couldn't take anyone after a while it I was always like I don't want to do this why would you want to do this survival I mean people commit suicide now guys like that are doing well their life is great yeah and they have loved ones yeah they commit suicide you tell me that people just gonna live through this nonsense Jamie bring up Dresden before and after the war and take a look at that they say the middle of Dresden was how does the Sun jeez speaking of 200 degrees because of the when the Allies bombed it but just take a look at the what it looked like before and after ooh we're so lucky we'd all have to tolerate that kind of shit right now I remember who was the guy who wrote oh god where that worthy where the monsters are where the I wrote a children's book it was a call where the monsters aren't alone and he was he was in the war do you believe in God he said and he just casually said no the war took care of that for me I never forgot it now it was a fuck yeah he just died but five years ago I had Eddie Israel on yesterday and we were talking about wars of aggression and that most likely we've seen the end of wars of aggression as trying to conquer new territory like that world war ii is probably the last one of those look at that man so that was Dresden Dresden looked like the surface of the Moon - and they were really done with it oh my god yeah oh my god that lady got barbecued yes it's hell terrific those are all bodies man yeah that was stairs dressing very nice go stop scrolling look at that what the fuck man yeah that's what war did that's what World War two is the true destruction of old Europe imagine what it would look like to to watch those bombs hit and just level everything like that well it was carpet bombing so civilians that you know the objective was actually to kill the the German worker to really bring that country to its knees it was it was back when total devastation the enemy was essentially a tactic there's a horrible horrible thing Wow yeah it's is these images was so stunning okay this is now human beings we build yet they prevail yeah and you know decades but we were talking about yesterday was so that would most likely have seen the end of these wars of conquest where people try and take over new territories right this territory is no longer a commodity now its services its ideas its technologies its land in that sense yeah but even the concept was that we're moving in a better direction and that things are becoming less and less at least overtly aggressive more people are able to see what's really going yeah and more people can communicate mean this is really the only generation ever like these last two or three generations where you're able to easily translate anything that anyone's saying in any other country like how often do you go like I'll read like khabib nurmagomedov Instagram page and it's in Russian you know and I'll translate it and so I could read what he's saying and I do that with a lot of his other fighters too I just hit the translate button yeah like how dope is that brings you closer to them yeah well do you get to know them you know you know and you you see that they they're pretty fucking similar even though they're different you know they're in the family worship and their food and their community they laugh they laugh yeah I mean it's humorous insults with each other if you live there you'd be in that style of living too and it's a hard place to live so you got to be a tough motherfucker that's right yeah that's right but there's a predictors there's something predictable too about how to live there certain norms and practices you know with Russia being run by Putin that seems to me to be the last big country that might invade somebody like Russia being run by Putin you could almost see him pulling a Crimea somewhere else in the world you could almost see him I think Russia and I think the history of Russia I have not been there I was there when I was very young but I've not been there since I and I have people have gone there and they they actually really enjoy it and it's you know just great people like great people the Russian people who suffered maybe more than anybody in the 20th century but great people and an industrious and everything else but I do think that they're run by a gangster well but it's not just that they're run by a gangster yes but I think that sometimes the way a populist thinks about certain things can inform their destiny right so so think about this if you were always invaded and you had a flat topography and tanks could roll in German tanks whatever it is and you paid such a price price for that again I told you when I went there in 1985 you didn't see any old men yeah they were all killed but aggression male aggression was what kept those Nazis at bay and when they were when they surrounded Leningrad and now st. Petersburg and stuff like that a lot of stories in it and I think that when you've been traumatized to the extent that Russia has been traumatized certain strengths you know the ability to stand up against aggression and to be brave and powerful those become that that becomes the commodity that's where that's the guy that gets all the money all the women all the you know whatever and I think that's a product of their history so Putin is an admired man Putin get I bet you the Putin had very fair elections he would get elected in to power he's respected you try to say he doesn't have fair elections yeah well there's a website my larger point one record I'm not saying that I'm not saying that sir I don't know anything about Russian elections but I will say this I don't know why you're putting words in my mouth what the hell is going on would get elected anyway I think just a symbol of them so might be allowed open criticism of them well there is open criticism believe it or not sure are the guys would get shot it was not openly criticized and then they get shot there's actually there's actually there is a press that actually is critical right right right but he's not you know they've killed journalists yes it's not a threat to his power well how many how many journalists have been murdered I don't know but enough poisoned in all kinds of weird google google journalist critical of Putin murdered also his supporters would beat the shit out of you yeah so sure so what I'm saying is that I think Russia's what are you saying I think Russia needs to embrace a difference after strengths are you a foreign policy adviser yes I am they said no this is a philosophy I have this is my philosophy ready okay so my philosophy is this this country is a great country and our culture is an interesting culture why why because not only are we representative hard strengths the military the NFL the can you FC all that shit the what Eagles and Eagles fucking alright bro you're right it's a classic that Canada's fucking national anthem is a beaver well Russia's a bear okay but so America is again a very aggressive but you know what America's secret is we've also provided safe corner to our gentler spirits what is this violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era okay so they just been doing that yes forever yes so there's just like presidents just do that in Russia always half murderer crossfire terrorist act in 2008 there was six of those did murder only there was another six listen two of them were brought to trial look at me right now Putin is Gandhi Putin is Gandhi compared to Khrushchev Gandhi compared to Stalin Gandhi compared to Lenin Gandhi compared to any anybody who was in power before him those guys used to kill wholesale I mean then that's a fact up to their elbows in blood who was that guy that got murdered recently that was running it was a political opponent they shot that dude down so when his death was not related to the journalists work the conviction rate exceeds 90% well I put him in jail too if they don't just kill him when the debt what does that quote though when the death was not related to the journalists work to convict so you're talking about the rates of conviction oh that was a weird quote Oh rates of conviction are very high yeah of course - the guy with the Rings got in that society they do though espionage those kind of trials yeah you're going straight to the pokey son do not pass go good luck with your trial that's true the judge is like yeah I listened to you 20 years fuck off but aggressive missile aggressive part of the world the united states like Russia however we're smarter no we're better we know we are the tectum power we protect our funnier why are we funnier because we're better that's not to general Sauron James at the commissary - general sir you too general this is a quiz why we're bad free because we we have protections for our that the people on the fringes are creatives our weirdos our fashionistas all the people that make our culture interesting Stephen jobs he said wasn't good at CrossFit no he's gonna yell at an employee yeah either was Mohandas K Gandhi and Martin Luther King but they but we provide they at least there was Duke recourse at least we know that there are softer strengths that have to be protected it makes you more interesting and it makes you more creative and stronger you got to be innovative you're innovators are weirdos yes like Linda revision I apparently was gay what Oh rages yeah wait a minute guess what what there are a lot of very smart in Russia if you're gay it's not that safe for you right you get stuff a building yeah so what you do is when you do that with people who are creative and you you marginalize a group of people because they're different in the name of purity or whatever didn't they make like really weird public statement about homosexual I like the law in Russia like its homosexuality illegal in Russia well a lot of times that are equated with pedophiles the LGBT community has a real trouble there and and it's hard to get apartments it's more of subtle it's hard to it's hard to just live and make a living so what happens is all those creative people who could be contributing and coming up with beautiful ideas they're they're marginalizes perverts deviants and that's the dumbest yeah don't get to inherit the earth the meek a lot of times that the people that provides you your fucking goodies Russian gay propaganda law for the purpose of protecting children from information advocating for a denial of traditional family values oh the gay propaganda law and the anti-gay law the bill that was unanimously approved by the State Duma on 11th of June 2013 holy shit man so you want to protect children from exposure to you know home activity yeah and it was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin yeah on the 30th of June 2013 how long is he gonna be present so let me but let me ask you a better question so with those kind of laws there's kind of lost okay that marginalize anybody that's not it's not normal quote-unquote that's not right traditional prototypical male-female right awesome when was the last time you bought and I'll wait when's the last time you bought one Russian product please besides the fact that they're essentially a one crop economy which is oil and I guess some other commodities what happens is you kill all your creativity what happens is you are not a strong country your weaponry isn't even good that's the irony of all this shit right you have that mindset and you have one idea of what strength is you're gonna be fuckin weak and you're not gonna be creative he's a Kalashnikov for good rifle it's a very good rifle make some good shit design in 1957 I believe okay 2012 previously holding the position for 2000 2008 so he's been right now he's on seven years in office this is our sir he's been longer that learning that yeah but I mean seven now currently and then he did eight years before yeah yeah but he didn't even take four years off when he took four years off he was like running shit from behind he's got to look like I'll kill you like he's like I will kill you it's a black belt right definitely kill you oh yeah legit black belt in judo yeah like he can actually throw people around probably smartest fuck and and in his mind you know Putin is running a country that requires a strong man yeah it's who they respect right so he's caught in that - even if he freakin world let's say you're the king of the world how you fix Russia you you you come back come at them with up you present an idea the idea I just presented which is the idea that you you might want to protect the people that you consider to be queers deviants and weirdos nerds or whatever they are because those people a lot of times are your creatives I don't know why but they are so you think they lived in too much of a wartime culture for like for too long I don't if they develop this hardness to them that that's why they're lacking in the creativity and the innovation and I don't think they can afford that and I don't and I think that a lot of times when you've been traumatized that you're dealing still with the residue and the trauma of World War one in World War two and that's very real and you know and also by the way communism and having nothing and and you know they have strong communities I mean my friend went to Russia and said everybody was nice to him fucking they're good people and they're innovative people in their cream look at how good they are at boxing anything the Russians put their mind to that they that they hold value for like strengths like MMA like like boxing how good they are so they're they're incredibly industrious disciplined smart people so I just wish I'm sorry how do you get weed over you hell no I bet you don't I bet if you have money you get everything you want right if your money yeah if you're connected to the oligarchy but but I think P nuns ever tried DMT oh I think he's too measured for that well I think he would want to know you know baby I bet he's done a lot of shit he does whatever he wants yeah but yours are how many how many checks you think he's got a stable well I I I will tell you this I truly believe this I think that he does he can just sit there and he has women flocked to him oh for sure they love him for sure the best circle in the world he is never doing it right that's kind of power why my my wife was like he's he's hot whoa I go but he's he's a gangster she does who doesn't like a gangster ooh jeez I'd walk away house oh it's uncomfortable steal your girl yeah take your girl yeah still your get your football ring hear about that know the story but fucking Sturgill told me about this he who was the football player where Putin stole his ring Google that the owner of the Patriots was it him it wasn't a player it was just the owner of the Patriots is that the guy that Kraft that guy okay so he had this Super Bowl ring on he meets Putin Putin says can I hold green you know and then they takes the ring off puts noise like he said something like you could smash someone's face with this ring and laughed and then just walked off with the ring and they were like hey where's the ring is like no he just stole the ring is you know Harvey Keitel really just took his ring why my ring no that's awesome this my ring a dick so he just decided he wanted it and took it off the guy's hand and was laughing and walked off with it as the story goes craft handed the diamond studded ring to Putin as a bit of show-and-tell I could kill someone this ring Putin reportedly said as he fitted to his finger then when Kraft held up his hand to get it back Putin surrounded by KGB agents wordlessly slipped the ring into his pocket Wow news circulated quickly the ring was not meant to as a gift which prompted Kraft to issue the statement at the time at the end of a very productive three-hour business with President Putin I showed the president my most recent Super Bowl ring Kraft said upon seeing the ring President Putin a great knowledgeable sports fan was clearly taken by its uniqueness at that point I decided to give him the ring as a symbol of the respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and the leadership of President Putin aka I want to live I want to live I think this this my ring no I do I do have an admiration I just think you think he's ever killed anybody with a ring yes probably he was beaten people to death by Birds W Bush administration had pressured him at the time to let go of the ring to avoid an international incident that's hilarious Wow a 2013 craft reneged and offered some backstory about the incident a legging alleging that the Bush administration had pressured him at the time to let go of the ring Wow it would really be in the best interest of us-soviet relations if you meant to give the ring as a present crafter crawls the White House saying I really didn't want to I had an emotional time of the ring it has my name on it Kraft said I didn't want to see it on ebay but but maybe putting this stuff you know there's a language barrier so he'd probably misunderstood listen but he said no he didn't shut the fuck up the Russian propaganda agent there was a pause at the other end of the line and the White House voice repeated it would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a pin calm put in the faith bro no I'm saying shut down your bag when he took that ring he punked that dude and took his ring Isana thief he's a gangster yeah up there punk why Harvey Keitel to dry 124 diamonds the great Harvey Keitel yes told me a story I think it was him they said you know remember Nikita wouldn't know what's that what's that fucking La Femme Nikita La Femme Nikita remember the actress and the TV show yes I met her once she was she went to Russia candy Alexander's
