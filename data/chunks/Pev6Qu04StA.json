the Joe Rogan experience I have the Canadian Thanksgiving back thank you powerful Canadian Thanksgiving it is a very powerful and interchangeable Columbus Day evidently because sometimes this is a 12 sometimes it's so real it ain't Oh so today is or isn't it is you know how this one's fluid like president day you know kids don't get that off school anymore no not funny well we were talking about it today like yeah they realize Columbus is kind of a mass murderer right no holidays changed more in ether from the time we were a little too now well like Santa Claus didn't become a fucking house breaking right no sexual violator yeah you're right like first it was Columbus discovered America with a Santa Maria and the Pinta and Nina and then it was oh he never really got to America he was in the Bahamas or some shit and then it got to he's a murderer and just dashing babies heads on rocks and you hear the stories of yeah they would force people to bring them back gold and they would have to bring like whatever they weighed in gold every week and if they didn't they cut one of their arms off oh yeah so they do it to a couple people they cut their arm off and everyone's screaming and so the rest of them just scramble and go and get that gold like they they they remember the last two miles on we talked about Columbus because you called him an original gangster he really was well I think everybody was gangster back thanks Joe hey you know the crown couldn't wait it was when he got back after the first one it took a long time the other guy who hated him who was also co-captain of the expedition died for much to his good fortune he was in another vote it was in the knee Nia and so Columbus got back after much of jail he had to go through Portugal almost crash-landed the whole fuckin enchilada when he finally got to Ferdinand and Isabella he had enough stuff with him from that first journey and by the way he left like 40 guys there cuz the Santa Maria ran aground and there was fuckin scuppered so he just left a bunch of fucking guys in the Caribbean and they died they got in fights with the Indians and died when he got back to Spain and finally finally got to front in front of the king and queen he had a cup you know 810 Indians and some parrots and some gold and some native shit and they went you know their minds were blood no one knew there was another world right now I mean people knew there but they didn't know that you could go find a new one like that like he came back with people from another place who spoke Arawak and had fucking monkeys differentially what the fuck is this here's a bunch of men 10 times more money a bunch more boats the second expedition was hugely funded anyone ever with horses cannons the whole fucking and show Wow the first one was like when you send your friend to fucking Home Depot yeah here's my car don't use the blinker you know right he barely made it there and back on the first one and yes he did do all those horrible things to the Indians he was no notion of them as people he was a strict Catholic he believed that he'd been singled out by God to just the idea people's arms off because they didn't bring enough gold and doing it in front of family knew that if he didn't produce precious goods for the Spanish crown that he wasn't gonna keep getting funded when he went back and that was them driving to keep going and pushing through to Asia was what he was after to find China cuz he knew there'd be ivory and pearls and all that shite but look what he look at on the other hand within 20 or 30 years of Columbus now there in Mexico and within another hundred years of that that largest silver mine in the world that giant mountain of silver that all of the silver of Asia for 400 years came from because of the Spanish trade routes between China and shit really they reduced a mountain of silver in Mexico and some in South America too and use the Indians to fucking do it mountain of silver you mean there's a book called 1493 that's the year a trans man well no well using Columbus as the line of demarcation for everything there's a book called 1491 and a book called 1492 and a book called because he's the first contact you know between West and East or between between the Americas and you and the old world and honest Bodi had he was Italian he had Portuguese there was some Spanish there's some Genoa is probably a couple Venetians by the time Cortes when Cortes came over which is what thirty years after there was women conquistadors on his boat women conky's yeah there was about two or three conquistadors on his boat Wow they don't tell you all the fun stuff they're probably that big chick on Game of Thrones exactly big giant Warriors imagine what a badass adore you had to meet a bill on that fucking mission and quartet's burn the boats and took a vote with everybody and said you want to go back or not and they were like you guys okay this is how it's gonna go we know where the capital of the Aztecs and this is our mission and absolute and they got all the Indians along the way and that's how they did it and they burn the boats they couldn't go back yeah but according to one book I read by Bernal Diaz who was the last survivor of that mission he landed up and like Honduras or whatever the little ranch when he was old he writes it forward I'm old and I'm blind now but I'm gonna tell you what the fuck happened one on the mission with Cortes and he'd been on a previous one with another conquistador and then he says he didn't just say we're burning the boats we took a vote well captain general Cortes said to the boys parrot is you can go back to Cuba where they were living or you can go back to Spain where you got nothing horse gold and fuckin glory in two-note state lon then you may die and they may eat you your heart out that's so it's such an ability to take risks back then it's pretty extraordinary I mean the genocide on the Indians is of course the disgusting part but I mean the Aztecs did have an organized army and you know it wasn't it wasn't a hundred Spanish guys they had tens of thousands of Indians in their army when they finally laid the big battle out Columbus on the other hand just kind of marauded around the Caribbean and tried to get these poor fucking Indians who had no gold to give him gold and he was in the wrong country man you know Americas were coldest well didn't they give him that something at some point in time they gave little baubles but those baubles had come from the mainland or you know I've been across the Caribbean or from South America where there was stuff and that they didn't have any gold there so they were wearing little earrings and nose rings and shit and he'd be like that was it the whole focus and they couldn't understand X they're giving him chicks and food and like well what else do you want we we don't have fucking the gold and why is the Gold's important to you it's not important to us they were like and he just what as soon as he saw any gold that was the end of that we have how do they have this that obviously they have that one account from Cortez you were talking about from one of the people that oh there's accounts of Cortez because there's friars that wrote how do they have these accounts Oh Columbus wrote a diary and guys not his ship wrote Diaries and there's a famous priest who as the the sort of the conscience of the new world who decried the genocide against the Indians from the very beginning and the Spanish kept meticulous records and there's a giant library in Seville called the library of the Indies where all of the conquistadors fucking documents are collated and Captain so there's that's awesome there are legal society so you brought a priest with you you brought a notary with you you brought lawyers with you you brought generals with you you brought a doctor you wrote shit down you fucking when you took over a town you wrote us on and posted a crucifix cents so I'm rather didn't agree to the Indians who can't understand you that you are taking over there down in the name of the king of Spain and chin how much they bullshit like well all of it I mean you know it's so when when they would tell their version of the the events how much of it was born history is all spinning isn't it yeah I don't think all of its bullshit because there's a lot of real also Indians wrote accounts later who listen within a generation obviously there's Mexicans which are the marriage of Indians and Spanish right and within a generation all of the Aztec Nobles of which there were lots and all the nobles in Mexico from the Indian tribes married into rich you know married into Spanish family so they were raised as rich people who spoke Spanish now and they were able to tell their stories as well there's a lot of first-person accounts by the Explorers Cabeza de Vaca kept a diary in I mean Columbus's is great because it's so self-serving you know yeah he owned its whole portions of the journey and he doesn't mention some of the ratty shit he did and the radish it was all ratted out by priests right yeah and then later expeditions within by the second expedition guys were mutinying on him and and fucking going back to Spain and riding on and then who were they saying that he was a terrible incompetent fucking commander and that he hadn't once they got on land he was useless and he didn't know how to analytic Indians and there was always in her violence with the crews killing each other and choosing sides and hiding on different parts of the island from each other and not doing what he asked them to do he was a terrible commander on the sea the greatest thing you can say about Columbus is he's an extraordinary navigator he knew that there was going to be a trade wind and he caught it having had some of that knowledge he knew that if he went down and got it he could come and get one back and I think he guessed that he surmised about her he knew from other sailors and shit that you wouldn't actually get lost and die you could come back to Europe from wherever you're going in Asia and he didn't have a telescope this is previous to the telescope so he is dead reckoning reckoning was terrible with instruments like he had an astrolabe n he had a sextant but he couldn't fucking use them very well so all of his reckonings in the book and he kept two separate notebooks one with his navigational charts and another with fake ones in case anybody caught him because he didn't want anybody copying his route because he thought he was gonna have the monopoly on going to the new world and so well then of course twenty years within within four years there's a whole bunch of other Spanish vessels coming over and you know within ten years it's all over there's rowing levers so when he first starts writing it down you said he's writing he's not using instruments he could he had instruments what their crappie they didn't have any idea of longitude right mm-hmm latitude was kind of a free-flowing affair if you had shit you could focus on like stars or bodies of you know islands or whatever the you could now the game which is why those maps for the world always seem so small right from then so he had to reckon by currents and winds and color of the water how the water the salinity of the water oh my they had a rope with thousands on it marked in knots and they take soundings to see how fucking deep the sea was and all of a sudden when they got near and the crew is having a heart attack because they'd been out for a couple months and it's true the crew was like hey we're gonna die and he said calm the fuck down and the next day clearly something a human had made like a carved paddle hit the boat and they pulled it up and what you know there's something over there and then the next day a bunch of branches and shit and then birds and when there's birds and branches there's fucking islands and they knew then the men started to get hip to the fact that he wasn't wrong that there was something over there and then of course he he said whoever sees the island first gets a prize and the guy in the middle of the night saw the lights and he said when they got up in the day I saw him last night oh well that douchey ratted his crew so way never loved him what lights did he say fires the Indians are burning oh wow fascinating I know right that's amazing it is it's really weird think of their gear maybe see no rifles on the first expedition maybe a couple of not rifles like ARCA buses that you lit a fuse and put it in a breech and you know you know package that I don't knock it down the ball lot of crossbows a few crossbows that was considered real high-tech to have those with you that was a big deal to have like an organized group of crossbowmen because an organized group of crossbow bowmen could wipe out lots of people well they're very accurate yeah the armor thing never worked out for them with all the conquistadors within a few weeks they'd all fucking started wearing the Indians armor because it's too hot yeah too much stuff they were metal and metal rots in the jungle and shitness the Indians had fabulous cotton textiles that made made you know so Columbus is um his journals they were all his own way of measuring the salinity his own way of measuring the color of the water so he would just describe that like that's how he knew he'd been at sea since he was a teenager Genoa is tended to go to sea because there were slave traders and there was always a tradition of slavery in Genoa which is why he didn't perceive the Indians as people as much as his first thing he wrote back was like I think we found a bunch of slaves here you know wow we can use these people to build stuff and then of course their temperament was not that way he didn't manage any of the situations right and he betrayed everybody and that's why I don't want so horribly shit and all those Indians are dead there's no Caribbean Indians it's just weird when you stop and think about what a short amount of time ago that was oh my god years 500 years seems like a long time for one person but once you've been alive for a little while like you're in your 40s and you start looking and going you know that didn't take that long it seemed like you moved pretty quick how many of these are left how many of them do you get a life my mother was 94 when she passed away think about that five of those born in 1919 yeah five lives birth to death and you're dealing with like the most horrible atrocities that you know we have like on record there was times when my mother was born there was no it's so we radios are growing out in Columbus Ohio because that's named after Christopher Columbus and there's all these fucking statues everywhere like just like celebrating this man and you grew up in school celebrating and it's just weird really what we looked at me judgment and not of any other reality keep talking should we oh okay we can adjourn if you like I know right and if you go to Seville there's a giant statue of him and there's one in Barcelona too looking out over the sea now and then the statue in Seville is in the cathedral and he's being carried in a litter you know by four Indians from different tribes and they're wearing their Indian garb and he's in a big brass and his foot is rubbed completely shiny because it's good luck to rub Columbus but in Seville was on a river and every year when the the fleet would come back to treasure fleet from the new world they'd be laden down like almost to the waterline with fucking gold and precious Goods and people and stuff and they'd come up the river and there was a chain across the river in Seville and they'd pull the chain out and and they'd sail up the river and that was a big event every year because when the treasure fleet came back was like and of course Spanish people got none of that money just the crown and then what did they do wage war against the French in the hall the Dutch in the English for fucking 300 years and blew all the money you're a fucking human being
