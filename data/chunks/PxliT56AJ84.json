the girag and experience one of the things about being a comic in Boston is that there was a lot of craft to me you you came along us a little bit after me about after my generation of open mic errs but there was a there's a lot of emphasis put on the craft of like the use of the word fuck like you know you could use the word fuck but don't over fuck don't break the fuck meter that's what guys would say all the rake the fuck I remember that I got to keep it to three three to five fucks yeah Mike Donovan used to say yes Donovan was a genius man Donovan Donovan is one of those unheard genius one of my favorite lines ever is he's talking about uh being at work in their boss breaking your balls about going on break and one of my favorite like most one of those blue-collar details that I never heard anybody bring up onstage he was like imitating you know giving shit to his boss he said I'll take a 20-minute shit on the clock if I want and I was just like oh my god I used to work with a guy who did that every day just dog in it just his life he would grab the newspaper it was just like he'd got we just had a break the Roach coach pulled up we just had to break and he used it to get he was so fucking miserable to get from the break to get to lunch he had this routine where he would go and he's like I have to go the bathroom and we would all break his balls it's like Joe fucking within this like nine hours you know and he would just laugh and he would just walk in sit down and just read the newspaper I don't you think you second a shit he would just sit on this bowl just to have this like that I never forget that shit like how lucky my life is to tell jokes let's just like that like your game plan this you hate your job so bad that you pretend to take a shit for 20 minutes every day just to get to lunch that's a lot of guys that you get fired for that oh now it dates with all the cameras and everything they can literally break down exactly when you because back in the day that fucking was six minutes the other would be hernia how quick am I supposed to take a shit and bring it to a diet counselor try to get you we have to figure out some sort of a way to optimize your time better here at performance and setting the people in the cubicles that you're walking by as you go to the as you go to the toilet there they're pulling your load while you're shitting that was one of the dumbest things we ever did we used to be used to ship out like this computer software we were the middleman between like software companies and people ordering software this is like the 80s so there's no internet so people would come to our company I mean the company I work for where they had all this software at Lotus 1-2-3 dBase 3 all this old-school shit and one day we got in this stupid guy competitive thing like fucking morons we didn't realize it like who was shipping out the most so we started saving them competing with one another and this guy shipped out a hundred packages so the next day I did 120 and then he did 160 move fighting and then the fucking management got room for it they're like oh yeah why don't you start keeping a number and then they figured out who was being the most efficient and guys started losing their job so I even back then I was like dude guys stop fucking doing it stop doing it because we're literally cutting our own fucking well you're making yourself you put yourself in a race that's there's nowhere we didn't know any better yeah we didn't know any better we look it's we like 1920 though we used to fucking go out and drink like a 12-pack of beer and eat McDonald's at 1:00 in the morning and by like 8:00 o'clock we were unloading trucks fine laughing and then we would work we do all this shit and then during the lunch hour we would go out and play basketball in like just regular sneakers in like 501 Blues remember that the butterfly and you'd be help if you come back and pour and sweat and then just keep unless a greatest shape I was ever in in my life and then in the end of work I would then go lift and go ride a bike dude what time I want a bike ride hammered I was so into working out fucking bike ride I'm on like a 12 speed bike that I bought when I still have it by the way in my garage I refuse to throw shit out and I remember being hammered on the bike and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more hammered I was going to do this 11 mile loop that it became o 7 and then I just kind of came back and I was like on the bike laughing and I was like 2021 and was only beginning to understand the fragility of life and I knew that what I was doing was stupid but I couldn't get like I I just kept picturing my friends laughing at me and I was literally by myself riding this bike laughing drunk driving up the street yeah you have a two and half hours like I'm just taking snippets from fuck in the 80s I got I got nothing left this used to be able to bounce back so well when you're young it's amazing when you're 20 years old you get hammered in the next day you barely feel anything good ice drinks cold water Donald's and tear down that place I would get two quarter pounders with cheese a large fry a six-piece McNugget and I never liked him I never liked them I never thought a nice to try the different sauces i scoped that mustard never tastes good I just wanted something to fill the void and then I would get like a couple of cheeseburgers and I think it just took giant coke and just throw that down and wake up the next day with a flat stomach and I'd already drank like you know eight nine beers we got a fight we got into a fight one time right under the golden arches and the next town over I don't know what happened these guys came in drunk classic Boston shit they just come walking in and they give everybody the finger of course we respond to it next thing you know we're out underneath the golden arches there's like five of us in two of them and my buddy were always fought he starts swinging on the big one and then the little one he sort of jumped in it just became this big it looked like wrestling you know and like they all come running out of the dressing to help each other run snow everybody's drunk just falling down we so fucking drunk the cops were there like sort of misting mace for like I don't know how long like we didn't see him pull up this is that I like being in the fight and all of a sudden everybody's like eyes are like tearing up and shit and then what was hilarious was they just broke us up and they fucking and then like two seconds later we're back in our car and the same two guys we were fighting were coming back up to the car it's like one of the cops go I thought it was over and the guy's like that was a bullshit punch under the little one goes I said memory goes we laugh at your shit uh it was fucking nuts I gotta give it up to him it was dudes you know fucking four-on-two whatever and they didn't give a shit they definitely laughed at our shit they didn't care they ate that mace and they came right back they already yeah one right into our paste right up to our Ford Escort they does not give a fuck if you still into the fighting you just got maced that's you need something happened I don't but nobody got it full-on like it was just like your I thought we thought it was the snow like they had thrown rocks all cuz we were on the ground I don't know what it was but it was just like unbelievably fucking air but we were hammered it sound like a fucking police car pulled up and nobody noticed that's hilarious yeah yeah whatever was going on [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
