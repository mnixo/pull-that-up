one Jonathan you're the first man not only the first man I've ever met who made his own leather jacket absolutely the first man who made his own leather jacket has ever been on the podcast wearing that jacket well I thank you so much the fucking sweet jacket man I'd show you my g-string but it's a little much for this time of day well how are you functioning I use it like on the side how you tie in that one well I like I prefer a sinner rear yank so does my wife because it's you can just put the leash right on it and you know you for one keep sir when did you get into making leather stuff is that a recent thing about three years ago but I mean Joe my whole life I've just been a rampant fan of craftsmanship and I've done various deep dives throughout my life into like all sorts of different art forms in fact the reason automotive design became my thing and turned into a business was because my hobbies of painting and sculpting and and finished carpentry woodwork and all these different things if you think about it transportation is like this incredibly communicable extroverted combination of so many different art forms yeah so I've been also as in my travels in the last ten years or so or maybe five I've really been focusing on always have been focusing on like getting immersed in that local culture but now I've stepped that up a notch and I'm doing like these deep dive travels into different art forms of different cultures so leathercraft I've been visiting tanneries and studying from masters in the US and in Morocco and Mexico I just got back locks last week from Mexico doing it really yeah it's super fun and it's in because for me now at this point the scale of this shop is such that I'm actually doing a disservice if I'm out there actually building your car right and because that's what I used to do I've welded in to shape it and I was on the floor but at our size I'm I'm not and our fill rates as you recall suck it takes forever for us to finish anything and there's something about just literally putting on your podcast going in my spare bedroom at home because my son's off at college the second his ass was out of there's like leather studio and there's totally built that sucker out with really good audio and lighting and stuff so being able to come from sketch to have finished good within a matter of weeks a hundred percent myself independent of everything I needed that I've really kind of felt I was losing that tactile craft connection at work well what you do is so unusual and I'm there's other people that build cars there's other people that do do innovative things with automobiles but what you're doing is at a level and with it with an obsessiveness that is to me deserves be rewarded I love it I love the fact that you make these fucking I love the fact that you do those dare licks where you leave the patina on the cars well you take these beautiful old cars that have explorer giuse because of the life that they've lived totally we do the inside so you can drive them really well yeah Mel bad you see it and you're down with the romantic sort of ya know rosy eyes a memory and then you actually drive a vintage vehicle for most people in the modern world after a couple modulate well that sucks I have a very peculiar obsession with cars but it's not it's not why'd I go from like 1965 to 1972 like with Broncos maybe 72 and then that's it and then there's modern cars like nineties cars I'm cool with I like 2000 cars but all those 70s and 80s cars can only ship Sokcho I'm right there with you and like people bring me all sorts of requests to do later model cars and in anyway used to like try and get my head around it in fact we did a Caprice Classic I saw that thing what a shit show man but what a ridiculously overbuilt car that thing was super gnarly but in reality was at the end of the day I was rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic because it was still a 90s piece of shit built poorly by people who didn't give a damn and that version of it well we had fucking sporty yeah you know that video got like a half a million views in like half a day and the client just freaked out he's like dude the whole point of this car is to be under the radar could you please remove the video oh yes we had to take everything down but for those that didn't see it it was an ex miami-dade narc undercover car and the client came to me with like a pretty direct and simple mandate he goes basically like I I trust what you do and your instincts and design the whole purpose of the car I wanted to say get the fuck out of my lane that was it that was my mandate for the bill I'm like I can do that you know that's fun that's a fun challenge you guys had that thing for a long time yeah it was it was a long and arduous build for sure but you know think the guy's brother passed away in a plane crash and ever since his passing his brothers refused to get on an airplane but he has a ranch in one state and businesses in other states and he does a lot of Interstate high speed travel so we set it up as a full-on mobile office plus a bunch of James Bond hidden oddities and shipped on her performance and what can people get out of his Lane what kind of engine do the thing if I recall I think that one had an LS 9 so dry something are cold very similar to your LSA motors yeah but same here like the continuity in the design and the consideration but you know by the time you get into the 70s even I'd argue late 60s 70s like the aesthetic is super sexy but then you get inside and execution the material choice and everything is just sucks yeah that's why I like resto mods like I don't know if you've seen it by 1965 Corvette that I have out there yeah it was just where I came in that's that's what I like I like cars that look like an old car on the outside but that have disc brakes and modern suspension and you know and it's a slippery slope right ready to stop but for me one thing that I'm keen to do with everything that we build you know be at the derelict soar the reformer one-offs or the production models more and more I'm pulling back on my redesign on the cosmetics to make sure I'm not creating something temporary or trendy in that I want to honor the original design language of the era in which a vehicle was built now I may want to elevate that and geek out on it and do unnecessarily cool shit that the production you know our company would have done but I'm trying to be super careful not to do something that like in ten years is like you know some fuchsia graphics eighties hot rod all smooth II doubt that just represents them like a reef moment in time gym ball a Porsche yeah did you see the new one yeah it looks like an RC car and I don't I haven't decided in a fucked up bad where and a fucked up really good one I'm not sure yeah it's one of those things where just some people have too much money you know you're making a four-wheel drive off-road Porsche although Matt Farah from the smoke you know man he has an off-road 1980s Porsche yeah yes it's one of those you know the really nasty upholstery in that yeah you can blame me forget some really weird stuff no I love all the weird sourcing you doing I'm like well how weird do you want disgusting it is I don't know why he's into it but it's almost like a Atlanta you know Marta bus yeah like a eighties public transit right yeah it's it's foul but it's uh it's a rally car you know I mean he has the rally caller lights in the front I mean it looks like a rally car but it won't perform like a rally won't no no I don't think so I mean it's like an enthusiast car at the end of the day you have a shitty car in a crappy boat you got a picture poison like I thought he thought yeah it actually was like a car that you could rally know things I mean you know it's got coil overs and a couple things here and there but you know at the end of the day it it is what it is and it wasn't built to do that mmm I thought he had built it that way he did see this many mods as could be done within those confines they do Drive those fucking things on dirt roads it's really weird those rallies when you watch them online it's like Jesus Christ first of all who are these assholes standing next to the road while these people go on sideways around corners where are the lawyers yeah why are you trusting these people have you ever seen anything in the old Paris to Peking race no I'm so fascinated by that so I can't remember his name right now Luigi was the first name so it started in the turn of the early 1900s I believe it was one of the first large international rallies and the there's a wonderful biography written by the son of count Luigi whatever who started it and it all started as a drunken dinnertime bet and the the idea was you know I bet it can't be done he's like of course that couldn't be done so the the thing was alright whoever's gonna go for it let's go hard whoever wins gets a magnum of champagne and it's like you know the race took months and months and months but phenomenal like it's on my bucket list that would be such a phenomenal experience to do and can you imagine doing it in like 1917 Jesus Christ they were going through villages that had never seen a round eye not to mention a motor vehicle and all the photography and all the old data put into the all the original Diaries of the driver and the co-drivers it's just such an amazing explain to people who don't know what we're talking about what this race is so it's a race by land from Paris to Peking and it goes through a Mongolian all sorts of middle-of-nowhere situations in fact that you leave it a bit up here cancelled and rerouted several times to different geopolitical dramas I wouldn't even know that Paris in Peking were connected like that right who would have thunk it I never really thought about it and I think worse it's like a three month race so it's a serious commitment but wouldn't that just be the adventure of a lifetime you know Andrew Picard right no a CP it's a great race car driver dear friend of mine you don't know him I would know you've been on this show no no no yes so I've already been talking to him and a dear friend of mine with it you know my buddy with a dc-3 that you see me flying are humming sometimes did no.3 dc-3 airplane 1944 no oh so stupid stupid absurd hidden car collection in central California so I've been slowly lobbying him and you know invited Andrew ACP to a dinner to start sort of planning that see then they don't realize I don't think either of them realize it yet they're gonna realize now they're part of the team what are you doing I want to do damned Paris Peking no you don't hell yeah three months yep oh my god I just as Christ doing yet but I want to do it really see trying to put it together yeah as a travel geek in as a car geek and as a culture geek like hello why why on earth would I so much you use a modern card no you can't it's okay yeah no very stringent very vintage oh yeah like all these photos just nuts and that's an incredibly contemporary card for usually you're talking about Larry five six is like those oh no like rolls open touring cars offices and like super weird early shit open wheel cars that's what those people do yeah so there's these are hundred-year-old cars yeah and that that car in fact in that image is a replica of the actual original car that started the entire race oh my god this super super cool experience especially you have to read in that book that's how you would want to do it well I don't know if I'd want to go brass air a bad shit about it well where would you stop you wouldn't go 1979 Datsun you know I think a Volvo sugar what's that sugar it basically looks like if a 48 humpback Ford and a Power Wagon had a lovechild it would be a volvo shu GGA i need to see this thing it's super trippy i think one of those all rallied out vintage would be super super cool su g oh that's actually a cool looking car they're super fast beautiful right inland like the ugliest way what is that but is that an aftermarket so no that's the wheels and everything dead factory other than those are more contemporary tires go go with that last image it you had Jamie with the crazy tires that thing is fucking cool oh yeah there's no the last image so solid before that yeah but I want the other image that one right there like look at the wheels on that thing yeah they usually that's usually they were command cars commanding officer cars so the back area on the interior was generally kitted out quarter-sawn dovetailed fumed white oak with like a teletype machine and all their early correspondents gear and there's such a freak of a car that is beautiful yeah that's such a cool little car I'd love to see that with like modern headlights I'd like to see that with yeah like on forties yeah solid axles Fox Racing coil overs has anyone done that no there was one that made the rounds I think it was last year I saw it at SEMA that did more of a sort of conventional contemporary hotrod Street rod build but they kind of not the way you and I are thinking that is so cool-looking I've never seen that car before there's superfreak no one really knows about him they're one of those odd moments in automotive history what size are they like with it so there's no nothing to come to it I mean it's like a 48 humpback Tudor Ford or anything to you it's it's sort of not into post-world War two so it's like a mid forties standard four-door sedan scale other than its height they're pretty reasonable they're probably really hard to find though right stupid are defined I believe there's eight of them known in North America but you know whatever you bring one over from Europe there is a shame to chew it up yeah no I'm over that I'll tell you what at the end of the day what's actually getting used and enjoyed and creating more memories none of my vehicles that are hacked and ruined as people like to say occasionally or something sitting in some static collection gathering they say that about the derelict swen you redo the interiors oh sure everyone everyone likes to talk shit well I kind of enjoy it what I was gonna say about cars I have this very narrow window so if I see like a really cool 55 Chevy it's great I never want to own one really I don't what about I don't do it how far back can I take you like 65 like super Mets it's those that year like like a bubble top 63 Pontiac or Chevy years too early no it's like the the second generation Corvette is as early as I go and then really look to 67 Mustang what year we long 667 okay so that's the problem but it's not it's my high school years during my high school years in the 80s that was those were the cool cars the cool cars were the snow it's what I think that's what I mean we've identified the problem it's not even a problem it's just like too mean like like the quintessential shape is like a 69 Camaro there's something about a 69 Camaro like goddamned they they just it's a timeless classic it'll always be they've been crawling under my skin lately I've been Camaro yeah I think it'd be interesting to do one because if you look back in the design history they were the design team and executives a GM designed that car basically in reaction to trends and European touring cars and sports cars so there's a lot of Ferrari Direct Ferrari inspiration like 275 s and stuff so I always thought it'd be interesting to do a elevated more European perspective version of that gen Camaro like devoid of badges not like I'll smooth it out like everyone does but just like elevate the trim but like that kick-ass egg-crate grille and all those details like do it more the way a small coachbuilder would have done it than production hmm there's something to him for sure yeah when Matt was here last he was showing me there's a company that takes an older Ferrari what was it which which model was it do you remember Jamie they took an older Ferrari and puts a much more modern Ferrari engine and completely read does everything but makes it so that was a GTO was it the norwood p4 or was a gto engineering in LA in the UK they do a lot of gto builds but they stay pretty true to the original form but phil norwood who used to actually race for ferrari he's I don't think he's doing him anymore but he for a while in Texas I believe was doing what they called the p4 Norwood and those are so badass so like Monaco Superleggera lightweight and they were using modern I think at that time they were what are they taken like wreck testarossa's or something some modern Ferrari powertrain and but keeping like the original race aesthetic I'm not sure what company's doing it but what they were doing essentially was making everything that you could remove and put it back to the original stock form including the engine including the suspension including the transmission including the brakes but everything was aftermarket so they weren't cutting anything there was sort of replacing stuff but making this way better way more high-performance version that might be GTO and also man if you look at one of their recreation cars that are scratch build and you know the value of the original GTO is is so nuts they're now like a guy goes oh well yeah I'll leave that in the collection and they'll call GTO and say build me one that looks just like my car and I actually want to drive it and if you sit him side by side the only difference is the GTO one has better fit and finish in tolerances otherwise you cannot tell them apart hands down so the new one has better fit oh hell yeah yeah the years a company called Rev ology that doesn't that with muscles yeah I'm cartel oh yeah they make some beautiful car I do but I wonder like smog in California would probably a nightmare well yes so right now unfortunately you know there's that new law that Tom and myself and a lot of other builders in our space have been very active in trying to get past that was for ultra low volume vehicular manufacturers act so if we made under 350 units a year we'd be exempt from crash and many expensive regulatory limitations but we had to be responsible for emissions so it's turned into a complete shit show and it's already three years beyond posting in fact SEMA just filed suit against the federal government for inaction because there will outside of their legal timeframe to actually create the damn paperwork to enact the law and Tom's caught up in the middle of that so right now he's been putting General Motors ellas threes into the Mustangs because it's the only thing that smog legal because Ford Racing hasn't bothered doesn't seem to see any importance or value in creating a mission certified powertrains when these are using ls3 once the laws start again a little sketchy Oh so past a percentage and when Tom was doing the new bodies and new everything he's going down that road even all the Cobra guys in emissions regulated states are putting ls3 s in them Wow because Ford does it's like I talked to execs if I'm like you guys cool with that like you don't see that's so that's not good for branding and yeah there's such spreadsheet junkies I don't think that they see the value the struggle is real yeah it seems like a bastardization I mean there's think about combining forward and like it's really gross when they combine Chevy and Mopar there's something about putting an LS engine in a like an old CUDA you're like what are you doing I agree but like to a point I think if we look forward that's changing because as it is today you know you're Bentley is your BMW is your Kia like everyone's sharing the same pool of suppliers anyway and a lot of these cars are just bad cars nowadays anyway so I think there's a wider acceptance as time passes to oddities but I mean look at that 49 electric mercury I did we purposely like dress the quote-unquote engine bay to look like an old speed equipped v8 and you know vintage fend of fent and header look you know the cast to try and keep those old dudes engaged and not to look out and go under true you ruin you put my video it was a 49 so we have 40 49 mercury electric it's on the Jonathan Ward YouTube page you know what that's amazing guess where it is right now in the bottom of the lake not that bad what it's stuck in Luxembourg why well to long story but we were honored that Goodyear invited us to have it be the feature vehicle on their large booth at the Geneva International Auto Show so we jumped through hoops we put on an airplane we sent it over their show got canceled oh now all the commercial because we we want it traveling by air not by boat now all the flights are canceled now other cargo is getting prioritized so now we're transporting it to Frankfurt and it's like stuck in limbo oh no yeah oh the coronavirus transport yes you yeah shit when you gonna get that back fuck if I know and that's a client's car yeah fortunately the claim is like one of the best humans we've ever worked with and he's totally cool about it but you know we're all nervous we want the darn car back yeah what's a one-of-a-kind you there it is now that is one of the things that I love that you do that I don't think anybody else is going to do I don't think anybody else would take that level of engineering and to rebuild something to that spectacular level of detail but yet keep the fucked up paint rolling down the street you wouldn't have zero idea what that is especially when that thing is that has no transmission so it's dual electric motors just under five hundred foot-pounds of torque no shifts so it's if it moves like a freight train yeah the thing is so fast have you driven a Tesla not you the S P 100 d yeah yeah it's a preposterous vehicle yeah we put the ad array in that with American Racing motors and dual Reinhart controllers and thermal management network that we engineered a whole bunch of stuff and when this guy charges us in how many miles can he get 202 that's not bad that's the more the Porsche Tyco and essentially yeah well right but but yes I can't afford to do fancy misleading federal testing so I literally just make sure my flatbed is at hand and just drive the piss out of it until I can't go and then I go okay there you go there's the range well what the EPA or whoever is doing the tests on the Tyco and apparently they sold it way short and all these automotive journalists that have driven the car are saying no we've gotten you know to 70 to 80 they've gotten quite a bit more than that I think whoever the the government rated at 201 yeah so it's it's quite a bit more than that but but they're that whole derelict program you know was like many things in my life started just from a stupid passionate idea like I didn't ever never considered a business model of doing it it was just okay I've got two young kids I've got two labs I like to do this I like to do that what do I want is my next car and I'm like you know what I'm tired of over restoring shit because that's like my OCD I just everything be perfect perfect and then the first time you know the kids nail it with a skateboard or I ding it with a surfboard or the dog takes a piss and it whatever like I don't wanna be that guy anymore so said you know what I think I like want to find something that's already fucked up and I'm just gonna leave it looking all fucked up so I don't even I washing cars and hate putting gas in them so with the derelict all you do is clean the windows and vacuum it at best and party on and then I just put a massive gas tanks so my old 52 DeSoto station wagon was the first derelict that I built hundred percent myself nights and weekends just because I had this stupid idea in my head and I wanted to realize it it wasn't until it was done and it got like the cover a hot rod and won all these awards that my dumb ass went oh wait a minute yeah we're honest and this still is you know it fits within how we define the icon brand holistically about revisiting classic transportation design in a modern context it's just a different way of doing it so that was your first air likely yeah what even derelict till I was done and then we're like okay let's brand them and we started getting tons of requests we've built some pretty wild array of them and your first one was for you yeah yeah I mean but that speaks to how weird it is that you're doing that in the first place because most people who are you know high-dollar restoration and you know air-quote resto mods or whatever you want to call them everyone wants them to be beautiful and pristine with you know handles that that disappear you know I mean everybody wants to shave everything down and [Music] moving a lot of the original character of the design that they're supposed to be celebrating in the first place so that compounded by patina which tells a more personal story of like where's this carbon how did it get that ding there's like romance and mystery all wrapped into one as far as the history behind all those finishes how many big is a gas tank in this thing that one's got like a 42 gallon gas tank I was like spare tire gas tank spare Derrick Mike screw it three cans of fix-a-flat and a big-ass gas tank I hate stopping for gas well especially with something like that it must get like four miles to the gallon that actually is a full emissions equipped modern srt8 Hemi 6.1 and it'll get six you know what it's I don't understand why but I'd have built several Hemi based builds that is the fastest and most fuel efficient of the Hemi build I've ever done I mean that thing gets probably fifteen seven real yeah we're not much metal and I Drive it like an ass I mean I'm flogging that thing granted I'm on my third transmission but oh really yeah to the first two remote power trannies which fellow builders of laid them they suck if you add even like five horsepower beyond the stock motor app they completely shut themselves so the third time I'm like that's it I'm done pull the band-aid off throw that thing away and put a good old GM 4-leaf IV in there so this thing has how many miles on it now I got about thirty-eight thirty-nine thousand miles on it so Wow I love the split windshield - yeah it's such a fun fun fun ride but you know he's going all the way back to the beginning of ikon even further back to the beginning of the first brand TLC they all started with personal cars mmm like the icon idea was just another dumb idea that was rattling in my head it was literally keeping me up at night and it got to the point that I need and this happens to me often like well you know when I did my watch and then all the different products that I've designed generally you'll start with something that gets to the point that I'll lose my remaining sanity if I don't actually create it so I had the concept for icon I could see it clearly in my head I had like a full-on 3d detailed model in my head and like my version of jumping over sheeps at night in bed was like sitting there and zooming in on an element and changing that radius and scaling this and trying that and it literally got to the point told my life I'm like I got to build it I just gotta build it well your your company it's sort of it's symbiotic with social media in a sense particularly YouTube because so many people on YouTube are interested in unique builds and interesting companies they're doing cool things like rev ology mmm-hmm but your company in particular it's so perfect because you do all those videos and you drive around the cars with this incredible detail and that's one of the first things that got me very attracted to your company was the fact like I go look at this motherfucker he's so balls deep into this shit you're so into this and if I'm not I won't take the job so it's easy to say yeah you know it's so contagious though when someone's like really into something particularly design and production and I totally like if you're not totally into it and you're not balls deep into it then pull out and zip up and go home shut up yeah do something else is if you're not passionate about it you you suck at it well particularly in this world right in the world that you're in and you know like your most classic models are like your Bronco your f J's like those those get the most amount of attention I think online and those I mean there's a lot of people making Broncos there's a lot of people making out there are now there are yeah well you know you opened up a door there's a lot of people that are making the exact Bronco you make that it's so close it's ridiculous they're redoing your grill yeah yeah some people are like oh you should be flattered I'm like no not really like I'm flattered when I see an industry swell around my first dumb idea when you know you see the ravallo G's and the singers and all these companies having viable businesses revisiting classic transportation design that I absolutely love what I absolutely despise is the Suckerfish that just will go oh well they have a two-year waiting list that doesn't look hard let's make a company and let's make our business model that we're just like icon but we're quicker and cheaper like that just irks the piss out but what do you know what are you gonna do I can't say just hard because some party on don't have the money you know but they want a Bronco you know I get it I see what you're saying but I get it from their perspective no but from a consumer perspective I understand the appeal of not having to wait and not having to pay as much but at best in this industry you get what you pay for and frankly even that is a rare equation what I'm more pissy about is companies that go oh and now we can charge more for it and let's just deliver something that looks as close to that and copy as much of its trade dress and style and kick it out at a fat margin at what's deemed to be the most acceptable price point but what your wait lists like why do you even fuck with that like what do you why do you pay attention to those maybe I'm insecure and childish or maybe I'm worried that you know past a point it's going to erode our business one way or another I don't think no not Europe I mean it's go like Scouts for example there's like three or four companies now while doing Scouts their way with their vision they're realizing their dream and I like I'm here to support him help them cheer them on that's great it's when people come into a market because they just merely see a capital opportunity but they have no passion or expertise in it that's where I get pissy I understand your perspective my perspective is always a bandwidth perspective you say if you your bandwidth is 104 that's all of your attention that you have to even give 10 of that to some knuckleheads that are just copying it's true oMG it's all it's all does it just takes away from what you're doing and what you're doing is amazing I think the last time I thought about it prior to just now pitching to you has been a good three or four months so I don't think I don't give it too much thought just every now and then every now and then keep moving yeah you were you were doing a bunch of I mean I don't know how much you could talk about this can you talk about that little BMW no that doesn't exist no I mean I guess now that we did talk about it no I I have a couple we said is little BMW has any model R&D projects in the works that are again those odd projects that we're keeping me up at night and one of them includes doing kind of a very progressive take on you know even beyond how we've been known to redesign classics taking that up ten notches yeah with an early classic iconic BMW and meanwhile it's killing me it's it's I'm hemorrhaging money in it I'm almost three-quarters of a mill deep into that project well the other one that we yeah for a long time like before you built my Bronco which took a year to build and I've had for a year and a half yeah hopefully my wife doesn't listen yeah I think it's been about four years of work on it yeah but I'm super stoked like when when it's done yeah it's something like nobody ever done seen before well I love the yeah behind it you know like I'm I'm a fan of those cars those I'm a fan of the original one and I'm a fan of you know we're doing another one - that's you know again sort of looking at how we've done what we do and like how else could we do it or how further could we evolve it which as you've seen and working with me like I'm doing that all the time and all the little things but like holistically conceptually how do you do it so we're doing early C 20 Chevy truck hmm and you know we were gonna do our usual thing of you know engineer chassis engineer the axles and call Brembo design the brakes like and then you've got like umpteen purchase orders from umpteen different suppliers and a big pile of cost and at the end of the day you could say I mean we don't have hundreds and millions of dollars in development so we're building hopefully a well-functioning what is in essence a prototype so this time for the Chevy truck I like screw it I'm going to the dealer so I just went and bought the the WT which people call the white trash edition the WT series Chevy pickup so we bought a 3/4 ton four wheel drive brand-new Chevy truck off the dealer floor for like 36 grand took that apart and we're rebodied it with its grandfather's body so now like ABS he'll hold many of the perversions of modernity everything is integrated and literally the client could go to a Chevy dealer although they probably cringe and say no no no no it's not a 70 you know look look here's the ID tag this then from this 2019 truck that's what it is so just service that's the service product and the interior dead stock c20 Wow so the gauges were working with classic instruments to design an IP and instrument panel that has the original design aesthetic but then integrates the little 3x3 digital screen for all of the you know all your prompts and digital what about airbags can't do that because the body's not designed to absorb energy thereby it's not compliant with airbag hmm but we're keeping the entire basically the entire truck - the airbags and the HVAC system in tact so how does someone register that what is that registered as still as the original truck because a client brought us the c20 so then it's up to the client say okay here's your legal entities for both you pick which way you want to title and party on and obviously most people want to stay the traffic of least resistance yes stick with an exempt year yeah but it meets 2019 emissions and everything as cylinder deactivation and all sorts of that's why I asked you about the airbags it wouldn't meet come Koretz yeah but that would be sick though yeah would be you know for a while who was it someone told me if he was Midas was trying to think of ways to stay relevant and they'd they were like knees deep and investment in retrofit airbag systems really yeah did they ever get it off and go I mean it's an absolute engineering shit show because there's so many parameters you can't control it would just never work if you were talking about retrofitting things with ABS did that overcome no and I still I'm dying to do it so the only way that it's come to fruition for me is like with your FC j8e by maintaining the original ABS system or such as the case with the C 20 by keeping the entire modern vehicle active and just rebodied it but I mean I'm dying for the aftermarket to come up with a standalone ABS module that's tunable I think it's such the missing link there's so many missing links as bitching to you earlier the automotive aftermarket quite frankly my dear is an absolute whole house in my opinion there's just so much garbage on the market and and it's like where's the quality and the markets they're like I think consumers are ready for elevated consideration and execution but they're surely there's some companies that are making good so the minority it's pathetic 10% not even really oh yeah good lord but I'm a picky bitch you are so I wouldn't say that word I might I might do you see a lot of words but you wouldn't say the B word I would I say the bitch word all the time but about you calling you a picky bitch it seems like it seems like I would say picky fellow all right yeah I'll take either one clever bitch you're a clever bitch don't say that maybe but your um your whole place like every time I go there I feel like like I like I want to give myself time like if my appointment is at 12:30 I'll show up at 12:00 just start wandering around so what do you got what's going on here man what are you doing Willy Wonka's exactly such odd diversity in there right now Angie notice in the DNR and the derelict remember former section the range of projects the diversity of those platforms right now did you see the 70 Ford yellow and cream shortbed no I did not I didn't see that it's so stupid sexy I did see that blazer that someone's selling yeah that's one of your older projects yeah I never drove it I remember you were building two of them one it was more modern-looking correct kind of more over engineered or not more over engineer but more engineered and then this one which is more of really looks like an older yeah and it has a same mechanical engineering integrated in it but it was a much different style more of what I call my old-school style where all my mods like even the badging on it where it says icon was CNC didn't stainless in the original typeface that blazer was written in so if you don't know you don't know and it's like super under the radar mellow colors yeah really good leathers it's a blue yeah I love that it's a 60s Fiat blue so the guy just never drove it no it drives me crazy I hate that I love that you drive my car I Drive the shit out of it people take it back and had like 400 more miles on it than when I delivered I'm like yeah that's going on oh it was too nice I was afraid to drive it on my own come on I Drive that Bronco everywhere everywhere and every time I Drive it people like what in the fuck is that mmm like yeah that's exactly see yeah yeah it's it's such a mechanical thing when you drive that car it's what I love about it like sometimes if I don't drive it for a week or two I kind of forget I'm gonna get in it's like everything is like you feel everything it's like there's a thing about modern cars like I really do love my Tesla it's it the way I describe it it makes other cars seem stupid like they're stupid like this is how car to drive like you hit the gas it's almost telepathic it just goes somewhere just moves it's in the gigantic navigation screen everything about is amazing I was supposed to be in Detroit right now for the Bronco launch which they lay out but the difference between that and say the Broncos you don't feel it like if the Bronco it's a manual transmission and you literally feel every gear it's there's all these moving parts that you kind of sync up with so there's all this sensation that's going into your brain through your hands visceral connection of man and machine and I think there's a place for both right but I think more and more as the world turns to autonomous vehicles rideshare infrastructure community development is even starting to go a different direction I used to be concerned about that in regards to the future of our company but now I realize like that's great like because the more that happens the more there's gonna be plenty of people who for the weekend further whatever like demand a manual tranny and a visceral man-machine relationship it feels different it feels different when you drive them there's a sweet spot somewhere I have a 2005 e46 m3 and I got it online off this dude it was only 15,000 original miles and that seems to me to be the sweet spot this is not the fastest car in the world and it's got a dine-in supercharger on it it's it doesn't handle the best in the world but man is it out it's like there's something about that car like when you're driving it makes you smile if there's something about the weight it steers the way you feel the hydraulic steering not electric like the new the new m3 is almost becoming there's like too many nannies it's it's too technical in a manner that makes the stats improved but not the connection to the driver feel more dynamic yeah it's like I've got a 96 993 twin-turbo and that to me is one of the most perfectly engineered vehicles that was designed by a core group of people who had a singular focus on what its purpose was and what it should do what it should have VOC and what it shouldn't damn the same one he had before what that thing yeah was mine okay yeah I love that car it's a great car I remember the cover of was motor trying to rodent tracked said sell your soul and buy this car when it came out when when it came out it was like you know early 90s was when I first came to California there was no way I was ever gonna be able to afford my own I remember looked at if I have the poster as a kid when you see that when you see a car like that you start thinking like how much does that cost how much do I make how long do I have to save what do I have to do what if I work twice as much history make this happen remember how's it possible I had the vector poster I had the 993 turbo I had the Countach to fetoscope oh and at a 550 Maranello poster for a little while as I approached I just turned 50 last week like my late 40s I started like having to knock at that list like okay we're waiting for right bought a 550 it sucked the Maranello should have been left to the rosy eyes of memory the bucket is shit I get so annoyed at that car can't afford the vector missed my chance to afford a pet escapo but I've been watching Farrow just piss money and it is constantly I had that BMW M car the wedge you won the original wedge what the fuck was that call him one I believe M 1 M er that's right yeah I like the original BMW supercar I had one of those my wall when I first came out to California in the 80s I remember and I think it was Newport or Manhattan Beach there's like ex BMW dealership looking space but it was an independent BMW dealership and service center and they had one in the factory tricolor livery and they had it for sale and I remember begging my mom to pull over in our crappy dodge areas rental car and going in and asking and it was for sale it was like 11 grand and the guy was like hoping and begging I was serious because they couldn't give them a way back look at that there's so nifty god I love that thing and the wheels are so I had a red one on my wall I remember thanking God only one day that's it that's the fucking car Jamie that the poster and probably it's hard to remember but it looks exactly like one of my photographers does a trick and now I've been using it so you'll get that mirrored effect if you take an iPhone that's off and put it right under the lens and hold it up and angle it just right that's suitable interesting again that's a beautiful car and back in the day like what was that then had to be like early eighties right what year was that oh yeah I was late seventies I believe was it yeah for luck that makes sense because I was in high school first year high school is 81 so that that's when I had it on my wall a key member his real name but on any mister enthusiast I don't know he's a designer and a really interesting cat he has like Lancia Delta he had a straw toes for a couple years like he's into like all the weird shit and I think he still owns one but he rocked one of those before anyone was talking about him and like had it forever drove the piss out of I love those cars I have zero desire to own one now and I have zero desire to own anything old that hasn't been redone yeah I don't like there is mr. enthusiast oh there you go that's a beautiful car he's so funny - cos like as you know I'm a big watch geek and he's like the Antichrist and who watch culture because he's all about courts like vintage courts so like for a short time Patek made quartz watches mm-hmm and like everyone shuns them but now like they're immensely collectible why why does everybody hate quartz because they just want everything to be mechanical to me that's why I won't touch a quartz watch what about a Seiko where they combine the two of them they use them the courts don't even respond she's one of my favorite of the weirdos around watch yeah not my design this is a resin service on says the brand these are super trippy but like they just came out with a SmartWatch where like when you're on the plane and you're in a new time zone and you land it'll reset itself like what I have a thumb and an index finger that worked pretty fucking good I can set my own watch how does it do that oh it's a mechanical quartz combination oh wow but these are super tricky because the entire well rotates as it tells the time what yeah that's crazy super trippy bran really interesting guys in their oil filled and all sorts of neat nifty Ness and talk about an industry in a shitshow even before this sad virus situation watch luxury watch worlds is this is crazy leading yea is it why is that why is the luxury watch world bleeding um I think Smart Watch put a bigger ding on it than they thought it would and they negated it an original anko's no lights no cameras yeah and exactly arrogant said we're doing just fine and then like now they say there's so many manufacturing options for low volume watches that the only growth segments and I read the big LVMH like annual report and the like was it 800 to 1600 dollars segment of watches pump and killing growing like crazy otherwise it's up it's like 20 grand and more independent watch brands are killing it and everyone in between is like hemorrhaging money really that's interesting there's this new company I'm bummed because when I went to the Geneva show was gonna go meet with him but David Rutten watches that are doing watches that are cnc'd out of a solid chunk of meteorite and like not like is some bullshit EDM meteorite dial and nineties Daytona the entire watch case the crown and everything is meteorite Jesus Christ how many meteorites are there like how there's actually a shit meteorites really yeah there's different grades of them and stuff and it depends on the metallurgic content if it can be machine and they eat machines left and right wow look at that funky right how weird looking that's made out of a meteorite yeah damnit you can see how they're fracturing it and his price points pretty much he's doing like a pre-launch and he hasn't launched yet they just started doing deliveries like a week ago and like I'd saved up my little side monopoly cash from selling off used parts and leather stuff and I was like ready to pull the trigger and I already had a meeting and lunch date set up with those cats and I'm like oh and what happened well the my trip got canceled does the Geneva show got canceled but anyway the point of the story is guys like this Andres on sin Lorraine Frey and all these different Mosers another great brand if they have a very unique aesthetic and philosophy they're killing right but it's the traditional big luxury bling-bling yo look at me you know those guys are just dying on the vine because I think more and more people aren't buying into what is considered luxury in a conventional sense mm-hmm before more story well you mean that also speaks to like what the kind of stuff that you do I mean people like things that are crafted by artisans yeah you know I love that meat you're seeing that revival right in the last years it's just growing and growing and growing and so I feel like as the world becomes more digital and people become more disconnected with each other there's something about like when I Drive your Bronco first of all I really like you so I love the fact that I'm driving your truck and then too I feel like it's a piece of art yeah I feel like I look you Savard highly functioning scold I smile when I'm in it so it makes me feel different when I'm in my Teslin like this is a bad ask motherfucking piece of invention but you're still in your own head it's a piece of plastic it's there's you know it's plastic and glass and metal and it's beautiful it's amazing it's spectacular innovative but it it will never be art are you in it what do you have an ass I have that yeah the p100 d yeah it's a sin about C no don't why the noise coming out of that Third Point shoulder seat belt retractor is so unacceptable wear modern clothes standards like literally the shit's coming up through the plastic wheel well in like a noise and a cold breeze is hitting your outboard ear and I'm like okay breathe how did this shit happen if there's a damn draft that comes up through there and you're hearing road noise through its you're hearing road noise through the seat belt through the cavity the horror which really yeah the retractors pull sits and air gets in there next time you're too stoned to drive I said in the backseat let mama drive and report back semantics it's that annoying it for guys like us dare I go out on lemons us yes it'll annoy the piss outta hmm interesting that Carson you didn't have a call-in number when Elon was here I would have chewed his ass about them what did that one thing me you know who the fuck is this happened years ago I developed a concept that I called the Helios I don't know if you ever saw that so I love like design challenges I like framing things right so I was like all right let's do a revisionist history approach to car design so what if electric cars had remained predominant in the late 1800s Early 1900s what if we had taken inspiration from aircraft design a couple decades prior to when the industry actually did and then what if after he did the experimental plane that age - I think it was what if Howard Hughes its satin down and like he couldn't get that last starlet to go out with him right before he lost his mind completely what if he Buckminster Fuller and Gordon burek sat down and did a napkin sketch after too many martinis what would that car look like so that was my stupid pile of questions around which I framed my design and I designed it to work on the at the time a p85 platform and basically I received a copy of a letter that's titled like peanut butter and chocolate that was written by Ilan score engineering team begging him to allow them to support me to do the build and like since day one like my launch was I don't need your money I'll go to the dealership I'll buy the damn car I need y'all's back in support on the software because there's super shitty about any repurposed er I'm sure probably s Liz and Eli never addressed it as that gentleman right there with the glasses the larger bobble head that's really rich we just did a speaking panel together in Texas recently that's his major beef with Tesla yeah he's bought a couple of them in peace yeah together a cock-block him yeah they cock-block him left and right let him supercharged but but six about in the last two or three quarters there have been major gains think honestly I think due to rich and due to the community that rose up around him that shit's been hacked now oh yeah now people can open-source hack the can data chain and people are repurposing Tesla components like I use Tesla batteries but I haven't been using their motors or planetaries or anything else because again what do I tell my client when the client needs an update or a part you go to the ruler it's like what's your VIN but yeah like stealthy V in fact has this new setup that they just started marketing where you literally take that IRS apart where the electric motor is built in there's a little access door you pull out a little circuit board you put in another one and voila is there a setup like crate engines where you know or do you envision a setup where because you know you know that the new Hummer is now going to be an electric vehicle which is really interesting yeah and there's going to be a bunch of other electric vehicles that are coming out from Volkswagen that are really cheap and a bunch of different companies are jumping in do you envision there being some sort of a crate engine option for people that want to I do I do and I think there should be now proof in the pudding to this point is that everyone's focusing on the do-it-yourself market therefore also on the cheapest possible equation which leaves a lot of in my opinion a lot of safety issues completely unaddressed and they can get downright nutty so the other issue is they're all for ease of installation and conversion everyone's thinking about doing kits that literally re a spud plate in a short shaft to go where the engine used to be put an electric motor to a bellhousing adapter to the stock transmission which is stupid because electric car is going through manual transmissions there's a lot of scavenging of energy it's bad enough to go through a ring and pinion doing a right angle gear displacement of power you lose so much efficiency and the best v's in my opinion our transmission list or go through planetary said you know for gear reduction like that the Merc is the to my knowledge the first sort of retrofit Evi that you know I being the goober that I am like I was like okay we've done a couple Eevee builds but if we're gonna keep doing them like I want to do a Mar way like I want to I want more safety I want more performance I want more range I want dedicated thermal management networks for the batteries that controllers the motors and all that and none of it existed how long did that build take oh god four yeah just a little bit over four years and that the scale of technology shit's changing so quickly in the Eevee space that as we were building it suppliers of key components came out with another generation that's infinitely better than the V 1 or V 3 already had so even before we could finish that car we were backing up and updating and updating and updating which really if you put sort of a marketeer hat on I'm so proud of the value retention in my vehicles and I'm proud of our foundation of taking something that in essence a lot of people would think is that the end of its already usable life cycle and upcycling it and breathing new life so it's good to go for decades again but now with Eevee stuff is moving so quickly that am I like making iPhones all the sudden so we're two years it's totally worthless because the tech is outdated that is the weird thing about tech right is that the exponential growth and improvement it just makes yeah like no one wants an iPhone one right they're useless so look at you know internal combustion engine development cycles what I put in today is still relevant in a decade mmm but with with electric it's a whole new space to consider so a EEM who's like well-known in racing an aftermarket for engine management electronics they just at PRI and it's SEMA made a fair bit of noise about coming out with a full array of evey retrofit conversion system so these seem to be the first ones entering the field that are going to offer a comprehensive suite of products and solutions but then again being that it's part of this industry you know I go girl the dudes at their tradeshow booth and they're like well it's something we're working on you know does all these press releases and all that on my paper well tell me some shit they can't sell to you I think I trust it will come out when you see Elon coming out with like that new roadster is gonna have a 600 miles - that is when things get really interesting in Volkswagen claimed with that vehicle that you noted earlier that they were going to make the platform shareable and they were gonna make it available to many different manufacturers large and small but I've heard stories like that over the years from you name it from Faraday was claiming the same thing and so much of its bullshit because now it's it's like I don't want to say vaporware but it's it's so much of that like VC money don't worry we'll be profitable one day and we're worth a billion multiple of nothing today so buy in and then it's like so many of these evie startups and retrofit companies come to the scene looking for that elusive FedEx fleet contract that everyone thinks is going to be easy to get and none of them get it and then they all go belly-up you know so I just think we're at that point in history where not only is the tech moving forward so quickly and not only that but the likes of predominantly only due to Tesla it's proven the viability in the market now there's purists and traditionalists and everyone's starting to poke at it and I see exponential more interest so I think you know for the next five years or so it's gonna be a bit tumultuous but I definitely think it's the future of hot rodding III imagine within five years I imagine probably half of my client builds will be electric wow that's a big that's a big statement what I'm totally pulling out of yeah but that's the vibe that I get have you seen there's a 68 Porsche 911 that has a Tesla engine in it yeah is that the one evey west I don't know who build I'm like just scamming through scanning through in Instagram the other day and I saw it a green 68 that's that's very interesting when they do stuff like that to old cars but and there's so many guys springing up out of the woodwork yeah like nationwide to various levels of price expectation range expectation etc but I think that's a really it's a lovely community too I've noticed it's much more open than the conventional automotive community is about sharing information and suppliers and knowledge and helping one another and it's it's there's a really nice camaraderie within that community there's like movement motors and Austin's doing really nice retrofits and oh yeah evie West has been around forever there were really the granddaddy's on the scene and yes no odors in Austin mm-hmm they're the ones that did that Mustang I think they've done is staying they just finished doing a 2002 BMW they did a early GTV Alfa they've done all sorts of different like pretty cool diverse range of platforms and then of course Z electric down in Orange County that started out doing just the bugs now the bugs and the buses and now 911s and it's like there's such a large and welcoming kind cool community of people in that space now when you charge a Tesla it's easy you know you look for the Tesla superchargers they're all over the place you press a button on your screen and it shows you where they are it'll navigate you to them when you try to get one of those you can't charge a regular car to Tesla super station Ken you know and there's different so there's this standard I forget the inaccurate color rich the J blah blah blah connector but there's a standard municipal connector and then there's also the new fast charge network but it depends on where you live but for example around here it's a joke they're everywhere so like I have an app when I'm driving that 49 Merc and you know I was speaking at barrett-jackson and had it there in town for a while I was visiting and there you network the apps and you find it but we made that one supercharger compatible because the clients going to install one in his house and bunk the system otherwise you try and go to a public Tesla charger it has to do a handshake and it says no you may not charge here so you can have it supercharger compatible for like I have one in the wall back there for my car so it would work with that yes that's my understanding but not in public in installation those have to go through a whole handshake protocol yeah it's interesting they decided to do it that way well it's fun we put one behind the front license plate so we did one of those old-school articulating plates like remember on the gals behind the plate so that has the one interface connector and then the other one I machine this unnecessarily groovy sort of gas cap under the original fuel door on the merc and then that's for the other style charger so do oh so you could charge it with different ones of the superchargers one pending on to increase the versatility of it you had a supercharged of fast charge compatibility and then you had the more widely distributed municipal format charger and then there's just two different pigtail adapters you can go either way with it do you anticipate upping the range on that thing do you think that someday sure swap the batteries out and definitely I think the reality is an EEV project I build I have to not only do I anticipate but like I've lost many clients because I'll be super blunt about making managing their expectations that look you're gonna spend a lot of money to have me do this and trust I will geek out and do the best of the state-of-the-art that is available to us but in a year that might all be garbage yeah so you have to understand either you're cool with this moment in time and the range and the performance it is what it is or you're a tech geek like most guys that are engaging in that and you're gonna be hemorrhaging money then coming back every couple of years for us to upgrade and evolve as the sciences evolve oh you know we build on the sub modular even like your Broncos sub module we built so your powertrain the electrical network for your powertrain goes to a two single Deutsche Tec 26 pin connectors aerospace connectors so one day when that powertrain is no longer relevant but your truck still has good platform value unplug that yank it out and put in the hydrogen or the micro capacitor or whatever the hell's working at the time remember some balloon boxes no really what is it that's been thinking about them lately I remember seeing on 60 minutes years ago and I think Google headquarters was powered by one there were these funky little black boxes that had some chemical process of creating energy and they were like early on massive news promising tech and they're super groovy little simple boxes and they originally did it for like campuses and military like large large installations for you know multiple complexes and stuff how they work then they were also making them for automotive and they had a prototype I was so excited hi there I don't remember it's been years but it was some sort of I think it was a ionic transfer process that went through a series of elements within the shielded box to create the energy but they were like self-sustaining and super groovy it's called a Bloom Box anything literally is just a big black box doesn't what's in there and I don't know what happened with him they went belly-up errs yeah so that 60 minutes so that was powering Google at one point those things and what's inside and I think Stanford was getting into it I don't know major mental flashback for me even that I'm remembering it it's just one of those things that seemed so promising that then went bye-bye same with like toroidal engines there was a great engineer up and load I that was revisiting toroidal x' and he had a he had a Ford Focus that would do is like his daughter's old car with a blown up motor he had his own toroidal motor that he had developed that could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air what this thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat test track running on air charged particles in the air yes technically charged particles as the technology improved that 15 miles an hour could be a real speed yeah Wow yeah and in that scene guy I saw him once at a trade show and I was exhibiting at the show as well says there on setup day as bored out of my gourd we were I was already set up on the Ford booth so just walking around sort of sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat and this shitty little booth it was like you know six by ten foot booth and he a show where people have like 200 by 60-foot boom he's got this odd little toroidal thing and then a bigger toroidal thing and literally like a chalkboard it's like dude what's going on so I start talking about he starts explaining the technology and what he was doing and like the smaller went at 300 foot-pounds of torque the larger one had two thousand and he was looking to develop it for rail cars for semis for cars like an on and on and on he's like yeah the biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going because the toroidal structure meant that the compression cycle from you know 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going so getting that power out of a central crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge but they'd run on like horse piss ionic charge particles diesel gas like didn't even need spark plugs so I'm like blown away by this I go back the next day where do you go booth gone empty done and I had the guy's info I try to reach out to him website go on the website I had looked at done night before gone got gobbled up five years later I see him again at another trade show with another kick-ass design and man was he a bitter man he's like yeah never again because they bought it and they shelved it I'm never selling anything again fuck them I'm licensing to specific channels of applications and that's it his new product so what do you think happen if you're a conspiracy theorist do you think someone bought him out and just oh I'm not I'm a small independent business owner real realist in that hell yes someone didn't like that and they shelved that shit so they bought it and then just shelled it yep so his next product did that yeah I don't know and he was very cagey about it then he had another product where you would replace the alternator in your car with a generator and you had a small battery in the vehicle right so this is a retrofit system the retail model was brilliant because you'd have like a pretty cheesy and expensive three axes mil a shit-ton and CAD files and one product on the shelf so in a lightweight car it was like an electric super charger so you'd replace your alternator and it had a toothed cog and for the pulley and then your crank pulley would add a toothed cog to it and then toothed belt so the idea was it would assist the internal combustion engine through its compression cycle it wouldn't it get the parasitic load of all the Fiat all the front engine accessory drive mounted things you know your alternator a small pump or whatever by pushing the engine through the cycle with the captured electrical energy from the deceleration whoa and then in bigger cars it gave you like past assists and range increase in did great things for mpg and then the story I got on that one was BMW put him under a big contract for it to license it and use it and then the guy disappeared off the face planet again Jesus Christ this guy shit happens do you remember there was a video that was circulating many years ago about a guy who created a car to run on air mmm no excuse me water created a car that runs on water and then this car that ran on water I mean he apparently had a viable engine and it was really working and then he he had a heart attack and as he was dying he was saying they killed me they killed me and then he died nobody heard from the water engine again but uh Columbus he's from Columbus to see that shit happens and I don't even like the term conspiracy theory because I think that's something created by the machine to negate things that are disruptive and innovative so we can put him in a little box and call it a conspiracy theory or whatever and yes therefore it never happened well anyone who doesn't believe in conspiracy theories I say look at Jeffrey Epstein it's real clear Meyer said that is an invention could do what physicists say is impossible turn water into hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to drive his dune buggy cross-country on 20 gallons straight from the tap he took a sip of cranberry juice then he grabbed his neck bolted out the door dropped to his knees and vomited violently I ran outside and asked him what's wrong this brother Stefan Meyer recalled he said they poisoned me that was his dying declaration that's fucked up that's fucked up I don't know if it's true he might have been nuts or both or both you know that's another thing like we'd like to just call people nuts and write them off some of the greatest innovators you know throughout the history of mankind have been a little off the rocker and Nikola Tesla was in love with illusion yeah he's in love with the latest story yeah his final days well there's a story that I read that I've tried I've tried to substantiate that apparently he was he was so frustrated by sexual desires and a love affair that he had and the distraction that it presented that he in quotes destroyed his sexuality I do not know what that means you know I gotta say man I'm kind of tired of my penis still ruling my brain you know at 50 it's like I wouldn't mind just like enough already like no you know I get it you know I mean I like turn it on turn it off as needed and when I'm reading I don't want to be walking around like maybe have a hip switch it's like something you could just oh like set it aside and become a eunuch for a little bit please make it useful make it like a GoPro mount or something yeah let's see what you're saying there's there's a lot of innovation that does sort of get swept aside that you wonder like there's a documentary who killed the electric car yeah Kevin really interesting cat the guy who produced and developed yeah lovely guy yeah I don't know who he is but that is another example of you know there was an innovation that was a little bit ahead of its time and the powers that be were like fuck you yeah we're not ready for it yeah and that goes way back I mean you know this ever heard of the the Selden patent very interesting notes of American transportation history this prick named Selden was one of the richest people in the country because he was like one of your early patent trolls who like sat back one day one you know we got these horse carriages and we got these new motor things and you know at some point there could be a horseless care so he like literally did like a chicken scratch bullshit drawing and filed it and got awarded the patent so Henry Ford in his first two companies as well as the Dodge Brothers all the early pioneers in the transportation sector in the US had to pay this prick a massive royalty to even produce the vehicle and it was Henry when he read when he after he went down and under and he goes reborn and came back out with Ford Motor Company the second time that he said you know what fuck him fuck that I'm not paying this shit and it was like eight years of court battles to overrule it and the National automotive dealers Association originally didn't want any trouble and everyone was paying and Henry was the one who had the gall and the balls to say no no we're you should not pay this prick and they finally got it kicked out but they say that hindered innovation and transportation for a good decade Wow no I didn't know about that and it was only the electric starter the Magneto's started that Henry Ford integrated into his cars that really made the massive shift away from predominance of electric cars to internal combustion so when you flash forward and you look at mr. Payne's film who killed the electric car and you look at Firestone and who was it Pacific oil but was oil company a tire company and they created that bus company and then they did all the lobbying to privatize municipal transport so that then they could slowly buy them all up and you know California had an incredibly successful electric trolley system through the West Side it was brilliant as pioneering was they had everyone they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert some of that footage in the film yeah because they they're not gonna sell tires or oil fish it goes down so let's tank it yeah they do that yeah they will buy a company that's doing amazing innovation yeah and they just put it on the shelf do you remember that early Ford cars the the early Ford cars were made with hemp all of his fenders and everything were made with happening is a video of him taking a hammer and bang a sledge and banging it off the fenders and it shows you the insane durability that hemp fibers have of yours yeah but he never that never made it into production right I think that was a wartime shortage R&D effort same thing with stainless you ever seen any of the prototype a couple of them still exist but yeah so Ford I think it was the 37 to tour it was a 61 maybe t-bird was the newest and there was a third one that the entire bodies made out of stainless and there's so GM did one during World War two during the metal shortage time entire plexiglas Buick sedan in it sold an auction recently and I Plexiglas slightly so if I can tempted yeah so the entire body is clear like you see through the doors it is so badass and it sold for what didn't seem like an absurd it was like 180 200 grand Wow so actually can you google that image it's a plexiglass prototype Buick I think it was hopefully we'll find it super super nifty Wow I know that was the company Lotus lotus developed a hemp fiber car they did like an anniversary one of their what is it st jour whatever the fuck it is there it is to the left Wow one more over yeah look at that that's insane like are you kidding me those were fucking cool that's crazy no Caen apparently it cracked and proved not to be viable so never made a pass shit just as like a sculpture to have you in your man cave things so bad yeah really cool like there's all the as that safety bracing on the door structural bracing on the doors I also for a while like I wanted to do there was a Dow Corning and somebody else there was a big consortium that was doing a bio derivative molded plastic concepts so like four years City trash cans and stuff and the durability and the life cycles and everything were epic and I was thinking for all like how badass would it be invest all the money in the platform of the vehicular engineering and then make the body literally by design almost disposable so when it's at the end of its lifecycle it literally could turn into mulch and go on the ground totally neutral right or more interestingly more liberating it for a consumer and a designer like let's say that same platform you had you could have like a dune buggy style like okay I'm gonna take it out to the desert and we're gonna go elk hunting or whatever the hell you're gonna do that weekend right anyone like a buggy Truckee style or you know we're doing construction at the house and we're gonna use it for you know hauling soil or whatever so you could have like modular bodies and different applications used on the same platform but all bio derivative materials I think that'd be super cool well I've always wondered why someone didn't but besides Lotus didn't make another hemp bodied car because you know Corvette still uses Plexiglas or fiberglass for all their cars but hemp is far superior it is me and you it's another one of those things like why isn't yeah I'm moving forward who does someone make maybe you should do it maybe we should make like a 69 Corvette but make all the panels redo them in hemp fiber hate to say it but you're going up against the petrochemical industry and I do not want to be that for you sure I mean all the chemical interest in plastics you would if you're just rebuilding something do you really think that it would be that big of a deal like they would come after you if like if you took all the body panels off and by the way it would probably so much stronger if you watch the video of see we can find that video of Henry Ford banging the hammer off of reading about it right now it might not have been what was like he lied he didn't live the video that putting out the video live I guess is what this article says what does it say angry historian wrote a big blog about it dug through it that seems to be a prototype as he was saying and it was probably plastic it might have been some hemp in there but it wasn't he some fine there maybe it wasn't even 50% him how does he know that he did begging with all that's all the places that this that the information came from forties and all the places that they were talking about making angry historians pretty balls out serious Wednesday he does his homework interesting I had a friend who had a stalk of him I you know one of those the the base of a hemp tree on his desk and he's like picked that up and I picked it up and I guess it looks like like a piece of oak like it looks like it looks like a real eye can we feel it it's really hard but it's really light it's the weirdest plant like if I don't have you ever held a piece of hemp hemp stalk it's like an alien plant it doesn't seem to make any sense yeah and its properties and its structure is so unique and there's so many benefits to it for sure yeah I would think I mean see if you find that Lotus the hemp Lotus they had it where the front stripe down the center was clear coat so you could see the actual hemp fiber in the in the Lotus but no one's ever done anything they still make Corvettes out of plastic I'm still making them out of fiberglass I would think that that would be like a real straightforward approach especially now that hemp is legalized and you can grow it in the United States and in most states I think it's federally illegal yeah I you know I I for my leather goods like this jacket is all hemp thread really super strong it's better than anything so that stripe down the middle is all the clear coat natural hemp fiber mmm so that whole car is made out of hemp what the hell's load is doing these days like they keep coming out with all these concepts and prototypes but then nothing ever seems to be actually happening or coming out I don't know they had that little car you know I guess it's that one is that the one the really little one that they had and at least I drove it one day I was like what will you have a fucking pair of Chipmunks running the the engine with a flick of one of those hamster wheels but then even like last year at the quail we were up there showing a car they debuted a concept that was lovely was kick-ass but from what I heard what's his name Behar they're making such a disgusting amount of money and licensing like keychains and bullshit that like the core even the engineering Tier one engineering aspect of Lotus and then the production they're like fuck that that's complicated wait a minute they make their money off keychains yeah from what I been told that's what's kept Lotus in business over the last 10 years Lotus keygens kid just merged just whatever watches mercs bags whatever shit that anyone wants to put the Lotus name on we're selling licenses left and right but they're not selling cars I don't think they have anything in production right that's so weird and they've shown like more concepts than multinational car companies well I know Matt Farah reviewed that rear engine or the mid-engine one that they have and said it was awesome beautiful car but you don't see them you never see them I think they're one of those interesting companies that like kind of like a Malcolm Bricklin situation of like just was that dude Malcolm Bricklin so one of the best car books ever that John you know Johnny Lee Berman right yes dear friend Johnny had recommended it's called the worst car ever built and it's the story of the Hugo so it's a fast read it is absolutely hysterical the shenanigans and shitshow around that car and behind all of it was Malcolm Bricklin who's like the PT Barnum of the automotive industry the amount of stories and stuff this guy is lived through and caused and gotten away with is insane but like Hugo their cars were like late they were gonna debut at the LA Auto Show and they realize like oh shit we don't have booth models or anything what are we gonna do so Malcolm Bricklin in the story goes that he drove around downtown LA and just where are the prostitutes where did the whores hang out around here went over and like hired a bunch of the girls - they're like could you put on something a little more tame and like be here at this time for these days just like run this show can be their booth models and rep the cars but like the cars is they came out of the container had disassembled themselves and transit like just on and on and on shenanigans is hysterical but that book is so fucking funny I've never heard of that before that's interesting yeah I would think that for a guy like you who's building cars away you're building them well the real challenge would be staff no I think that would be the real challenge is finding people that understand what finding fellow artisans that also understand how to build cars to really get what you're doing yep that and I love the state of California but they do not want me here how so they don't want me in business they don't want anyone in California making anything except maybe solar assisted bicycles they did the business climate in the state of California and the associated HR costs and insurance and workman's comp and liabilities like every couple weeks there's another absurd ruling that we get an update on that like wait what it's like you mean to tell me if I catch a dude smoking crack while on the clock stealing my inventory I can't fire his ass on the spot nope what oh yeah now if you do you have to give him a week's pay at the time of letting him go and you can't make him sign anything that indemnifies nor protects you you have to put him on probation and offer therapy and resources no stealing merchandise and smoking crack like literally the most vagrant disrespect of safety of policy of company goods like it has gotten so bad and like we just got a letter from the from the building inspector came by and he's like yeah you know those those automotive lifts in your building like yeah it goes yeah you have 30 days to remove all those what thank you that was pretty much my response repaid them because yeah you're not so in for automotive I'm like you see this plaque on the wall the congressman councilman and the mayor you see this picture of me and the mayor when he did the ribbon-cutting here's the email record showing the mayor's aide personally and delivered me all my occupancy permits because yeah not my problem I'm like what about the last nine years of inspectors coming in all the time saying you guys have the cleanest most professional aboveboard shop kick-ass well done thank you so much for making my life good it goes the other idiots I'm the new inspector so the new inspector says you're not licensed I'm not zoned appropriately to be in business where I met despite having permits and everything for it did they change the zoning I don't know what the hell happened other than this new guy seems to be a prick and wanting to show his value what's his name mm-hmm I actually don't remember but I literally at every turn it's killing me and like I have a piece of shit I think at this point to the amount of costs related per employee should be going to my employees not to insurance companies and all this bullshit that gets tagged on top it's like for every dollar you pay someone now there's another thirty two cents that should be going to them that's showing disdain they want you to do how do they expect you to work in these cars oh I this is something you can fight or you gonna have I had to lawyer up and we're fighting it but I mean literally I honestly think they'd rather have a commercial weed facility in that building kicking out a hell of a lot more tax revenue than us really yeah do you think that's what they're doing yes so you really think they're trying to make it challenging for you to do business so that you quit yes and just about any small business owner I know in the state of California that challenges we're facing or getting to the point of making us wonder about our own intellect for staying in this state I don't know I don't want to go anywhere I don't want I love it here so what would you do with this if you lose this you know if it gets the point that we have to oh you mean this building situation yeah I'll fight it or a move and I'll deal I've been through this ship for so you find someplace where you are zone just keep partying on but I know I'm zone fine where I'm at I'm just gonna have to you know instead of running a business I have to now become a lobbyist and you know knock on doors and ring phones and dig through my black book to find people with the clout to get the city to go so I'm just flexing like what is this I think so and at first he seemed like he chilled out when we went above him and then everything was good and then a week later bubbled back up again and we got another notice so we're in the middle of it right now but you went above his head and you got approval verbal verbal yeah and then in city I don't know what he's talking about you're fine you're good to go and then you go back again right now it's a problem you said what in the fuck that's crazy but look at the end of the day the reality is also I'm going against what trade schools are telling young kids going into the field what are they telling kids they're telling kids that here if you run this scan tool you'll be you'll make 150 grand a year as a lead tech at a BMW dealership what they're not telling these kids while sucking all their money out of them with crazy you know student loans and stuff is yeah that's like the kids in the street in Brazil all wanting to grow up to be Pele there's not that many Pele's so there's plenty of dudes at that dealership that are making minimum wage or there abouts or dealing with the politics of flag hours or whatever but what what I'm having a hard time with is we charge $100 an hour for our labor I can't just keep charging more and more and more it's level of what we do with projects that can run thousands of hours per job the math is it almost doesn't make sense like I honestly have guys that I think should be I should be paying them 70 80 90 100 grand a year to do what they do because they're artists and they deserve it the bullshit of running a business in California all of the exponential costs that are added on top they even D incentivize overtime now if I give adieu to overtime it ups his tax rate and they take even more out of the overtime well is whatever happened it like GDP and employment and productivity and like keeping everything rolling there d incentivizing us even to offer our employees more money with more hours it's it's tragic and I've lost several guys now that have gone to do jobs that they hate but like I'd the Department of Water and Power I've lost several employees at DWP because they'll they get a pension they get killer health care they get 90 grand a year to pick their nose and watch other people work well sucks what is this is this a democrat thing I think it might be the uber green side of democratic because I think though whatever little two-party systems as shit shows it is anyway I don't think it's about which party so much is I think we've empowered attorneys to such an extent that it's it's downright sinful because it's hindering industry it's Henry innovation and there's just so many constrictions because everyone has their hand out no one's no one's self accountable but everyone's liable so then you you know then you need a policy for that and so than that I mean we had a we had an employee once suus he jumped in a dumpster to stomp on everything to compress it in the dumpster it started moving across the of ramped parking lot and he jumped out of it clipped his leg on the way down and shattered his arm in four spots well he sued me I was like well it's not on your job description did someone tell you to jump in the dumpster and stomp on it no and then we discovered the guy in brittle bones due to chemical agent exposure in the military but it's my problem like what people what ever happened I'd like be proud of what you do be respected be well paid everyone's content everyone's like inspired and engaged and I just feel like more and more there's just so much noise and lawyers and policies all this crap it's like we're just here to like do something we love and get rewarded and pay people I mean I'm stoked that you know we support directly 58 families plus all our sublets and everything else but it's it's hard to retain people when when weak we know we can't pay them what they're worth in this business environment I have a really hard time with the whole crack thing catching someone stealing smoking crack and you can't fire them that seems so strange you have to give them a week's worth of money yeah on this spot on the spot so you have to cut him a check this is getting so stupid that seems that seems it's and you gotta offer from therapy I mean but I tell you man more and more Surf Shack with like my own little garden out back in my little leather studio and sell shit on Instagram simplify life me my wife and my dogs I know what you're saying my own one bag arrived you know Jamie's Montana anything dealing with cancer you know my wife got diagnosed with cancer last year and we've been in the throws of chemo and dealing with that whole shit show you want to talk about something that puts everything in a perspective yeah you know we really made us stop and sit back and go okay all right that doesn't fucking matter like a lot of the bullshit a lot of the noise in our modern world does not matter doesn't mean a fucking thing so that kind of reinvigorated but also refresh my perspective to remind myself is someone's panties are in there not because their icons been in storage for six months they didn't plug it into the tender and the battery's dead and they want to call him yell at me about it I think yeah like like give me your bank and fill us in to your money back oh well known as there's not what it okay then why are we interfacing like this you have a dead battery you haven't been there for six months dude that's gonna happen stick your back well that's why the icon is a real easy way to remove the battery post right and an integrated tender if you click that box on the fucking configurator yeah well there's a lot of silly people out there for sure but it's just weird when they're empowered by the government well yeah you know when you don't have a common sense approach to knuckleheads you know if you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck and it's like the you know the homeless challenge that we're facing and you know when we try and address that in my opinion when that's addressed on a state level it's gonna fucking fail because then you're going to overburden that state even if they're innovative and brilliant in their solution then the whole country tilts to that state and they all come a sliding over yeah and then the one in Venice that is like super nasty low occupancy level because the homeless are like wait a minute there's a curfew and there's drug tests screw you I want to do whatever I want I want to smoke what I want to smoke and do it's like no Sojo I'm running for office oh this is my platform I'm announcing right here Catalina Catalina kind of sucks have you been there it's not the best place okay so how about this move to the hall most people to Catalina yes I want to live there though no you go there you come nothing but you go there contribute to that social system mm-hmm we'll give you you know seed money and development free internet for all free and you actually start producing something of value to society and get your shit together and come back home then we'll send the ferry over we'll bring you back to the prison for homeless people yeah what do you think how they gonna get food um airdrop oh no crow your shit there's enough bison to feed him for a couple it's not gonna work all right that's that idea so I'd also my other platform would be you cannot evoke the law in your defense in the process of breaking the law like when your stories are like friend of mine NFL player called a dude breaking into his car like he's in the gym and looking out the window and sees like legs hanging out the passenger window of his BMW is like motherfucker he runs down there he literally grabs a dude by the ankles and Yanks him out of their car blows the guy's jaw out knocks his teeth out on and on and on my friend ended up getting sued for that and ended up liable on owing this prick a bunch of money like really but he was in the middle of breaking the law and stealing the guy's property you should not account for anything Texas they don't give a fuck that was California you should go to Texas yeah Austin's looking better and better Austin was pretty good I some buddies with some shops in Austin and barbecue from my friends at the barbecue have a kick-ass barbecue people yeah it's a great place in front of me if someone's breaking your car you could just shoot them sweet sign me up I mean I don't think you should shoot them but yet you could you know I'm not advocating shooting people for breaking shit up in the foot and then run over him what do you feel better with that well I feel like if you break into a former NFL players BMW and he catches you you should get your fuckin ass-kiss yeah totally a big giant man I mean that's that's how you learn how to come in to not break into someone's Cooksey that's going back to this lack of accountability yes like well that's the problem with Democrats that's the problem with this country and then there's a problem with particularly the state the state is so progressive minded and I'm a progressive and I'm a very open-minded person but you can't remove responsibility you can't remove the consequences for actions you can't do those things can't give people participation trophies and that's what you're doing yeah and I mean this is that attitude that people have by thinking they're being open-minded and kind and nice you are just enabling people to keep fucking up their lives by not getting a word by showing up they have no consequences and you know you can't litter right so how how come you can put a fucking tent filled with shit and just Park it under the overpass but if I throw a can of Diet Coke out my window into that same spot I will I will get a fine and I will get arrested rightly so but why why can this asshole park his fucking tent filled cracked there how come you can have cardboard boxes just scattered out all over the place that you sleep on I don't know what to tell that guy and how to change his life once he's got a tent once you camped out under the overpass that you've there's a lot of things that have gone wrong to get you to that position but what I do know is you shouldn't be allowed to have a fucking tent you shouldn't be a lot of these tent villages under our town members lately in downtown yes I went to dinner with the other night in Venice one of the last times I'd go to dinner for the next couple months I think in a restaurant but when we went down there there's a nice house like a beautiful house in Venice across the street there was 50 tents just filled with shit broken bike parts and garbage and just things piled up and you're like this is the problem of being open-minded this is the problem and this is why people like when Rudy Giuliani cleaned up New York City with this totalitarian approach like the people that live in New York City that that weren't homeless we're like fuck yeah finally take these homeless people off the street do this fix that does it make it harder to be a criminal make it more difficult you know and the the downside of it a lot of people got arrested that probably shouldn't have a lot of people got frisked there probably shouldn't have a lot of people got harassed there probably shouldn't have but on the plus side you got to crack a few eggs if you want to make an omelet and they cleaned up New York City and they cleaned up the homeless problem that they have there I think that's like probably our most vexing modern social challenge yes is it's really health our health care mental healthcare challenge the bottom line is how did you get to that position like there's there's a many via federal negligence there's that the you know the original problem when they changed what what it constitutes to be mentally incapacitated ministration yeah yeah I mean they gave him a bus ticket well that's what they're doing I believe they send people over the country everybody likes to do that they send them to Palm Springs Gary get out what the desert what am i doing I'm with you though man like the restoration of personal accountability like to me my word is everything to me and I'll lose my ass to honor my word if I told you I'm gonna do something to whatever extent I have to go I'm gonna do it because my generation whatever my dad I was raised where that meant everything above all other things yeah but more and more like corporations have no conscience and we've that's been encouraged more and more and more right so people there's a lack of accountability there all the way through it if your kid even shows up to school he gets a fucking award like no we need to celebrate the leaders the people that really are pushing and going and let them reap the benefits and gains of that and our government should be protecting their energy their efforts their investments their intellectual property but I just feel like it's almost like everyone should everyone should get something and it's like no that's not how it really works like never how it works yeah it's never been how it works and it can't be how it works it's the whole reason why it's difficult to get out of bed because there's a reward for accomplishing that it's difficult to show up at work but there's a reward for accomplishing that do you think it's an exercise do you think we could segment aspects of our culture our society meaning do you think it would ever be viable and I'm so politically ignorant so maybe you're just gonna laugh me out of the room could you socialize legal defense education and health care like do you think that would be viable as a hybrid where it's a democracy it's it's a capitalist driven system but you take the the money therefore the corruption that takes us like the business of medicine versus the art of medicine are completely different things you know now give you a pill so you can live and then we'll give you another pill to deal with the ramifications that the side effects of the pill we gave you versus the cure got fucking shelved you know cuz there wasn't a rev model behind it yeah do you think we could ever would would that ever work I think education in healthcare for sure can be socialized the questions would you get the same education the same health care if it wasn't socialized I think as long as you had private options you would and then the problem is well how much funds go towards these public education solutions versus the private options that have the answers yeah that's that's already the issue and that's because when people want look if someone is excelling at something whatever that is whether it's teaching or their it's you know being an orthopedic surgeon they want to be rewarded for their efforts plus they've probably cured acquired a massive amount of debt right they if you're a orthopedic surgeon you've gone through Medical School there's a strong chance that you're deeply in debt by the time you start cutting people and that's a real problem it's a real problem because that also incentivizes them to perform surgeries that are not unnecessary that are unnecessary rather and you find you hear about that all the time I mean there's a lot of doctors who just want to start cutting people you know and they don't have proactive solutions like listen let's this this might take a long time but let's let's try to rehabilitate this first let's particularly with like back issues well that's all gone yeah I remember when I first started having my health issues you know I'm epileptic and when I first started looking into that and they were throwing darts at the wall for a decade I don't know could be discovered that endocrinologist cardiology all these different specialists and literally the cardiologist sits me down and it's like okay so here's what here's what life with the pacemaker is like we're gonna do this I'm like well back the fuck up like show me the math like I'm far from a doctor but I'm kind of an engineering guys so like show me the math like this is a result of that which causes that as indicated by this therefore we're gonna do this couldn't it's like well we just figured you know it's probably a safe measure and like so you haven't even seen anything that clearly defines that that's even the issue and your fuck you I'm out of here like well he's dealing with 15 people a day yeah he's probably exhausted Lonnie's got a big note and yep big loan mm-hmm and also a little desensitized they get desensitized to people struggle and you know did you you and I talked about this but did you look into ketogenic diets did you ever look into the idea of ketogenic diets and how it benefits epilepsy I did just to the extent of doing some Google research promptly after our discussion and I also was looking into medical marijuana approaches to it but again the beautiful state of California is such that I lose my license if I don't take the chemicals that big pharma promote because they do biannual blood tests so even if test you for those chemicals oh they do blood tests to make sure you're on the shit but wait that's well is that just assuming there's no way to cure epilepsy correct that seems insane because there's especially with all the proof in is CDB CBD CBD solutions right and it's been medically verified but the state won't acknowledge it so if you choose to go that route not only obviously your insurance company won't pay for it but you lose your license and everything else related to its regulation but would go through all of that and you have no issues like what if you could prove that your epilepsy is in remission then that can work but it takes a year or longer to be able to prove that Jesus Christ so you have to take medication yeah unfortunately I haven't had a seizure in years so I'm stoked yeah I have a friend he'd taken and his son has issues is epilepsy and he got him on CBD knit stopped dead in his tracks young boy - his like three years old mm-hmm yeah stopped dead in his tracks yeah it's um CBD is an issue or a solution for some people with some people with epilepsy ketogenic diets are another one they actually started using those on certain team members that were using rebreathers so certain seals and team members that were using these rebreathers some of them would have seizures for some reason you know rebreathers or it's not a scuba gear today set up and one of the ways they found to mitigate that was to put them putting them on ketogenic diets there's something about your body burning fat opposed to carbohydrates that lends itself to stopping these sort of seizures and they don't completely understand why or whether or not it works on everybody that's a lot of research - in the cancer field in regards to diet impacts is pretty phenomenal dad out yeah it is yeah yeah one of the things that I'm hoping out of this coronavirus scare is if people start taking their health more seriously you know and your immune system and just maybe if something hits you and you're in a compromised state you're so much worse off then if you're in a healthy state I mean it literally is like having insurance on your body being able to defend itself from an outside attack yeah that's what a virus says stop yeah listen to it honor it yeah she'll stop your roll get better keep your defense up keep your strength up I mean that that is literally the benefit of a healthy diet and exercise is your body functions better and it can ward off attacks and that's what people have to think about when you the flu comes around or anything comes around that's an attack it's an attack by a viral entity and if you have weak defense if you have a poor immune system if your body is already compromised because of tobacco use and drugs and all these various things it can wreck your system and you don't exercise and you're gonna get around to it but you never do and you eat like shit well guess what man you have no fucking tools you have no no weapons to defend yourself against this entity I'm worried about Jamie right now like I'm not letting her filler car up a gas go to the bank yeah anywhere like me and my younger son Quinn who's still at home like let us handle everything yes your immune system is severely challenged right now just finish chemo like lockdown but you need to go to work and build people because we got to meet payroll but other than the other than that like let's stay low that's yeah heads it's up it's such a trying time it's I'm just really hoping it's a wake-up call for some people that they really understand how important it is it's not there's there's so many intelligent people that I know that treat exercise and diet and just your own physical well-being as if it's a frivolous pursuit shallow-minded people that that want to you know the the egotistical vain people that want to have nice bodies and it's for fools you know that the intelligent person concentrates on the mind the Intel but I think that's a really it's an that is in itself it's an unintelligent way to approach it it's not holistic you should treat your mind as if it's a part of your body right and that's that's again it's more of that polarization that unfortunately we were seeing in the last ten years that's just growing exponentially so that's one thing I hope out of this is that us amongst ourselves as Americans and as a larger family of people who only have one globe to live on I hope there's more I hope to see this create more cohesion more more of a unification amongst all mankind yes to realize we all are dealing to different extents with the same challenges the same potentials the same liabilities and get people back tribally like together yeah I couldn't agree more and I think that sometimes it takes a real outside challenge to bring us together very scare yeah a scare I think this is a scare I mean it's a challenge and it's such a reminder because I've always felt this it's also fragile right like even our Western reality like okay just just from a small business owner right like I think it's probably fair to say that nationwide any business that's under say whatever 20 million a year our kind of hand to mouth give or take a couple months yes right then you look at our distribution systems our infrastructure all of it it's it's also fragile so any arrogance because of convenience or wealth or resources or connections that we all have it's pretty quick that none of that shit matters yeah then like it's also fragile but I hope again that there's a positive spin to that where people can understand and acknowledge that and therefore learn and connect and have greater consideration for our neighbors ourselves our own bodies our mine our spirit but like get people more connected and like face out of their fucking phones yeah I'm really interesting really interested to see what happens coming out of San Francisco because they're the first ones to impose a real lockdown like you're not even supposed to go to work I don't know how they can say that I don't know how they can do that and I don't know what's gonna come out of that you know but again they're still dealing with medieval diseases on this tree because people are shitting everywhere I mean so you're really concerned with a Portland should have been first well I mean you're really concerned with with people's health and you've got people literally dying on people's cars all over Haight Ashbury I mean it's it's fucking not San Francisco is there's apps where you can see the human waste scattered out throughout the city so you can you can people when they see human shit they entered into the app and it's spectacularly disgusting when you look at the map of San Francisco and and human shit it's all over the place and they don't do a goddamn thing about it and you know they seem to think that these people need help and these people need but it's like if they're those people were murdering people or assaulting people ever if all homeless people assaulted people would they treat it the same way well you know they would say well these people are breaking the law now we're gonna arrest them well they're breaking the law they should be breaking the law if they're camping out and throwing garbage everywhere to I'm not saying you should arrest all of them but you need to do something you can't just look at it like it's not a gigantic Public Health Service vexing vexing issue man that the diversity of situations and stories that lead people to be into that situation is so complicated it is and you're gonna see more of it if you force people to be out of work for like the OPC is a big charity in LA that's working on that that that my children's charities had some sort of Kevin Bacon moments of interrelationship and I look at all the efforts of charities like theirs and how they address it and it's like fuck that's a tough one like I don't understand how how you'd even approach it's gotten so far gone I mean it should have been nipped in the bud they should have figured out a way to stop it as it was happening and put a considerable amount of resources towards that but all these other problems seem to be more on the forefront and more on people's mind when when it comes to elections and so they just sort of let it happen I think like you said back with Reagan there not being a forcible state multiple state lawsuits against the federal government because of the load put on the state systems by that federal change in the limit of health care for for mental issues yeah that was really kind of the root of it right I mean I grew up in New York City in the 70s and it was a fucking zoo but that now even pales to what you're seeing like I went to visit a supplier three weeks ago in downtown LA and like just trying to drive down his street to get in his parking lot it was like it was like a circus man yeah and like they've not only taken over the curb in the street they're walking down the middle of the street with an attitude like I shouldn't be driving on this street and like half the businesses on the block literally gave up and closed down and they can't even like my friend wanted to move his company and the realtor is like Senor fucking dream and it's like never gonna sell this building right now like look at this neighborhood and there's nothing they're doing yeah they didn't I don't know you know it just keeps getting worse when I was filming fear factor down there in the early 2000s it was bad I mean I was like does everyone know about Skid Row like this is crazy you drive down Skid Row and you go what in the fuck is this is a zombie movie and it is tenfold worse now there's 70,000 homeless people in Los Angeles I mean that that's an enormous amount of people that's you know the way I describe it is it's basically almost the size of Boulder Colorado but homeless are the entire city of Boulder homeless that's what it's like it's crazy how many people there are and that's just document they don't really know how many there are I mean it's it's an enormous number there's just a rough estimate and that's like all these kovat estimates wait a minute yeah in the two minutes ago you were saying no no that's a test so how are we supposed to trust any fucking thing you're telling yeah no one has any idea and also the fact that so many people are asymptomatic so they're warning around with it and you know and the real issue is the immune compromised folks and then I'm worried as a business owner like at some point in my disrespecting my employees my culture by staying open like should I be closing or my breathing into it's like I'm torn between this is social media gone wrong too much hype and too much bullshit versus speaking to friends a friend who's a scientist in the viral field and what she's telling me and friends who are doctors and a friend is a doctor in Milan and the shitshow he's dealing with it's like okay no it's not just like but it's it's it's very interesting trying to I think all of us in all over lives right now picking our paths picking our priorities how do we address this but then as a business owner again in California there's liabilities to how you address or don't address it mm yeah that's it's very interesting do you think you'd move to Texas no couldn't do it frankly if it got that bad you'd quit I'd rather sell the company into someone who thinks they're smarter than me and they can do it and scale it and go there I just stay in my happy space and just make leather jackets yeah just make shit travel the world spend time with craftsmen spend time with my family when you're you mean you've you know made this very very successful business and very I hesitate to use word iconic but it is do you have goals outside of what you've already done or do you just do what you enjoy doing I do what I enjoy doing having said that I I need to listen to the capitalist Pig on my right shoulder versus the creative geek on my left shoulder in that I we've been quite successful as a company I'm honored how many people know the brand but I haven't like amassed some you know great personal wealth if the shit blows up tomorrow you know I'm looking for a job you know so I need to figure out how to cash in so to speak on the the the equity the brand is created in ways that don't step on the brands we we so like I'm dying to get into all different aspects of industrial design I'd love to do that on my own or through collaborations but I think my goal would be to diversify my product line to keep revisiting classic design in a modern context but in many different ways and many different product signals so like I am right now on part of the trip to Mexico and and to Morocco those trips were in the last three years of practice and building prototype wallets and you know sort of side hustle on Instagram and stuff is really getting granular with it because I do want to start a leather goods brand as to make a jacket like that I'll buy it that jacket looks sweet yeah wallets and belts and jobs you make them the champs dude I literally like this this jacket is like hand cut hand stitched hand not a single machine used like shitshow commercially unviable but I'm working with hor Wien leathers in Chicago and a friend's brand called black bear and we're like studying different patterns and prototyping so I think I'm pretty soon I'm gonna launch like a limited run kick-ass jacket that's like layers a story down to why that leather and who made it and how and on and on and on I'm in yeah tell me what commands art exploring well I was like ready to go and now I'm thinking I'm an idiot to start a new brand right now so I'm well for a bit yeah who knows what the fuck is gonna happen this economy and like I said I'm really interested to see what happens out of San Francisco because they I think they've imposed a three week mandatory lockdown yes that is a long time to go without income a long long time especially the burn rate of a company in my size mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah that's what people don't understand I mean I mean when someone looks at something that you create like an icon Bronco and you know they look at the expense of that thing and how boy it must be nice like that's crazy like this guy must be making look at four-thirty group yeah well they just the that I mean I went to visit the car when you're making it the level of detail is off the charts from the polyuria coding of every fucking component under undercarriage of the car to the media blasting this and they're replacing all the bolts and all the wiring all of this you know you don't really understand what it's like to see a handmade car built from the ground unless you watch it yeah being built from the ground up asinine stupid yeah business the amount of money it goes to debt costs to build one of those things is fucking crazy you know when people think of a car oh but you can get an f-150 for 39 grand which I look at and go how is that possible like that's amazing you guys can do it I'm gonna pick it apart all we want oh that's amazing it is amazing robots I mean I mean efficiency of the production modern production line look at this all blows up tomorrow I have had multiple lives in multiple careers that have all been amazing experiences I wouldn't change an a single aspect of my life thus far other than my wife's cancer battle like it's just been an amazing ride and if your shit all blows up tomorrow and this is as far as it goes I'm honestly I'm stoked it's been amazing the perfect world I'll keep pushing limits I'll keep trying new platforms I'll keep pushing tech and as long as I'm able to not have a real job I am just super stoked yeah well that's the key that's a goal the goal is to get through life without a real job right totally no like literally we ran it about this if anyone wants to listen to our first podcast when we first met and just we've geeked out for hours and hours but like the whole educational system alone like should be focused on helping our youth understand what they're passionate about if someone finds their passion and you make it their life they're a happier individual and they're gonna break new ground and be of great value versus trying to fit everyone into these bullshit social silos most of which are broken and overflowing now like the Watson computer is better than general counsel like at a huge percentage difference if AI can outdo these lawyers in like coming out of school and six digits of debt and they can't get jobs you know that model doesn't even work anymore so let's get back to like honoring tinkerers and craftsman and free thinkers and innovators and there ya encouraging people to think outside the box totally encouraging people to be creative and I think there's also an issue in teaching people at scale you know I just I don't I think people need individual attention they need some sort of a mentor figure that can tell them hey I did what you're doing I went through what you've gone but just understanding that individual kid and understanding is does he learn best by seeing does he learn best by doing does he learn be like even understanding that interface yeah yeah it's um it's a mess you know and the only thing that gives me hope is now because the internet there's so many other resources for kids there's so many YouTube videos they can watch and so many articles they can read and there's so many just there's documentaries there's all these different stories of someone like them that also followed a dream mm-hmm and you know when I was a kid there was none of that shit that's true like I didn't even know you could being an industrial designer was a career path sure I was well beyond having the opportunity to have properly trained it well there was no such thing as being a podcaster right now I mean it didn't exist but now it exists and there's nine hundred thousand podcasts literally really oh it's so crazy they think one there's some crazy number like it's one out of every 400 people in America has a podcast and it's mostly yeah is that a real number what is the number there's three hundred thirty million people yeah that's the number right a million podcasts close to it one and yeah hundred fifty it's in the neighborhood it's in the neighborhood of one out of every four but even you right you had no idea no idea yeah no I know but I mean you didn't know the magic carpet ride you were getting on no you did this as a passion play right yeah wanted to have interesting conversations and meet diverse people and you kind of needed a gig right you wanted to this sort of was a I don't want to say a hobby but it grew very organically for you hundred percent organic you had no clue was gonna turn into this Empire of craziness right no it costed money for most of the time it was just for fun yeah it was a hundred percent just for fun and an opportunity to get together with my friends one of the things that I've figured out early on that's beautiful I love the honesty of that yeah it is yeah I mean but one of the things I figured out early on is I I spend the most time with my friends when we sit down and do podcasts because then there's no phones involved it's just three hours just talking to each other whereas you know if we go to a restaurant we'll talk for a little bit but we only do it once every now and then and they're on the road and I'm on the road and so getting together was like a communal thing and then it became a clubhouse thing and then we started doing it at the ice house so is that a comedy club so we do it when coincide with shows and that was a lot of fun and then slowly but surely the numbers started growing and as the numbers started growing then I started getting guests and then as I started getting guests I started understanding what I'm actually doing and getting better at talking to people and then realizing that no will you do anything like linking up with one person the less distractions the better the less bullshit the better it's just you and a person talking and then I got better at that and then I started thinking about what I'm doing wrong what I'm doing I realize like oh this is a skill just like everything else is a skill like being annoying to listen to is a failure to do the job right like you're not it's not just that that's who you are that's not what it is it's just you're you are who you are because of a lack of attention I mean I've done tons of interviews and tons of podcasts and tons of media over my various careers and stuff and I honestly like you know our conversations and the my last experience here and again talking with you today man I love it like there's such great conversations and I honestly like it's we were direct in eye contact it's been personal it's about whatever the hell we come up with that we end up just naturally flowing into and that's so it's so rare it's what's rare for people to listen to to and for for me it's it's very educational and it's also the beautiful thing about it is that the only people I'm talking to is people I want to talk to so there's no one that's telling me who to talk to so you know when I reach out to you and it said hey man you wanna do another one yeah if I got let's do it all right exciting so it's only people I'm interested in talking to so that makes it so much better for the listeners as well because you're getting genuine enthusiasm just like me when clients call them ya know something that sounds like it would suck and I'm not interested yes so less s right well we have the power to say no yeah trol what we do what we say yes to what we say no to as long as the market allows both of us to do that we'll stay in our little happy place for sure I what I hope out of this coronavirus thing is other than people stay healthy of course is that people do revisit what they do with their lives as well and recognize that the fact that all this shit can go away and even if you're a good boy and you show up at work every day for some fucking job that sucks and you feel like you're putting your time and you're doing the right thing they could take that shit away from you ain't none of us getting out of here alive yeah exactly and you can jump off that fucking chip and I bet you can make it to the shore I bet you can but you you have to do the due diligence you got to do the work and you have to understand like this is not going to be easy this is nothing that's worth doing is easy but I think once someone understands the importance of being impassioned about what they do even like with what relationships they're in how they spend their time you know what they scheduled their day about once you really own that to a deep extent like the risk it's it's not even debatable leave the shit job leave the unhealthy relationship take better care of yourself your body or whatever but like once you make that first acceptance and understanding the rest of its Brees it'll be such a happier world if people have that connections they will and I'm with you I hope that grows from this one of the unintended positive side effects of podcast is that they get to listen to people that have done that people like you and and other people that have had on that are living their life the way that they chose to and they realize like this is and then you get to hear the story like oh this isn't like they weren't handed this they didn't get a willy wonka golden ticket they had a passion and then they followed yeah I had 10 grand to piece-of-shit cars and for credit cards I started the company and I walked away from a lucrative career yeah that's walked away there's a million stories like that you know and those are the fun ones those are the fun stories I'm just happy there's people out there that are living that example you know and I really do hope that some people I mean it's not for everybody but some people out there that are hearing this that are in this situation like fuck like I I did all the right things and my job is still gone now and my you know my pension 401k tanked the real problems people with families people with families and people with mortgages and they can't jump but they have leases they have you know rent to pay and it still argument nights and weekends stay up a little later nights and weekends nights and weekends even if it just gives you the creative creative juice yet that juju flowing and then you can dabble in is there a rev model is this a viable business or where can it go but man nights and weekends staying like motivated and excited and thinking and stretching and trying versus just you know plugging in and watching the same shit being guest on our throat by media like there's so much that can be done even just at that level the effort to push that car and then jumpstart it as it gets rolling it's really hard to push that car but if you can get it going enough and jump in and push the clutch in and throw it in the first and part you know and then it's then it's moving but it's that initial effort it's so fucking hard but once you do it like this podcast is easy to do now it's easy just show up and do it it's easy but you do it from scratch if someone had to start it tomorrow if you think it's gonna be easy it's not I look back actually just today I was going through an image catalog as updating the site and how to remember what it was it was some some image I was editing for the site I was going fuck this is complicated like looking back it's it seemed it seems somewhat easy like there's so many aspects and so much complexity in this business that looking back at it like well the fuck did I pull that off like it grew merely out of the passion and when there wasn't by focus groups or you know analysis or anything it was I just fucking jumped in and started doing it made it work and you keep grinding that's the thing the grind is amazing because it does really achieve results you just keep doing it you keep doing you keep working keep showing up keep pouring your passion to it and then you look back two years three years five years you go holy shit look at the distance look at all this look at all the projects look at all the stuff that's been done went through a year before we did this I went through your YouTube channel and I started looking at some of the newer projects some of the older projects I'm like look at the fucking amount of work that's coming out of your shop it's really crazy yeah it's pretty nuts it's amazing 330 some vehicles out of Ikon and then a couple thousand out of the first brand entity if what is that like a week at a GM not even right how many days is that it's like on cars part that's like it's like a half day probably right yeah it's cool though I mean it's it's a very unique field the field of people making cars you know I would hate to see the regulations and all the bullshit get down to you I love the fact that you're a 15 minute drive away and go check out the shop yeah we'll beat them it just sucks that I have to convince them that I'm a valued member of California's crazy society and especially the city they should be so pumped that you're there I mean I don't get it he used to be mayor Villaraigosa family the damn building personally like like they were they were great but I don't know I think you know what a lot of people are telling me and we're seeing this even at Bureau of automotive repair California resource forces there's a lot more regulation occurring now because since California and the Trump administration have gotten pretty deep in this argument over does California have the right to create its own air quality control mandates or not that it's sucking so much money out of the California system that they're having to scramble to come up with new reve models so like a lot of aftermarket automotive like for off-road use only marketed parts they're now pursuing the distributor the manufacturer the retailer the fucking web host the consumer and like penalizing everyone up and down the chain mmm to create this Rev mob to keep it keep it going it's it's a real bummer man it's a real bummer I mean I understand the the desire to keep air quality high but I don't understand that you're using all these cars that are you know you're using these emission compliant engines I mean these LS engines are using is crazy yeah I'm putting cats and systems into cars that never had a remember yeah all the vehicles that we create actually emit less being driven like an idiot than the stock one did sitting in a parking lot not even being driven if just by fact of the charcoal canister in the non-vented fuel system just that alone just that alone so just sitting amounts in co2 yeah oh yeah because it was the the tanks it was vaporizing out and all those particulates go flying well it's no different than a modern car was my point I mean if you buy a modern f150 or you buy one of your cars which with a crate engine it's the same it's the same as far as the amount that it releases into the ass and we're exempt you know all the platform years are the vast majority of them that preset right you know pre 75 but I'm just doing it because it's you'd be a dumbass not to it's the right thing there's yeah and it's not like the 90s where you're putting in EGR and the smog pumps and five miles of vacuum tubes and shit that's not going to be reliable I mean now it's all about wideband o2 spree cat post Caddo to boom-boom and a clean program and like it it's better it's a better experience what about hydrogen has anybody come up with a viable method of I mean I know that uh there's people that have done some hydrogen systems and cars have you ever fucked with that no and I've been curious about it but from what I understood the distribution of hydrogen was the big deal breaker in that hydrogen that is readily distributed if I recall correctly was a lower grade that would not work in the systems required for hydrogen powered automobiles mmm so it was a complete infrastructure shitshow to get it to the point of viable seem with like capstone that was doing those micro turbines out in Chatsworth Canoga Park it I don't know what's I don't seem quite quite viable what was it micro turbines so turbochargers and but they're micro it's a full turbine so think industrial commercial application turbines power sources but for road-going vessels oh so that was the attorney for the VA yeah but apparently they burned pretty dirty uh okay I don't know what I'm talking about but that's what I was told when I was starting to dive into it I remember there was a nice one in bloom box yeah whatever the fuck they are oh shit that sounded cool anything else should we wrap this up sure no just I love being here and I really appreciate your time and your intellect and your diversity and thank you my thanks man I appreciate what you do I really do I mean that I'm happy there's Jonathan Ward's out there keep on truckin all right bye everybody stay safe stay healthy bye [Music]
