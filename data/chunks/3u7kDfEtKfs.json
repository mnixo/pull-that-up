the countdown series 2 1 hello Peter chef hello Jill so you just what we're gonna we're gonna ask you just did a whole show before this one yeah I did 3 hours no two hours Oh all right isn't that hard okay so the comedian those are the easy ones all right it just it's just basically talking to a friend okay well I'm a friend you are friend that's right yeah I remember when when I first saw you when you were doing that octave well is occupy wallstreet a thing anymore did they give up they stopped occupying yeah they did but you know we just maybe you shouldn't have saw that on my youtube channel I know we just reposted the Occupy Wall Street video I never actually had it on my channel oh really but because it was originally done by reason this is about five years ago or so five six years ago and so reason TV did it and so I let them promote it on their site I didn't copy it and they got millions and millions of views and there's some other sites that that that went with it it was asked a one-percenter right wasn't that what we called it well I was down there with a sign what'd it say I said I am the 1% let's talk and I went into Zuccotti Park and you know I only reason I stopped that if you the log the long one the log version is just under two hours which is on my youtube channel now but the only reason we stopped is because we ran out of you know Kennedy batteries batteries in the camera the camera died but I could have kept talking and we were losing the light you can see by the end you know it's getting it's getting darker watching them get frustrated with you but not having the words nor the knowledge to compete with what you were saying was very entertaining like agree with you or disagree with you it was just hilarious watching someone so completely outmatched or a group of people so completely outmatched trying to debate economics with you and trying to understand the way business works except they didn't even realize they were outmatched they thought they were smarter than me but you know the main reason I went there was not so much to try to convince the people there that they were wrong and that you know capitalism was you know the solution not the source of their problems and that they you know should be protesting Washington the Federal Reserve or Congress it was for the people that I knew that would watch it on the Internet and I still get emails even now least I don't think a week goes by where somebody from somewhere in the world doesn't send me an email about that and I know another what website I forget the name of it reposted it about a year ago and they got a couple of million views on it just posting it again so a lot of people have watched it and I get you know comments from people saying this is what changed me I was a socialist very left-wing i watch this and that was the Epiphany that was the moment and then I did more research and I learned more and now thanks to you I'm a total libertarian or a free-market capitalist and so it's it served its purpose yeah well it was enlightening it's it was it was good it's good to see people that are so involved in something that they'll go and they'll protest I'll hang out in the park but they really can't articulate their feelings or their thoughts in a well reasoned debate they really don't have the facts but yeah they're dedicating their entire life to protesting something it's really interesting that people will spend so much energy and effort on something they're really not even educated yeah and it's a lot easier just to talk about something just emotionally yes instead of actually taking the time to learn about economics and to understand you know the source of the problems because anybody can just blame it on some rich person who's hoarding money and discriminating and they loved it in that and then just say oh this solution see if you blame the problems on some rich person well the solution is easy just take his money right have the government come in and and redistribute the wealth which is another word for steal take money from somebody who earned it and give it to somebody who didn't but if you actually take a little bit of time and use your head instead of your your your heart your feelings you'll learn that you know that the source of the problems is government interference and in the economy and that the protest should be directed at government at their regulations and their subsidies and their taxes and all the things that government does to stifle economic growth and deny opportunities to people oh I think it would be a really funny documentary if you could do like a documentary on the last occupier like the last person to Occupy Wall Street because it had to be stragglers right eventually must have gotten to the point where there was like 30 people left 20 people left that one guy no fuck these people may well you know they started occupying different areas right because it caught on and it was all over the world they were occupying here and occupying there and they were setting up camps right they were essentially living there yeah yeah and who knows what else they were doing there but but now the Occupy movement kind of morphed into the Bernie Sanders movement right because that's where all those guys are now they were volunteering for the Sanders campaign and and socialism is really kind of going mainstream now because they put the word Democrat in front of it yeah as if somehow that changes the meeting right well I'm not a socialist I'm a Democratic Socialist meaning I want to vote for socialism as opposed to just have you know an armed revolution but the end is still the same right it's still socialism and it's it doesn't work yeah I was watching an interview with Tucker Carlson and some guy he's a professor at Harvard and he said I'll give you the last word you guys said socialism is gonna win give me the piece I'm like what is that what does that even mean like socialism is going to win what is it what does that mean and what is socialism well it could win at the polls that's the problem it's very intoxicating to people who don't know any better right and the interesting people they have too much money yeah the interesting thing about socialism is that no matter how many times it fails people expect it to succeed right that's the definition of insanity right doing something over and over again and expecting a different result well the Socialists always expect a different result from doing something that has never succeeded in the past so socialism by definition is one thing but by the emotional reaction that people have is kind of another thing the emotional reaction is there's rich people that are a real problem they're hoarding they're greedy I'm not concerned with money I want I'm concerned with people and community and feelings and health and welfare and education and all that money we should take it from those rich people and we should funnel it into education and community and they say all these words that make people feel good like yeah we're not about money either yeah it's all it's all about feeling good that's where yeah the liberals are about it's about you know feeling that they're better than everybody else because they're you know they're they're higher up on this moral pedestal because they don't care about money they just care about you know people and you know but when you talk about rich people they don't hoard money I mean the way you get rich is not by hoarding the way you get rich is by trying to figure out what problems people have that you can solve right whether it's inventing something that makes their lives better or providing a service that makes their lives better because the customers are in charge individuals right that that's what's gonna allocate wealth it's if if somebody is better than somebody else at satisfying the desires that people have and if if I can come up with something that you like that you want to buy that's cheaper and better than what somebody else has come up with then you're gonna buy for me and so the person who ends up with the most money is the person who's satisfied the most desires the most needs in the most efficient way possible and and that's what's benefiting Society I mean it's great to have charity and I'm all for private charity but if you look at the wealthiest men in history even though they've been incredible philanthropist and they've given away a lot of money they helped a lot more people amassing their fortunes than gifting away what they made it was the businesses that they created the the products that they invented the services that they provided and the employment right that was all a function of their creating their wealth that's what did a lot more to help Society than simply giving away some of the money that they earned have you ever had a debate with a Democratic Socialist well I mean most Democrats are socialist they just don't know it or they don't want to admit it and a lot of people don't even understand what socialism is because you know you'll have the left I'll always consider somebody like even Donald Trump that's always a fascist right they don't even realize that fascism is part of socialism socialism is a broad concept that includes things like communism and fascism so if you're communist you are socialist but by but it doesn't mean that if you're a socialist you're a communist because you could be a fascist you could be for a lot of things but fascism is a form of socialism where the government doesn't just steal all the property like the Communists want to nationalize everything and take legal ownership of the means of production right the government just owns all the capital under under fascism the government is a little bit smarter they realize that people will work harder if they think they're working for themselves so the fastest doesn't want to nationalize businesses they just want to control it through regulation and taxes and that's pretty much what the Democrats want to do they want to control everything by taxing it heavily and regulating it and those that's an important aspect of fascist I mean a lot of people associate fascism with racism just because the Nazis were were racist but you don't have to be racists I mean fascism started in Italy and that there wasn't any racism there and if you go back to the Nazi Party it's the National Socialist Party of Germany that's what the Nazis are its socialists so fascism is a form of socialism that's why the Communists and the fascists you know argue so much because they're really they're fighting over the same turf it's which brand of socialism is better fascism or communism but they're not at opposite ends of the political spectrum they're on the same end so do you think the people are frustrated with the current system and so they see someone like Bernie Sanders come along that offers this radical change of pace he's saying you know we need to end income inequality and redistribute wealth and all these different things and it just sparks an emotional reaction in people that they know that the current system the way it's in place especially the way it was under Obama they didn't like how things were they didn't like how things were under Bush they think we need someone who's not a career politician or someone who has got a radical new approach oh look at this Bernie Sanders guy he wants to do some stuff with money let's let's vote for him yeah look people you know are grasping for straws when they're looking for a solution but look that's why Trump is president I mean a lot of people think that Trump's election maybe shows that the u.s. electorate has moved right right that we're more Republican or more free-market but that's not what that election was about it was about the fact that we had a lousy economy and Trump was honest about that to the voters Trump told people that the numbers are phony don't believe these unemployment four or five percent it's a lie it's fraud it's fiction and he was right because the way they calculated today they don't calculate the millions and millions of people who have given up looking for work right they don't count the people who just have a part-time job and they're still looking for a full-time job so the real unemployment number is much much higher and Trump talked about that and he called out you know all the politicians from both sides right not just the Democrats the Republicans and he said look I'm in a clean house I'm out of politician vote for me right I'm gonna make America great again I'm gonna drain the swamp you know and he appeal to people's you know their their fears about immigrants I'm gonna build this wall as if the reason that things are bad is because we have too many immigrants taking away the jobs and so people decided you know what what the hell let me let me give this guy a trance because things are bad the media is lying to me Wall Street's lying to me and so you know Trump Trump won but unfortunately now Trump is part of the establishment and now all of a sudden the fake economic numbers are legit now every time there was an unemployment number out he tweets about how it's the lowest it's ever been so I think that when we get this next recession which is going to happen while Trump is president during during this first term which I think will be the only term but when all really why do you think those two things well because I think the economy is going to fall into a severe recession what makes you say that well a you know it's we're overdue right I mean you don't normally have an expansion that lasts as long as this one I think we're we're the second longest in history and if we go for another year it'll be the longest expansion in history 2008 is when it started to turn around 2009 to the end of 2009 years in yeah exactly what is a usual expansion and compression I don't know five six years so so this one is long but also this one required more government stimulus than any other you know recovery and I don't think we actually recovered I think the government simply you know injected a bunch of cheap money into the economy and exacerbated the real problems but you know reef lated the bubbles in the stock market and the housing market but you know everybody talks about how the economy is doing so great but it's really not much better than it was under Obama if it's any better at all we've GDP growth for Trump's first year in office last year was 2.3 percent I mean nothing great first quarter was 2 percent this quarter might be a better than 3 maybe maybe not but I mean I think it's gonna be the second quarter will probably be the best quarter of the year maybe we're probably going to go downhill but you know last year was I think the the weakest year of job growth since 2011 so people want to talk about how great everything is but it's more a function of people are hoping things are gonna turn around there's a lot of optimism now but things are gonna get better but I think that the people who are so optimistic a lot of them are gonna be disappointed because we're gonna end up with is a weaker economy the only thing that's really strengthening is inflation inflation is gonna pick up so the cost of living is really gonna be rising as the economy is falling into recession so we get stagflation which is probably the worst possible economic scenario and you know I think that the the left and even the Fed is gonna be able to blame it on Trump because Trump has come in and you know claimed credit for this great economy that he believes we have and he's claimed credit for the record in the stock market but he's basically put his name on a bubble and when it pops you know it's gonna be hard for him to try to blame the next recession on Obama when he's already said hey this is my economy I created it and so people are gonna be disappointed and they're gonna vote I think for another person whose promises change and unfortunately that's gonna come from the left so you think this is gonna happen in the next three years well yeah I mean you know what is the bubble what do you think is gonna cause it to crash commercial real estate is it credit what is it well I mean commercial real estate is expensive meaning it's in a bubble but that you know that's not gonna cause it I mean airs gonna come out of the bubble I think we would already be in a pretty severe recession now had it not been for Trump winning had Hillary won I think we would already be there but I think what makes you say that well we got a lot of false optimism as a result of of Trump and we did get the tax cuts and the tax cuts you know just like you know any kind of artificial drug you know you can inject yourself and a little bit of a phony hi because remember the tax cuts were paid for with debt we didn't shrink government right if you if you make government smaller that's great then you can cut taxes because now government doesn't need as much money and you can you know you can relieve the taxpayer of the burden of paying for it and that's great but if you just cut taxes but you don't cut government spending and of course what the Trump administration did was was even worse they increase government spending we increased welfare spending we increased warfare spending and so spending is more but they reduce their tax revenue so the deficits are just exploding out of control and those deficits are gonna do more damage to the economy than the tax cuts were benefit except you get the benefit first maybe for the first year and then you start to deal with the pain after that and so I think that's gonna set in you know long before the end of Trump's term so you think that this is what is causing the economy to be in a really at least to look like it's in a really healthy state right now well some of the numbers right some of the numbers look better but beneath the surface again it's not improving just like just like it wasn't improving under Obama that's what laid the foundation for Trump's victory was because Obama and everybody kept talking about how great the recovery was but the average voter knew that that was all a bunch of nonsense because he wasn't living in that reality so if you were the financial adviser to the president what would you tell him well how would you happen what would you do to try to keep the economy moving in the same direction is it possible to ward off well kind of a crash right we don't want to keep it moving in the same direction I mean it's in the same direction it was going in before Trump came in and that's towards the edge of a cliff I mean so what we do we need is an about-face and Trump is not doing that I mean the power face would look so like for the people that are listening to this that don't understand like they're saying okay you can't be supposed to be doing well black unemployment's the lowest it's ever been unemployment is down did all these jobs have been created yeah well remember again the unemployment rate is mainly down because so many people that are unemployed are no longer counted as part of the statistics so you know that that's if you look at the labor force participation rate near a record low means certainly for men it's the lowest it's been in the history of the Republic but and look at the you know workers to population so fewer and fewer people are actually working and more and more of the people who aren't working are not included in the unemployment statistics so if you backed all those people in right able-bodied people who don't have jobs but should be working then the unemployment rate is much much higher so that doesn't really paint a good picture and then you know you look at the fact that so many Americans are unqualified right there's a lot of jobs out there that go unfilled because American workers aren't qualified to fill those positions because you know we take a lot of our kids and we keep them in high school until they're 18 19 years old many of these kids should drop out of high school and learn a trade I mean a lot of people you know they don't have the aptitude for you know academics there's no point in just being in high school a lot of times they're glorified daycare centers but they should be out learning trades and of course we make it harder for employers to train people on the job with occupational licensing laws and minimum wage laws so we destroy a lot of the opportunities for younger kids to get skills and then the ones that we send to college they waste their time you know majoring in liberal arts so they spend four or five six years in college learning nothing of any real value in the market they accumulate a massive amount of debt in the process and so you know we have a labor force that's highly educated and that they've got a bunch of degrees maybe they didn't learn anything but they got a piece of paper but then what they have is a lot of debt and so we don't have a lot of people qualified to do a lot of things that need to be done so what would you tell the president if you were if you he said look Peter Schiff I don't know shit about the economy you obviously do help me out how I'll stop this bubble well you know first of all you can't stop it you got to let it deflate but the question is how does it deflate and then what do you propose is the solution see the problem that Trump already made was when he first got elected he should not have changed his perspective he shouldn't have said hey everything is great right now he's planning on running his next campaign is Keep America great right when Trump ran for office he said America was an economic wasteland that it was a disaster he's been president for a little over a year all of a sudden it's the greatest economy in the history of the country which is not even close to being true but if he's gonna try to run for re-election on I've already made America great and now we just want to keep it great that's not gonna resonate so what he should have done from day one is leveled with the American public again this is how bad the problem is and this is what its gonna take to solve it because there's a lot of you know pain short-term pain that we're gonna need to go through in order to come to the other side in order to get rid of all these problems like right now look at the trade right Trump is making a big deal about the trade deficits and he's launching tariffs is gonna have this trade war that he's convinced that we could win and this is very misguided the trade deficits are not the problem they are the consequence of the problem the problem is that we have bad monetary policy bad fiscal policy too much regulation that's why we have a trade deficit because American industry is not productive enough we don't save enough we don't make the right capital investment that's because interest rates have been kept too low you know our tax code favors debt you know and we have a lot of regulations that make American businesses less competitive and so the result is that we import a lot of products rather than making them ourselves and it's not because the other countries aren't fair or because they have tariffs tariffs are very low around the world I mean there's tariffs are not the problem and so if Trump is simply gonna erect tariffs all that's gonna do is tax the American public as the American public has to pay the tariffs whenever they buy imported products so this is not going to going to turn the economy around but you know and Trump is right he points out that well you know one point in time America ran on tariffs which is true during the 19th century the government you know raised money primarily by tariffs but we didn't have an income tax you know and so this the irony of it the reason we have in income tax today is because the populist politicians of the day told the American voter if we can tax the rich with an income tax then we can get rid of tariffs that the average person is paying so the average person understood that tariffs cost them money and the politician said let's get rid of these tariffs and let's just tax the rich and the income tax that was originally proposed really was a tax on the very rich I mean even doctors and lawyers didn't pay it I mean you had to be super rich before you pay the tax and then it was like you know 1% to 4% so it was a small tax and and it wasn't taken from your paycheck right I mean first of all if ya if you if you got a paycheck you didn't pay the tax but we didn't have withholding until 1943 that was part of the the victory tax to pay for the Second World War but Americans were told let's tax the rich and you won't have to pay tariffs anymore well it's the minute that you know the government got the nose under the tent right all of a sudden now the income tax affects everybody right people pay a lot more in income taxes today than they used to pay in tariffs but now now the president wants to bring the towers back on top of the income tax I mean if Trump wants to repeal the income tax and get rid of it entirely and then have some tariffs I'd be ok with that but you can't do that unless you dramatically shrink the size of government which is the most important thing that Trump needs to do but what he's not doing he has to make the military smaller not bigger I mean he's talking about a space for us I mean we can't even afford the Air Force Navy Marines that we got now you know I'm having money for a space force but we have to cut everything we got to cut entitlements right do you think we should be the first people to have a space for us what are the Russians come up with space for and no one's gonna come out of luck would even what did he do this space for us we gonna fight in space maybe we fight the Russians is based well well why would we fight him in space they're down on earth well maybe they want to fight in space it's more novel yeah I don't think I don't think anybody wants to fight right no it might be protected right yeah III think we got that covered I think we've got a pretty good-sized military I don't think anyone's gonna mess with us the problem is our economy so brah when you say let the bub crash like what what would that entail well basically look the problem the basic problems with the US economy and this is because of monetary policy fiscal policy is we don't save anything right and because we don't save enough we don't invest enough we don't produce enough we don't make enough real things right I mean when Trump wants to say that foreigners are taking advantage of us by running these huge trade surpluses he's got it backwards we're taking advantage of them like the Chinese are sending us all these products that they worked hard to produce and they had to use real resources land labor capital to make these products and they send them here and what do we give them we give them IOUs we give them a piece of paper and they buy our Treasury bonds so in the short run Americans are just putting everything on a credit card right we're living a higher standard of living because we can consume what we didn't make but when you do that you become poorer see America used to be the richest creditor nation in the world right the world owed us a lot of money today we're the world's biggest debtor nation how did we go from being the biggest creditor to the biggest debtor it was trade deficits every year we keep borrowing money to consume and what's this has done is this has turned a rich nation into a poor nation but we just don't live like a poor nation yet because we're still borrowing yeah and you could be a rich individual yet maintain a rich lifestyle on debt but eventually you know that's gonna catch up with you and then your lifestyle is gonna come crashing down and this is what's going to happen but what we should do instead of having a crisis imposed on us globally with a crisis in the dollar and a crisis and our bond market we should do it ourselves we should set these forces in motion ourselves so what we have to do is shrink government right we have to you know cut a lot of government spending get rid of a lot of government agencies and departments to get government out of the way so we can lower taxes legitimately and then we have to allow the Federal Reserve to let the market set interest rates interest rates have to be much higher than they are now right that's because that's gonna encourage people to save if interest rates are high you'll put your money in the bank to earn that high rate of interest when money goes into a bank it can get loaned out to businesses right now all that money is going to government or it's in the corporate you know bond market where it's not growing the economy or you money is being used to finance stock buybacks we need money on Main Street financing capital formation entrepreneurship you know new businesses new jobs so we get higher interest rates we'll get that and we need people to stop buying things they can't afford you know you buy something if you have the money to pay for it you don't just put it on a credit card but if and if credit card interest rates went up and if credit was contracted so that credit card companies were not giving out as much credit they're giving out a lot of credit now because the government is misdirecting it but if we slow down our consumption we increase our savings and investment then the economy can actually grow but if interest rates go up asset prices have to come down the stock market has to come down a lot real estate prices have to come down a lot now that means people are gonna lose money they're not gonna be happy about that yeah this sounds counterintuitive to everything that I've always heard about how to boost up the economy the idea would be that spending and people buying things it's great for the economy we need more that know that oh let's put the cart before the horse you can't buy something that doesn't exist something has to be produced before it can be consumed so it's the production that drives the economic train not consumption see right now we're just consuming what the Chinese produce right but but the consumption doesn't mean anything unless you produce something first so you drive an economy by creating supply its supply that creates demand if you just try to create demand without the supply it's just inflation it's weird to that we keep hearing things about Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei in particular they're always telling you to not buy their stuff that wasn't there there was something about there's something in the paper today about Huawei it was about I think another country saying no to these I guess Huawei in particular is the third largest cell phone manufacturer in the world and they they have a close tie with the communist government and they believe there's there might be some shenanigans going on with them their electronics I don't know I mean I'm not familiar with that I mean I know that the the there's there's constant talk about trying to oh you know just don't buy certain products or Huawei they were actually the the State Department told people to stop buying them national security threat or something or something on lines of third-party spying their concerns but what does it say here Australia to ban Huawei from 5g role out amid security concerns but us had an issue and I think the u.s. issue was slightly different us was who was the state department that was saying for security concerns tonight yeah I don't know but you know whenever they talk look they're talking about these the the auto tariffs is is from and they say it's national security as if somehow my buying a foreign car is you know somehow jeopardizing what is that national Scotto I mean they you know the the Canadians have called Trump out on it so what do you mean we you know we fought as allies at every single war how are you saying that you have to put tariffs on on Canadian products why is Canton why is Trump doing this look again he's going after the symptom trade deficits are the consequence of a problem most politicians ignore the trade deficits right at least Donald Trump is putting them on the spotlight and saying look this is a problem it is a problem but not for the reason that Trump believes in the short run in the here-and-now the trade deficits benefit America because the world is subsidizing our standard of living we're getting to buy things that we otherwise wouldn't be able to have I mean without these trade deficits we wouldn't have all these consumer goods on all these shelves I mean people would not be able to buy some prices would be much higher if we had to make stuff ourselves by having the Chinese make it you know it's a lot cheaper and plus you know it's great for our environment because you know we don't have to pollute our own air because the factories are over there but in he's so he's right that it's a problem but in that it's a reflection of the fact that the economy is inefficient and that's what needs to be addressed it's like you know we have cancer but you just can't put band-aids on the blemishes or something to cover it up you got to actually get to the source of those blemishes which is the the Federal Reserve and their bad monetary policy and our government policy or our fiscal policy or regulatory policy we need to have that type of change and then the trade deficits will go away but if we simply try to put tariffs on it's just gonna make our own problems worse all that's going to do is price is higher is this gonna mean that Americans are you have to spend more money buying stuff and it also actually undermines a lot of American businesses that export into countries that are retaliating and also a lot of US businesses import components and then they assemble the components here but now those imported parts are gonna be more expensive and so they're net exports are more expensive and so they become less efficient the people that are supporting Trump the people that are happy with the way things are going have said that him lowering taxes for corporations encourages growth well it encourages it gets more jobs and there's there's more economic activity does that make sense well look if we eliminate taxes yeah that'd be great I mean the lower taxes are the better it's going to be but not if you borrow the money to pay for the tax cuts so the idea is if the government now has to go into the market and borrow money that it no longer collects in taxes that's gonna have an impact on the economy that's going to further deplete our savings pool that's gonna put real upward pressure on interest rates and obviously the Fed is trying to counteract that but you know that what they did with the tax code though they dramatically complicated it I mean there's a lot of there's a lot more complexity in the code now than there was before not like it wasn't complex before so initially they talked about simplifying the code they didn't do that they they they made the the the code a lot more complex and they certainly you know they lowered they raised lower taxes for some people but they raised taxes for other people depending on what state you in there are a lot of people now that are gonna pay higher taxes what could what people are doing well people in California right you got a you know you got a 13 percent income tax in California that's no longer deductible on your state income tax on your federal income tax that's a new thing well yeah I mean up until this year you you could deduct your state income tax from your federal income tax so you know you did the effective tax rate was you know maybe forty percent less because it was just money you would have sent to Washington so instead you sent it to Sacramento but basically the state tax rates are almost double now what they were last year in the the way it impacts the payer so there's a big increase in state taxes for individuals you didn't know that no yeah you know you oughta you know you didn't move to Puerto Rico with me I know but I hear you guys don't have any power well that we got power now now but three months of the take well don't you have generator yeah but you were the only one you like man guards outside make sure nobody steals your water no it's not it's you know in fact you were laughing about it but you know what I was on your show a year ago right we talked we talked a lot about Puerto Rico it was post Trump right trumpeter yeah Trump was trumpet one but it was before Maria right but and so I was on the show and we were talking about Puerto Rico yeah and we also talked about crypto currencies and Bitcoin and stuff like that but since then hundreds and hundreds of crypto guys have moved to Puerto Rico I mean let some of my neighbors now are these crypto millionaires and living on guys see now on the beach they no they they weren't dare a year ago they're they're bear now they're they can't they call it a poor topia they all want to come there because there's no capital gains tax but I got a you know kind of credit you because I think a lot of these guys didn't know about it until they heard about on this podcast and they said wait a minute there's no taxes down there in Puerto Rico and now they're all there and they moved it just in time for the hurricane no they moved after the hurricane III moved before the hurricane is moving after the hurricane a better move financially it's probably cheaper land you know I don't you know I buy easier no it's you know I can't even tell some of the real estate has actually gone up really yeah and like the real estate that was untouched you know I mean my community whether to storm pretty well so maybe it made it more desirable really why did your community you do so well just I mean it's got its its you know even though I'm on the beach the elevation is very high so we didn't get any flooding and I just the construction is much better there you know the houses are built better so they didn't withstand yeah they didn't withstand the damage and the community got up and you know up and running a lot quicker so how long were you without power oh there was well officially there was probably no power for a couple months but I have a you know my condo has power just as a big generator and so we had condo power there right away but the house that I I ended up buying a house there too right before hurricane and I didn't have the generator put in yet so the house didn't have power for months and months which just exacerbate I had some damage to the house and then the fact that there was no power made it worse because it got very humid in there but I've since purchased a generator and I've got it all installed and so I'm ready for the next for the next hurricane but you know I got there was funny funny thing before the hurricane there is a lot of controversy from this podcast from my my I talk about Puerto Rico because I mentioned on on the show that I had moved some employees to Puerto Rico I have three single guys that used to live out in Southern California and they all moved out to Puerto Rico because I moved my business there this was in 2013 I moved my asset management company your Pacific asset management moved it to to Puerto Rico and so these guys moved out there single guys and I mentioned that they were having a you know a good time there's a lot of very beautiful women in Puerto Rico you know I mentioned I think five Mis universes have been from Puerto Rico which is which is a lot for a small place and I said that you know they have a good time there because the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico is terrible I mean hardly anybody has a job maybe maybe a third of the people who should be working are working and that's you know and that's again because of the socialism down there the welfare state that's there and it you know and the minimum wage in Puerto Rico is effectively like you know it's the medium wage it's like having a 15 $17 an hour minimum wage here so it destroys a lot of employment opportunity Island so I mentioned that you know if they you know they have a good time down there because there's a lot of women and if you're a guy and you got a job I mean you know you could write your own ticket that's a big plus to have a job because women want to date guys with jobs and and this was controversial you know you wouldn't think it would be but all of a sudden all these big guys down there in Puerto Rico they'll probably say something again because obviously they watch your podcast but orally but a couple of really big guys we're calling me out saying that I'm insulting Porto Rican women like you know I'm calling them whores or something because I said that they want to date guys with jobs well doesn't every woman want to date a guy with a job yes it's not just butter eating in the running I don't want a guy with a job though exactly of course a girl wants a guy that has a job I mean every girl yeah I mean probably one of the main reasons we get jobs is to get girls oh yeah I mean you know and you know generally the more attractive the woman you know the more the better your job is gonna have to be to attract her yeah there's a there's a term for that right hypergamy like women tend to gravitate towards men with higher social status status and and higher I mean well first of all if you want a guy to take you out on a date if he doesn't have a job where's he gonna take you there you go I mean you know so I mean it's not I didn't think it was a controversial statement is I think that boy just making much ado out of nothing these days and they can write a blog and then you talk about what they wrote cuz you were upset that them being upset at you on the podcast and talking about it again so you're feeding it no but I'm correcting it I mean I just wanna say that it's not just you know there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting a guy that that has a good job not only that it's favorable well yeah well but it's not only just because he can take her on a date I mean when woman is on a date with a guy I mean everybody is a potential husband and you gotta bring some to the table yeah so you got it you know you gotta you gotta have ambition go-getter you got it you know just living and you're in your parents basement you know I free what does I mean you got to get a job right to get the money so then when you get some money yes swimming how are they saying what was the protest that I was insulting Puerto Rican women by saying they want a man with a jaw like they're just all gold diggers or something or not you know I didn't say the guy you know it was just they don't they only wanted money but look I mean having a job is a key thing I mean God we don't care the guys don't care as much what the woman does but women I mean that's a big thing most nothing they don't care at all if she's hot if it makes a lot of money and the girls hot yeah I mean look here she's not nice you knows how to read if a guy was gonna set up a guy right with a friend the first thing the guy's gonna say ask is what does she look like yeah that's the first place is she nice hot right if a woman is gonna tell a girlfriend about a guy what's the first question probably what it looks like first now what does he do first I guarantee it's what is he really what does he do for living I think first it's what he looks like second is what is he not I think what he looks like is lower down I think it's what does he do for living is he does he have a nice personalities they have a good sense of humor I think I think how does he look us a little bit lower down on a woman's totem pole of depends on how hot she is well maybe yeah it depends on how good she's doing in the marketplace yeah but I mean but all this I mean it's almost it was almost part of the whole political correctness thing of it like or the me to like you can't you you you you can't say something anything that you say is gonna be spun like this is this is yeah against women because I'm stating something that's very obvious right that that you know so can't state obvious anymore no no no I mean it's all but you can because I think these outrage peddlers that make these articles and write these blogs who the fuck is agreeing with them I just I just don't buy it I think what they're doing is they're striking a chord and a few malcontents go along with it but you read those things and you think like wow there's some validity to this because it's in you know X publication yeah so I got a comment on this there they're misrepresenting what I said yeah they're outraged merchants yeah and everybody wants to act like you can't say something that's offensive to anybody like if somebody gets offended then you know like you know this some Moses you know this one of these contestants I read the story but one of the contestants on The Bachelorette apparently on his Instagram page he liked some jokes that that you know be kind of look maybe off call a little bit offensive jokes that right-wing somebody on the right I had posted on their Instagram page and it was like a big deal you to take that his whole Instagram page like I mean it's obviously jokes they're jokes jokes are offensive that's part of what makes them funny I mean who I mean almost all the jokes offend somebody but now you can't even have a sense of humor everything has to be you know you can't you can't offend anybody which you don't have a right not to be offended that's the whole part of freedom of speech people are gonna say things and do things that you might be offended by and you just gotta you just got to deal with it you can't be looking like you know I I gotta have a law against that or but these are these offense merchants these people that get offended they that's their currency they they trade in being offended and then once they find something that in any way offensive they just start writing blogs about it and making videos about it and that's their that's their in yeah therein is finding something Peter Schiff said about Puerto Rican women mmm just saying we can women's offensive because it's just this is the world we live in a white guy like you wealthy guy you're gonna talk about Puerto Rican women you fucking piece of shit yeah well they're I mean they're white most of I mean they're little darker skin and then that most part in this day and age they're Latino they're people of cum Bob what color am i I got a lot you know I got a little color TV that's an interesting conversation I just had with a friend of mine who claims she's black uh-huh I'm darker than you how are you black yeah well it's like it's this whole mentality that people have now about not being offended is about feeling that they have a right to something or not being entitle or people confusing a privilege with with the right right right so you'll have all these groups that demand you know women's rights or gay rights women or gays they don't have rights because they're women right we all have individual rights and so men and women have rights because they're individuals they don't get a separate right because they fit into a group right all that is about privilege and you don't have special privileges granted to you by the Constitution we all have rights and when people try to pretend that a privilege or a group privilege and try to give that the status of a right I know you talked about it on your on your podcast we had the Supreme Court ruling recently regarding the gay couple that wanted a wedding cake and they you know they sued because the Baker wouldn't make them a wedding cake with you know a couple of guys on the top and decorated in a way that it was obviously for a gay wedding I had there's a bottom misunderstanding about that and I've read something recently that not only did they not do that but they weren't making custom kake's so they didn't make custom cakes for weddings so when these the the gay couple came in and said they wanted a custom cake this and now we don't make that like that was also part of the problems they don't that's not something they even did well they could have sold them a cake there he had yeah well they did while two dudes holding hands well the bigger problem is first of all they it's not like you have this gay couple that just went into a bakery and then they were denied you know the ability to buy a cake right right they probably went to a hundred bakeries to find the one that wouldn't bake the vacation so specifically do that so that was hard the story was that they wanted someone to deny them yes it had a story right and of course you know if you're a baker right I I don't know what the margins are on wedding cakes but wedding cakes are probably like the holy grail of case right I mean yours if you're sitting there on the small bakery shop you're waiting for somebody to call for a wedding cake because those are the biggest case you could make very expensive cakes so everybody wants to do a wedding cake nobody cares whether there's two guys or a guy and a girl on the top of it you just want to make the money that you're gonna get from baking a wedding cake now you come across a guy who just has a strong religious conviction he just you know what doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding okay I mean he's the one that's losing he's losing out on the the the Commission to bake the cake I mean the gay couple isn't hurt by that they there's so many bakeries that would bake him that cake war it was this couple were they denied because of religious reasons is that why the people who said they weren't wouldn't make the cake yes they said it was religious reasons and that's what the Supreme Court I think went on religious freedom but as far as I'm concerned it doesn't matter what their religion is nobody is required to perform a service for somebody else if they don't want to okay anyways what if it was a black couple yes I mean what if these people were racist and whether they said we don't want to bake a cake for a black cop well then the black couple can go find a bakery that will bake them a cake I mean what's the odds of there being a racist Baker out there but I you know I mentioned if I was today's day and it's less than ever before right but let's look look I mean it's still possible or not I'm Jewish right let's say there's an anti-semite Baker right and if he if I go in there and the guy says you know oh I don't want to bake cake for Jews fine you know because let's assume that he knows I'm Jewish he hates Jews and he spits in the cake I mean I'd like to know like right up front that this guy who's about to cake my cake hates Jews so then I'll go and buy my cake from somebody who doesn't hate Jews because I don't want to worry about what I'm gonna be putting in my mouth I mean why would you want to even force somebody to bake a cake for you that you've got to eat if you're forcing it to do it or you know that this is all nonsense but you know the idea that you can't discriminate that you can't make choices right I I have a right as an individual to you know to do things that I want to do but I can't force somebody else rights are about the government can you can't rob from me and you can't steal from me so you can't take away from me something that I have but I can't force you to give me something I don't have and just because I feel a certain way like if you go back to the the the gay couple to say okay you can't discriminate how did the Supreme Court Rule in that well they they upheld the right of this individual but it wasn't liked by the individual to not but I think it had to do with some esoteric state law it wasn't a definitive ruling that says that you have a right to discriminate which I believe that I believe you do I don't think the government should be discriminating but private individuals but the point I was about to make is you know for gay so let's say that you Joe Rogan were working as a gigolo that was your job you just had sex with women and you charge them money nice yeah that's your job now what if a dude comes up to you and wants to partake in your services do you have to serve him that's not the job sir the job is women no no you can't discriminate what right that's my point discriminate in terms of having sex with men well not if you're doing it for business or business well my job is gigolo gigolo is a guy with sex with women no no that's the job it's like you're asking a firefighter to dig another cool gigolo is a guy that has sex for money doesn't matter whether it's a guy no that's women bro well this card but then you're discriminating against men how can you deny how could you deny a man the opportunity to have sex with you interesting sees the same thing you can't look and you can say what if it's what if it's not sex okay that's what if it's just a masseuse what if it's just massages what if your masseuse but for some reason you just don't want a massage guys you just only want to massage girls prayer should n't you be able to do that yes yeah I mean so what so because it's it's it's touching people if I you if your business you want your business to be limited all I do is massage chicks bro I don't touch dudes yeah yeah but you should have a right to do that but then once you extrapolate it you just make a decision now you could make more money if you massage girls and guys because you have a bigger market but if you want to limit your business opportunity to just women well that hurts you right then it's your right to do that yeah like a massage therapist that doesn't want a massage guys you never hear about those and you don't get offended men don't get offended by this and the guys won't massage me would you I hate men well but you know you could do it as a customer I mean you know let's just say I'm a I want a massage and I could say look I'd prefer to get a massage by a woman yes I mean most guys would probably prefer to get a massage by a woman yeah well is that that that's totally legal they always let the customer the customer can discriminate the employee can discriminate right nobody would say you know hey if I let's say I happen to be black and I want to work for a black boss nobody would say that was wrong I could go to a white boss and I can say no sorry I don't want to take the job because I want to work for something black mate you can't sue me for not writing these are not actively seeking out a black boss which is the difference between that and being approached by a bunch of white people and saying no I hate white people and then they don't work no the point is if a if a white person or even a black person was seeking out a job applicant of they would say that's illegal you can't discriminate but the employer can do it all the employee can do it all the laws right right customers right if I was if I was a if a gay couple wanted to have a cake baked and I went and they went into a bakery and they said yes we'd like to have a cake bake are you straight or gay because we want our cake to be baked by a gay Baker right and the straight guy said no I'm straight sorry they find they can keep searching until they found a gay be gay and no one send you no one would care and I'm not saying that we should make that illegal I'm just saying the laws should be consistent that is interesting that the employer or rather the customer can basically go wherever they like and no one says you didn't go into this restaurant because you don't like gay people because gay people run this restaurant nobody ever says that right and I they can't force you to eat there if you don't want to but the other way they can they can yeah force you to use or to have someone use your services even if you don't believe them what they said yeah and they and that you know they the left always tries to make it out like if you have this perspective right oh like oh you must be a racist if you believe that people have a right to discriminate look I believe that people have a right to say a lot of things that I disagree with I'm not gonna stop them from saying things you know I believe in free speech even if what you're saying is idiotic or offensive and I believe people have a right to discriminate because that the bigger problem is when the government becomes the thought police because the minute you make it illegal to discriminate now you have to get into people's minds right if somebody doesn't promote somebody or fire somebody and they happen to be black or a woman or too old or handicapped you assume their motive but no but now you're gonna say oh you fired that person because he's black well what if that had nothing to do with it right you're assuming the motive for firing yeah and now I gotta prove that I didn't do something for what I was thinking when I did something I mean none of that you know all of that to makes it so much harder for employers I mean look at what just happened this isn't race but it's part of it do you see that story the other day about Trump's driver is suing him for overtime yes I did see that yeah so this guy worked for the Trump Organization for like 25 years drive into his personal driver for Donald Trump and he's now suing him because he claims that he worked more than 40 hours a week and so he wants more money right now of course he worked for 25 years why didn't he ask for a raise like during those 25 years right but apparently his job he had to be on call for maybe I don't know ten hours a day right and an on call doesn't mean he was actually driving he just had to be available to Trump if Trump needed him but that you know he could you know be on the internet he could be watching a movie he could be reading the book sending emails you know trading stocks whatever he wants to do so it's not like it was that like he was really working but he had to be available so he couldn't you know go out of town right but he's going back and he says that well I had to be available for more than 40 hours a week but maybe it was 50 hours a week or 55 hours a week and now he wants back pay time and a half right because overtime laws say you got to get time in half but first of all he wasn't even an hourly worker the guy collected a salary something like I know sixty-five seventy thousand dollars a year was his salary and you know he knew what the salary was when he took the job he knew what the hours were if he didn't like it he could have said something to Trump he could have demanded higher pay or he could have quit right but instead he works without complaint and then 25 years later files a big lawsuit now the boys out of work don't work in there he's still working there he is yeah and he's suing he's working yeah which you know and then of course if you fired them when they sue you it's like oh it's retaliation then it makes it worse but the problem is you know Trump he's got a lot of money I mean he can deal with this but your average small businessman you know this kind of stuff kills you when people start suing you it cost a lot of money and a lot of that happens to with you know the the the discrimination laws I mean because a small business owners are so concerned about getting sued that they try to hire people that they think are less likely to sue them and then it ends up backfiring because it works against all the people who are protected classes who are now able to sue you you know but I also wanted to bun to point out you know the overtime laws because so many people think oh this is terrible right I mean he should pay overtime you know overtime is those laws are probably some of the worst laws out there because they don't protect workers right because what happens is let's say you got a job and you're working 40 hours a week and you're an hourly worker and you want it you want more hours you want or money maybe you know maybe you want it you know you trying to attract a higher caliber of girls so you're trying to get more money you want to work more hours so you exist that's sexist what you just said so the blog so you tell you tell your boss hey can I you know can I work an extra ten hours a week right I want to get some I want to get some I want to make some more money right well your boss says well I'm sorry I'd like to let you work an extra ten hours but I have to pay your time and a half right and the guys like oh I don't need time and a half I'll just work ten hours for the same pay that's illegal sorry I would like to do it but I can't and if the if that boss needs extra workers he has to go bring on a part-time worker so now let's say if I want to get an extra ten hours work I got to find another job someplace else where I can work part-time where the time-and-a-half law doesn't apply but now I got to get from my my full-time job to my part-time job how long does that take me how common is this though that people are denying people extra well if you very need it because they don't want to pay the time oh it happens all the time I mean that's that that's where moonlighting came from that's the whole I mean obviously people you're gonna have you can have people that work for to employers and then other people working and they're going back and forth between the same companies so what you're saying is it's weird if someone has to work extra hours why are you paying them double the money well or time and a half time and a half way paying them the extra money because they're doing just just because they're working more than eight hours a day well but the thing is the employer doesn't want to pay the extra and he doesn't have to if he can hire somebody part-time but the point is that all of these the the the details of employment should be negotiated by the employer and the employee the government should stay out of it you know and that when time in half is a government law yes it's all nationwide yeah well different states could have different rules and and federally they have different rules over what constitutes how much pay do you have to earn before the overtime rules apply what's also isn't it pretty arbitrary like this decision that's 40 hours a week yeah well look everything that government does is arbitrary that's what laws are they have to come up with a number but all of this should be free for discussed you know it's because you have the Liberals believe that hey you know two people should be able to you know have a relationship without the government interfering right you know they can have a sexual relationship it's it's none of the government's business you know who you're you know you're sleeping with well why don't they have the same believing the same freedom when it comes to economic relationships if an employee and employer are having a relationship why doesn't the government just butt out and let the employer and the employee negotiate the relationship and the terms of the relationship that they think is best for them because there are a lot of workers that oh I don't need the overtime but maybe there's another benefit that I would prefer to have that I could get but I can't because of government laws are requiring things that I don't want so you're against minimum wage you're against essentially all these government regulations in terms of what you'd be paid I mean the minimum wage is probably the dumbest law that we talked about that on the last podcast but it's probably the dumbest law that you can come up with because all it does is hurt the very people that you are intending to help you you're hurting the the least skilled people you're preventing people from getting jobs in the first place and you're you're creating extra incentives for employers to eliminate jobs to try to use capital instead of labor to try to outsource I mean nobody is gonna hire somebody if they're losing money right people have a certain amount of productivity that they can bring to the table and when an employer makes a decision on who to hire they have to hire somebody that brings them at least enough productivity to cover the wages and so what happens is when you have a minimum wage let's say the minimum wage is you know $8 an hour and unskilled worker and I have to convince an employer to pay me $8 an hour I have to also convince him that I can deliver more than $8 an hour of productivity to his organization and if I can't do that I can't get a job now what if I can only bring $5 of productivity well that means you can't get hired well I mean if I could if I only have $5 an hour worth of skills and I can't get a job to improve my skills I'm stuck in unemployment forever I mean the worst thing you can do to a guy with minimal skills is prevent them from getting a job because it's the job that's gonna enable them to increase their skills so they can earn more money in the future I know what you're saying but the idea is that if you have a minimum amount that you allow people to pay then at least the people that are working for that company will have a real income where they can pay their bills and feed themselves and that this company because they have all the power they have all the money and a poor worker who's stepping into the market for the first time or you know just hasn't been able to acquire job skills that would allow them to make much more money per hour that they would be taken advantage of by this larger corporation well you know the corporation's don't have all the power because they're not the only employer I mean all employers compete with one another for labor and and and they bit up wages I mean you can't you know pay people less than the market value of their labor because somebody else will hire them you know so the the minoan tit be great if everybody can earn more money has there ever been a proven example of this where they've had no minimum wage and it's been Oh financial boom oh absolutely well first of all we didn't always have a minimum wage in the United States I mean it happened really in the 1930s but you can look at situations of countries that have no minimum wage and they have very low levels of unemployment and you can look at areas where the government reason is well I mean you know they don't have a minimum wage in Singapore and you know and there are countries that's in Singapore a lot of an example though it's an extremely wealthy country right well that's one of the reasons well they don't they it's very easy to do business but you can look at examples where the United States has imposed a minimum wage on other countries I mean the minimum wages did a lot of damage in Puerto Rico but you know look at another American territory American Samoa right American Samoa we basically destroyed American Samoa with our minimum wage I mean that the Samoans are you know you know are furious about it this happened years ago actually and I the reason I even found out about it I was watching 60 minutes and they were doing a report about I think football players in Samoa and and during their report they mentioned that there was like a depression going on in Samoa and it was like there was 30% unemployment and really high inflation I was like what the hell's going on in Samoa so I wanted to research that on my own and I found out that we imposed the minimum wage on Samoa and we destroyed all their jobs they're the two biggest employers were to a chicken of the sea and Starkist they were canning tuna and then they were shipping the tuna back to the mainland but the minute they raised the minimum wage they made the production uncompetitive because now you had to pay the higher wages plus the shipping costs to get the tuna back to the mainland so they say all the canneries shut down and then it created massive unemployment and then prices went way up on the island because they no longer had boats coming back and forth to pick up the tuna so now all of a sudden the shipping cost of imports went way up so they had massive inflation sky-high unemployment all because them in wage so you know you could look at you know examples of how minimum wage destroys jobs you know right there yet you know they continue to advocate for these higher wages because it sounds good Oh everybody should earn a decent living well you know not if you don't have any skills you can't and I'll of course you know a lot of kids you know they're 16 17 18 19 20 I mean people live with their parents still the most important thing is getting a job so you can acquire the skills to get a better job to you know to move up the ladder in an organization to enhance your you know your value to employers in general what's the argument against this yeah sure I'm against what you're saying about minimum wage against all these ideas that you're you're just proposing do you do you get a lot of pushback I mean I'm sure what you're saying this free market capitalism approach is it's you know there's a lot of people that oppose it of course I mean there's a lot of people that don't think it out they think with their mind or their or their mothers and they don't even get the origin of the minimum wage was racism I mean the first minimum wage is here it was designed to keep employers from hiring the Chinese or from hiring blacks because they you know the that that's where the minimum wage came from you know to try to prevent employers from hiring certain people so they said well let's have a minimum wage and and that will reduce hiring of people who have less skills and and so and the labor unions the biggest Porter's of the minimum wage are the labor unions and none of the labor unions workers earn the minimum wage so you might think why are they they so care about the minimum wage if they don't get paid a lot higher than men wage and it's because you always have a competition between skilled labor and unskilled labor right so let's say a business a businessman has the option of hiring a skilled person to do something and let's say the skilled person is gonna charge $20 an hour or an unskilled person and let's say I can hire three unskilled people for five dollars an hour and that equals fifteen well hey I'd rather hire the unskilled worker I can pay three five dollars an hour to do the same job of one skilled worker but now if the skilled worker can could lobby for a seven dollar minimum wage now if I have to hire three unskilled people it cost $21 AHA now all of a sudden I hire the guy with skills so the labor unions benefit by keeping unskilled people unemployed because they have more skills and therefore they can you know they can get more work that sounds like a complicated mess to me for the people that get get priced out of a job yeah now democratic socialism is the thing right now this is you're hearing it all the time you hear constantly in the news what do you attribute that do you think it's a frustration with just the lifelong politicians like what do you think it is that's causing this up for eyes an upswing look the woman what does her name that one in New York yeah you know she's actually half Puerto Rican what am i my countrymen but yeah I forget her name country United States no actually you know I found this out as I'm traveling now you know I still have an American passport but when I when I mentioned what country I'm from and I look where you live I always have to select Puerto Rico as a country even though it's part of America it's still considered its own country even though you still are American citizens when you live there and you travel on a US passport it's listed as a separate country from from the reader name from yeah that's how its Andrea yeah and you know Cortes 28 years old yeah well she beat she be a 8n term incumbent combin and of course he was a white guy that's a that's a negative for him she's but a woman of color yeah you know lefty nice-looking woman to actually justify yeah so but but but but the thing is people I think in that community are just voting out of frustration in fact I looked at her commercial you know and it's a very powerful commercial you know kind of like you know about you know I'm women like me are not supposed to run for office we're not supposed to court me not that's all bunch of nonsense but it's a story that that you know I think resonated with a lot of people like hey let's stick it to the man yeah right you know and and that's what they did but I think that this this wave is gonna be bigger than people think I think people are under estimating there's like oh this is unique because you know she she's in a you know a heavily minority community and so that message worked better but look Bernie Sanders read this here the gym just pulled up she won in a district where she didn't even run progressive candidate also won a primary in her neighboring district in the Bronx as a write-in found Reform Party oh well that's right but she won that she won yeah well I you know that you can't think you could have two House seats simultaneously think you crazy but the but if you look at Bernie Sanders appeal it wasn't just you know you know poor people in minorities that were that were you know attracted to the Sanders message and what was that message that was attract it was social it was you know it was it was you know the corporations and we got we got a tax the rich we got a Tax Resolution of wealth and it's all about getting stuff for free right it's all about you know free health care free education guaranteed jobs I mean they want they want the government to guarantee everybody a job well then is one of the things that Bernie said that yeah I could guarantee people Joe you can't everyone in the country how's the government getting Karen teach at first of all were the government saying where's the gummer going to get the money they did that in the Soviet Union yeah everybody has a job but nobody makes anything and so everybody is poor I mean you can't say what they want to guarantee a $15 an hour job plus benefits plus vacation plus health care to do what and of course the governor's gonna assign jobs to everybody what are they opened exactly I mean people forget that we don't want jobs we want the productivity that results from the job so it's about productive employment not make work right we don't want the government digging holes and filling them we want real jobs and and how do how does a private sector know what jobs are needed it's the bandits they're it's it's individuals that want something they're guided by a profit motive you know the government that open government doesn't make a profit there's nothing to guide them to efficiently allocate resources and how is the government going to just figure out what people should do and just assign them okay this is the job you're gonna do this is you know it would destroy employment in this country if you did that which this doesn't even make sense that you could offer everyone a job like you don't have those jobs first of all and the idea that well what what are we gonna do we're gonna create X amount of construction jobs and X amount of dishwashing jobs and X amount of carwash jobs you're not going to and where's the money gonna come from to pay for it they're gonna do that they're gonna have to take the money from the private sector that would have created efficient jobs and they're gonna give it to the government to create inefficient jobs it's a disaster but the problem that I mentioned earlier is the economy is in bad shape because of all the government that's what went back to my the Occupy Wall Street is that the people are protesting because there's serious problems in the country they don't realize that it's not capitalism that has creating those problems capitalism would solve those problems it's government interference that is causing the problems that they're protesting and so the same thing with these socialists that they understand that their standard of living is falling right look at like they one of the things they want to do is they want to give free education I guess the Liberals are all complaining about the fact that college is so expensive and that students have so much debt that's because the government before the government got involved college was cheap I mean government drove up the cost of college by guaranteeing student loans I mean that's how the government got the votes of students they promised the students something for nothing they said hey vote for me and I'll guarantee I'll make it easier for you to get a loan to go to College right well the minute colleges knew that people could get these loans they started jacking up the tuition so they could benefit from all this government money so the college is benefited the banking system benefited by making riskless loans that the taxpayer was on the hook for but the byproduct of all this cheap money being funneled at the colleges was that the colleges kept raising the tuition higher and higher and higher and then the politicians kept increasing the amount of loans they would subsidize and so all of this is their fault of government the government created the problem that they're now complaining about but the students don't understand that that's why college is so expensive well no one sees a clearer way out that's part of the problem and it's one of the reasons why socialism is so compelling it's like this seems like it's an alternative to what we're currently experiencing so people look at that and go maybe that's the solution yeah look people want something different I said that's what Trump was able to claim that he was going to shake things up and make America great again because I'm different because what's working what we have now is not working that's why I'm so afraid that when people who voted for Trump you know end up being disillusioned because nothing changes their lives don't get better and you're completely convinced it's gonna be a crash coming in the next three years yeah I mean look there's gonna be a big recession right I think it's gonna be worse than the 2008 financial crisis I mean that because the government was able to bail everybody out that time they were able to print a bunch of money and go deeper into debt and the financial crisis if you didn't have money in the stock market and you didn't lose your job it wasn't that bad right I mean you know you know you you were fine but this next crisis even if you don't lose your job you're gonna be affected by inflation prices are gonna go way up because I think this is gonna be a dollar crisis this is gonna be a sovereign debt crisis and investors were bailed out the government was able to bail out investors last time with quantitative easing and all the tarp and all that but the next time investors are not gonna get bailed out right they're gonna go down for the count because if they try and I believe they will try to reflate the bubbles again by printing even more money doing another round of quantitative easing it's going to destroy the dollar so they're not going to reflate the bubble in cocks they're gonna prick the bubble in the dollar and so when the dollar loses value and prices go up and you have stagflation you have a combination of a recession and inflation at the same time and then of course what is the Fed gonna do in that circumstance because they you know their playbook is if you have recession you ease if you have inflation you tighten well what if you have them both together you know they just did these stress tests you're you're these banks stress tests and the Federal Reserve came out and they said that all the bank's passed you know well what a shocker right the Fed came up with a test that everybody passed but if you look at the assumptions that that they made about the economy under the worst-case scenario that they assumed interest rates ten-year rates go no higher than three percent they don't go they don't they don't go down they just don't go up and they assume that inflation stays below two percent under the worst-case scenario and they assume that the Fed is able to lower interest rates 2 1 / 2 0 again to stimulate the economy now I mean what happens if inflation doesn't go down what if it goes up but if it goes up to 5 percent 8 percent you know what if interest rates go up to 5 percent or 8% 10% what happens then right all the banks collapse because what happens if we have a recession where the Fed can't stimulate because inflate they have to fight inflation or what happens if we have a recession and the government has to raise taxes during the recession because the budget deficits exploding and they don't have the money to pay the interest on the debt what does happen well well I think that the political politics are going to play come into play and that the Fed is going to err on allowing inflation to run out of control they're gonna do what they can to try to prop up the economy and they're gonna sacrifice the dollar they're gonna say well inflation is the lesser of the two evils but it's actually gonna end up being the greater evil I remember you know when Nixon imposed wage and price controls which was a very misguided effort it's kind of like you know what Trump is doing with the with tariffs trying to cure the trade deficit rising prices are the result of inflation it's not the cause and so price controls don't work they simply try to mask the problem while it while it while it gets worse but I think they're gonna let inflation get a lot worse and what that's gonna mean is that you know people need to prepare for that I mean people people need to do something we talked about that when I was on your show before about buying gold you know we talked about crypto currencies I talked about you know gold money and by the way this is you know when we talked about gold money on your show before and so many people this just shows you how many people listen to this podcast so many people tried to open up accounts at gold money because of our conversation that the regulators actually shut them down they actually stopped them from onboarding new customers because there was too many people coming onto the platform and and and and the reason look this is the bank this is this this is system that we're in now because when you have a gold money account right it's not like just buying gold you have gold that you can actually transact it I can take my gold and I can send it to anybody I want anywhere in the world who has an account for free so it's like a money transfers so gold has to be actually stored so yeah there's actually some real gold attacks it exactly there's gold stored in a Brinks vault and you know they have vaults all around the world but I can transfer my ownership of that gold to you or anybody else but because I can do that now all of a sudden the regulations there because they're worried about terrorists they're worried about money laundering and so everybody who has an account there has to be a lot of scrutiny about those accounts and those transactions just like it was a bank and so this is and a lot of people got frustrated I got a lot of emails from people who were frustrated a try to open up an accounts and they didn't realize that it was the regulators it's you know they get mad at gold money because they're not opening up their account or improving their account but it's the regulations that are the cog in the machine but the good news is I think they've they've made they've satisfied the regulator's recently they've come up with some new systems so the process is a lot more efficient now for people to go online and buy gold and you know again you can buy you know 25 50 bucks worth 100 bucks worth of gold and you actually have another store value another means of you know transacting with other people where you can have some protection against against inflation and you know I showed you I have like by the way they're sending you one of those gold cards I talked to him oh yeah yeah you know I showed you this card as I do have to send him some money yeah well you're gonna have to get I'm not sure if they're gonna preload your account you know I went through you know I brought this card through the through the security today and of course every time I go through security with this card it rings so I always have to take my wallet out and put it in a in a little little bin right and it freaked out you know they can never figure out what's going on because they see this thing a metal they have no idea what it is so it's always like it stops me but it's a conversation piece but I had about three or four different TSA guys we're all like you know looking at this card is that gold please don't know this is pure gold it's actually this is yeah this is this is that 24 karat gold so which is gold mixed with metal right mixed with Stephen no it's not mixed with anything it's Justin 24 karat gold like gold it's also mixed or something else yeah no that's like that you and you if you go buy gold jewelry right you're getting get an 18 karat gold or 14 karat gold so how much does this card worth it's gonna like fourteen fourteen hundred bucks this would be and if you melted it down pocket it's heavy yeah but I mean compared to other cards but you know gold money another way that people can buy gold pimp-slap some won't this yeah they launched a company called monnet right the website pulled up at me and he calm and this is a great way for average people to own gold but also killed two birds with one stone because when you go out and buy jewelry right and you buy typical jewelry maybe it's you know 14 karat gold 18 karat gold the men a jewelry is 24 karat gold and they sell it by the weight of gold so if you let's say you went you went to a department store and you spend a thousand dollars on a gold necklace right maybe you'd have $100 worth of gold maybe right if you spend $1000 at minae you're gonna get $800 worth of gold and Monnaie will buy that that necklace back from you at any point in time in the future two years from now five years from now ten years now at whatever the gold value of the necklace is so let's say gold goes up by thirty percent from the time you buy the necklace you can actually sell it back to Monnaie for more than you paid for it whereas if you know if you have used jewelry that you buy at a department or what's it worth on the second-hand market you know ten cents on the dollar right 20s maybe so this allows people to have nice jewelry but also own real gold at the same time I mean you're gonna pay a higher premium to buy a gold necklace I have a pair of gold gold cufflinks that I wear my wife my wife wears this been a jeweler all the time she wears it every day and so it you know you can buy it instead of buying other jewelry but you know you're not throwing your money away you're actually you're actually getting also people but the point is that people need to protect themselves from the inflation that's coming because that is where we're headed right they the government is going to continue to print money to try to prop everything up to try to delay the day of reckoning for as long as they can and you know we've had a rally in the dollar recently because people think oh the trade war is good for the dollar they're wrong it's a disaster for the dollar America can't win the trade war I mean we benefit from the trade deficit right now all we can do is lose in the short run if we lose access to all those goods that we're not having to pay for with exports you know they're actually trying to say that the budget deficits going up is good for the is good for the is good for the dollar when it's not I mean big budget deficits are always bad for the dollar because it means the government is creating more debt they're selling more bonds around the world you're you know the supply of dollars also includes the supply of Treasuries and so if you're flooding the world with Treasuries you're you've got a surplus of dollars that dollars gonna lose value and so people have to find a way to protect themselves and you know the average guy I mean gold is the easiest way to do that you know and you know with the gold money account you could do it very you know very inexpensive of course if you want to buy bigger amounts of gold if someone wants to put 50 thousand 100 thousand dollars with the gold I wouldn't spend it on jewelry right you could just buy you know regular goal I got a company ship gold right where I sell you know maple leaves the Krugerrands US you know rare you know us buying gold jewelers should be in addition to not not a primary investment well because of the higher markup right when I sell gold bullion to people coins we mark it up you know 1 2 % it's a small markup the markup on jewelry is higher because we had to pay to make the jewelry it's more expensive to make a gold necklace or a gold bracelet or a gold ringg than to make a gold coin so you wouldn't want to have all your gold in jewelry but to the extent you're gonna buy jewelry anyway you might as well buy real gold because now you actually have some savings that has value in addition to having something you can wear I mean I don't I don't get a lot of value day-to-day by having gold and is safe but if you know if you're wearing it right I mean so then you know now you're getting an extra benefit from the fact that you have gold because you now you know you get to enjoy it on a daily basis if you're wearing it and and obviously too if you don't have that much money if you know someone's not gonna buy any goal that someone has a couple thousand dollars that's you know they were gonna spend it on jewelry alright well spend it on gold jewelry because at least you still have the money right at least you know 80% of what you spent you still have yeah well it makes sense to me and I don't know much about gold but it's it's weird that gold is one of those things it's like universally been thought of as valuable like forever yeah that's well that's why that's why it's money I mean gold has always been you anything else like that let me there are other metals that have been used as money I mean silver has been used as money but I mean gold you know has been the choice and it looks Central Bank's own a lot of gold I mean not as much as they used to not as much as they should but central bank's owned it Gold's are monetary metal but you know gold is used in a lot of things I mean it's in cell phones and computers it's used in in in in medicine and dentistry I mean so there are a lot of uses for it because gold has properties that other metals don't have that gives it value not just its its physical beauty but also the things that you can do with it you know you you can do things with gold that you can't do with other metals and you know gold's not gonna tarnish it's you know not it's like you know rust you know so as you know you can make something out of it and it's not going anywhere yeah you can also plate things with a rail you can take a small piece of gold you could plate this entire table exactly yeah Ivy's very I've never seen that happen but I've had it explained to me it seems very strange yeah the property is that it has you know you know no other metal can replicate and that's what are the reasons that it's been so desirable for so many years but it also makes it you know ideally suited to be money and that's you know one of the things that you know Bitcoin bitcoin is trying to digitally replicate the properties of gold I mean that's the whole selling point of Bitcoin they say it's digital gold right and it does have a lot of gold's properties that helped it succeed as money but it doesn't have any of gold physical properties that gave it so much value in the first place and so you can't separate the intrinsic value of money from money money has to be a commodity it has to have value and that that's where Bitcoin fails you know I just had I had a debate in New York and Soho lastly the last week on Bitcoin but you know whether it was going to succeed and replace the fiat currencies and basically you know technically I lost the debate but I think it was rigged was it rude well because you know the way the way they decide to written the winner is before the debate they have a poll and they ask everybody where they stand and then after the debate they asked them where they stand now to see if people you know people change their opinion and since everybody in there was it was a whole Bitcoin audience and I had to confirm to me from several sources that basically everybody was saying hey make sure you vote this way before the debate so you can change your mind after the bait so that the pro Bitcoin guy is gonna win why did you did they initially vote neutral or anti Bitcoin no no so the opposition well so the proposition is will Bitcoin replace the dollar or other fiat currencies right in the future but they wanted to propose it initially before the debate right get your thoughts but they rigged it by having these people have contrary thoughts before the debate well so as if Bitcoin was evangelized to them like oh now I get it yeah the idea is like a bunch of people were in this debate that didn't believe Bitcoin was the future but now after this hour debate they were convinced by my opponent that it was the future because then you know when I read all the stories and if you go online you read the stories about the debate it's always like Peter Schiff lost Peter gets bested shift loses so it's almost like I got I got caught up in the in the Bitcoin propaganda but this is so much like you want to talk about tribalism Bitcoin and cryptocurrency those people are all in oh yes I said a giant group of them that are just yeah in yeah they're all I said they're all in Puerto Rico now so I'm hanging around more the crypto guys than I used to and yeah you take look you know I feel badly in that well first of all some of them got very rich so I don't feel bad for these guys that I mean that that got rich they put you know a few thousand dollars in and I have millions of dollars you know I mean obviously I could I know I missed out on that myself right I mean I mean that I mean there's a lot of bubbles that I missed out I didn't make anything on the dot-com bubble I mean I made money when it came down I didn't make any money on the housing bubble until it went down and you know I missed out on the Bitcoin bubble but but this bubble was tailor-made for me if there was ever a bubble that I should have been part of it was this one this was all it was all for the libertarians right free-market guys anti fiat currency so you know I knew about it early on I mean not at the very beginning when it was like pennies but I knew about it before it was $10 I knew about it when it was pretty low how much do you have invested in Bitcoin oh is zero zero yeah I mean I you know I actually you know what I got 50 bucks worth because Oh big spender well you know what happened is you know after after after the the debate I went out to dinner with Erik Voorhees who is my opponent his wife my wife was there we had group people and so they gave me to show me how it works they gave me $100 with a Bitcoin and then I gave somebody back 50 but I kept 50 of it so I just in case yeah although now it's only worth 48 cuz it's gone down right it moves all over the place yeah but but you know so I mean I don't feel badly that you know some of these guys lucked into having a lot of money or you know it's luck or they took a shot and it paid off right they got in and you know and that the market exploded and they have an opportunity to cash out on a profit but a lot of them are not cashing out they're gonna I think they're gonna go down with the ship but when you say that you think it's going down oh yeah it's look it's not gonna succeed as money it's not going to work it's just a highly speculative asset you know and the last time I did your show I mean a lot of people are you know what Peter Schiff got wrong on Joe Rogan about you know Bitcoin I mean everybody think I don't understand it and that's why I don't believe in it it's because I do understand it but I don't believe it the people who think it's gonna work they may understand the technology but they don't understand money and so but when I talk to these people to me you know it's very much you know like a cult I mean they're they believe so strongly in this they're so caught up in the hype and the hysteria and maybe they're blinded by the money they think they're gonna make you know when this you know these things are a million dollars apiece or wherever they they believe they're all right so they think it's going to they think it's gonna go a million well there was an article last week some guy was saying a hundred million a hundred million a big coin you know that's why nobody wants to sell right but the smart people are selling the people that got into earlier trying to con people into holding on so that they can get out a hundred million they're talking about a hundred million it's basically some numbers on did they ever figure out who that's at oh sheesh no no just Nakamura I don't know I be I don't know why the guy hasn't come forward if it's a guy at all so I said that they think it's Neal on musk I don't know but whoever you whoever it is you figure they've got a lot of Bitcoin if they're a real person might be a group of people but of course now it's not just Bitcoin right there's 1,500 to 2,000 of these other crypto currencies well not just that there's a bunch of different ones right there's different variants yeah and that's part of the problem because they think oh there's 21 million bitcoins mm-hmm and they think that that means they're scarce well they're not scarce there's so many other currencies out there and it's only scarce because they it's coated to be scarce gold is scarce because it really is scarce you know bitcoin is scarce because they decided to make it scarce but it's it's not scarce in that but there's nothing that any other cryptocurrency can't do that bitcoin is doing I mean but they're looking at as an alternative not to gold but to the currency that we currently use well no they mobely they look at it as an alternative to both I think a lot of them although some people think it's maybe a compliment of gold but you know it doesn't have any actual value and that's where I get into a lot of arguments with these crypto guys because they say well gold doesn't have any actual value either which is laughable because of course gold has actual value there are lots of things that I can do with gold and that shows that it has value there's nothing that I can do with Bitcoin other than give it to somebody else I mean that's the whole purpose of it is to give it to somebody else and right but our whole economy is kind of screwy it's entirely possible that it could shift over to is a crypto coin based economy don't you don't I mean cryptocurrency based economy governments could certainly issue crypto fiat currency the same way they issue paper fiat currency in fact most of our paper currency transactions are digital anyway I mean how much cash do you use on a daily basis you use your credit card and and so banks are transferring they're not you know they're not shipping bills back and forth mostly it's just numbers on a computer so the government could certainly do that and I you know that that would probably you know give them even more control over the economy which is a negative thing because you know at least if you have cash I can I can give you $100 and the government doesn't see that transaction they're not spying on us but if they eliminated all cash and all transactions were digital then they would know everything I did I mean every dollar I spent would be recorded on some government computer and you know that's something that I felt I don't want and I think you know libertarians certainly don't want that which is one way cryptocurrencies could backfire as if the government's end up monopolizing cryptocurrency and you know an issue cryptocurrency alongside or instead of the paper currencies that they issue now but I think part of the biggest damage that's ultimately gonna come from it is when the crypto currencies collapse and people lose a lot of money which is going to happen the government's gonna be able to say you see we told you the free enterprise capitalism is no good I mean look what happens when you trust you know you know the Bitcoin it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna help make the dollar and the euro and the yen look good by comparison even though these are fatally fraud currencies they're still gonna look better than the crypto currencies the people who have lost a lot of money see right now people there are a lot of people that like Bitcoin cuz they bought it real cheap and even though it's gone down you know 70 percent from its high it got up to 20,000 and now it's about 6400 you know there's a lot of people that bought it and still have big profits but what about the people that bought it at 20,000 18,000 fifteen thousand ten thousand there money and if it keeps falling and it goes down to 1,000 or lower where I think it's going you have a lot of people that have lost a lot of money and so that's going to create a lot of problems and I think the government's going to come in with all sorts of new rules and new regulations on transactions to try to protect us from ourselves again it's just gonna you know try to make government look good in the free market look bad but you know people get caught up in frenzies all the time it doesn't mean that the free market needs to be shut down just because every once in a while you know people get greedy and get nuts and it's not a reason to expand the power of government because government will do much more damage to an economy then you know small bubbles will do when you know when you have a boom and a bust because you have a mania do you think that there's any crypto currencies that are compelling is there is there anyone other than Bitcoin ego well this one has a different percent of parameters or different set of rules now because to me I mean you know you you just can't have a digital token that you just create that's going to have gonna be a store value I mean money money has to be a store value it has to be a medium of deferred payment so what that means is you know I have to be able to take my money and save it for a year five years ten years I have to be able to make a loan like I can loan you money I can't loan you a Bitcoin and you say I'll pay the Bitcoin back in ten years because none of us know what the bitcoins gonna be worth so how do you know what kind of interest rate to charge you need to have stable money and I don't think any of these crypto currencies can ever be stable because there's no real value to stabilize people say it's a store of value but there's no value to store so the only crypto currencies that would work would be crypto currencies that were backed by a real commodity like gold and that can work but you know what gold money does is actually something better because you don't have to have a crypto currency you just have actual gold see the reason that currency existed in the first place because currency was always backed by real money so let's say I had gold that I was storing at a blacksmith I had a bar gold and I had a piece of paper that said you know you know pay to the bearer on demand you know this bar gold right and it was written from a rep beautiful blacksmith I could negotiate that piece of paper I can give you that piece of paper say hey I own some gold at this blacksmith take this piece of paper and now you own the gold right and and so that piece of paper is functioning as a money substitute as currency but the real money is in a vault it's gold but it's I can't break it's hard for me too I can't break up that bar I can't just give you a small portion of it but what gold money is doing is taking that old blacksmith concept and bringing it into the modern era because I can store my gold in a vault at Brinks through gold money and now I can transfer any portion I can give you a gram of my goal that tiny amount of gold I can just send it to you for free and now you own that goal because now the ownership register is going to be changed and instead of being in Peter Schiff name it's gonna be in Joe Rogan's name and so once you can do that once I can take a bar of gold and and turn it into liquid money that can be used to buy a cup of coffee and you're doing all this without having physical control of the gold no no it's not physically holding it in your hands it's in a vault somewhere yeah well somebody has to have physical control and that's what a lot of the Bitcoin advocates don't like about something like a gold mine I said well you have to trust a third party to store your gold yes you do I mean but people have been trusting third parties with gold for thousands of years and you know you have reliable third parties that can hold onto something of real value because you have to have stability I mean that's the big problem that we have in the world today is we have no real money we just have these fiat currencies that governments create out of thin air and there's no real stability in the monetary system if we had real money if we were on a gold standard which I believe we will be on again eventually because that is the norm throughout history is to be on a gold standard all these experiments with fiat currency they don't work they don't we haven't been on a gold standard since 1921 Trump is out there trying to say we have the greatest economy in history I mean it isn't it isn't even close I mean forget about the fact that it's not even better than it was when Obama was president and he said that was an economic wasteland but you go back to the period of time let's say 1870 through you know 1910 or in there I mean that was the the Golden Age of America I mean that is what created the middle class the middle class was a was a byproduct of the economic growth that took place in America I mean we basically had tremendous economic growth we absorbed tens of millions of immigrants that were coming from all over the world and they weren't coming here for welfare and food stamps because they didn't exist there was no minimum wage you know there was just freedom here and people came here from all around the world because they could be freer in America than they could be anyplace else and it was those free Americans working you know with a gold standard with a solid sound money that created the greatest amount of economic growth that the world has ever seen in this shortest amount of time I mean people talk about how great the Chinese economy is but you know look back at the American economy during that period and that was tremendous growth and I think you know we could have great growth again you know to the extent that we you know you know substantially diminish the size of government but part of that would be to return to sound money and that would be gold but the cult of personality you know it's it's one of those things man I don't know this this is such a fascinating conversation because I would love to have a person who's equally educated on this stuff that opposes your viewpoint and I'd love to see yeah well they're there you know there's certainly people that oppose my viewpoint there's no shortage of them right but you know you you know I'd be happy to come on the show you don't think they're correct no no they're not correct at all oh you know before I forget - I forgot to bring this up because you mentioned it on the other podcast and you're like I wish somebody would come in and talk to me about it yeah that's got to talk about it which is the act 2022 in Puerto Rico and whether or not Porto Rico is in trouble because you have a bunch of rich people who are there we're not paying taxes yeah that was the the charge right that the reason why it was so difficult to rebuild the infrastructure post Maria was that all you rich guys had come there and he soaked off the economy and that's why you're there because you weren't paying any taxes yeah and so first of all the the the tax breaks didn't start until 2012 and before that what was going on and well just say what changed well if you were rich in Puerto Rico you paid the same 30 percent tax federal you know taxes everybody else know nobody in Puerto Rico has to pay federal income taxes that is one of the big benefits that Puerto Rico has you don't have to pay the federal income tax if you lived there when you're working there and the money you earn so if I had moved to Puerto Rico in 2010 or 2011 which I did not do but had I moved there then I would have had to pay the same high Porto Rican income tax that everybody else in Puerto Rico's paying but what enticed a lot of people to move to Puerto Rico was the fact that they reduced the taxes now the taxes aren't zero right you if you come there you're still gonna pay taxes on some of the money that you earn like my business pays a four percent corporate tax so it's not zero I pay four percent I can give myself a dividend that's tax free but the corporations are required to pay out a certain amount of taxable salary to the owners so some of my salary is taxed as high as thirty percent the MUC the majority of it is taxed basically at the four percent but four percent is something is better than thirty percent of nothing plus they're getting thirty percent of something so a lot of the people who have moved to Puerto Rico over the last you know five six seven years that didn't live there before are paying a lot of taxes now to the Puerto Rican government even though the rate is very low the dollar amount is very high and each individual person who has moved there is paying a lot more taxes than the average Puerto Rican who's already living there paying the higher rate so the people who moved there bought brought significant tax revenue that Puerto Rico never was going to get because remember if they were taxing people at thirty percent people from California wouldn't have moved their people from New York from New Jersey wouldn't have moved there it was the low taxes that brought all these people to Puerto Rico who never would have been there and they're now paying taxes but more importantly they're hiring people who are also paying taxes they're spending a lot of money locally in the economy generating revenue and jobs so they've been a big plus and I can tell you the people who have moved there myself included we donated a lot of money to the relief efforts I mean as soon as that hurricane was over a lot of the act 2022 people which is what they'd be called because they went there to participate they were raising money they were helping out I mean so there's a lot of charity that came to Puerto Rico that a lot of these people they wouldn't have thought of it if they didn't already live there but by bringing a lot of wealthy people down there to Puerto Rico and they're they're living it you know they're more inclined to help out their neighbors then when they were still living in the u.s. so Puerto Rico has derived significant benefit from an influx of wealthy entrepreneurs well this idea you're taking advantage of them and that you moving in there and just exploiting that place by getting paid and low taxes and that it's it's a it's a bad thing for the people that live there no that's a false deal it's a great thing for the people that live there because people are coming to the island bringing capital bringing businesses bringing employment opportunities paying taxes that they never would have paid let me ask you ever anticipate I mean it seems but what is Puerto Rico as big as any state like is this big as Rhode Island like how big so it's it's small I mean I mean geographically it may be about the size think it's like 30 miles maybe and that's the length it's it's skinnier than that so it's it's a small place but you know relative to the Caribbean I mean if you compare it to other Caribbean islands it's pretty big how long is the flight from like New York to Puerto Rico actually in the air it's about three hours but I think the airlines you know they leave about four you know if you look at the flight time but actually from wheels up to wheels down it's about a three hour flight so it's it's not far and there you know there are a lot of places that you can fly direct to go to the west coast no you got it you know you got an aeroplane would there be a way that all these people coming in they could somehow or another fix this the whole electrical system that they have there their power grid and yeah look the power grid this just shows you all the people that think socialism is so great look at Puerto Rico that's why they're broke right the socialists destroyed Puerto Rico the Socialists in Puerto Rico and of course the ones that we have in Washington because all their problems aren't self-inflicted but we created a problem for Puerto Rico and number a number of ways right first of all right we have the minimum wage that you know the average income in Puerto Rico is half of the poorest state in the United States which I forget I forget which is the poorest state so I can't uh Kentucky may be but it's it's half of half of that right but now you've got a minimum wage that's the same as Kentucky so it is basically keeping a lot more people unemployed but then you have you still have welfare you still have food stamps so you have all these people now that are not working because they're getting paid by the government but then you have the Puerto Rican government which is a major employer of people work for the government and a lot of them are just doing nonsense right I mean there's so many people that are working for the government they're not productive but they're draining resources from the Puerto Rican economy I mean part of it was a power company you know you mean it's a disaster but the government is running everything there and so everything is inefficient and meanwhile a lot of the productive people people who want jobs have left the island like if you think a high minimum wage is great all the people who are leaving Puerto Rico to go to Florida are effectively even though it's the same minimum wage they're actually going to a state that has a much lower minimum wage relative to the minimum wage because they can get jobs in Florida they can't get them in in Puerto Rico so you know you have that situation where you know very few people are actually employed so you don't have a real tax base and then what America did what really screwed them over was we made all their bonds triple tax free we said if you're if you live in New York and you buy Puerto Rican government bonds you're not gonna pay any local income taxes you're not going to pay any federal income taxes it's all tax free now if you loan money to a Puerto Rico company right if you loan money to a private business in Puerto Rico you got to pay taxes on whatever they pay you an interest but if you loan money to the Puerto Rican government the interest is tax-free so America subsidized invest in loaning money to the government in Puerto Rico but not to the private sector and so they made it very easy for Puerto Rican politicians to go into debt because all these muni bond funds all over the country needed Puerto Rican paper to increase the yield on their fund so you have everybody wants to Puerto Rican government bonds so the Puerto Rican government is creating these bonds and they can now buy votes they can promise all sorts of goodies to people who vote for them they can overpay government workers give them all sorts of holidays right lots of time off and they can keep borrowing money so they got deeper and deeper into debt because we created a incentive for them to do that and and now they have a debt crisis because all of a sudden Puerto Ricans bondholders realized that Puerto Rico is never gonna pay back their money and then the other thing that we did to them and you I talked about I think on the show is the Jones Act which if you remember Trump suspended it for like a week or two after Maria but the Jones Act should be completely repealed and especially if Donald Trump's gonna be talking about well there's a number of aspects of it but the most significant to Puerto Rico is that the Jones Act says that if you want to transport goods from one US port to another US port it has to be an American ship right so Trump is out there talking about free trade we need free trade the Jones Act is the opposite of free trade it's complete protectionism it's saying that if you want to take something from Florida to you know if you want to take something no if you want to take something between the US and Puerto Rico you've got to use a u.s. ship you can't use a foreign ship right so there's no competition but what this is done is this has dramatically increase the cost of living so even though the average person in Puerto Rico earns half of what the average person in Kentucky earns groceries in Puerto Rico are more expensive than groceries in Kentucky so you have lower income but a higher cost of living that's thanks to the Jones Act and if they repealed Jones Act the cost of living in Puerto Rico would plunge and that's one of the reason - that the tourism industry Puerto Rico is a beautiful island I mean if you haven't been there you should come it's it's a magnificent island and what's also great about it is it has a real culture as a real vibe to it it's a it's a city it's like it's a Latin American city on an island it's not just like a remote little island so it's a really nice place to be and it's one of the only places that I think you can really live in the Caribbean and and not feel like you're just you know you know on Gilligan's Island or not dealing but just you know like on vacation all the time it's a real city with real stuff going on and I've been there now long enough that you know you know I would go there you know you even without the tax breaks I like being there right I look forward to going about crime and poverty yeah I mean look there's crime there in the big city in San Juan in certain areas just like there are in New York and just like all major US cities you've got crime problems and again that's there's there's a lot of reasons for that again has to do with government it has to do with the drug laws and all the other things although they got miracle marijuana in in Puerto Rico I think eventually though I probably have recreational but at least they have they have medical but what was I just lost my train of thought what was like um well we're talking about oh they Jones Act Jones Act right and so oh yes so how it hurts the tourism industry so the Jones Act makes Puerto Rican hotels you know unable to compete on the low end with hotels and other Caribbean islands because everything is so expensive because the Jones Act and because they have the u.s. minimum wage specifically the Jones Act was it's on the shipping imports rights all right all the food in Puerto Rico is more expensive all the supplies so hotels have a lot of things where you go into a hotel there's all kinds of products you got bath products in there well that's nice to be sure and all the food that you eat all the drinks all the stuff is shipped in and to bring it to Puerto Rico is a lot more expensive than to bring it to the Bahamas or bring it you know - you know Barbados or someplace else so all these other Caribbean islands can get a lot of American tourists to go there on for bargain vacations but Puerto Rico can't compete on the low end on the real high end oh they can compete because there people are not as concerned about the cost but on the lower end the budget traveller a lot more people would be going to Puerto Rico if it wasn't for the Jones Act because there the hotels would be able to cater to you know a lower price point because they could hire the chambermaid for less money they could think if they could have lower prices at at the restaurant so that this is really destroying the tourism industry in in Puerto Rico which could be thriving but for the Jones Act but also it is diminishing the standard of living of Puerto Ricans who are forced to pay higher prices I mean what happens is let's say there's a big ship coming in from China with all sorts of goods and it's gonna it's it's headed for a u.s. port if it could stop off at Puerto Rico drop a few things off and then continue on you know its destination that would be great it would be inexpensive from but they can't what it has to do is it has to bring all the stuff that's going to Puerto Rico to the US unload it and then load it back on a US flag ship and then send it back to Puerto Rico which cost a fortune and then the same thing with Puerto Rican exports so their whole the whole Puerto Rican international commerce is being limited by the Jones Act now this also affects Hawaii Hawaii suffers from the Jones Act too but Hawaii is much richer than Puerto Rico they have a much higher average income and so even though it you know it affects them it's not as it's not as big a deal it's the same thing with her why even though Hawaii's a state yeah because yeah because Hawaii is a u.s. port so you know Hawaii has to have all these Jones Act ships as well so the if something gets delivered to Hawaii it has to get delivered to somewhere else first and then ship to Hawaii it's in go to California for this most stuff that's going to Hawaii that's coming like from the Pacific they don't stop off at Hawaii they may it seems so crazy if Hawaii is actually a state like Puerto Rican no because that does a strange thing it's right it's a territory right right that's that's the best thing that Puerto Rico's got going for if it was a state they'd have to pay the state income tax they'd have to pay the Obamacare tax time they'd have to pay the federal gas tax they're exempt from all that stuff but the Jones Act to do with you can't take a ship between two US ports they haven't it has to be a foreign port to a u.s. port so Puerto Rico is not considered a foreign port it's a domestic port Hawaii of course is domestic because - why is the state right and so Hawaii things are very expensive in Hawaii for the same reason that they're expensive in Puerto Rico but Hawaiians can afford it more because Hawaiians on average have more money right and so if your average income is is higher then you know you're you know your food budget is not as important to you so if we got rid of the Jones Act that would be a big benefit for Puerto Rico but you know the worst thing that can happen to Puerto Rico is it becomes a state and I get tired of when I keep hearing these politicians say Puerto Rico needs to be a state and and all the problems will be solved their problems will go through the roof the only thing that will happen if Puerto Rico becomes a state is the welfare checks will get bigger - people in Puerto Rico but that's the last thing they need is more welfare they need more freedom they need more opportunity they need more free enterprise and all that will go away if they become a state because if you imagine all the problems of Puerto Rican has now imagine levelling the income tax on top of that imagine sending the IRS to Puerto Rico they've met they're not even down there now imagine have an IRS agency really the support for socialism is there any place where socialism has worked where there's like some extreme benefits to the people that live there or they can show you know because they're guys like you the free market capitalist guys you're always saying like this is this is the solution you know get capitalism is solution give people freedom the solution deregulation that's the solution let businesses thrive more people make money businesses will grow people have more opportunity yeah you know people think it's worked in Scandinavia you know they always want to talk about Sweden right as an example of where socialism works well talk to a sweet right and they'll tell you that it doesn't work but if you want to look at the history of Swedish socialism Sweden became a very wealthy country before they had that socialism right they were very much of a free-market economy and it was the freedom that produced all the wealth but then whenever you have wealth and you have freedom you're always gonna have inequality right because peep are smarter than other people more ambitious harder working so whenever you have freedom you're not gonna have equality and outcome even if everybody has you know an equal opportunity and of course even that's not true equal up everybody is equal in the eyes of the law but there's always gonna be some people that will have an advantage you know maybe they have better connections they were born to you know parents that are you know have more money and they can give them you know give them a leg up so you're always gonna have unequal outcomes some people are gonna be rich relative to other other people but the beauty of of capitalism is that everybody is better off when you end up with socialism you you equalize everybody but you equalize them at a lower level you redistribute the poverty the people who end up wealthy are the people who have political connections so the wealthy people in socialist countries are the people who have political connections what happened with Sweden so let me go back to so Sweden was very rich okay and then of course you have the demagogues the politicians who will get votes by appealing to envy hey this guy has more than you it's not fair and of course politicians always promise something for nothing right vote for me and I'll give you this that you don't have to work for right I mean that is the problem with a democracy I mean people vote for crazy things that's why the founding fathers when they created America they created a republic right people don't understand the distinction but we're not supposed to be a democracy the word democracy does not appear in the Constitution it does not appear in the in the Declaration of Independence you know just you notice that the pledge of allegiance right I pledge allegiance to the flag in the I sense America right so we're a republic we're not a democracy because the founding fathers knew the dangers of democracy well democracy is what brought socialism into Sweden and it screwed them up right it screwed the economy up so much that in the last ten years they've gone the other way in they've lowered income taxes they've abolished the inheritance tax in Sweden I mean you know they got rid that sound socialist in the last 10 years so previous to that socialism had a stronghold yeah it would yeah it was getting bigger and bigger you know probably going from the 70s 80s you know the Swedish mixed economy just like it bankrupted New Zealand I mean New Zealand used to be the poster boy for smick sztyc on amis socialism until they got bankrupt so and Mandan is the only successful no though they're not it's not no but we're just gonna say that that's the only example that someone can say that's not Excel site Norway a lot of the Scandinavian countries Denmark but you have to look at how successful they were before they became socialist and then you also have to look at what the government is doing there because the taxes on business are not you know extreme the taxes are on the average guy they have I think in Sweden I think the Nevada is about 30% sales tax that you have to pay I mean this is a high sales tax I mean and then the income taxes impact average people so because they know the Swedes know if they really jack up taxes on businesses the businesses will just leave and they'll destroy their economy so at least they're trying to redistribute the wealth from the middle class to the middle class you know but that you know this stuff doesn't work and you create a generations of people who now don't want to work who just want to live off of other people you destroy the initiatives you destroy the incentives and so the success that Sweden enjoyed is a byproduct of freedom and capitalism and since they moved in that direction they have slowed down that progress but the Swedish people have recognized that and that's why the reforms that have been made over the last decade or two have been to turn back the clock to move away from those socialist policies and to try to dismantle now they haven't gone completely the other way just like New Zealand I mean New Zealand went so far they became they went from like a totally socialist type economy one that was like you know this was the example if you believed in socialism you would point to New Zealand as see this shows you right and then they went bankrupt they went through a huge economic crisis in the 80s previous to being socialist were they successful capitalism yeah of course that's always work yes because if you're always socialist and you never have any wealth to redistribute it's capitalism that creates the wealth that the socialists want to redistribute so let me ask you this though because we're gonna keep going around in circles with this your go study us for a long period of time what is it about socialism that's so appealing to Pete to people if there's no examples of it being effective well you know why does it keep coming up well again is it is it a lack of education or lack of understanding of economics like what is it about it that keeps like when this woman who just won and she seems like a very nice person when she talks about being a Democratic Socialist and everybody gets fired up and is it ignorant yeah look it you know certainly it's a lack of understanding of economics most people don't understand it but look I mean there are a lot of reasons that socialism is appealing to people especially when they're young right there's an old saying that if you're not socialist or if you're not a you know liberal by the time you're getting no you don't have a heart right if you're not conservative by the time you're 28 you don't have a hearing right so liberals are just people that never grew up right it's like it's like it's like it's like they still believe in Santa Claus that's what it is you just never socialists yes typically not necessarily liberal even well even people believing in big gar because usually what happens is you know when you're a kid right and when you're you know in high school you've never had a job and all this stuff sounds great until you're out in the real world paying taxes you know that's why it was a mistake to lower the voting age down to eighteen I mean I don't even think 21 it should be higher if you think about the original voting age when it was 21 100 years ago 150 years ago think about a guy who was 21 back in you know 1850 different person I mean think about I mean the guy probably got out of school when he was 10 probably already has been working he has got a family he's in a real world and I know people are gonna say look women were in voting fine you know whatever like I don't think that how old do you think it should be I think maybe twenty eight thirty the reason the reason that way is all the reason that should be twenty eight he's not old enough son really you know the reason the reason they raised the voting age was because of Vietnam because of the draft right they were saying old enough to fight old enough to vote right which was a bunch more sane lower the voting age no they they lowered it because you should be drafted when you were 18 and they were saying look you know if you're gonna drive look I don't believe in the draft I would rather get rid of the draft right and and and leave ie with you that 21 sounds better I would say 25 cuz that's the age that your frontal cortex develops but know what's what's important about voting is not voting look when I move to Puerto Rico I my right to vote right that's one of the things I can don't vote at all for president for anything I can't vote for Congress I just don't have a Congress there's nobody but it's still a state territory territory but so if you live in Puerto Rico and you move to Florida now you can vote for congressmen in your district you can vote for a Florida senator how much time you have to spend in Florida to be officially living there well I mean if you kept your place in Puerto Rico well I wouldn't want to do that but you know if you're if you're in port if you're in a it's 183 days is the you know the cutoff for where your residence is gonna be but the important thing about voting is not that you get to vote the important thing is to have good government right and what does good government good government is government that respects private property that respects that you know if you go back and look at I mentioned this on my own podcast recently I talked about the meaning of America and what government is foreign American if you go back to the Declaration of the penance we just had that we celebrated our Independence Day you know just a couple weeks ago but government is here to protect life liberty and the pursuit of happiness their government is here to protect our rights it's not here to give us free stuff it's not here to take stuff from other people and give it to us it's there to protect us right it's there protecting life liberty property and so the goal of government or the goal of an election is to have good government now as far as I'm concerned I would rather have good government where I don't vote then bad government where I do vote right because you know one of the things people said oh you're gonna move to Puerto Rico you can't vote who cares I vote for the loser in every election what difference does it make when some idiots are gonna out vote me and and and that's basically who's voting in America I mean if you think about it the elections are decided by the TV commercials right because most people you know they know who they're gonna vote for can you imagine the person who's who decides who's gonna vote for based on a TV commercial I mean these guys are morons it's a swing yeah the swing voters are determining the outcome of these elections and we end up with horrible government I mean government democracy almost guarantees horrible government but what are the things you want to do if you're gonna have democracy is okay let's have responsible people voting who you know understand what they're voting for who have actually lived and worked in the economy who have had a job who have paid taxes who have run businesses who have employed people if you've never had a job if you're still living with your parents why are you voting I mean we might as well lower the voting age and let people in kindergarten vote I mean right so they can vote for whoever promises them free toys I mean and people say you know oh it's unfair look if we can have good government without 18 year olds voting that's fine you know but the left wants the young people voting because they're stupid enough to vote idealistic there yeah and you said why is socialism appealing to somebody who's young because they don't know any better they haven't lived and it sounds good right right oh you know I care about people that's why liberals think conservatives are mean right right conservatives don't think liberals or me they just think they're there they don't understand they're misinformed right they're there they don't they don't get it right though that's sort of shifting it seems like there's more people that are thinking that liberals are mean now than ever before because the way they're attacking thing yeah because liberals are now so intolerant which is the craziest part like they like to pretend that they're so tolerant but they're the most intolerant people out there only tolerant if you agree with yes and to be tolerant you have to tolerate intolerance right that see we talked earlier about discrimination look if somebody is a racist I'm gonna tolerate that fine you can have your own opinion I can disagree with your opinion but fine live and let live I live in a free country people can do things I don't like but to a liberal if you don't if you don't think exactly the way they think then oh they know yeah they're thought you know the per ass you so they're becoming evil and mean so if they used to just be ignorant now they're now they're ignorant add add mean well not just mean but her passing like people encouraging people to harass people that have separate political views and yes it's it's it's very noisy it's very strange like anybody who supports the Trump administration or is even a part of it yeah people to get harassed at restaurants and yeah and you know I wish I could be a bigger supporter of Trump and I voted for him I really like Trump as a candidate because he was saying a lot of the same things I was saying when he was a candidate it's just that the minute he specifically well about do you know the phony economy and you know how we have to you know you know the numbers are not right and we have to shrink government so from you economically it made more sense than Hillary well I mean Hillary would be it I mean certainly a disaster but the irony of it is why would she be a disaster because she was just you know more big government I mean you know and I think she would have you know continued to fail policies but unfortunately Trump has continued those policies as well and he could end up being a bigger disaster if he is the catalyst to put a Bernie Sanders type into the White House and response 21 in response to how much worse the economy gets and he takes the blame for it but you so this is all predicated on your initial view that the economy is going to crash inside the next three years if it doesn't it does really well well it stays in this state that it's it's is it doing that well next it's just a bubble it's I mean it's it's it's it's no different than it was when Obama was president there's just some more optimism that things are gonna change well we know we're talking about this before it happened I remember you going on these different talk shows saying this is gonna crash and people weren't listening to you and they were like all Peter Schiff doesn't know what he's talking about and then it did crash and then they listen to you you're the only one that's saying it's gonna crash again well they never really listen to me they kind of tolerated me here's the well they had to cuz you were right well here's the irony of it all because you know leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and if you go to my youtube channel you could see like my introductory video is a little montage that I actually shot as part of my Senate campaign when I ran for Senate in 2010 but it's a bunch of people you know you're mocking me and then a lot of the shows that I went on where they said hey you were right you were the one guy that called it so I used to be on I was on television a lot on Fox CNBC CNN Bloomberg probably once a week for three or four years I was on something and then I used to get you know the Washington Post used to call me the New York Times you know I you know People magazine articles were written about me when I was this lone kind of crazy guy talking about a housing bubble talking about a financial crisis that was coming they at least you know gave me a platform to air my views even though they mocked them and laughed at them I was still there I was like the gloom and doom guy dr. doom I think Time magazine did an article with me I had a sickle in my hand like I was the Grim Reaper but anyway so then then we get to France with crisis and all of a sudden I get a little bit of notoriety who knows to Damas yeah Peter Schiff was right but all you know over the last few years that's I nobody will talk to me I'm not on any television shows about it well I think that at this point people just think look you know I've been saying talking about this problem for so long they look he doesn't know what he's talking about they forget that I was warning about the problems in the housing market for four or five years you know as the prices kept going up you know it's not like the things that I see happen immediately but I think you know at this point maybe in the past they thought maybe there was a chance I could be right even though it was a slim chance now they probably think it's impossible that I could be right so why even give me any airtime so I mean I come on shows like yours and people actually get to hear the truth but if you go back to what I was actually predicting 2008 that financial crisis was the beginning of the end not the end what I what I was predicting and I wrote a book about it crash-proof had a prophet for the coming economic collapse that came out in February 7 I said we have this huge bubble we have this housing bubble that the Federal Reserve created right not not the private enterprise it was created by government and in fact after the financial crisis happened Congress had a hearing to try to determine why we had a financial crisis and I tried my best to get invited to testify and they refused to let me be there because they didn't have anybody there that predicted it because they wanted to basically come to a conclusion that they had already arrived that was that it was caused by a lack of regulation and we need more government right so they didn't want me there to say it was caused by government and we needed less government although by the way I have testified at Congress twice since then and both of my testimonies are on the on YouTube and you got to watch him it's incredible stuff and in fact after I was on the first time I was convinced they would never invite me back because I don't treat these guys with the type of respect that they normally get so I thought they would never invite me back and they actually invited me back and then the guy that invited me back out fired I'll never there's no way that they're gonna bring me out you're so much better suited for I mean in those talk shows they bring you on you're so much better suited to doing your own videos or doing something like this where you could just go on yeah I mean now now see now I has a complex issues yeah now I have my own platform I have a lot more people who listen to my podcast and who you know then that I did back then but the point that I wanted to make about the crisis is I wrote back then that we had this bubble and we were gonna have this crash but the economic crisis was not gonna be that it was that the the collapse that I saw coming in oh wait was the beginning I said that we have this disease that the Fed is created and it's manifests itself in this housing bubble and it's gonna pop and we're gonna have the worst recession since the Great Depression we're gonna have double-digit unemployment we're gonna have trillion-dollar deficits but I said that's not what's gonna kill us I said we're not gonna die of that disease that disease is survivable I said what's gonna kill us is the government's cure they're going to print so much money they're gonna try to reflate these bubbles and that's gonna cause a dollar crisis and a bond crisis and that was what was gonna store the economy and that's not happened yet now what I did not know at the time and I didn't put a date on it I didn't know it would take so long I mean here we are ten years later almost and it has that hasn't happened yet but you think it's God it's got to happen and what I got wrong I said the government was gonna try to reflate the bubbles I assumed they would fail they succeeded the bubbles now are bigger than the ones that popped in oh eight and what's the difference between bubbles and an actual functioning economy that's sustainable right so it's doing well right now you you agree it's doing well no it's not doing well it's a bubble so the difference between a real economy okay a real economy grows from production and savings right right in the real economy we're making stuff and consuming like if you look right now at the savings rate right the savings rate is near a record low and the politicians try to say oh this is because the economy is so good right everybody is out there spending that's a bunch of nonsense if the economy was good people would have more savings right if if you ran into a friend of yours that you hadn't seen in a while and you asked them hey how you doing and he said oh well I maxed out all my credit cards I took out a second mortgage on my house you know III blew through my retirement account right you wouldn't fail you're doing great whereas if another friend said how you do it oh I just fully funded my pension I got massive savings I got you know I mean I paid off all my credit cards I own my house free and clear that's the guy that's doing well right when you're when you're doing well you you get out of debt right you know so we're not doing that we're all living based on a bubble based on cheap money being spent out into the economy right why is the stock market going up because of buybacks why are people spending because they're going deeper into debt we have record student loans record credit card debt record auto debt everybody is load up with that they just had a survey out I think that less than half the people could come up with like 400 bucks yeah if they had an emergency I mean that's nothing people have nothing they're living you know paycheck to paycheck and even that they need credit cards we have huge budget deficits we have huge trade deficits you know we got record numbers of you know people older people that that are working because they can't afford to retire meanwhile the young people can't get jobs just they have those skills and there's two so the economy is not real right it's all it's all disillusion just like it was what was going on before 2008 people were living off their home equity you know out here in California homes were going up people were taking out home equity lines of credit they were taking vacations they were buying new cars they were remodeling their houses all that prosperity was phony it was more well upon fake wealth yes and then the wealth came down and I talked about that for years what we have even faker prosperity now but it's not it's even less prosperous even fewer people are feeling the benefits than before so the real economy is getting sicker and sicker as it takes more and more air to inflate the bubble because in order to keep the bubbles from popping the government and the central bank has to keep misdirecting resources out of the real economy to sustain the bubbles alright so talk me through two things one what is going to happen that's gonna cause this big collapse you predicted way back in 2007 that hasn't actually hit yeah what's gonna cause that how's it gonna go down and walk in the average person like me that knows jack shit about economics what can we do to protect ourselves first of all you probably know more about economics than the average guy with an economics degree from an American University to you well yeah or just for having common sense I mean when when you go to US college and you study economics they basically beat all the common sense out of you and by the time you graduate you're complete moron when it comes to economics how do they do that well they teach them all this tames you nonsense you know that you know and and that's why all the the big economists in academia on Wall Street and government they're all a bunch of idiots when it comes to economics so you know a lot more than they do not that you're you're an idiot but I mean you just you just have to have common sense because they lack lack common sense but to get back to your question this is a bubble this is how I think it's gonna go down so everybody believes that the feds policy of quantitative easing and you know and and you know lo zero percent interest rates everybody believes it was a success they believe the Fed revived the economy right they put out the fire that's in there right they still don't realize that the Fed lit the fire and they didn't really put it out it's just kind of it's simmering and people don't notice it but what what's gonna happen is the Fed never was able to normalize interest rates right rates are still 2% that's still really really low and for all the talk about shrinking their balance sheet it really hasn't shrunk right it's still enormous and I think that the economy is gonna slip into recession right and when it does the Fed never got interest rates back to 5% or 6% where they normally bring them they never shrank the balance sheet so now all of a sudden we go into this recession but it's gonna be as a stagflation because inflation is now really starting to pick up you know prices rise with a lag you know the inflation is the expansion of the money supply that's what the word inflate means it comes it's to expand right you can't expand prices prices can go up and they go down they go and expand what expands is the supply of money and so the mot supply of money expanded and a lot of that went into financial assets so inflation caused stock prices to go up it caused real estate prices to go up it caused bond prices to go up it caused the price of rare art to go up and all sorts of things went up because of inflation ultimately a lot of that inflation that was going to end up in the supermarket right you know at the gas station and and so you're gonna have that at the same time that we have the recession now the Fed is gonna have to go back to the only thing it knows how to do we're gonna do QE 4 and we're going to cut rates back to zero but now the markets are gonna see this and they're gonna wait a minute you never normalized interest rates you never shrunk your balance sheet and now you're gonna expand it again now you're going back to zero wait a minute wait a minute if you couldn't normalize interest rates following you know this last recession how are you gonna do in the future I mean if you couldn't shrink a four and a half trillion dollar balance sheet how are you gonna drink shrink a six or a seven trillion dollar balance sheet if you couldn't raise interest rates back to normal when the national debt you know our national debts not 21 trillion what if it goes up to twenty five trillion 30 trillion I mean one of the reasons the Fed can't raise rates is because we have too much debt nobody can afford to pay the higher rates you know when inflation was running out of control in the 1970s and it's going to be a lot worse now right the inflation that we had in the 1970s was created in the 1960s by Lyndon Johnson right by the Great Society the war on poverty the Vietnam War going to the moon we borrowed all sorts of money we ran big deficits and the consequence was the dollar crashed in the 70s gold went through the roof oil went through the roof and finally you know we had to do something about it at the end of the seventies because when Nixon came in and and Ford came in they just continued the same policies they were you know very liberal Republicans Rockefeller Republicans and we didn't do anything about inflation until Reagan came in and Volcker was there and so how did they stop the inflation from running out of control Volcker jacked interest rates up to twenty percent twenty percent and we had a recession where the Fed was raising interest rates but that saved the dollar and it broke the inflationary cycle that was in the acog rising the interest rates yes they will they had to stop the inflation right right they had that they had they had a break and of course you know Reagan did some other you know tax reform and things like that but the Fed really finally you know got it got out in front of the inflation curve and they brought it down but if you think about the difference between the United States in 1980 and the United States today we were still the world's biggest creditor nation in 1980 not the world's biggest debtor nation the national debt was a fraction of what it is now I don't maybe it was like a half a billion oh five hundred billion or I don't know the exact amount but well under a trillion but the the national debt was financed with long-term bonds like 10-year 30-year bonds so when interest rates went up to 20 percent that didn't affect the majority of the debt that was out there that only increased the cost to the government of the new debt that came out right the new borrowing but today the 21 trillion dollar national debt is predominantly Treasury bill stuff that matures in a year or less and and so if interest rates had to go up to let's say 10% the government would have to pay 10 percent within a few years on the entire national debt so where would the government get all that money and it's not this the government corporations have never been this levered up individuals have never been this lever they didn't have adjustable rate mortgages back then you know now you got still have a lot of people that have arms you know we're you know their mortgage debt would go up with so at this point the Fed can't really fight inflation because it doesn't have the tools because we have so much debt if they raised interest rates to fight that inflation the the collapse would be so much worse than 2008 all the banks that they bailed out would fail again but they couldn't bail them out a second time because they can't bail them out and fight inflation at the same time because you can't ease and tighten simultaneously it's one or the other so I think when the markets see that we're going back to QE that we're going back to zero they're gonna realize that this is not temporary that this is permanent that the Fed can never normalize interest rates that the balance sheet is never gonna shrink that we're a Banana Republic that we are monetizing our debt that the you know the Fed has no ability to drain that liquidity and no ability to fight inflation that means the dollar is a bottomless pit that means that dollars gonna keep falling that means nobody is gonna want to own it and everybody's gonna want to get out of dollars and everybody's gonna want to get out of any bond that is denominated in dollars and then the Federal Reserve in order to keep interest rates from rising they might have to start buying muni bonds they might have to start buying corporate bonds otherwise interest rates are gonna skyrocket and that just fuels the inflationary fire and then we get a currency crisis right where the dollar is plunging prices are skyrocketing that is real pain and who knows what they're gonna do maybe they're gonna have price controls which are just gonna backfire then we're gonna have shortages we're gonna have rationing we're gonna have civil unrest I mean this is going to be ugly when it hits the fan and you know it's dangerous to do this in a backdrop where so many people are inclined to vote for Socialists because that's gonna be the type of economic environment where socialism can thrive because socialists always want to look for a scapegoat who can we blame this on and it's very easy to blame it on the rich or the businesses or the corporations or the Republicans and and I think that's what's gonna happen if this happens you know sometime over the next few years but if it doesn't happen in Trump's first term there's no way he finishes the second term without this happening no way I can't ask you this if he calls you opposites Peter Schiff heard you and the Joe Rogan podcast it was huge you were amazing what do I do what are you telling to do you know yeah I think he has people that were listening to me on the campaign drugs I used to I would say things on my podcast or tweet something and the next day I you know he'd say something pretty similar so she's like people cuz he my rhetoric up he had to appeal to certain voters that you know and so he was throwing them this type of red meat but look look I know some of the guys that are close to him you know like Larry Kudlow like Steve Moore I mean I I know Steve Moore pretty well I cuz we speak in a lot of the same things I used to be on Larry's show a lot back in the day when he used to have his his show on CNBC so I know some of these guys I don't know some that for as well but you know art Laffer right if you go look at the the debate I did with art Laffer in 2006 when he said everything was great and you know there's no recession coming and then he bet me a penny and welched on it I mean if you can't even son yeah well yeah he bet me a penny that everything was great and there was nothing to worry about and we weren't gonna have a major decline and you know and then he wouldn't even pay up you know but let me ask you this if he calls you up and says what do I do what does he do well at this point look it would have been better as I said had he come clean right away that's nice what does he do now you know now he's got to have to come back and say look I just listened to the Joe Rogan podcast I listen to Peter Schiff and you guys guys a genius financial genius money he's huge I'm out of genius I just have common sense it's it's these other guys that are just you know they're so their judgment is so clouded by the bubble that's you know when you get a lot of people that can see things the reason I saw the crisis coming you know the housing bubble it wasn't that I was so smart I just I was just thinking clearly everybody else was so delusional buddy what does he do though yeah I mean so what he's got to do is basically he's got to come clean now and tell the truth about how screwed up this country is after years of big government and after years of a central bank that has inflated bubble after bubble and say look this is what we need to do want to really make America great again I said we're gonna have to shrink government I know I said I wasn't gonna cut entitlements but we got to do that we can't afford to make these commitments we can't pay all the Social Security benefits that have been promised because if we try we're gonna destroy the dollar right because if the government tries to give everybody a Social Security check they can't do it without destroying the dollar so we've got it we've got to shrink the program we've got to means-tested program we've got to make it a lot smaller we got to end it for the future you know we can't have this you know intergenerational Ponzi scheme that you know it was a mistake to create it I mean a lot nobody wants to admit that Social Security was a mistake that Medicare was a mistake you know other things about Social Security that's been harp on and on is that one day it's not gonna work well it doesn't work now it's never but the ideas that you're paying into it now if you're a 30 year old person paying into it now there's strong odds you're not gonna get it but you're just paying into anything I mean Social Security is a Ponzi scheme it's not a legitimately funded retirement program it's not like your Social Security money is putting a real trust fund somewhere and invested and when you retire you're gonna get payments out of this trust fund no your money is going to the people that are spending it right now yeah and so when it first started Social Security started a long time ago the first woman that got a check was a more fuller if something was her name and she lived to be a hundred years old and for her Social Security was a was a windfall because she paid into it for a couple of years she collected for like 40 years and when full security started it was a 1% tax on payroll and it was only a small amount and then the employer paid 1% which of course comes from the employee that's part of the fraud right I mean the employee pays the whole thing doesn't matter if the if it's considered the employer but it didn't so self-employed people weren't even included I think we didn't include the self-employed until like the 50s okay cuz the government figured if you're smart enough to run your own business well then you're smart enough to save your own retirement but the government tried to say look some Americans are not smart enough to save which I think was a mistake because the government didn't save anything because what the government did is the minute they got the money they spent it but before they spend it they write themselves in IOU and they call it a trust fund see what happens is the government collects the Social Security money and then they they spend the money on the current employees but what they don't spend they they put into this so-called trust fund but then they borrow it right out and they write themselves an IOU called a government bond but if the government owns its own bond that's not an asset because they keep saying oh the trust funds are gonna be solvent until the year 2040 or something like that but they're not they're in solvent right now because there's nothing in them because if the government has to tap the trust fund it has to sell bond to the public which is what it would do if there was no trust when it's like if you wrote me a check for $10,000 right and I had that check that would be an asset to me if I had your check for $10,000 if you wrote yourself a check for $10,000 that's not an asset to you right because they you you're it's an asset and a liability the same time you owe yourself the money so if if I buy a government bond if I own the government bond it's an asset to me if the government owns its own bond it's not an asset at all that makes it it's a liability and asset saying so the trust funds have been a fiction from day one I mean Roosevelt sold this to the American public was a con that's why they call it social security contributions they call it you're paying premiums it's a trust they tried to make it sound like legitimate insurance but it was never a legitimate insurance because that would have actually been unconstitutional the reason that the Supreme Court said social security was constitutional was because it wasn't legitimate it was they said it was like just like any other welfare program okay we went off on the deep let's I want you to bring back though because I we're getting off track I really want you to say what would you tell them to do yeah so social security limit entitlements or eliminate them we've got to we've got to start eliminating lots of government agencies departments whether it's education energy I mean all there are all sorts of government departments that we need to abolish we need to cut back on government spending we need to economize we need to make government as lean as possible because we're broke government is like you know it's like if you're trying to run a marathon you've got a 50-pound sack you know you're not gonna run very fast the secret is to take some of that you know weight out of the pack so you think that limiting government and getting rid of all the spending is going to allow the economy to be more powerful but yes but initially you know it's like if you're gonna train somebody to come into your gym and they they come in and they're real fat and they're you know they're out of way they're overweight they have a lousy diet right and you say okay I've got a plan for you that's gonna get you into shape mmm in the short run they're not gonna like that plan they can't eat their favorite foods they're gonna be you know getting up early and training so their lifestyle it's not gonna be as enjoyable to them it's gonna be there's gonna be all this pain right so in order to do the right thing I'm not saying there's a panacea right in order to fix the economy we are going to have to go through a recession a very bad one in order to reallocate resources to where they need to be to let the free market reallocate them so when the government gets out of the way and starts shrinking a lot of people who are getting government checks are not going to get those checks a lot of people who had government jobs are not going to have jobs they're gonna have to get productive jobs in the private sector so there's gonna be some transition there we're gonna also have to get rid of a lot of regulations that make it so difficult and expensive to hire people and train people so we have to downsize government and again they said we have to let interest rates go up so that people will save so that entrepreneurs can get the capital they need to make the investments to make the tools that their workers need to be more productive but then we have to let asset prices fall we have to stop trying to create this phony wealth effect see that the central bank thinks what we need is to make the stock market go up and then people will think they're rich and go out and spend money stocks are not supposed to be the stock price appreciation is not supposed to be the source of wealth it's companies becoming more valuable because they're they're earning more and producing more that's supposed to make the price go up they're trying to put the cart before the horse they think that just making the stock market go up is gonna make us richer okay so in your opinion deregulation smaller business all these things are going to help letting people know that the garfunkel the economy's doing great thing is a ruse yeah and a lot of people who are not working have to start working they got to start doing stuff we got to get people off of you know the dole and and start and you know they're they're they're riding into wagon they got to start pulling it like everybody else and you think smaller government and less regulation is gonna enhance of course well that's what's keeping them from getting jobs in the first place I mean it's you know they make it hard for you to get a job with rules and regulations and taxes and then they reward you for not working with all sorts of subsidies and programs I mean then there's also a fear of automation automation is going to eliminate it a large amount of jobs including driving jobs yeah but you know that's all gonna make us richer I mean we've had automation you know since the Industrial Revolution but even before that there was automation I mean look at people on the farms look at how many people don't work on farms now because we have machines right but people are worried about universal basic income that this is the only solution solution automation makes us wealthier as a society because it eliminates work work is not an ends in and of itself work as a means to an end nobody wants to work they want the fruits of the labor and so to the extent that we can have a machine do the work for us that frees us up to do other things so you know if we have autonomous cars and I don't have to drive anymore you know a Trump won't have that problem being sued for overtime by his ex driver because he won't need somebody to drive but imagine if everybody had a self-driving car think of all the free time now that you have you can work while you're in your car or you can you can do all that you can watch a movie while you're in the car I mean you won't be dreading a long trip because you'll be able to be productive while you're in there in that car and you know so there's a lot of things that will happen yes will eliminate truck driver jobs but you will have safer streets and and and and trend it'll be less expensive to transport goods but that frees up that worker to do something else with their time now so the idea that universal basic income is the only solution to that isn't appealing to you because you think that they really the the real solution is not to give them free money the real solution is for them to find something else you do the the disease oh yeah the appeal of universal basic income is almost like two wrongs make a right I mean the problem is the welfare state discourages people from working do you see the highest marginal tax rate that anybody pays is going from welfare to work because not only do you pay the taxes on what you earn but you lose all the benefits because you now have a job so welfare and the welfare state creates a huge incentive for people not to work so at least the argument with Universal income is look we're not going to take away your welfare if you get a job so if you improve your lot in life if you go out there and you become productive we're not going to punish you by by taking away your welfare well the better answer is let's not punish you for working let's get rid of the income tax let's not tax labour let's get rid of the payroll tax to make it more ever for see getting rid of the income tax we this country yet we don't have it but the the but since the nineteen what nineteen thirties forties we it was introduced in 1913 but nobody really paid it until 1943 when we had the the withholding tax but we could get rid of the income tax really think that that would ever fly in this country hope so people are so addicted to that money well but people that people don't like paying the income tax but we can't get rid of the income tax unless we shrink government I mean back in nineteen hundred government was only like five percent of the GNP all levels state federal and local now it's like forty percent so we can't have no income tax and no payroll tax if we want to have all this government but if we're willing to do without the government then we don't need the taxes I mean if we don't most of this government is ineffective most of course I mean government you know it's it's always inefficient I mean it's a necessary evil but that's why you want to minimize so what would you want to keep power maintain streets things well maintenance utilities on a federal level education well the federal government should not be involved in education at all and in fact if you look at the Constitution again the word education is not mentioned the world school is not meant a all have buggies back then and right and will feathers but they had a schools they knew what they were so wet so how do you fund education and the department that the Department of Education didn't even exist until what would wait that it was it in the 60s I forget when they started it but look the federal government should be involved primarily with external matters so we should have a national defense I think it should be much smaller I think that we spend more money than we need on the military I think we could we could have a defensive military for a fraction of what we currently pay but I think the federal government should be predominantly focused on external matters to the extent that we're gonna have public education or government spending money on the schools let them do it on a state level or a local level I mean no it should not be done at the federal level you know those are issues too can be the you know managed by state tax money yes and you know if the what happens now is everybody sends all this money to the federal government and then they beg to get some of it back right they have state aid where you send money out and you try to get some of it back just don't send it to Washington in the first place I mean look at the five richest counties in America they all surround watch it's all the lobby it's where all the power is I mean we got to get rid of that I mean the federal governor's like a cancer right you know we have we know we now we were talking about we got a new nominee for the Supreme Court talking about you know about but nobody really talks about the role of the Constitution everybody's like oh were you gonna repeal Roe vs. Wade as if the most important thing is whether or not you know there's this federal you know abortion the important part of the Constitution is that it is the law that applies to the government it limits the power of government where Thomas Jefferson said that we will bind up the contig of ermine in the chains of the Constitution but at this point the government does whatever it wants the government is not abiding by the law I mean they try to pretend that we're interpreting the Constitution it's not up for interpretation the Constitution is not written in Chinese you don't have to interpret it but they think government likes to talk about interpreting the Constitution because they want to ignore it they want to do all sorts of things that are not authorized by the Constitution the Constitution only authorizes a few powers to the federal government they're enumerated there in the Constitution and if the Constitution doesn't say the government can do it it can't do it and almost everything the government does today is unconstitutional is doing something that it has no constable authority to do and that's what we need a Supreme Court forum and a lot of people don't like Congress very low opinion of Congress a lot of people don't necessarily like the president but everybody loves the judiciary right we have three branches of government the executive the legislative and the judiciary and everybody likes to judiciary but I think it's the judiciary that has sold us out the most because they have let the government get away with murder they are not enforcing the law on the government and and making the government abide by the law I mean the laws that apply to me and you aren't up for interpretation you know they mean what they say right but somehow the laws that apply the government you know well they could be interpreted which means they can be ignored right they want to say oh the cost June is a living breathing document so that it can change with the times is a way of saying it means nothing so we need to reclaim the Republic by actually if forcing the government to live by the Constitution that's one of the things Trump can do is say look we are going to restore constitutional government to this Republic we are going to make sure that government only does what its authorized to do in the Constitution and this smaller you make government the freer you make people right that's what it's all about I said earlier in the podcast about this whole idea about group privilege the more privileges that you give groups the fewer rights that you have for individuals and the more government you have the less free we are so that's actually the real definition of freedom is freedom from government and so the smaller your government the less they regulate your activity the the end the less money they take from you the more freedom you have and the more free we are the more freely we can interact with one another the more prosperous we're going to be now second step what is a person like me do to stop or to mitigate the effects of this bubble that's gonna crash well I mean is it the only thing you can do personally because politically there's really very little we can do I mean it's gonna hit the fan right I mean there's nothing we could do about that I mean because Trump's not gonna call me down to the White House and maybe we'll do this Peter yeah I love doing the Joe Rogan podcast and even though sometimes you talk shit about me that little weasel you know I was I was his biggest defender after the Access Hollywood stuff I was on podcast I was I defended him when nobody would defend him for that because I understood those comments and now and what he was doing and I called their mashach and shit yeah look he was just being a guy with other guys Makeda no he's not he was either no he was being he wasn't saying that for public consumption imagine saying something funny my friends have said horrible things to me and I've laughed yes and if or is the thing that Billy Bush got in trouble for sitting next to I know laughing he there wasn't he wasn't like taking a stand he's on a broadcast next to a guy who's a crazy person who is literally known for being a crazy person saying outrageous stuff his tagline is your fire look you know you know some of the stuff that women say about guys they're just together women chatting I mean but what what now I forgot your question about oh how do we fix yes personally me so yeah present we're not damaged we're not gonna prevent it I what I am hoping how do I put a people like you and people like me after it collapses that if we can at least come out there was an alternative version of what happened like after the financial crisis happened and I was one of the few people saying it's not it wasn't the banks it wasn't greed he was government it was the Federal Reserve it was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac they were the problem right now but the government got away with blaming capitalism and making government bigger what we need to do and what you can do with your audience which is much bigger than mine is when it hits the fan again to put the blame where it belongs on government and say government did this to us it's not an accident that we have all this government and we have all these problems and you know it's government interference in capitalism that's the problem not capitalism itself if the government stayed out it would be working beautifully so we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater we want to preserve the baby the government's the bathwater so what you can do with your you know soapbox is get people to understand the real source now what you can do now what your audience can do now to protect themselves so they don't go broke and I think that to the extent that you don't go broke you're in a better position to help the economy and help the country if you have resources right if you I said if you you know if a ship is gonna sink and I can get you off the ship onto a lifeboat then when the ship goes down you might be able to help some of the people you know out of the water if you're not drowning yourself so what you can do is protect your finances if you've got a large portfolio right what I do with my own money and what I you know advise people I manage money at your Pacific Asset Management and my Broker Dealer yours of capital is I invest in countries that you know I do I think are in relatively better shape whether it's Switzerland or Singapore you know or you know New Zealand I mean even though New Zealand just elected a leftist you know the their economy is strong enough that I think they can withstand it they've made enough progress you know so there are countries out there that are not nearly as screwed up nobody is perfect right nobody is as good as America used to be but there are a lot of countries that are much better than we are now and they have assets that you can own that are not in bubbles you can get good dividends you can protect yourself from this coming stock market crash dollar crash bond market crash so you can preserve your wealth and as the dollar goes down so if you went through the 1970s and you had your portfolio's the 1970s the stock market went way down but the dollar went down even more the dollar lost two-thirds of its value the reason oil prices went up tenfold in the 70s the reason gold went from $35 an ounce to 850 was because the dollar collapsed well the dollars gonna have a bigger collapse this time than it did last time right this time I think the dollar is gonna lose its status as the reserve currency last time it didn't lose the status it just got marked down because we went off the gold standard but it didn't get knocked out I think the next one is gonna be a knock out so you got to invest your money outside the US to preserve your wealth when everybody else is going broke and you got to own real money you got to own gold you own physical gold right which you can buy you know larger quantities of gold through shift gold you know I got you know very low prices you got to be careful out there there are a lot of companies that'll try to you know bait and switch you into collectible coins rare coins with these huge markups 20 30 40 % markups sometimes 100 % markups stay away from that you know you just want to buy bullion and you want to buy it as cheap as you can over spot the only time you'd want to pay a little bit more is to get some jewelry because you want to wear it then it's probably worth it to pay a little extra if you want to you know buy something that you can wear you know it many but so you can do that I think the stocks that are gonna go up the most if you really want to potentially make a lot of money on this crisis it'll be gold stocks gold bullion is not about getting rich it's about staying rich it's about not getting poor buying physical gold is about preserving the wealth that you have but I think that these gold mining companies when the price of gold goes up I think some of these stocks would go up 10 20 times or more so if you're if you you know you can tolerate the risk because if I'm wrong you know these stocks could go way down but if I'm right they're gonna go way up so a way that you can really profit from what's gonna happen is by having some money investing in these gold mining companies and then when we have a dollar crisis and the price of gold goes way up these stocks can go ballistic the voice of doom and the voice of reason all in one man Peter Schiff ladies and gentlemen that was awesome man hey how long been talking three hours three hours already yeah how crazy is that thank you brother always might see my pleasure thanks for
