hello freak bitches so yeah you don't have a deep freezer when you keep pot pies sultans like you said the world fought over sulphur aids is amazing to think about today people were forced to work in salt mines and died in them that was like as huge punishment for age there's a mountain in is it Germany there's a mountain of salt Wow it's been out yet there's a book called salt and it's very good when you look up the book called salt the guy who wrote it that and they reduced it just because the world's need for salt yeah they you know they dug it all down Wow like there was it there's two mountains one in South America I can't remember the other and Mexico's it and potosi and there it is all a world history I really like it man because he breaks it down and he shows you the salt mines and there's pictures of the salt mountain and and it is un-fuckin'-believable I mean we were talking earlier today we were talking earlier today about not having a smartphone what a big leap that would be to go back to a flip phone but look at the fuck who people fought over salt mm-hmm that is so alien sizes right the reason why Columbus was coming there it is the reason why a Columbus was a mountain of song came and I always talk about Clemson every bloody show that it even Magellan and when he went around the world he sent five ships they lost all of them they finally came back with one three years later right three years later crappie ship with 18 guys sailed back in well it all been underwritten by businessmen from Germany right who under wrote Magellan's voyage there was enough spice in that ship to pay for the whole trip a three year trip and losing 300 guys and five ships or whatever for ships whoa there was it because they brought back what like I don't know what they wanted on that one nutmeg or whatever it was and they had to go all the way around the world to on wood East Indies no electricity but she see that was the difference was Magellan was gonna prove he could go that way right usually they went around India and morning and so that's how valuable was and that's why angle for chakal and Spain were such giant powers the biggest spice and then when Spain took over the New World mountains of gold one in South American one a mountain of silver I mean a mountain of silver that they made the Indians and killed them all doing it dig out and all the gold and silver in Asia still in circulation is like Spanish gold the new world that's insane there was a literal mount two of them one in South America and one in Mexico that's so credible a mountain you know the real problem things with even the term social justice warrior is that they're aggressive like the thing about social justice it's like what do you what do you really want what you want peace guess where guess what the worst way to get peace is being an asshole totally being an asshole will almost a kind of anti-social presence in a lot of ways because there looks like they're about doxing people and aggressively pursuing actions against them trying to get people fired because they don't share their ideology the weirdest test I totally agree like the weirdest thing to me and I think like people have started becoming more like I've certainly become more aggressive just dealing with their shit you know what I mean I become less aggressive believe it or not about them like I don't I don't want to fight with that kind of shit at all because I think it just creates a dust cloud of confusion it's counterproductive it's totally counterproductive and I share their beliefs on a lot of things I just don't I don't share their methodology I don't share the the aggressive tactics and I just think that what they're doing is like insanely short-sighted they think that their Malcolm X or something they think that they're like trying to you know fight yet system by screaming yelling fuck capitalism and it's kind of like the people who were born like after the 60s like they were born after the party you know like and you could tell they're kind of pissed about it my friend my friend Andy Sarabia and I were talking about this and we were talking a lot about like how basically they target you like all right so there are two gay guys who like had Ted Cruz over just like chat with him right because he's like running for president you know whatever and these guys were targeted by all these like gay social justice warrior types being like just for talk just for talking to him like you're mainstreaming his anti-gay views and like how are we supposed to persuade people of our views if we can't even like talk to them to all of this creeping in there's a there's a concept of moral luck which is due to the philosopher Thomas Nagel who has done a lot of interesting work you know half of which I really agree with and some of it I don't but the concept of moral luck is that it does seem unfair that there are many situations in which people create immense harms doing stuff that you and I have gotten away with you know I mean they're not they're not worse people than we are they're like you know they you know you you and I have both driven when we shouldn't have driven you know we had one beer too many or there were there are things that we did or you're you're looking at you look at a text you know and you know you should never look at your phone when you're driving me to say I'm expecting a text and I you look and there are people who are looking at that text right now and just you know killing some child in the crosswalk right and their lives are gonna be ruined and you know they're gonna go to prison and they're exactly like you and me right so there's there's a there's an aspect of luck here but that the luck actually propagates backward into the kind of brain you have the kind of upbringing you had the kind of parents you had the kind of the fact that you got hit in the head as hard as you did or didn't and no one has made themselves so I'm a little bit more I'm less judgmental about some of these things given my view of freewill but I'm not it's not that I'm not interested in making the interventions that would make a difference you know whatever we could have done to have gotten him to behave differently we should have done whatever we should need to do now to him to make society better and to make him better and to get restitution for the woman what we should do all that and so this does entail locking up certain dangerous people and it doesn't tale you know we have to keep keep ourselves safe from people who are going to reliably act badly and I don't know where he falls on that spectrum but it's just it's not the the difference between the feeling you get when you hear oh it was brain damage I sort of had that feeling about everything you know if we if he gets a brain scan if he goes to trial now he gets a brain scan we and we find that his brain is just massively damaged in all the right areas that would have eroded his impulse control right that would seem to let him off the hook a little bit he would he would look like someone who was unlucky more than he would look like a bad person right and I sort of see bad people as unlucky - I mean I recognize that there are certain people who are quite classically bad people they're psychopaths who you just not only can you not rely on them you you can rely on them to be bad actors you know so you have to you have to be in a posture of self-defense with respect to these people but I do view them as unlucky on some fundamental level it's the idea that you're gonna arrive at some point or that you're gonna land in this destination that is called success or happiness and when you get to our age you realize that that's just that's an illusion right it just continues and you start to think about you know what your life means what do you stand for and what is your legacy you know like we're approaching 50 it's like what it you know if I died today what was you know what did I what did I leave in my wake well even that look the bottom line is whatever you leave it's not gonna matter because it's gonna matter to some people that you know and they're gonna leave - everyone's gonna leave but are you enjoying this are you enjoying the moment everyone's working towards this like ultimate like the retirement years the golden years like you're fucking almost dead when those years come like those little you see those people like holding hands and walking along they barely can walk their knees hurt they're all fucked up like that's not what you work for you don't work towards this ultimate point where you don't do anything anymore and that's ridiculous that what you should work towards is doing what you enjoy doing right now enjoying your life right now and join your friends right now enjoying whatever hobbies you like to pursue whatever you know love affairs and friendships and huh all that stuff is what life is it's life is the moment being in the moment and we somehow have turned it into this this weird like journey to a very specific point specific points of high school graduation college graduation but good job marriage children we have all these like milestones that are supposed to impart happiness in this race and they they're not real there's social constructs and we've we've created these social constructs and we've fed into them and pass them down from generation to generation without anybody stepping back and going who set this up mm-hmm who set up who set up graduate school who said who set up who set up common core who are these people like oh why is why is it this way with this we're just biological organisms trying to have as much happiness and good feeling while we're here as we can
