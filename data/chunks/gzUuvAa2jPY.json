one what's up dude how are ya good how are you first of all the game looks fucking tell everybody who you are what you do my name is Hugo Martin and I'm the game director on doom eternal the dragon let me tell you something folks we Hugo just played some of Doom eternal he showed us the game and show and ran through the some of the first level holy fuck god damn it's so next level it's so next level graphics it's cooks everything about it like the weapons the demons the the way you kill them it's the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life it's awesome it's so addictive but it's like it seems like it's okay because it's violence against demons yeah totally and and we we we work hard on that like you never there's no cursing that I have three kids there's no cursing there's no sex I do want it to be something that my nine-year-old could play don't you think it's kind of crazy that you could rip people's heads off you could shove their arm down their throat you could cut them in half that's fine just don't use any of those naughty words kids yes because I was joking with some of the other day it's like when I'm with my kids like he's not gonna go to somebody and like glory kill them but when someone says glory kill is because it sounds too much like glory hole we're gonna get really confused so in the game when you damage a demon enough they will glow with like a shader on them and that means you can go in to do a melee finisher basically which is like a melee attack and you'll get help from it and there there's really really cool and melee we should explain is like with your own hands yes rip them apart or cut them in half with a sword or a chainsaw yes and no crazy like when my kids see that they're not going to do that but when they hear someone use the f-word they're like oh I could use that in everyday life and and that sucks so very interesting rationalization I'm not buying it but the game is awesome and it would be cool if you had an r-rated mode that you had to like enter in your security numbers social security number or something and unlock it it shows you're over 21 or over 18 I feel like over 18 yeah and then you just hire your brother dude get in here I'll give you five bucks I'm like this bitch it's cartoonish violence though you could see it it's very much like a cartoon yeah and again you're killing monsters yes walking dead spiked them in the head you can't do that to a person on TV but you could do it to his llama and their demons from hell you're doing God's work you have to yes that's right and we should explain that doom was one of the very first 3d games it was Castle Wolfenstein right that was like the first one with its software we've had Carmack in before he's no longer with you software but who is is will it still there no he's not there god damn it no what the fuck bro how is it it software Marty try name you got a bunch of new people right away listen whoever is running at they're doing an amazing job because that game looks sick and I'm scared I'm scared I'm gonna get sucked into it it's awesome the game first of all the gameplay and then just the beginning sequence the in-game like whole sequence looks like like a CGI movie it doesn't look like gameplay like remember when we used to play games and he used to have that opening scene there was like a video and then it would go to the game game was crude this game is exactly like the opening scene which is so crazy no pre-rendered that everything those are the in-game assets that's how good they are the team is like insane the guys are true artists craftsmen you know like they just go crazy on the details and when you zoom in with the camera for the cinematics they completely hold up the rigging like it's like a feature film it's nuts are you guys there it is right now let's play the let's play the the old jailer this is the old trailer yeah this trailers good just play it for people and if you just listening you got to see this on YouTube maybe like I'm a grown up but up times of this shit I have an IRA and a 401k and I have kids me too bitch me too simple your people will not bring you peace when we make the burden carry worse let me how we have survived made other sacrifice in the name of our you [Music] now if you're just listening this is just annoying music and noise but if you're watching it looks fucking sick watch this oh and then it is mayhem right Ned angels those angels - oh Jesus oh shit so he's like the boss demon yeah [Music] god damn this looks good doom eternal it looks I anticipate a massive waste of time for people 320 so that's when it comes out so yeah what's that 9 days from now yes that guy if you're Bruce Lee that is your Chuck Norris yeah and you guys are gonna admit the whole scene actually when you meet him which is a little clip from that it's really inspired by that scene is it Enter the Dragon or return of the Dragon when he fights Chuck Norris I think it's enter dragon yes and I think you know like when they square off in the Coliseum yes you know he comes out and he says some badass shit you like look at me yeah that is great way of the Dragon is it way of the Dragon or for the Star Wars fans we say like it's like you're obi-wan and that's your Darth Maul okay I like the first I don't know Star Wars has become too dignified it doesn't really sync up with that that fight is badass though between obi-wan and Darth Maul yes oh man it's awesome yeah that's pretty bad yeah that's before I went to shit the fights and the prequels were amazing yeah they were really good yes I've watched the one against obi-wan and Anakin like a million times like I love that one it's so good like when they in the lava and shit and I just go off on each other and like it's a mate George described it in an interview that it would be like you would be seeing Jedi at their peak that that really in the first three Star Wars films they were not at their peak and then in the prequels you would see them in their prime you know like Hickson in his prime so like it that's what's so cool about that fight they're just going off on each other it's amazing yeah well what you guys have done is create something that's gonna ruin people's lives I hope you're really excited about massive waste of time I mean we were talking before the show about video games and the addictive quality of video games I have a real problem I just can't play him that much yes I can dip my toe in every now and then and then I shake my head and I gotta go running or something cuz otherwise it'll get the grip on me yes they're too fun like there's no movie that you're gonna watch it gives you the kind of engagement that your videogame does because you're like in the movie yes and it looks like a fucking movie now and you see what the glory kills like you are your own fight choreographer you're sick of breaking the arm and shoving it in his head then swing around from behind and cut them in half you know like do anything you are it's awesome now as far as multiplayer because I'm not really into playing games the game game I'm into multiplayer so you I promise if you play the single-player what is unique about our single-player is that it will give you the same buzz that a multiplayer will give you because your opponents this time are the AI and that opening level that's white belts you're messing with like easy dudes the later on it will continue to level up and as you saw like that guy that comes out with the axe like again he is he is as tough as you are so you will get the same feeling from the single player that you do from a multiplayer that's not really possible it's because when I like this duels I like like like in quake champions I like playing duels you know that's what's fun for me like one-on-one like me and Jaime would get barbecued and we'd come here and we play for hours just one-on-one you run around the map and collect your rocket launchers and your ammo and armor and shit and just fuck each other up we have a multiplayer called battle mode that is fucking awesome like it's really really good and then is it like quake multiplayer like no no it's it's different it's very unique the last multiplayer we made was not super well-received it was a really competent good multiplayer but it was that I was just doomed 2016's multiplayer experience but it really wasn't innovative enough like fans wanted to see us like do something new so we basically took the single-player experience that combat loop that you'll master and then we we give you a way to do it with your friends it's a 2v1 so to be you know two of you guys versus one guy gets to be the Slayer with all the guns and it's really really cool and then there's invasion so like you'll play the single-player campaign and then someone can become a demon like Jamie could become a demon and then invade you while you're playing you won't know where he is and it'll just come out and try to fuck with you mmm like it's really cool but is there any one-on-one multiplayer invasions kind of one-on-one but battle mode the closest we come to the one-on-one is 2v1 oh okay that's weird why'd you side two versus one instead of one versus one it's just unique you know it's it's the balance there no one demon can stand against the Slayer you know the doom guy is all-powerful he's got all these you know he's right here he's got all the guns and the mods and he's got eight his bicep exposed it seems like a vulnerability okay it's like that kind of calm pretty much if someone comes along cuts his fucking arm off it seems like that's a good spot to hit his arms are like trees so like that they're made of jelly doughnuts they're very they are so big that in one scene he raises like a sword and the bicep just like is it's absurdly huge but but um that's cute but it's still made out of meat that's true that's true the the I forgot what I was saying but yes you think you can compete battle mode is really good you really like it yeah but why don't you have a one-on-one because we just it didn't it just didn't work out that way I think do you anticipate anything like that in the future like you never know like certainly we'll see but but we're really really proud of this like I think what you want to do is you you got to innovate if if you want to make something that's really going to engage people like that like the whole point is to like give them something to master that they've never seen before because if you're just asking me to master a new version of a thing that I already mastered sure a lot of people would appreciate that but you're not really going to capture like a large audience so we really created something that was completely unique and so we're excited that now is there gonna be a deathmatch mode where like all of us can get in a room and fuck each other up I know we we have quick champions for that I know but we already played quick champions I won't play that I'm gonna use those weapons well with that guy like this is this the multiplayer this is the multiplayer Jesus Christ looks crazy it is nuts that dude you the it's its kind of bait based on a couple of core pillars of like we needed something that had a lot of drama we wanted something that I had a lot of pacing like the variations and pacing in the match and something with deep strategy so and and was primarily innovative like unlike anything any anything anybody had played before and was from like it's a multiplayer for people who love doom eternal so I'll play the doom eternal single-player you'll you'll like this right it looks so incredible it's it's fucking awesome the graphics are so off the charts I just wanna play this right now do I know I'm looking at this video that Jamie's plan showing the video of this guy playing and it's just yeah it's incredible so he's he's the Slayer you're seeing through the Slayer right now and those two demons that he's shooting the numbers coming out of them those are the other guys now I don't think most people understand the incredible amount of work that's involved in creating one of these things yes when did you guys start on this about four years ago so it's been four years of steady work to make something and in nine days we're gonna like give it to the world Lisa yes I'm like I'm shake it off yeah oh my god I'm so nervous I just cancelled III yes everyone's scared like goddamn Corona fire I know my wife says I'm gonna be in quarantine at the house for two weeks one cousin come here I think it needs to be two weeks I think it's four days you start showing sniffling already I'm just like Oh semantics they say that it's four days and you start exhibiting symptoms so okay I coughed at the airport and people looked at me like it was I felt almost wanted to apologize I was just clearing my throat and I didn't cover my mouth and everybody was like yeah it was yeah meanwhile The Comedy Store was packed last night dude we went to PAX East last week with the fans hunt like lines of fans and the beginning everybody was touching elbows that lasted like 20 minutes and we were just high five and it was the store last night a couple guys were trying to give you knuckles and get the fuck out of here well they say I didn't watch that show you it with that guy that you had but 50 and up or something or like it's the real problem as people with respiratory issues people who are overweight and and people who are old those are those are the real problems unhealthy people that's the real issue that's gonna be the real issue although Sam Harris did know a guy who's a skier who is 50 who was apparently very healthy and very fit and he was now on a ventilator and he was in Italy I don't know the specifics you know sometimes look I've got the flu before and I'm sure you have as well and sometimes what happens is you're worn down from travel you're worn down maybe from drinking you warm down from too much exercise and then it gets you and then if you're not like and this is just the common cold and apparently the common cold is a type of corona virus I don't know Google that make sure that's true but I'm I'm pretty I was reading up on corona viruses last night I was like what like SARS is a type of Kuro a virus is this just here now forever like this is a part of the world like coronavirus question well Michael osterholm who wrote this book deadliest enemy and who was on on Tuesday on the podcast Tuesday he opened up a lot of people's eyes as to like what what the issue is and what what you can do to prevent it but those wet markets that they have in China are just bananas man with the fucking bats on the tables and Corona Vice our large family viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS severe or SARS a novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans so zoonotic or zoonotic meaning they're transmitted between animals and people so what what's happening is these fucking wet markets he was detailing how they have chickens that are in one cage and civets that are above the chickens and the civets are shitting on the chickens and chickens are eating the civet shit and that's like goodness he's like it's just a perfect environment to create a disease it's gonna jump from one species to the next that is scary yeah and he's like and many of them have jumped to humans I mean all the major whether it's avian flu that's from birds swine flu obviously from pigs they jump from farm animals or from these wet markets to people yeah and they're not gonna stop those wet markets so it's like I mean that's how people buy their food which is just crazy have you ever seen the videos and pictures of what they look like over there no that seems scary though you think your game is scary let's see what a bat looks like when it's laid on table apparently bats are like a common thing to eat and bro when you see what a bat looks like with its mouth open it looks like it belongs in your game that that would be get the good reference we were looking at pictures of them yesterday and they have a table laid out and then even not just on the raw concrete bats laid out with their mouths open they look cartoonish they don't even look real and they have no wings yeah Jamie's oh my god and over there look how big these bats holy shit dude that looks like a dog they do look like dogs or dogs like Christ those are dogs oh those are bad so those are bad so look at the teeth on the bats yeah that's really that look at how they're all they all have their mouths wide open like they're trying to bite you so they die trying to kill you and they're gonna they're gonna cook those yes now that is how this disease got started look at that guy's and he's working well go back to him again let me trim he's triple stack in the behavior stacks of bats smoking cigarettes like they're eating bats that's crazy it's just nuts man but this is what happens we'll see Lily's chickens stacked on top of each other when you have a billion people and look at that guys sleeping on top of that jet that should be in our game actually yeah you're hungry eat a bat you could glory kill that thing and get health that would be good apparently SARS came from bats as well so don't eat bats kids I won't but they have to because they're starving I mean that's one of the things that China's doing what they have to do there's too many people not enough food and a lot of what they're eating is just we wouldn't imagine eating it are you are you not traveling because of this not changing shit yeah that's my wife asked me a lot like she she was really concerned about me coming here and I was like dude we go we got a cèlle game so I just got back from Vegas and I was a little nervous walls over there but I did everything normal I went to work out I you know I ate went to the fights which is you know 20,000 people at the t-mobile Arena yeah all stuffed into this one area and everybody was acting normal everybody's high five and a hug and then fighters I mean Jesus Christ want talking about people exposed yeah yeah you know they're sweating and they're half-naked Tyson Fury is trying to lick that dudes blood I mean I don't think he's great for those before the big outbreak yeah I am I'm worried about old people I'm worried about my parents for sure I'm sure about I'm worried about people who are overweight you know I have friends that are not healthy that maybe she'd lose some weight and I'm worried about them I'm worried about people with respiratory problems you know a good friend of mine has a daughter a cystic fibrosis know that's Ryan he cancelled his tour shout out to every last he canceled to his tour because of that I mean but he's got you know a real concern yeah his donors are pretty serious one condition that is really scared horrible yeah and so look you know he's got no choice he has to stay home and and play it safe and I think a lot of people gonna do that you know um it's gonna be interesting to see how the government handles it because one of things about love or hate Trump he's willing to do some shit that a lot of people would think would be unpopular like close down traffic yeah close down flights coming in from other other countries that are infected that have higher rates of infection you know I mean I wonder what they're gonna do and something I think something really radical has to be done to try to start this slowdown this this fucking illness but I don't know what they can do seems like are we waiting for it to I gotta watch your show with this guy are we waiting for it to go away like I read a quote that like when the weather changes it'll it'll stop or something that's horseshit yeah Michael osterholm set it straight on that that's nonsense he's like it's not gonna have any effect on it what happens is it just runs through the population and people develop immune systems that can handle it you develop an immunity once you catch it and for many people it's just gonna be like a bad cold for many people it's gonna be like you're coughing and you're and you just you just try to get better stay home drink a lot of fluids be healthy do your best and eat healthy and then get out you're gonna have an immunity to it and that's what's gonna happen on the other end I saw one guy he had it and it was fairly mild and then the quarantine and he got over it he was getting over it and getting better and then they quarantined him with a bunch of people that also had it and he got it even worse I'm interesting cuz I was like I wonder how he got it again and I guess probably his immunity wasn't fully developed yeah and then it just overwhelmed his immune system because there was you know he's basically quarantine with a bunch of other people that were really really sick but he got through it and he was talking about it and all these poor people that are stuck on boats oh my god it's crazy this is gonna kill the cruise ship industry yeah guarantee you that we just went on vacation and I have to say traveling and the like we went to this vacation spot but there's nobody there it's actually it's kind of nice oh yeah right now what the whole beach do so we had everything to ourselves it was amazing yeah I wonder you know I wonder how this is gonna play out I really do we go like know you're even at our hotel eating at the buffets and stuff but like to point I'm just like fuck it what are we gonna do they're closing down buffets it's one of the things they're doing in Vegas they're closing down buffets Hills buffets are huge I haven't been to Vegas too many times but the one time I was there I had a pretty crazy buffet yeah I mean all-you-can-eat just fucking pick out yeah some of those buff but that's also how they do it on a lot of cruise ships they have buffets I only went on one cruise ship and by the end I wanted to throw up like oh my god look because the first day you're like the food is amazing it's so buttery gross and it's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead yes it's like they're feeding you the fattiest grossest but tasty food yeah you know oh man we're gonna get fat that's your move some people just fuck it let's go all in but I just recently lost 20 pounds all right yeah I was due well my I was 226 and that was fun especially I mentioned earlier like to introduce ooh but the fun just because you could pin people down easier yeah more weight to throw around I guess yeah it's easier though I did like there's definitely been benefits to losing weight that I actually really like but my heart my blood pressure and my cholesterol was really high so what did you do well I went to a nutrient well really I gain that weight just from eating like an idiot I had really bad eating habits and I had no idea like I didn't know you weren't supposed to eat a shit ton of pasta before you go to bed like yeah and I'm 43 hours how do you not know that I make video games I do glory kills man I woke up this morning with acid reflux not really but like well felt gross because I ate two tens of sardines last night before I went to bed yeah so I'm not smart either I went to a nutritionist and she just kind of coached me on like basic stuff and it was remarkable how much weight I lost just by not being you know stupid you gotta just go to bed hungry yes you're way better off going to bed hungry than eating a big meal before you go to bed but I come home from the comedy store and it's late and no one's home I just I've just become an idiot I just start eating - that's exactly I'll go right to sleep I would crunch on the game and like be at the office late come home and told my wife would make something amazing but I miss dinner and it's like I want to fucking eat it looks awesome yeah but that made me super fat and and like it wasn't very but I was I was working out a lot so it was actually been doing jiu-jitsu so it it was fun being of a larger size but I'm not supposed to be that big like it wasn't good that's my my numbers are all much better now that's great and you just the nutritionist what did she change I basically I kept a food diary and she read it and just laughed she's like she's like you eat like you're 13 like I work on things for thirteen year olds that's it pretty much yeah and I just really when I was a kid it was like finish your food clean up your plate wipe up every last bit watching my dad he's Argentinean piles of fucking steak you know like just I thought that's how people ate and I'm supposed to eat yeah but not at like 11 o'clock at night I guess yeah I just don't think you're supposed to eat and then go to sleep it's just not I didn't do a vegan thing I asked her that I was like should I not eat she's like no I it's kind of the basic stuff I eat the little bit of all these food groups and I just eat in moderation also when I moved to Texas the Asian food scene there is amazing and though really it's fucking amazing if Dallas like what kind of Asian food Vietnamese food is outrageous the Taiwanese booth beef noodle beef noodle soup is fucking which is like Chinese ramen that's interesting that it's in Dallas yeah I didn't know that either Dallas is culturally super diverse jealous is a fucking great city it's awesome it is a great city I was just there two weeks ago the food is so good and I love it there if it's bad for you they have perfected it that's for sure what my first week there I went to the Texas Fair and I had fried pumpkin pie with a scoop of ice cream and hot chocolate and it was like the best fucking thing I've ever had in my life but it's so bad for you and so just fried pumpkin pie it was it was good they don't play games no the whole fair is just fried stuff al fairs are ridiculous yeah it's just going to Affairs ridiculous just you're gonna get fat just walking through the gates I did you know did definitely put and then honestly like the work was so intense with walk by my own doing I was so into making doom and still am but that but I had to balance it out like I think I was reaching a milestone of like learning how to eat better and sleep right like I was I was just acting like I was still in college and how many hours a day are you guys working because when I was friends with the ed guys back this was like quake three before it came out like way back then I was friends with those guys and when I was doing gigs in Dallas I'd go to its studios they showed me all the stuff they told me yeah it was pretty awesome sure I'm embarrassed that I'm coming here and I'm not good at quake so like I was like shit he's gonna totally give a garbage no it's okay but you play with a controller we should tell people you play with an Xbox controller which is quite embarrassing it is well I'm pretty good with it though but how do you not use a mouse and keyboard I do sometimes but that's probably why you're not good at quick well I quake Jamie and I were bonding over this when quake came out I was in art school and everybody was using Apple products so right I like literally no one I knew had a PC like one dude and a dorm had PC and he'd go there and he'd turn on doom and you're like holy shit this is crazy but like I mean I'm I was like an apple guy hardcore so I just I just missed it you know like that boat but I play now and I'm okay i play i like playing pub gee i mean you have to certain game you have to play you know mouse and keyboard and like pub G and stuff like that but see me Arthur our computers updated is everything's updated we were ready to go you work in the game industry I do a little I don't say I'm not gonna play no I I'm saying to all these kids out there that are not good don't even start oh no I will I will totally play I'm just not we didn't make quake champions I was made by another team but they did do an awesome job we everything that comes out of it is always gonna have a certain level of quality so it's a different team at it that made great champions yes it was outsourced managed by Tim Willits and then outsourced to I believe Sabre and so will it's with them now where as well will it's I believe is with them but I'm gonna probably shout out to Tim how are you buddy yes I've seen that guy forever and and he left a couple months ago I think but he's retired no I was on the beach he's with now okay yeah like doing something awesome I don't know I don't know can't Ellis I don't even know to be honest I just head down making didn't get it so how many days a week you guys working when you when you're in crunch time are you working six seven days a week on this thing um it's not really crunch it's funny I prepared for this interview I watch all your video game interviews and I know that crunch comes up a lot but like the the the it's this is gonna sound hokey it's I it's like a lifestyle like I I live and breathe this you know like no one makes me stay at the office and even when I come home I see my kids I do my thing and then I just do research like it sounds ridiculous not not unlike my diet but like my research is that of a thirteen year old like I play fucking video games and read comic books and just engrossed myself in pop culture because essentially what we do is make pop culture content for that's pop culture content you know I didn't make sense but the so you just have to like you know ingest a ton of it which means that it's 24/7 I mean I get I get up really early I try to do the exercise thing I couldn't really fit in go and do any kind of training or anything in the afternoons because it was just family and stuff so I try to do that in the mornings and then I come home and put the kids school and then I have like about two hours where the house is empty and I'll just play games you know so you're training in real early though I do it's horrible but I do the 6 a.m. one which is fucking holy shit dude yeah shove some in your mouth no not anything I made that mistake I drank a protein shake once before training that was a fucking disaster holy shit so I don't need anything I drink water I didn't even - hell I was again I didn't you knew nothing of nutrition so I was like it's 5:30 and I got to be healthy I'm gonna drink this and like you can't train knee on belly I'm like dude this is we're gonna have a serious fucking problem in two seconds yeah yeah it's the same thing with yoga hot yoga I've tried to do it after breakfast you literally can't do it I usually I I'm tired too like so I'm I'm pretty much just water you know and and it's only an hour so I could kind of get through it I don't know if this be CAS are helping or not but I sometimes put that in my water just because I CAS branched-chain amino acids is that good yes yes for sure yeah good before you trained and after you trained yeah and depending upon who you ask you know there's a different protocol just for a little extra juice you know I don't know like to help because I get a lot of muscle strains so strains yeah like in my calves and stuff like in with cramps what were you saying I guess late taking any electrolytes I'm they're going away because I'm hydrating that was another thing the nutritionist said was that I was probably dehydrated way more than I realized so I'm drinking water like and it's actually working like I actually feel like I'm getting less of those and I'm also hungry less like one of her things was that probably some of what my cravings are for food is that I'm actually thirsty so I'm now I like chug a big glass of water and the cravings do cut those 11 o'clock cravings kind of subside a little bit but yes I try to do it in the morning so it's just super super rough you know over the last couple of weeks last week in particular but drinking a shitload of water just to shit like last time last night at the Comedy Store I must have drank seven bottles of water which is great until I got home I got up to pee three times no the night last night I'm like fuck yeah I'd wake up it's like 3:00 in the morning right I can't hold it in no shit I just kept doing it man three times I got up to pee so you would agree that just I mean obviously right just drinking drinks a shit ton of water but I believe in electrolytes I think electrolytes are very important and I think you should find a good company that you know sells electrolyte so you can pour into your water and we'll be even have one that you would Rick I use liquid IV it's a sponsor of the podcast just for full disclosure but I actually enjoy it and even if it wasn't a sponsor I would absolutely use it it tastes good you pour it in there it's got like a salt a little bit of sugar and a lot of electrolytes and it's just fucking really good for you that's awesome it's supposed to rehydrate you twice as fast as water itself oh wow twice as well as water itself that's that's awesome yeah so I pour one of those into into a bottle I like to do that before our work you know it's also something that gives you like a you know a little bit of calories not much but do you do anything during like is that just water just so the the electrolyte stuff for the BCA is before or after but not during I don't do it I mean maybe I'm wrong about that I that I died I know the most I ever do is if I'm training really hard like if I'm doing something really crazy then I'll then I'll drink something with electrolytes while I'm working out like a Gatorade or a Powerade or something like that just to try to replenish yeah about glucose levels is that good to drink Gatorade while you're doing exercise sure okay because I feel like it is like I'm pretty exhausted I have to be honest they have little bottles of Gatorade I do get energy yeah yeah yeah I mean there's I mean there's a reason why athletes you drink it that's true I don't know they're always drinking the it's not that's the logos on the cup but I'm like is that like some kind of special power issue with things like Gatorade or Powerade or any of those you know sports drinks air quotes is if you're not doing sports you shouldn't be drinking I mean yeah it's like if you're just laying around drinking Gatorade there's a fuckload of sugar in that shit but if you're running hills or if you're rocking with like a 50-pound backpack on and your goddamn exhausted well if you drink one of those things it'll give you some energy and it'll replenish some electrolytes and give your body some glucose there's some benefits to that stuff it's just when to use it where and why you use it is what's important but there's definitely benefits to taking those sports drinks your facility out there is fucking awesome it's pretty dope you the bat's thing that those clubs Club bells yeah that's pretty crazy yeah I've never done any kettle bells right I need to though because I don't know that my I could show you some of the stuff it's pretty easy if you have like a lightweight kettle bell you could learn it me really should start with a light weight once you don't hurt you so who's the guy who works for you he's got the beard I met him first Taylor Taylor I think he has a black t-shirt on Jeff yeah Jeff I shook his hand and I was like man my goodness I think you've been tossing around like he's just corn-fed seriously is like a big old fellow dude yeah they're big fellows the the great thing about kettle bells or club bells those clubs is that you're using your whole body you know that's the thing about those things it actually enhances your athletic ability it enhances your ability sports particularly jiu-jitsu like things like Turkish getup so ever do Turkish get-ups I was joking my friend yesterday so no I've seen them I think if you put the word Turkish in front of anything it usually means it's pretty gnarly so like sauna yeah Turkish bath Turkish prison like Midnight Express wasn't that a Turkish prison yes that is the magnifier for everything yeah true but I've never done one but that it did look pretty serious there legit Turkish get-ups one of my favorite exercises not romantic it doesn't give you big pecs but man for jujitsu it's a real real game-changer and that's what the one like like you have one leg out one leg well you start off on your back you start off laying on your back you you press the kettlebell up and then you sit up and then once you sit up you get one leg under you and then you go up and then you go all the way up stand straight up and then drop all the way back down you should watch a video ideally should find a coach and have someone correct all your form so that you have it down and then you could do it on your own but the beautiful thing about that is like you could have a kettlebell and you sit in your office and just for five minutes just do Turkish get ups for five minutes and do it a couple times a day and it'll change your body but change your core strength and your shoulder strength and your shoulder stability because you got this thing overhead at the end of it and then you're dropping it back down and you you know resting your body back down and starting all over again it's very difficult exercise I'm I think working with someone is what I need to do because at 43 I'm finding that like like I injure myself because I'm not exercising correctly I clearly I'm not doing anything correctly but the like I'll try to do some extra stuff outside of training to you know work on things and it's always something and then when you get when I get something it fucks everything up for months like I did something in my bicep and I couldn't do half the shit I needed to do you know in the morning a training like it was a pain in the ass so actually I'm not really doing anything anymore I do just some basic simple shit but like simple shit it's fun like just bodyweight squats chin ups push ups stuff like that that's it well that sounds real good for you the thing is like you're doing something right because you got a about all right yes so you congratulations on that thank you also you know you're doing jiu-jitsu that's a fucking hard thing to do man it's like I gotta do something because when I wasn't doing it I got the the kids and the work because the you know it is a lifestyle but it's also a lifestyle that involves sitting on your ass staring at a TV screen yeah what kind of chairs do you guys sit in the cube dude from getting back pains I don't really sit that much like from the ending desk no I'm just walking the whole fucking time like just walk into this thing with that thing and then we just have pretty basic desk but a lot of people do standing desks for sure and and I like those a lot to the I don't have one but because again I don't really sit anywhere specific I have an office but I'm never in it but you're always moving around talking to different people about this and that which is good because I when I sit for too long my lower back I got like a bulge and in the in the lower back area I don't know and if I said too much it kind of it kind of bugs me but everyone who does jujitsu has something going on with her back yeah I'm a little worried about that cuz I found the thing that you get the kids and before it I was like you know roughhousing with them and your fucking breathing heavy and it's just like shit and so I'm like what can I do I'm like I don't fucking like basketball I think running sucks like I don't want to just work out like you know so I did this and it became a fun engaging way to get healthy but it's a game you know you're playing a game it's like it cleans up everything like I can't eat shitty food cuz I'm gonna feel like shit on that so like it had this ripple effect in my life that was fucking amazing yeah and and and a really healthy pursuit but the back thing is that guaranteed that like but this things you can do to mitigate it and I'll show you some of the things we have here a machine called the reverse hyper unfortunately this just came up in a podcast Esther as well a reverse hyper machine which is a great machine for strengthening your lower back and then there's one of my sponsors is teeter they make those inversion tables and they have this thing called the decks and it's like you you bend over it's a de xx so it is just 1x and you bend over at the waist and it's just like decompresses your spine and relaxes everything to just sell to you afterwards social yeah yeah I want to I want to keep doing it for health reasons ya know I found something that is a good add add something to my life in a healthy way yeah I love it it's it's awesome but it does beat you up are you our fans or buts about it I've seen you wearing your ghee and some pictures are you wearing your gegen and training more with your gear did you always train with your ghee or like well I trained with the ghee and no I have a black belt on both I know but like I'd seem I could be completely wrong it seemed like you were doing a lot of noogie noogie yeah but lately it seems like you're wearing the ghee again but I could be completely wrong no I I think both are good I think there's nothing wrong with the gate think what the gate teaches you is defensive posture is you defensive techniques better because you can't pull out of everything so you have to do everything with proper technique you can't just because when everything gets slippery and snowy you just pull out of stuff sure but you can't do that if someone has a hold your sleeves and they'll get their fists fully wrapped in they're like you're not getting now and then you're just gonna get deeper in you gotta use technique you gotta use the proper defense do you have a preference or just it's all good I think both are good I think both are good look if you live in a place where people are wearing winter coats learning how to fight with Aggie is great yeah yeah you know you grab a coat I mean a coat is like a weapon that a person is wearing on them you used their own code against I saw a great podcast clip with you and Guy Ritchie and you were staring at his tie and you were like salivating cuz yes I sell people but if you have a tie you should have like a Velcro thing in the back just take a nice Chi put it on tighten it up and then snip the back and then so in some velcro so it seals up like this so that if you could just someone Yanks on your neck just pull that tire yes that's the paranoid button your collar itself right yeah good shirt collar you could choke someone with that you know you didn't as ii kiyul joke with that I like the community leaves you could use your own sleeves you can mean collar choking someone one of those jokes with a good like stiff dress shirt College hook is tell me where the dress shirt on that would be pretty totally good yeah with a book with a jacket like a leather coat the person's a dead man like if you had a street fight with a judo player and you're wearing a leather jacket good luck yeah you're gonna get thrown in your head our head instructor does a lot of judo stuff and his fucking grip is oh my oh my goodness they have crazy core strength - those guys have crazy upper body and core strength because they're so used to just yeah everything is throwing you in but you like when they're demoing and they grab your collar and you're just like what the fine like I'll never get this off hands legs yeah a lot of them what they do is they take keys or towels and they throw it over a chin-up bar and they do chin-ups by just holding onto the towel or holding onto the game there's a wiry like every muscle is like taut with those guys you know like it's crazy even if they look skinny like you could you taught you like they grab ahold of you're like holy shit well you look at their hands and you see their knuckles oh my god named yeah every knuckle like sticks out that far let's you see it a lot of with jiu-jitsu guys that's the truth like the ears totally telltale sign don't fuck with that guy but if the knuckles are fucked up you should just do whatever that person says like have you seen megaton Diaz his hands dude holy shit they're like I mean see if you find an image of megaton Diaz is that arthritis is that what this so is he like so he's in he's in pain well I want I don't know I mean you'd have to ask him but goddamn oh dude that guy will rip your neck right off oh my god well them Steven Seagal movies he could do it for real like house I was just gonna say that my favorite movies like that scene where he does that guy that bad guy he's fucking crazy like he's just like used to movies so good in all the worst ways daddy look at the megaton Diaz his hands yeah his knuckles so that's just one image of him there's a bunch of images of him with his knuckles yes his hands are just gnarly and I mean there's a lot a lot of jiu-jitsu guys like that you know what is so I've been said a million times they are also the community around it is that's another part that I really fell in love with cuz it's it's like dad Jitsu where I go like we all want to get in shape and there's younger guys who really athletic and old we have a one woman who's 72 because she's her son is there and her son's a fucking beast and he fucking did this to me but the the it's just awesome like we're all trying to get healthy and we're learning shit and we're helping each other like it's yeah it's fucking great dude I love it yeah it's a it's an awesome way to exercise I'm wondering if one day they're going to be able to figure out some sort of a virtual reality learning game that's one things that I talked with Carmack about I was like I see cuz Carmack has done some martial arts himself and I was like I see he's actually very good at judo and yeah - and he's really apparently he choked somebody out at the office once I think the person asked for it but there's some story of like they wanted to see if John could do it and he was like ok ok I'll choke you out now yeah yeah I spoke I worked I overlapped with him by like a month and he said one thing to me and was pretty cool he told me not to put greats in the game because they don't look good and I was like yes sir that will never happen greats it's something to do I'm like great so you would run on something with greats when you look at them at an angle they like doing all the tech guys right now are like Jesus you go like it's very specific but yeah he just told me not to do that and and I was like I will not that's all he told you yes he was super nice you know I didn't know I know it's a you know like I had no reason I don't wanna bother look at that's me and him that is awesome yeah he is that dude's legit the founders of it with John Romero that guy like I mean I really feel like we're standing on the shoulders of geniuses when we make this game like the a lot of what makes doom eternal good is is what they did in their game like the one the rocket launcher is such a well-balanced weapon in the original doom game and we took a lot of inspiration from that and that fucking characters are so well designed the kooky and the Cacodemons and the sounds they make the game still holds up to this day it does like straight fucking legit geniuses even with the clunky old-school graphics it's still very immersive it's it's actually adds to the charm because when you look at it now it just looks like a fucked up Saturday morning cartoon seriously it's like something they would make on Adult Swim you know yeah well quake 1 became a big hit even after quake 2 and quick 3 a lot of guys want back to quake 1 yeah because it was like a faster game and it was like and a lot of times guys actually cut all the textures out anyway yeah so they could see everything yeah which is really weird I just last year played through quake 1 single-player and quake 2 single-player campaign with mouse and keyboard yes you would be very proud but I didn't play the multiplayer but the I actually am going to just become awesome at quake champions I really I'm down very often part of my research like when I play is to I have to achieve unwanted like I have to reach mastery in a game to understand the fun part of the research that you have to do when you're designing a game when you play other games to remain so that we understand like how other games are working successfully or not is to play them long enough to achieve mastery so you really you feel that addiction you feel that engagement level and you like ok I know how they did this I know I know what I'm feeling right now did you bring in you take like professional gamers and bring them in a consultation say how do you how do you feel about this absolutely watch and certainly we talked to them but it's it's dangerous because if you absolutely but it's kind of like would you want Michael Jordan designing the next sports game like it's kind of like he can tell you he it's sort of like the the guy who builds the race car might not be the best guy to drive it like hold on here's what's wrong without analogy you're talking about Michael Jordan in a game I'm talking about game players now if you bring in game players to tell you about a game is a good idea bring in Michael Jordan and tell you how to play a video game based on basketball probably not the best idea no definitely not wait we do we talk to them but absolutely but point making was just that like you could fall into a little bit of a trap it's absolutely part of the process it's the smart thing to do again like if you're building a race car you go talk to race car drivers and say like how does it feel what do you think like well this is loose that feels odd ok we'll go fix it you know so how does a game like June maternal start does it start with it starts with a meeting you say hey we are thinking about doing this what do you think and then how does he get the green light how does a game like that get going we have from the very beginning yes we have a green light I've been there for seven eight years so what happens we have a green light process where we put together an overall idea Marty and myself you know work very closely at Marty is the studio director and executive producer shout out tomorrow he's awesome he's he's the boss he is the shit know what you guys say like someone comes up with a car so what are we gonna do for our next weekend we talk like it's you know making games is fuckin awesome like it's it is this the fucking coolest like I can't believe that this is my job blanket yes that's what everyone wants there's you stick a dynamite and a crowbar wouldn't get rid of me and fucking it software like I can't get enough of making doom games but you hit the Jack the jackpot it's like what people want to do for a living is do something where you go to work you I can't believe this is my job oh so that's why when I go to play and to do the work I'm like I'm not fucking working right seriously you know like that's awesome so that which can get a little out of hand I guess sometimes but the the in terms of like balance and like doing other things and like get up and exercise or do something um but yeah me and Marty we talked quite a bit and and it's it's it's commercial art you know it's it's a business and art and and creativity coming together and we have the schedule and and we have to work out the budgets and stuff like that but ultimately we begin with like a conversation about like what it is we want to do we're talking all the time he and I about stuff and then we talked to other you know people on the team but essentially it begins with the executive producer and the director of the project getting together and talking then we work very closely with our publisher and you start to formulate a plan and and we had a plan and a good one for doom eternal and it's cool because we just recently had a meeting with our publisher where we were able to bring up some of the things that we talked about three years ago and they are working now which is a good sign like you are pivoting a lot during development for sure like okay that didn't work let's try something else but and what what do you base it on it didn't feel fun to do it didn't look cool you yeah we call it just steering into things yeah but that feels good steer into that that feels good steer into that you're always steering into the fun like you let the game tell you what it wants once there's enough of it on Table two you know to judge so what are the first processes like when you say okay you got the green light it's time to make a game what's the first things that get done is it design do you sort of design what the players look like is it the coding it's like everything I mean they begin the engine all the different processes unique engine are you using an existing engine and this is very good questions for Marty the executive producer but yes they they begin making the engine based on what they want to do next and the goals there and that has to like the this is the engine of the race car and we're discussing the kind of race car we want to make so we should explain to people what we're talking about we're talking about a 3d engine this yes often times what happens is like say another videogame can license your 3d engine and use it with different graphics to make other games and that's a common thing yes the 3d engine is what we're talking about which is every game has a different feel it's like some people like when during the quake days some people were really into unreal right the remember that game epic games and they were like this game has a different engine I love the way this engine feels yes you know because they all have different sort of car maxixe made some good fucking engines yeah he's a smart guy well he recognized the balance of speed too like like real world physics versus this sort of cartoonish shit like what's what's the fun balance it seems like quake three was like a really fun balance whereas quake 2 was a little slower quake 1 was way crazier way faster but was didn't look as cool what is your favorite champions that's offense is the best hit Tim it's the best that's awesome it's the best it's everything week yeah it's everything in quake but ramped up I don't like all that stupid shit like when lizard spit on you and it's poison your run through it like that yeah weak but but the the weapons are really well balanced and the maps are amazing and the graphics are off the charts the graphics are so cool like while you're playing it like what did the the it's crazy and the artists are so amazing I mean the work they do is so inspiring that's the coolest thing like you you love what you do you the medium that you work in I'd feel so fortunate because and I speak for all of us at the team we fucking love the type of game we make I mean you just saw it dude it's so it's fucking absurd it's like an r-rated psycho cartoon but it's not it's not mean-spirited that's what I really liked about it like it's it's it's kind of it's cool it's like fun it's fun fun that was actually our main focus again you're killing demons like that's it fine it's just like Walking Dead you're allowed to kill the zombies the whole feel bad the whole purpose is to make something we talked about quite a bit like the emotional response of the consumer like how you feel when you play something and we want you to smile like certain games they want you to be scared which is good survival horror games someone I'm on my heels I'm like oh my god you know what's around the corner in doom we want you on your toes smiling like just fucking barreling forward like what am I gonna murder next like where is it you know and but it's it's uh it's it's frivolous and it's fun and it's junk food but that as we say there is quite a bit of nutritional content in there like it's it's a smart game is there any pushback against these kind of games like when you guys produce a game like this or create a game like this is there any where people are like this is too violent this is awful this is not really because it's not against humans like we it and it's not there's no agenda like it's not I guess yeah we we don't really deal with that because you're murdering cartoonish looking fucking demons you know and and dude believe me like we take it full advantage of that like like I said yes we straight-up Stephens the goal these motherfuckers right and ahead like it's awesome and and I use a Steven Seagal anymore and definitely don't use it as a verb I it's way more violent than any Seagal movie but that is true but but like I always got a kick out of his hyperextending of the limo yes yeah in that one in particular that glory killed - we were like there's a there's a there's one posing animation where you hold out his armor he's like because that's like always do what I'm holding out hope for is some sort of oculus version of doom or quake or something like that where you have like a unidirectional treadmill and you're locked into it you've seen those things right omnidirectional that was called yeah omnidirectional treadmill there's a doom VFR which is pretty cool like they made it and it did really well actually and really yeah yeah it was it but yum VFR have you heard of it Jerry I have it but I haven't not played it cuz it came in my little cycle of like kidding where I couldn't stand up for a long period of time Oh your back issue yeah yeah yeah Jamie broke his butt weak kind of Renuka group we removed those things from the office the thing that he hurt himself on oh the hoverboards oh my goodness yeah so one minute people are laughing check this out next minute some dudes ankle is just straight fucking and hanging off his leg so this is the VR version of doom yes it is pretty goddamn good and so how are you moving around you're teleporting just like yeah but how are you walking I think that's it I think just teleport you standstill like I didn't I didn't work on this so I don't oh you know Jamie like how are you going through over there there's a little line that shoots out that's like where you're teleporting - yeah oh so you steep this work I can't move I mean that's how they had it a couple years old now so they've figured out some new things oh well the graphics look dope but if you're just teleporting to each spot and then standing still and punching people that's ridiculous yeah that's how you do it huh and then you go forward well I'm not doing it justice - because I didn't work on this so I can really tell you how the movement actually it's obvious it's pretty it's pretty obviously that's what you do you're teleporting with that green bolt have you ever um you know what sandboxes if you're fucked with that 9 box VR no it's really cool there's um there's a company in Woodland Hills there's a studio in Woodland Hills and there's another one there's a couple of them around the LA area but anyway you put a haptic feedback vest on you put a helmet VR everything plastic guns and then you go and fight things and there's one where you go and shoot this one's great this one is called welding mansion was it called so they have one of these in Schenck zombies yeah I want to it's the shit yeah that's really fun rats come out you got a gun rats down so you are in this room and like this is see they keep cutting back for what what is actually happening what the people see sure when you're there live and you see it it's fucking killer it's really cool that is fun and they're getting better at these things they have like sort of that characters go that's the boss that comes and gets you Deadwood mansion that's that one I love that one that's awesome there's a star track game there's um there's quite a few of them I think they have four or five different little experiences that you can do that's all really fun well I have a Star Wars what perhaps the voids different yeah I've done the Star Wars one that's at Disneyland at Disneyland downtown Disneyland before you get to the park you could go and do the void ride which is actually better than any of the rides in Downtown Disney or in Disneyland itself is that the one with the avatar flying the necron or whatever the hell those things are called in Avatar world when you're flying on the thing that is in Disney World okay not Disneyland Disneyland is la la for land but Disney World in Orlando has this thing called flights of passage which is fuckin amazing it's the greatest they're called absolutely the greatest ride eeeek runs I think yeah you ride when those dragons in Avatar that's incredible I would love to do a VR thing where you're like one of the colonial Marines from aliens to like running through it that'd be fucking awesome when they're coming out the goddamn walls yeah you could do something like that Hudson that's my that's my hope for the future is that games are like that and you're actually gonna be able to exercise doing that because I think that if you had a game where you're in a warehouse and you're actually running for your life again you know and demons are chasing you and shooting down things like your heart rate would be jacked you could do that for an hour and get a sick workout in and have an amazing good time that would be awesome you can get in great shape running from demons you would I wouldn't have to get up so early in the fucking morning think about this game if you could play this game but you could play this game in a warehouse where you know you have all of the boxes and all those stairs they're all real stairs in real boxes yeah yeah you're running around this pre-designed map and you're actually engaging with these VR demons with a haptic feedback so fucking glory killing them back their parts they really into this glory killing but the really problem with is calling it glory killing is it sounds too much like glory hole does insect right Jamie they have a new ride that got announced today for I guess out here Disneyland a new Marvel Comics Avengers campus is gonna be opening up in the summer they have a disc or a spider-man ride where it sounds like you put on a 3d a headset I think just goggles in somehow they're tracking your hands so during the ride you shoot things for points oh and then there's a spiderweb and there's a leader vet's office inside the ride for like weekly daily and monthly stuff the the the level of sophistication going on with the games whether your mouse and keyboard or controller though it would be hard to achieve in VR I think VR offers like a very specific unique and fucking amazing experience and I would I would just like separate the two like you know when when when when we're making VR games we're definitely trying to do something else which is cool and of itself and in and of itself but there's like not only just in our game but in a lot of games like there's just resource management there's like high level skill meta shit happening I mean you know you play fucking quake so like you know that that's hard to reproduce in VR in certain ways at least at this time but but I think that's the thing like they want it happens a lot in games where people want to take how you feel or how a movie engages you and apply it to a game and I think it's like let it game be its own it let it game be a game let a movie be a movie let VR or be its own fucking experience like that looks fucking awesome like but yeah if we just yeah so so there's still oh yeah I would love to kill you know Dean I we have the VR game I should just play it but what I what I'm saying is like if someone made a doom where will you guys take a 14 thousand square-foot warehouse just outfit it specifically for doom you got a line around the block of psychopath waiting a platter thank you an hour I mean seriously especially somewhere like Texas where there's a bunch of warehouses like you know yes some warehouse district where you can get three or four of them and set them up for different maps in the game that'd be fucking awesome damn man I mean they're real close to being able to do something like that where it would be really accurate to where you could have like a laser sight on your rifle and you yeah yeah see things through the goggles and I'd be fucking bad-ass although it is it's it's it's lame I was not lame you know Carmack can do anything he wants but he's doing AI now like he's not doing VR anymore I heard I heard he was just consulting with oculus but now he's pursuing AI will this be honest he's too smart he's from another planet how many lawn muskie get together and share notes yes yes they're both super wizards yes totally he's I mean I'm sure he feels challenged by AI yeah and you know he likes a challenge he's a very interesting guy to talk to - I really enjoyed talking to him yeah he is awesome and you really think about what he's accomplished in the world of video games I mean he's the Mac Daddy amazing yes he's the the guy who started it all really the if you enjoy 3d games that's the guy that's why working at it software and he totally is the guy and along with the rest of him - like Romero and those guys like the that group fuck that should I know him do you know John Romero I've met him a couple times you know daikatana game he took a lot of shit for that game that was a fun game yeah yeah it took way too long and there was a lot of bugs in it and all that good stuff but dude I played it when it came out I was like this game is fuckin badass it and yeah I mean that guy is - all of them they're there they're like the Beatles you know it was like daikatana was like the physics of quake 1 but with the graphics of that era see if you find a video of daikatana in-game it was a fun and I was like this might catch on but people were down on it before it ever came out there's so much shit talk about it because it took so long and cost so much money and they had these giant offices in Dallas with this huge penthouse yeah they're spending so much money I personally think they some of the best work that they yeah it's this is a this image right here is dark yeah this is not the best video in terms of like what you're able to see in-game stuff yeah there was a lot of hype and certainly this is another other video because that's like so dark can't see anything is that it yeah I was lying yeah on the internet I think the best work that they did was when they were all together yeah like keeping the band together mm-hmm that honestly it's making games is definitely a team sport and and you got to have everybody working together really well if you want to pull it off but you also have to have like Division one pro athletes oh yeah Pro you know I mean rockstar vision ones on a good I did like your if you're gonna make it game you need everybody to be a the same level of dedication same level of hardwork there's a rock stars yeah one of the siz it this is why is he have a sword I never saw this usually it's like what is this I don't think this is the game dude I could tell no no this is not it might be I know it's a mod I mean maybe it's a mod I never saw it like that what I saw was a lot of cool rocket launch like this is one rocket launcher that would shoot and it would come out like DNA strands shara shara the rocket with like two Rockets would twist at the same time they go back and forth yeah this is what the game looked like it's just just really dark for some for whatever reason huh maybe like some levels you get a sword I never saw it I never saw this either this looks weird I think this is the game though yeah I think so too I've been fucking forever since I've played it I know there Romero is what we're making which is a huge compliment what is he up to now I don't know he lives in Ireland I think what yeah I think so and and but when I met him he was a super nice guy I met Adrian Carmack at a bar in Texas which was fucking awesome and and it was funny because he started telling me like well if you guys are gonna make it you know we were in production on doom eternal he's like if you guys gonna make a doom game here's what we thought we made doom and everything he listed we were all like that's what we think you know like he's like we just did stuff that made us laugh and made a smile I'm like that's what we say you know like it was cool he was super nice so it to me it's software is kind of like Disney like they invented a genre and we are part of the new generation there and we have a legacy to live up to like yeah it's the it's a really special place to work a tremendous amount of I don't want to say pressure but we're all motivated yeah well it's it's you know you're working at the highest spot that's like yeah if you go if you think it's like if it's rap you're at Death Row Records you know I mean you're like at the highest spot and the coolest thing is like the type of games that they have always made just they they are able to get away with things and a lot of mainstream Triple A games struggle with just because of how violent it is I mean they are like again it's it's Evil Dead 3 where the transformers budget like who the fuck gets to make that like you know like we those the shit you see we spent a shitload of time making that stuff whereas like in a lot of situations I've been in it's like yeah we want to cut this dude an - like not a lot of money for that dude so do it pretty fast you know like we're like there are artists like craftsman you know working on the entrails like it looks pretty good and we're and literally the notes you're like I need like the intestine to kind of like flap a little when you get the thing off you know like and it's how do you know if you've crossed the line is there is there ever been a time when you have a scene and people like dial that back we we actually tonally you know you say how do you start the project it's it's kind of like there's a fair amount of brainstorming and the strengths of any creative team is at least for a game is how you brainstorm with each other it's the synergy in that room has to be good you got to be selfless you got to show up you got to be willing to support other ideas other people's ideas just much your own we have fucking amazing group in there but tonally we try to establish that to like look guys we're not making saw we're not making hostel it's not malicious it's not meant to make you cringe and we actually cut together a little video of like what we thought violence wise was inappropriate and tonally felt off and then we made another video of what felt right and that was Evil Dead 2 with like it's not a slow trickle of blood out of a sliced open wrist it is some dudes head came off and Hawaiian Punch just starts fucking shooting out of his head you know like that's really what it is like it's cartoonish you know and violence it goes so far that you because the thing is you do this so much so often I mean you were murdering demons per minute like I don't know what it is but it's fucking crazy if it was off-putting and realistic and kind of like ooh you'd be so turned off it'd be sick like you didn't make you sick after a while but so kind of weird we're looking at it I don't think you're right what you're doing is like super gory and disgusting you think somehow or another that will make you less sick well it was more realistic and less bloody oh for sure I mean Chad's totally we could we could twist that where every one of those is mean-spirited and really off-putting for sure I mean I don't want you to sell me some PR stuff to sort of defend your game against people that are anti violence because that's what it sounds like what you're doing is super bloody and disgusting and violent to say that somehow no that that is less off-putting then less gory is pretty it's a ridiculous argument I don't want you using it here or anywhere else well it's Joseph it is not I this is no PR this is this is legit sounds like you've been coached no no no like this this is my message to the team I mean sincerely like okay you're coaching them well because they make the content so like think of this alright I good I like this because this is the fucking truth so you look at saw you look at torture porn horror movies there they're cutting achilles tendons with a fucking exacto knife and the dude is screaming in pain and he's a person like this is gnarly shit he doesn't look like he's having a good time like verses on Evil Dead 2 when you lop off the head of that one grandma creature that comes up out of the basement and fucking buckets of blood start coming out of her head right people cartoonish so like it's it's critical Z row PR spin that is we have to believe that because look your design story is going to be exposed to the to the consumer in two fuckin seconds like they can see through your bullshit in five seconds if they're like dude you're trying to sell know like so we have to have an honest good design story that we can stand behind that is true and that that is the truth I mean we basically looked at like cartoons and like make it over-the-top the animation so every time here's a perfect example every time you murder a Cacodemons which is those flying balls so you pull out their eyeball what does it call the caca a caki demon a caca what's the CAC CAC CAC oh oh CAC kids you have kids right I do have three kids Kaakha Kaakha demon it's a poopoo demon sure the so every time you pull out his eyeball you literally hear like oh I can't do it but yeah like a like a funny cartoony sound and that is absolutely intentional to take the edge off what you're doing because if it was more gruesome and they're like it's the Exorcist versus evil dead - those are totally two completely different movies you know House house was a movie that came out in the 80s that was inspired by Evil Dead that's like a fucking comedy it made it is a comedy and and it's a horror comedy versus The Exorcist which is fucking amazing fucking amazing but really very serious you know and that's that's how we're able to do what we do okay stop selling it I'm selling the violence thing I get it I see what you're saying what is this a caca demon that's a caki demon it's caca that's poo poo looks like poop they give like if you had a demon shit that's what it would look like like oh no tearing you up on the way out what is that an original one that is the original caki demon from the original doom yes oh cool so it's an updated version of that but you know just more graphically intense yes so when you do something like this and you release this game obviously there'll be patches and some upgrades and some different things that you do but how long how long do you work on this game before you guys move on to the next thing we're already moving on I don't want to say the next thing that is APR answer because I'm not allowed to say that but the you have ideas ideas certainly and and DLC the DLC is guaranteed like what is that it's basically like a small episode of doom that we would sell called DLC downloadable content I below it that sounds think that anyone would know what we were talking about ID I'm so used to Jamie but Jamie's a super nerd I'm so used to the gaming convention to speak but yes it is down like it's like an episode like we made the movie and now we're gonna release like an HBO series of it okay so you'll have this game and then you'll have a bunch of other ones that are based off the same engine same characters different journeys different things that'll come up well all centered around the doom guy yeah yeah but yeah basically the adventures of doom guy and how long do you do that for before you move on to the next game it's hard to say you know certainly we're always kind of dual tracking things and talking and you know always you know because you never know when the cool idea is gonna come along and you're kind of jotting down notes I always have kind of my notepad out there's thinking about stuff like as I'm I mean you never know when it's gonna something cool you know you're playing something or you see something or watch something so and then we keep those conversations going on the side and see how it goes so is there any do you guys like keep your eye open for like where VR is headed and things like that and go well not yet we're not ready for that yet but one day down the road we'll have something like that kind of a different again like we're like it's sort of like with cars I went to school for automotive design and right yeah I would wind up in videogames uh just because I love videogames you know the the training in automotive design have you ever been Art Center no it's dude you should fucking go it's fucking where is it it's in Pasadena and it's okay it's like the Harvard of design schools like it's a me and they do cars there and products but yeah the car is that they haven't display you know the big clay models about that big they're fucking amazing and and really really amazed place you know the design process that you learned there you can apply to kind of anything why would you say anything but a lot of things certainly a video game for sure because it's just kind of it's actually the questions you're asking which is like how do you start from nothing to something you know like that involves large groups of people and you kind of learn that there I forgot your original question but oh yeah no it's like you know so I use a lot of car analogies at the office quite a bit and and it's kind of like we make a race car and and if VR is something else that's like an SUV that's like just another kind of car so like we kind of perfected how to make race cars and it's been doing it since the 90s so like doom eternal is just another race card and and affluence and what you're saying I'm just thinking that as augmented reality and then virtual reality become more and more accessible to consumers I'm wondering you know like where video games are headed I'm wondering if you if you think that's where they're heading there's always going to be a place for them on an actual video game I think an actual computer rather I think they'll always be a place for them in the actual video game I think the the that's where my focus is other people like Carmack are looking to see where well not anymore but where video games were going to go next but I am fully focused on where they are now and how to make what they are now better well professing man you guys did a fucking amazing job it looks really cool thank you really fun and I'm sure people gonna waste massive chunks of their life and get a tremendous amount of entertainment out of it I I hope so anything else to tell us we can go play now oh really yeah that quake champions yeah anything else I don't I don't think so I don't know so it's out oh it's a March March 20th yes doom eternal coming out March 20th so not long folks get your sweaty little hands ready and we'll be available for PC Xbox everywhere yeah time all the platforms everything you know I absolutely yeah all right
