the girag an experience you're so good at breaking shit down dude you said that there was not a hint of bias there you were being completely honest about it that's I really value that in the way you talk and that's why I was really happy when I watched that Kemal bail show M kamau Bell had come that I totally biased command alia which was the MMO w kamau Bell you and Lindy West Lindy West who's a feminist blogger for Jezebel which is a feminist website and what I loved about it man was first of all you never got upset you you were rational and logical and you had you were talking about it in a very measured way and you're being really friendly while you were discussing this and you know and Hearst in her defense it's a very tricky subject to breach for a woman and she was saying a lot of shit like comedy clubs were filled with rooms filled with Angry Men and you didn't you didn't even flinch you didn't he didn't go after her you know she had like these digs about like you know you're allowed to just joke about it but I'm allowed to tell you're a dick yeah I didn't get personally cuz I don't think Zach she hadn't the blog wasn't about me was about a guy who yeah any guy making a dick joke or rich or certain rape jokes that put and this is the tricky part of Lindy West he's a lot of people would say she's against she's for censorship but she really wasn't she was about she didn't like the jokes that she thought minimalized the victim in a rape right now it's hard to logically say well yeah minimalizing the victim of rape is a good thing but she you know what what people forget they went after Sam Morelle a lot of jokes were just missing well he's a comedian in New York who had done some like domestic violence jokes or whatever but in a misdirection joke you you go for them the most obvious or opposite thing so some people didn't expect yeah sometimes it's like I did one joke and this didn't come up in that show but like I was talking about seeing it a girl now I don't know if she had a good time or was raped in a porta potti I'm not gonna go through the whole joke before but those with it was at a concert an outdoor concert so the two most opposite things I could think of mm-hmm if I said I didn't know she had a good time or not a very good time who gives a shit you exaggerate in a porta potti I'm painting a picture yeah if I said I didn't know she was beaten in a porta potti or raped in a porta potti nobody would have laughed because they're too close so the fact I mean I'll explain this to the audience not yes right the fact that you take two things into such polar opposites sometimes the polar opposite you land on for the joke is a horrible thing that minimalize --is the victim and every Catholic priest joke is somehow minimalizing the victim part comedy does that and I don't believe that it has to just be speaking truth to power I think that's part of it but I think that as long as your intention is genuinely to be funny and not to humiliate a person for real mm-hmm I think it's allowable and it has to be because it gets to be too subjective after that well it's an art form and if you don't like that art form I completely and totally understand you don't have to produce it to participate in the shells you don't have to go but when you're you're being like hyper critical about and trying to get people to stop doing it you're going to make it so that that art form is not available like the really fucked up thing that you don't mean art form is not available just like rap music what is going on in rap music are they're really running around killing people and selling cocaine every day no most of what they're doing is talking shit about something right it's no different than the movie Scarface nobody really died in that movie okay you're painting a picture it's a gross horrific picture but some people like that they like to watch Scarface then like to listen to rap music they want to hear a dirty comics a horrendous inappropriate things that are fucked up one of my favorites is Otto Otto and George he would say some of the most fucked up ridiculous over-the-top shit but the reason why I did is because that's like what shocks a shit out of you and makes you laugh when you least expect it and it was like well-crafted and on top of that he made me laugh harder than anybody's ever made me laugh in a club we were doing in a pizzeria in Pennsylvania and he said something it was it was barbarism and it made me it was because the the imagery was such it was a it was it was such poetry that he flew off the top with and it was awful and I've ever told you the story no and it was it won't like it won't hold like if I say it now it's not gonna be the greatest joke but the beauty of it we were in a pizzeria it was an awful gig and um it was it was a it was like we're like real pizzeria bench seats it's stunk right and there was a bar next to it I'm watching Otto's just up there fucking struggling and hating it and in the middle of this dirty act the Booker's girlfriend walks down the aisle with his her seven-year-old son which was so inappropriate and everybody looked and it just derails this show and Otto I just said you know because everyone looked right at this so the fucking the puppet had rested right on and said oh is it I make isn't that cute I'd like to grab him by the ankles and smash his skull onto a fucking sink and it was a Caligula reference to the end of Caligula and it made me the the the speed at which he put those words together and the the the violence attached to that uh and the imagery of that it may I've never left hide or anything anybody's ever said in a comedy club because I knew what had just happened is it was just I immediately saw the end of Caligula where they give they grab the ankles and they smashed the fucking head into the steps and I'm like the genius to pull that out in this moment and word it that quickly it just it was it was it was beauty it was beauty but it was a horrible fit and nobody laughed of course they didn't this is a filling pizzeria nobody understood how funny that was he had just said that I hadn't seen Caligula I might not have laughed as hard but the fact that I immediately saw what he did with it I was I wanted to hug him for that I'm like you brilliant brilliant guy he's a brilliant fuck me he's a very funny guy and his style of comedy much like dices style Kali is ridiculous over-the-top things they don't really mean like dice has some bit about about how a woman gets pregnant and it's it's it's one of the most hilarious ridiculous bits because it goes into like this medical or how you can make a gay kid like how you know like suck it's so fucking ridiculous idiocy it's completed but it's hilarious and for people to say that that's a homophobic joke that's like you know he doesn't believe he doesn't mean a word he's saying do you understand this is this is like an art piece that you're watching this is a ridiculous over-the-top art piece and for you to say that it's not if you to say that I shouldn't be enjoying it well then we have to go with a fine-tooth comb over virtually all the pop culture every song we have to find out what the true meaning behind movies are what what's the implication on society because it can't just be humor it's this it's a dumb way of looking at it because you know it's a joke if it's a stand-up comedy show you know it's a fucking joke at least in that sense there's no excuse with a rap news with a rap song like no it's not a joke maybe he's being serious with a movie maybe they're trying to promote that lifestyle maybe that's real it's a stand-up comedy show the only reason why people are laughing is because it's a joke well people do know that but it's unfunny people attempting to influence people trying to influence what you said it's like the same mentality I don't mean individually like let's just say the same mentality that would target dice or that would say um you should get in trouble for a gay joke are the exact same people who would stand up and defend Mapplethorpe they're the same people who would defend piss Christ and say that the National Endowment of the Arts should have paid for piss Christ because who tell people what that is it's it's it's it's the NEA and I think paid for it was an artist who pissed into a jar he put a crucifix in it and he called it piss Christ now I don't think that that's particularly clever but it doesn't offend me on any level and here's more inconsistencies the same clever yeah I mean it was you know look I wouldn't mind if I wish I would have thought of that to me I just I couldn't fill a jar with my piss it's been like you know took weeks yeah I really was a big jar - it's very impressive yeah very it's a - kegger but the fact that he did they support that and they're the same people who would have attacked Giuliani mm-hmm for going after the fucking Brooklyn Museum of Art because a guy pin African artist painted the Virgin Mary and um so it they would call him a fascist for that um you're you're you're you don't understand art if you attack Mapplethorpe but you know understand art if you attack piss Christ however if you attack a common well that comic is insensitive and he's saying something racial racially insensitive or gender intensive and you should be too it's inconsistency you can't fucking respective you can't acknowledge any of it with respect it's people have to you have to leave room for art and that's ridiculous when you're talking about dick jokes or any kind of jokes but you have to leave room for art because that's what it is it's just an art and if you don't appreciate that style of art it's no different than you deciding to go to a Metallica show and not liking the lyrics right if you don't like it you don't have to like it there's Jody Mitchell's playing down the block go see that go go you know go see Sheryl Crow or go see Dave Matthews there's a lot of variety out there but at the end of the day it's something that someone creates and when Otto says you know I'd like to pick him up by his fucking ankles and slam his head into a sink and you're laughing that means he delivered art to the person who likes that art and I feel the same way when I when I see look what I saw dykes or when I saw you in Austin same feeling I enjoy ridiculous over-the-top humor it's my one of my favorite things to watch so when someone comes along it says you can't do jokes about violence against children because it's fucked up yes you can yes you can you can even if your kid had been killed it's you well unfortunately for you this one hit home yeah and it's not fun to you but everybody else who doesn't have a kid that was killed by slamming their head into a sink it becomes fun for them and it sucks but you can't just stop the art form because it's going to hit you and that's one of the things that came up in that conversation with Lindy Lindy Lindy West Lindy West yeah one of the things that came up the conversation with her was that she was talking about rape jokes and meanwhile she had a photo on her Twitter of Jeff Goldblum right who is in death wish with a wig ooh yeah in enacted a really horrific rape scene a barbaric rape scene you know scary terrifying no joke there was no jokes involved there was no he-he-ha-ha no double entendres and yet an actor doing that in that piece of art somehow or another is exonerated from the impact and this idea that you should know that one third of the audience I think is those the current thing they're they're enjoying banding about when people talk about I shouldn't say they're enjoying I want to dismiss it but the people who really believe this believe that one third of all women have been either sexually assaulted or raped and there's people that dispute that and there's it's a lot of it is based on a certain study from I believe it was 1987 and there was a lot of questions that are very controversial in that study like they'd say if you ever had sex with someone then regretted it or we did we are coerced into having sex and things along those lines they called all of those rate and so then I think but I think their findings was like one in five but now people are saying it's one in three whatever the fuck it is yeah the idea that you have to like not you have to censor yourself because of the you can choose to you can choose to if that's your style comedy you can choose to but for you to get mad at someone who doesn't choose to it's like ooh your this is a slippery slope and I know people don't think it's a slippery slope because you think it's all just about protecting people's feelings especially victims feelings and I see your point but at the end of the day we are going to have to go over this whole motherfucker with a fine-tooth comb if you want to do that you can't just single out stand-up comedy because it's coming from one person and not a giant movie where a woman gets assaulted and beaten and raped or whatever I mean all of it has to be looked at you have to look at the whole thing so yeah and I also feel like I give myself the same credit I give the audience like I really do and it's like we all say we want to just just treat people like you want to be treated well I treat the audience with the same level of intellectual respect that I want and I went and saw Joan Rivers and it's not exist the edgiest set I've ever seen a comic do and I mean this a few years ago at the cutting room in New York she's doing 911 jokes a I mean fucking brutal and I I was when I was I literally wanted to cry at the end of it because I'm like that is what we should be doing it is taking everything horrible that we experienced and I mean horrible and making a roomful of people laugh about it and when we walked out of there my feelings about 9/11 had not changed my feelings about rape my feelings about AIDS not one thing she said made me value those real experiences less not one thing she said made me devalue anything made me lose respect for the horror of man nothing changed for me other than I was able to temporarily laugh at something that I knew was awful hmm so why wouldn't I give my audience the same credit for being able to come to the conclusion I came to watching Joan Rivers well it to take their argument it would be because you haven't been raped you haven't been murdered you didn't lose loved ones in 9/11 and that what you should be doing by omitting rape jokes is you should be avoiding triggers you give PTSD triggers are avoiding people freaking out and thinking about the rape while they're at a comedy show just try and have a good time and so their their opinion is set up entirely to protect the victims of these crimes it's not like a person like you has a certain sensibility about 9/11 Joan Rivers defies that sensibility but does in a humorous way and you walk away with the same opinions that you had going in because that's not really what you're dealing with you do what you're dealing with is a victimization crime a crime where someone's been dehumanized and them being in the audience watching you talk about that you should be more sensitive in that so that's there are point is that yeah very good argument in a lot of ways my point back to them would be I do understand that but like I said whenever I talk about Tiger Woods text messages I reveal my own I talk about my own I also talk about things that have injured me where I talk about my own suicide attempts my own sexual proclivity like so I include will you do you use certain things horrible and things that have affected me and things that haven't I don't it's not like I exclude things and if you breakdown humor like that like you said fine toothcomb mm-hmm every single joke or 90% of the jokes you do unless you're talking about balloons or bouncing a ball have hurt somebody well he's talking about duh oh my god was I drunk driving oh my gun yes children being killed by drunk driving is not if we get that literal with humor then almost all jokes comics tell are going to be up for a careful examination I think Matt and Trey said it's either all okay or none of it's okay I won't make pedophile jokes when Kevin fucking bacon can't play him in the woodsman all I won't do gun jokes when fucking Hollywood can't tell me how bad guns are and then they make a movie called two guns with it which I have no objection to but then don't fucking preach to me about guns motherfuckers yeah exactly it's like just you know I don't care what you do as an artist leave me alone as an artist I don't tell you what to do don't tell me what to do that's all it is no it's your point is is dead-on and it's a it's it's a very important point the the idea of censorship I can understand that people want someone in the audience to be impacted negatively without you making light of something that's a horrific crime if they've suffered from personally but that doesn't mean you should stop okay and it doesn't mean that you're a dick either what it means is you're saying something that hits them personally and you know then maybe you shouldn't go see Jim Norton and that sounds like a fucked up thing to say but really that's that's that the reality of the situation this is your what you're doing is a style of art people who don't want to be scared don't go see the conjuring or the Evil Dead because they don't I don't like horror movies how come nobody's trying to stop horror movies people that don't like them don't go to see them right so it the same way she'd be with certain types of humor and what's when you break it down what's the worst that can happen if you see something like am I going to talk about something that they don't show on Law & Order constantly Jesus the whole thing is a fucking rape murder fest everything people like is a rape or a murder or some kind of voyeurism and I will acknowledge and honor people's our abhorrence to violence when there's an accident in the southbound lane and the traffic in my lane doesn't slow down people slow down to look because they want to see it they want to fucking see it on some level but they don't admit they want to see it and I hate their lack of admission well there's a weird exclusion thing too if you're you're discussing rape and you're not discussing murder you know if you have anything that involves rape in a tweet or something you're a piece of shit or you know you should have had a trigger warning in there like this is the attitude that a lot of people are taking all that stuff but why doesn't have why doesn't anybody have the same issues about murders you can talk about a murder you can talk of like Nova's very rare that people get upset at murder jokes or murder movies or anything murder but there was a bomb a thing recently where Obama said that uh he could have been Trayvon Martin and I said you know well she could have been it could have been a little kid they got killed by drones right no nobody right that's a I mean it's not really a joke per se but it's it's kind of like blocking him you know it's it's mocking the the idiocy of this but it's also bringing up it's bringing up people getting hit with missiles their bodies exploding why is that image any less disturbing than the image of rape are they are they equally disturbing are they both off the menu or why are we only going with rape off the menu how come there's like zero push to take murder off the menu their argument be the curtain again this is what they would say is because rape murder victims or people murder is that you're not taught to be silent about murder okay you're taught to be silent about rape and there's a lot of rape victims who are too scared to report the crime no one is scared to report a murder list a mob thing right on they're saying the perception of the crime is different and there's such a shame with it where there's not a shame with murder there's not a shame with these other things hmm and again I heard what she said and I listened to it and I did get it um but I won't I don't do a whole shitload of jokes on rape victims anyway um but if that's the case and it probably is the case then be for castration of rape rapists or or fight the fact that the recidivism rate is so high in these fucking pigs because they're being led out of jail like fight that you don't worry about what dumb jokes contributing to a fucking rape culture is nonsense and it is to say comedian contributes to rape culture is simply bullshit and it's it's simplistic thinking it's a way of saying I don't like what you're saying and I don't want you to say it but I can't come out with that so I have to find a higher reason which makes it sound like you shouldn't say it for this reason yeah well even the term rape culture you know some of my message board said do they have like meetings they have a magazine like is it really a culture like what are you talking about and by calling it that by defining it in those terms calling it rape culture you would you put quotes around that it starts to be real and what I don't mean that it's going to encourage people to rape but I mean the idea that there's a culture that supports rape is going to be real it's going to be something that people address as if it's real regardless of whether or not it is is it real that people rape absolutely but it is a real that our culture supports it fuck no man course that much
