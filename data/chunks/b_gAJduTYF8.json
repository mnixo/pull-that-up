hello freak bitches there was a video that MTV put out yeah it was a new year's resolutions for white guys it was one of the worst fucking most racist sexist videos and ever since all you tweet thought it was so ridiculous like I imagine if anybody had ever made a video like that about any like generalization about a hundred million people and that's what it is it's a general like if you say how many white guys are in America let's let's just guess how many white males are in America not enough princess Leia's dot had a heart attack okay okay how much sixty-two percent of the US population is white 62% of the u.s. what percentage of white males white white man I'll suit the majority which is about seventy seven percent how many white males did type in males the white men are 31% of the population there okay so we're 31 percent of the population is 350 million people somewhere around a hundred million people right it's in that neighborhood between eighty and a hundred million right that's what a crazy thing to generalize like just to make a video about white men just like hey white guys how about you get your shit together like just white guys just white guys like holy shit do you want to do this about black guys too why don't you see what happens when you do it about black guys how about you do it about black women see how quick somebody beats the fuck out of you like a you how come you can do that about white guys like this the idea is that white men are the privileged and that white men have this advantage so you should attack that advantage by being racist towards them the best way to stop racism is to be racist towards people who you think are racist it's hilarious it's so stupid it's so it's unbelievable that MTV News thought they should do a video like that what's really bad MTV is the worst I mean like have you watched MTV recently I'm sorry do you like him too don't never watch anything I try I might even watch TV anymore I don't have cable anymore so I have you know a PS view or whatever it's slang and so I have certain channels I normally but not as many as I used to have so like I'll watch MTV more just because I have it as one of 30 channels but MTV is just garbage channel now like there's nothing that we're too old for it that's like you have to be 18 to 22 to have any well they have that show was it ridiculous is that on MTV God that show is just all a bunch of void videos for people getting jacked on the internet right and then everything else is they don't have videos anymore right it's not no videos on YouTube every videos on Sunday - what - what a weird time yeah but you know it was cool when they had videos as you learned about new bands because you saw their video like yeah but nobody wants to watch those anymore yeah I guess they played videos versus people falling on their head people go to phone on their head every day so they just went where the money is so this is the idea is that like they're just trying to appeal to social justice warriors by making this video there's one girl in the video she goes find out what mansplaining is and then don't do it he'll like find out what like a what a ridiculous idea that you can be condescending about someone being condescending and that that's somehow another's going to work like that all the thought behind making a video like that is exactly how Trump got elected when you tell people what to do they automatically want to do the other thing even if they wouldn't want to do the other thing if you hadn't said shit but when you push people and you tell people just if you make up ridiculous standards the way people are supposed to behave because you think they should behave like that and that you are allowed to make gigantic gross generalizations about an entire group of a hundred million people just because you think it's open season on white guys like that is how people like Trump get elected because people push back against your ridiculous political correctness and go towards what's the enemy of that what's the enemy of political correctness that pussy grabbing guy let's fucking phone them in and that's what happens that's exactly what happens these people are the people that are so mad that Trump is in office are directly responsible for hordes of people voting for Trump because they are sick of where the PC generation is pointing it's an irrational point of view it's not objective it's not if anything has to do with gender or homosexuality whoever has to do with any of those things is no longer considered as an individual then you're considered as a part of an untouchable group that is almost always exonerated of anything they've done wrong it's just you get to this weird fake world where people are people anymore they're figureheads four ideologies that's the problem with political correctness as much as it's a problem with people that are super right-wing or people that are born-again Christians or it's fucking up comedy like it that so many comedians have been talking about lately how like they've had to stop themselves on stage you know and not go down a route they normally would always go down because of the recent you know racist shit and the PC shit's so much different you know in the last even six months well it's definitely more pushback but there's always been pushback have you noticed a change have you have you noticed like certain things you won't say now or do now or well it makes you just back up what you want to say better it makes you reinforce your arguments better it makes you if you're going to have something to say to people you have to have you know you have to have a real point and you have to be able to back up what you're saying you have to be able to splain what you're saying [Music] you
