bars for what who gives a fuck about Mars I'm sitting at gold is a bouquet see this fucking tape they made this in Burbank well this is what I think I think first of all yeah they did go and it's awesome and what you you spend money on scientific innovation for space travel you're dealing with the cream of the crop of people that are trying to figure out how to manipulate space and matter and and transport things and how to you know and you're dealing with the most the most knowledgeable scientists on earth that's driving the $2 strive no Sam Joey come on I mean I'm serious I'm saying silly no no no but I this is what every let me tell you everything that they do what we gonna do the fucking price X when I have to do we got fucking age we got diseases we got fat kids running around

billions are bitch every fucking year and are we gonna spend more fucking money I'm going to Mars it's fuckin Afghanistan that Mars thing is a positive thing the Mars thing they're gonna get innovation out of this project yeah I know them in everything else it's gonna eventually lead to even who knows what kind of space travel eventually we're gonna have we're not gonna go and I'm never gonna go soon yes well I got to do with us that's just a problem when Isis we can talk shit thing I'm not in the fuckin door without this is why I care about it cuz it's cool as fuck okay when that

Burger King on why we think we need more what are we gonna put our plaza purse how we gonna make how we gonna pick up an envelope this very energy there ain't a fuckin Jew let's happy right now but what's goin on this podcast is sponsored by ear doctors all across America the conspiracy well that'd kill a cop of hiring Joe easy to make people blow their eardrums out that pissed conspiracy so many things going on this Coast Guard and schools are closing fucking people hit morale cities to clone human bastards we gotta go to fucking what bars to give a fuck listen I go Joey I said I support your hubris on this no no no and listen but I don't mind we gotta send reporter Ricans over there a stab at a rap that's what needs to be done I gonna blow up a fuckin building or three black guys is stabbed and a rat that's what needs to be the war is money the fucking bottom line that the square root of war guy is Jesus and we've all known that Jesus that's the square root of money I don't see any D dis and that's going to Mars except taking a bunch of rich people and charge them to taking them ours is a cool let me explain to you got every fucking drone is flying in Pakistan and taking out al Qaeda if you believe in that shit bills alright agreed by scientists and that uniform which if you want to argue about keeping people safe the best way to keep people safe look I'm not I'm not saying that I advocate drones because a fuckload of civilians have died from the use of drone attack but if they eventually get that shit wired to the point where they can kill everybody they want to kill that's where you with its the scientists that are involved in making that shit or the same scientists that are involved in making all sorts of I love it spacecrafts and aircrafts I love them that that makes technology man you want to kill somebody you make I want to see the bullet that'll need a gun for I just gotta go like digits and a hitch in your head blows up I appreciate the scientists but not right now billions of dollars to go to so many bars really that Joey that is a tiny fraction of what our military by guys it's a tiny chance fighting for our freedom what does Mars has to do with us is a Martian gonna come back to Vegas actually that's a crazy thing to say well you I said it every da one though the military is fighting for our freedom is that why we're in countries that have absolutely nothing to do with us that's why and we invaded them is come on man we got crazy sites that fucking flag brother but no we're good--we're bad we gotta kill some us you gotta break a fucking few harmless stuff to fucking make an army gotta break some eggs to make a few omelet yeah whatever they're doing it's a lot better than fucking they're selling drugs the CIA sells coke at least they're making money Mars and got none of you here's the big thing Joe every time every time they send something to like Mars or the orgy these missions they are also doing hundreds of experiments and these experiments are experiments that that we can't do you know you know in down on earth we're in a lot of these experiments lead to other things that that do help us out like cures for cancer and fucking time-travel let's get the cue list some gel has to be a dollop it's gonna be it's gonna come a point in time if we follow the path that we're on right now where we might not be living on this fucking planet anymore where human beings might pollute this motherfucker Department we're going to want to escape and what they're going to do is are going to send shit to Mars to terraform just like they did in the movie aliens and they're gonna put a fucking fake atmosphere on Mars and that's gonna bear a little escape colony yeah I don't know what it doesn't do with us how do we get okay it'll be fun you know it has to do it I'm alive right now and when something lands on Mars I get geeked out yeah I want to see that shit I came out looking at the photos I'm like that that land has ever been seen before is like has there been people that have walked on looks like fucking Arizona's well you know it doesn't the Arizona but you know there is there's a real theory that's a fascinating theory that Mars used to inhabit life that he used to had an atmosphere but it was hit by an asteroid and that's one of the reasons why they want to keep setting things there and get to test because if it was a planet that supported life like ours but then it was hit by an asteroid we realized that we've had mass extinctions on this planet at least two of them that were caused by asteroids you know hundreds of millions years ago and then 65 million years ago they know there's been some just doozies that have landed but it's possible that one could land that just kills the whole time and that's a wrap let me ask you something bro what's that doc to do and you are can you sell an asteroid could you bring an asteroid to a check-cashing Senate talking I'm here to get my fucking money fucking asteroid gonna vote for this year I mean I don't want could you from on the right in Doug Stanhope that's what I was negative like Stan yeah I just mean you see what's going on in this country we could get a lot of people to ready us down this country Joe Rogan oh yes judicata you aren't something intelligent guy yeah I'm a fucking Momo and I know that those both of them a bums you're an intelligent yeah you just looked me at my face and told me you're not confident by anybody who's running for press in this country you and another fuckin million people feel that whatever sorry about that chocolate bar fucking me up you know I think it's alright man I know what you're doing just having fun no no no no watchin Olympics fuck No
