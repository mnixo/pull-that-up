the gyro can experience a lot of us get there right a lot of people that we know came from a place where when they were really young they were like what the fuck is going on with the world yeah well how old we do you think you were when you had your first oh I think my parents might be fucking crazy thought well you like these people are in charge of telling me what to do this is nonsense you're making you're talking crazy talk here it happens it happened for me the first time that I took LSD and maybe before that but when I took LSD I when I took LSD for the first time I can remember whenever you take LSD especially you know I mean it you know when I took LSD what worries do I have I'm in fucking high school there's no there's nothing in it there's nothing - there's no demons to come swimming out of my brain and taunt me with like all the myriad of things you get when you're older there's just fucking nothing you just open I might be upset as like a cheerleader that came over to my house I couldn't figure out how to kiss her maybe that's like the biggest problem I'm having at a time so but I you know at that time when I did it for the first time and had that initial experience you know and you go back to your parents who've never taken it and if you mentioned to them that you'd even taken it they might want to put you in a drug rehab or they think you're insane or they think you're getting down the wrong track you're forced into this place of like fuck man I can't I won't you guys don't even you don't even know you you don't even understand this this new way of experiencing life you know so and I think there's a lot of people who spend their whole lives never knowing that you don't have to take psychedelics to get to that place there's other ways to get to that place but yeah it's a very strange thing and those people who never get to that place they're the ones who are a lot of them are in control right now so your life took an inexorable change when you did acid that was like the point where you look back and you said this is the point where I went off into this direction um well I know I'd say that the taking acid started with a series of like books it started with contact with like you know the whole weirdness mile weirdness weirdness started with as I recall it started with me coming upon this book that my mom had called Raja yoga by yogi Rama Chaka who by the way it was never a yogi which is some English mystic fucking lied about being a yogi but it's all just a fascinating story but the book uh you know that was the first time I'd ever read the idea that you there that you're an observer observing yourself that you you aren't necessarily the you that you think the you that can be observed is not you you're the observer state the mindfulness the watcher that's when I that's the first time I'd come upon the idea of what's that's called the Ottman the thing that observes yourself you know when you you know someone will say I'm really mad right now the moment you say I'm mad you're creating a distinction you know between the thing that's observing that you're mad and the thing that's mad so that observer that watcher that's the thing that that mindfulness is what you know throughout my whole life I try to you know go into that place of observing myself rather than being the thing and it's a game that you can play in it really it's quite helpful with a variety of problems especially if you get really angry if you get really angry and you can stop yourself and just watch and there's tools you can use in that book I remember it said as you walk around start thinking he is walking that was like one of the tools like it's in a book and your character in a book so when you're going around you're like you know right now he's doing a podcast right now he's talking and so that's these are at these are activities designed to create this like the watch or the state of presence of watching so that started it that led me to like you know the eye and then I found out about you know I I think I read the electric kool-aid acid test you know about fucking Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters blasting themselves on acid and going to the World's Fair and a bus then I read that shit no I remember wait I'll tell you that I'll stop this weird weird rant I remember now fucking filmstrip that's what it started in my head I think I was in like the fourth grade and they showed us a drug film strip remember filmstrips yes fucking popped up this guy like it thought there's a guy I still her it's a guy in it it's a guy in the fucking um empty apartment and he's curled against the wall in the fetal position and it's at LSD and it looks terrible and then the narrator says LSD can make you experience hallucinations you can see dragons and I remember I'm saying you could see dragons I'm like I want to see anybody that sounds awesome fuck the empty apartment the fetal position I'll figure it out sit on that guy's a pussy yeah that what are you crying so dragon little bitch it's AG acid expect yeah Iren and that was that put it in my head it's like well you know I think that's a interesting thing to explore but yeah that's hilarious so you think that you were like - Duncan's like Duncan won and Duncan - like Duncan one is like regular Duncan growing up innocent boy here boom psychedelics and then Duncan - yeah I know yeah yeah there's definitely a Duncan - that happened I'd say and then that that Duncan - changed to man because you you know as you get older the best thing there's - great the best thing that can happen to use you get knocked off track that's the best thing that can happen to you in general because generally the track you're on has been set for you by people who never got off their track you end up what you know you end up the child of someone who decided to have you in their 20s 21 22 they're not going to know a lot of stuff they're not going to understand the universe that much unless they were like came from a really good family of like artist or intelligent people chances are they're scared hungry desperate angry they don't want to be in the relationship anymore they don't want to be monogamous anymore the idea of non-monogamy to them might just seem insane you know like who the fuck knows it but you're born into that planet you're that's the atmosphere you're born into that's what you're breathing when you're first born and that can set you on a weird path and that's a very sad path that you can get on and so hopefully if you're lucky you'll come across somebody who knocks you off that fucking path you know I remember the guy who helped me up with acid I remember sitting in the theater of my school because I was taking I was a drama nerd and I sitting in the theater of my school next to this got away so the two next to this guy Brad and uh I remember singing a night and we were talking and he mentioned tripping on LSD and I'm like what psycho yeah I took acid over the week I'm like what why you can get acid the movie the life the life of duck somebody must animate this here's somebody please I know your folks out there they're animate shit you gotta animate this that that moment took me to and this is really weird tell me what the the first trip was like I love to the first trip was uh it was white blotter white blotter paper I don't it was just white blotter a little Pete you know for somehow if you don't know this LSD gets put on sheets let's just look like blotter paper and sometimes they have designed sometimes they don't but the name is always a reference to usually as a reference to the design on the sheet so you know purple Jesus white blotter lips you know there's a million different names for the different types of acid but so this is just white you knows what it was but it was really good and I can remember I took it and you have to you know it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes longer for it to kick in I still remember I was sitting into my friend's trailer in a trailer park in North Carolina sitting in an empty bathtub on it like an empty Jacuzzi tub that was in this trailer and I'm sitting there and they're watching Star Wars and I'm sitting in this bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest it's the greatest feeling just started going through my legs and up into my body and it was a fucking sword fight it was a lightsaber fight bam bam bam when I'm listening to that but all of a sudden now the sounds echoey like someone's turned and Ecko up on it so it's like you know it's kind of bouncing around it's beautiful and I feel so fucking good started laughing it seems so funny then I went outside and lay in the grass I'm staring at the sky everything's you beautiful trails you put your hand in front of your face and it's just this rainbow of hands drifting in front of your face everything's breathing then my friends come running out because they knew this is the first time I stripping and they all start jumping over me they're like jumping over me as I'm laying oh they're laughing and we're all fucking laughing and it's just perfect then I will somebody pull the cock out that's when they pulled that we all started fucking we fucking fuck and then I dog came by and we grabbed the dog and started fucking the dog no no it was beautiful or in spirit about it's very now yeah there was no fucking happening there was a lot of like laughing there was I remember going into my friend shitty high school car and like sitting and like pulling the seat back and looking at the ceiling and I'm looking at the ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics or some kind of like ancient writing you know I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit was at the time but I probably be like oh I'm seeing Sanskrit some kind of runes or glyphs all over my friend's car that's just kind of breathing and warping and it's just beautiful so yeah that was the that was the first time and once you've had that experience how do you go back to a world a normal kind of world I'm incredible amazing what is it it's courtesy kurtzweil is a they call him a futurist and he's responsible for many many patents he's a brilliant brilliant man and he is a huge proponent of the idea of the technological singularity and the idea behind that is that one day artificial intelligence is going to literally and virtually come alive and we're going to merge with it somehow we are either going to be downloaded into computers or consciousness is going to be replicated and indistinguishable from our current consciousness and that will be downloaded into computers and though our biological body will die our electronic signal that is our consciousness that has been recreated like you know let you copy a Microsoft Word file you will copy your mind you a copy of it just like your soul yeah yeah you will copy something and you will put it into this whatever the fuck it is that holds all this stuff but what we're saying is that life is almost completely connected to technology and it's a very very short time that this has happened yeah 200 years ago there were no cars you know so in those 200 years we have been connected to cars there was a really fascinating video that someone sent me that I put up on Twitter i retweeted it the other day you can find it if you just scour through my Twitter but it's a time-lapse video of of cars moving back and forth on freeways and how it looks like blood yeah and the heart yeah how it looks like the pulsating of blood coming back and forth you know I mean it's clearly it's the breath of breathing in and breathing out the you know the heart beats in and out the cars leave the house and come back to the house I mean it really is yeah yes that's correct it's a type of life form it's just it happens so slowly all this traffic sucks my dick you know on the fucking my car's dying shit and all these things that you you micromanage that that scenario and then you don't see it as this pulsating thing of of cars coming in and cars going out and how many of them going the same goddamn direction every day here's the thing man and this is what I think about this all the time because the way for app for things to work the way they're working right now which is for there to be capitalism and there to be super rich people and super poor people in war and all the things that you know a rather distasteful or seem to be seem to be a destructive for that to exist each of those little nodes of consciousness that represent that bloodstream have to think there are individuals and have to think they're more important than all the other ones so you've got a bunch of blood cells all thinking yeah I gotta get to work what the fuck's wrong with this asshole in front of me and not realizing they're all part of this one super organism and if somehow everyone's consciousness shifted from the idea of like I gotta get to work to whatever the next thing would be which is I'm connected to this super mind that is the planet which I think is going to that's what the singularity will be it'll be some technological quickly applied empathy that allows everyone to connect their consciousness to to other earth to earth yeah that moment capitalism kind of ceases as we know it and capitalism of course is just as a symptom of something deeper but that that model the model that's running everything is no longer possible and that model encourages a competition that model encourages people to push and strive and push beyond their comfort in order to you know to create more action create more money to create more more building more construction more more things or more more prisons more laws buying more things more diseases swarm up where your zones Desalle yeah all of it it all accelerates they invent diseases it's a it's a fascinating thing man you know the the idea that everything moves in the same direction is that these single-celled organisms you know that you know or even how about we look at blood you know we're talking about it looking like like blood moving through arteries you know blood is a single cell you know single cells of blood move as in the same as this huge animal that has you know billions of cells and not just that but is also a host for all sorts of bacteria and stuff that live inside of our bodies but we have to in order to keep it going in the same direction as those cells we have to have all these different little tools that we use to sort of justify existence all these different little tools like the love of having your baby the love of orgasms you know the love of going on stage or of creating something you know you think about the one thing that's the most satisfying you know outside of childbirth and in having your own children is creating you know people who don't create things I think as a whole are way less happy than people who do create things and I know dudes that make pool cues I know dudes that make belts they make custom wallets and there's a something that they get when they like you know I bought a wallet from this dude and you buy a wallet from him he sells you the wallet he made it for you and shit like there's a smile that he has like he created something he needed a piece of artwork and someone else is appreciating a wow I love how you did this is how this is awesome work it's so clean and well done is like thank you and like his effort and his his creativity have gone into an actual object and to us that's very very very satisfying and then there's the comedy satisfaction that you get for performing mean that's all we you and I understand we understand I guess it's in music it's probably just the same thing you create a song and then people love that so that's feeling creating something then what are you doing when you're creating something won't you're doing the same fucking thing you're you're pushing the machine you're pushing it in your way and your way is making people happy and and giving people some positive energy and I your DVD and there's an industry behind that and they come see with the clubs and it's his industry behind that even behind putting gas in their cars and you know this it's it's a really it's amazing how many different pieces are in place if you if you take bat if you like you know zoom in on the idea of what is creation and creation is taking something from the nothingness and bringing it into the somethingness and so you sort of become the doorway for something to come from the nothingness into the something as so when you're creating you're actually experiencing as flow through from the infinite into the finite and that I think that is the feeling that we love so much is that sense of feeling that that thing when you're working on jokes and all of a sudden it goes from being a Drudge to all of a sudden it's like holy shit you know what's happening and obviously we get sucked into this weird vacuum and you you've written for like two hours and it feels like a second you know that that sense of being pulled into a momentary current or something's coming out of you that's clearly not necessarily you that to me is like one of the ultimate it is it's the ultimate feeling and I have the you know I think if you go by this idea of this attractor the McKenna talks about or this thing that exists in hyperspace that it's what it wants to come through us into this universe it wants to express itself through us and I think that's the compulsion that you're talking about I think that's an alternative viewpoint obviously there's the cynical way of looking at it like it's a natural inclination that people have monkeys are curious this is what we do we think about things and every joke that you have is just accumulation of your life experiences and you're figuring out a little bit congratulations you're not tapping into the universal consciousness we'll be right back Sarah Palin's on the line we're gonna have a nice little sit-down with the future president United States may be huh yeah well let's hope he doesn't fuck anybody that he's not married to by imaginary rituals uh you thing about it but you know what I'm saying that cynical point of view about the idea of creativity yeah there's something to that point of view too you have to address it you can't always go hippie and one that I back I bounce back and forth I don't think it is either but it is a little um I pets I bounce back and forth with the idea of the imagination being almost like like when you and you have imagination that the imagination is the real force behind the evolution what imagination truly is is we think of as like oh I can see things I can work around problems I have this idea but when you imagine an idea when you imagine a product you imagine how to design an engine for a car near the firt you know you're Henry Ford whoever the fuck made the first engine yeah when your imagination has this idea for this thing and then you build it and design it and boom it's there that thought what there there was no thought of that before it existed it's not that people were running around thinking of the car and I know what's gonna look like there was no thought of it you created this or it came to you there's a something from nothing something from from what is that from the ether something from these even if it's just these synapses firing in your mind where's what is the signal what is the route of this signal to be so you know mathematical about it and say well it's just human ingenuity and that's what it is it's good old stick-to-itiveness and you roll up your sleeves and you figure out this world all that Henry Ford created a great thing and you know well Thomas Edison who's a great fella invader foes neuron sweatin yeah you know I don't necessarily know it's is possible that the imagination is something that is information that is out there like the the idea of the Acacia chrec ERDs the idea of yeah that there's shit out there and then what we are is little antennas again yeah and that are when we tune into something if we pick up this this signal for the engine and someone picks that up excellent once that piece is in place oh then it flowers and blossoms like like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking a sunflower you know it all bursts out you know exponentially in certain directions and then that starts creating more inventions with all which also burst out in but all of them emanate in the imagination initially all of them have to be thought up Auto all of them have to be created by the human minds right or what the human mind can tune into there's no way into this universe as a human but through a pussy and there's no way there's no way for an idea to come into this universe except through a thought there's no way for an invention except it to come through our mind our minds our the our minds are sort of the creative orifices through which all innovation every invention every idea comes it's through the human mind now if you want to think that some day you just wake up and you get in the shower and you get lucky enough for your neurons to fire a certain way where you figure out how to reduce the cost of making solar power panels and solve the you know the energy problem on the planet if you want to think that that's an accident fine if it helps you it seems like it helps a lot of people to think that the universe Springs from some kind of lightning pole hitting plasma or the earth does or you or biological life on the earth and some people like to think that their neurons get lucky and fire because they squeeze their brow together in the right way and popped out an idea but I think you'll find that most of the great creators they don't think that you know when you write but is that because the best way to create is to not think about yourself the best way to create is like when you start thinking about yourself the ego starts tripping over its own dick and you start thinking about like how cool you are yeah it's like when you see a guy on stage and the guy like we think she's cool the worst it's the worst the feeling is feeling of gross Ness as a disconnect and that disconnect also disconnects him from creativity whereas if you see a guy on stage and he's just in the moment man he doesn't give a fuck you just tuned into it it's so compelling and so interesting yeah you know so maybe it's it's a trick you know I'm saying like maybe this idea that you know that we are tuning into the infinite and that is it hmm maybe not maybe it just requires a certain state of mind to be creative and that State of Mind is to avoid the ego what it's also like like the card they don't just invent the car you invent the wheel firs and it's because somebody sat there like hey I need to take stone or take heavy thing over here you know it's it understand the antenna that way I think its awesomeness esse t inventions come with necessity it certainly is but guess what antelopes are an event and shit they keep getting jacked by Jaguars left and right those stupid fucks they never figure it out every year they never invent an animal mo car where they can just give the finger to the Jaguar keep the horn run over the Jaguar babies they see in the road they can't do it we can and they're one of the reasons why we can is because we're conscious because we can think and but what is thinking the real question is would it win are all these things firing together solving problems what is all that really because some people can't solve shit there's it's very clear that there's a there's different types of people there's people that are super solvers and there's people that can barely solve taking a shit and wiping their ass correctly there's people that can barely show up for work every day everything they do is a fucking mess and they make more people that are just like that well if you think that there's an order to the whole thing what are those fucks here for you know are they here just until robots can become invented to do menial tasks is that what it is well yeah like here's the thing what you did this is what you do supposed to eat them you think of an actually even when things get bad for sure think of like the greatest idea ever in our brains though then you get mad cow disease try on well fuck you I can't if you can applause you can treat the brain everyone eat the brain just the lens range nature's balls an asshole the Ranger goes bitch you got a prob bringing people brains you fucking crazy pellet is there delicious yeah if you look at if you so the idea just to get back to this idea of like where the thoughts come from well if you if you take things out of the temporal perspective and look at things as some unified whole in by temporal you past present and future ok so let's look at the whole thing is like from the perspective if we could jump out of time and we could look at whatever this event was let's call the big bang for now and the series of reactions that happened directly after the Big Bang in those first few seconds that the people at the particle accelerators want to understand and then you follow that all the way to the condensation of gas I guess that made matter an event in the galaxies and the GAT and then you follow all the way that to the first mix chemical soup that whatever that was and then the DNA starts forming out of that and then that DNA somehow gets encapsulated in a membrane and we have cells and the cells gain symbiotic relationships with other cells and become multicellular organisms which have symbiotic relationships and eventually you end up with us we still are basically a DNA trail going all the way back to before DNA to matter all the way back to this explosion of light and so a thought is an idea emerging from infinity from the ultimate explosion the trillions of years ago into the present moment now if that ain't coming from nowhere I don't know what is you can say well no it's my neurons that did it well your neurons did it right now but you're a chain of super reactions that led to this moment in time when you invented the thing you invented right you know you're not just your neurons you are connected to the entire ecosystem and you're connected to a infinite past you know and it's just I guess when you start looking at things that just you know this your 60 year lifespan I suppose things can start looking pretty grim and Penn & Teller --is-- but if you really just step out of time and really look at what's going down it's like it's fucking crazy man we got blasted out of some infinite past and we're like yapping about it right now it really it just keeps going over and over and over and over and over and over again can I tell you my new theory of reincarnation yes and it's really intense because I thought it doesn't it freaked me out it's pretty horrible so it's like the common idea of reincarnation if you subscribe to the theory is that you die and you're born again you go through your childhood you grow up and then you die maybe you get born as a cat maybe a butterfly right maybe an amoeba this is what I was thinking because I had a dream once and in this dream I was a kid a little girl and my mom was rubbing my head and I knew I was dying but I didn't know what that meant except I knew it was bad and I could kind of feel myself fading out there was this like white sort of thing happening and then I woke up out of the dream like fuck what a shitty dream so I was thinking like oh fuck what if that's what reincarnation is what if when you die you know when you're driving home one night you've had too many pot lollipops you're listening to coast to coast someone says something shocking that makes you look away from the road you swerve off you slam into a tree you wake up you're here back in your house I got fuck what a shitty dream but you've really died you just reincarnate it again into an alternate route in an alternate reality so you literally can't die there's no break this just goes on forever and ever and ever and ever no break no stopping no new age going into the light and seeing your parents and your family and taking a going to some new age a cosmic spa where you get to shake off all your shitty karma it never stops it just keeps happening again again maybe like right now there's an earthquake and the ceiling collapses and all of a sudden you're just some daydreaming cabbie in Boston like well I was fucking weird I was just imagining I was a comedian in LA but you know what I mean well that's bizarre you're gonna change lives no happened to another life you become the guy rides this body out yeah you've never been to an alternate life with all your memories embedded everything already embedded in there because it's an infinite it's an infinite this the the it goes on forever what if your consciousness is living a bunch of different life simultaneously and you just can't you can't see them yes like an office filled with cubicles and no one's poking their head over the top of the cubicle yeah right all rolling at this yeah or like the way I thought about it is like if you're if there was like something this it sounds really crazy but imagine that each of your fingers this sounds insane but imagine like each of your fingers had their own personality in their own like consciousness or something it's like and you could stick them through some kind of hole where they would forget they were attached to your hand and they would just think that they were their own individual selves you know what I mean like maybe that's what we are we're just like little fingers protruding into this dimension from some infinite thing but the product of protruding into this dimension is we get instantaneous amnesia and part of like dealing with a shock of coming into this dimension is we forget our true identity and replace it with our ego structures don't let go to four minutes and 14 seconds will just end this because it's fascinating by the way I'm not dissing this guy at all and I fucking love this music and I look I love his song and I love that kind of music I like a lot of Toby Keith songs I don't have anything wrong with patriotic songs at the end of it listen this guy does this little speech and this is like this old old dude that's like I love my country I love my guns I love my family I love the way it is now and anybody that tries to change it has to come through me that should be all of our attitude as this is America and a country boy is good enough for me soon okay play that back again because that might be a terrorist message okay that retarded fucking speech back it up ready listeners listen us that a bag was it I love my country I love my guns I love my family I love the way it is now and anybody that tried to change it has to come through me that's the music my head that should be all varietals essence is America and the country was good enough for me son a country boys good enough for me like we are as evolved as I need let's stop right here how can you talk and exactly if you can listen to a cancer so I put a down I it's just so fucking stupid it's like a little more guns but that's you I love my country I love my guns oh Jesus dude just hurry up and die where you fucking hurry up you guys fucking Model T human being you dipshit just died a liberal family I love my guns yeah Brad chopstick toes here come through me yeah okay look I'm not saying I want to take your guns dude all right I don't want to talk about guns - I love my family - all right settle the fuck down every time in history every time in history no one's coming through you bro but every period in history has got those human anchors desperately trying to dig their claws into the fucking into the earth and keep evolution from happening desperately fight they'll kill for kill for Inquisition what do you mean wait a minute you can't be serious - you everyone gather round did you hear Galileo did you hear what Galileo just said fuck he said they heard he speak of yeah earth not being the Santa I love my earth in the center of the universe of my earth I love my sticks and bows and arrows I love I love burn
