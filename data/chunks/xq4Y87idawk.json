all right with live Brett first of all thanks for doing this appreciate it man very glad to be here you look great despite all this pressure you're smiling is a for people that don't know what's going on let's lay out all of all the events that have transpired essentially you were being asked to step away from your college for a day is that what it was is it one day well this goes back farther yeah let's lay out the whole thing okay so we couldn't possibly lay out the whole thing well it's just for people that have no idea what's going on right they're listening right now and they're like who's this Brett weinstein guy so the core of it surrounds a tradition that we have at Evergreen called day of absence and this tradition stretches back long before I was ever at the college I've been there 15 years this tradition stretches back into I think the early 70s and it's it's built around a play written by Douglas Turner war to black play right and the play portrays events in a fictional town where the black population decides not to show up one day in order to emphasize their their roles in the town that the white population is unaware of and as you would imagine all hell breaks loose so anyway that's a it's an excellent play and some early faculty at our college decided that we should have a day that mirrored this event and originally black faculty and students and then later people of color would leave campus for a day to emphasize the role that they play in our community and then they would later the the tradition was amended and had a day of presence added to it where people would come back to campus and this has been going on as I said since the 70s and the whole time I've been there and then this year it was announced by the organising committee that the the situation would be reversed and they asked white students staff and faculty not to come to campus and that did not at all sit well with me as I said in my letter to the person who had announced this Rashidah who i should say his staff and i she has ended up at the center of this controversy I think wrongly just because my letter in response is addressed to her and then it was made public by our school paper so her name has been dragged front and center but in any case my letter I I said that there was all the difference in the world between a population deciding to absent themselves from a shared space in order to highlight their role and a population deciding to absent another population from a shared space which I find unacceptable as as a person as somebody devoted to the gains of the civil rights movement I just I and I should also probably say as a Jew and when people start telling me where I can and cannot be it it rings alarm bells so that that's the gist of the story and the letter caused quite a stir amongst students staff and faculty who responded many of them quite angrily privately of course people were much more divided on the matter and there were plenty of people who agreed with my letter but publicly speaking there was condemnation of the letter but the the event itself they have absence was mostly uneventful I did go to campus as I said I would in my letter and I actually it's neither here nor there it was accidental but while I was on campus I ran into a student that I know very well actually student that my wife and I were abroad in Ecuador with last year we were teaching abroad and we had 30 students with us and so one of the students who had travelled with us to Ecuador happened to be on campus - this is a student of color I'm gonna stop this sorry that's all right that was gonna go on I was gonna drive me crazy right dance keep going so I ran into this student that I know well and care about quite a bit and we had a very nice conversation mostly not about they have absence as a matter of fact I can't even remember if we did talk about day of absence but there was something poignant to me about the fact that while I was being condemned for refusing to accept this new formulation that I was able to meet with a student who is important to me and the neither of our racial backgrounds is fund is primary in our relationship we know each other as people and that's really how I would like to see all of us interacting on campus we all have our backgrounds they matter to us but it can it cannot become the primary interface between us let me stop you here and let me try to understand what the reaction was because you rightly said that you think there's a huge problem with asking people to not show up simply based on their color of their skin exactly and what was the argument against that like when when you said that and I read your letter and your letter didn't sound racist at all it sounded very well thought out it's it made a very good point but the response the inflammatory response to your letter was so disturbing and shocking was there anyone who had reasonable debate with you about this was there anyone who said well we we should take into consideration why they're asking us to do this we should sit down with them we should talk through this was there was there anything reasonable or was it just dig your heels in the sand and then let the insults and the white privilege and all these accusations fly well like I said there's a huge difference that you can't see unless you're at the center of one of these things between the public discussion and the private discussion privately I had very interesting discussions with many people that was not absent but if you were to look in on the discussion at the public level it looked as if there was united against me now when you say public and private are the same people making contradictory statements in public that are that are commiserating with you in private or is it just different people a few of them do that the act that actually is the thing I find most surprising is that sometimes people will privately say one thing to you and then publicly do another mostly it's different people and I should say the people who have talked to me privately and expressed concerns are actually a quite a diverse group so it's not as if white folks are disturbed by this and people of color are united it's not at all like that but the part of the the hidden story here is that in order to invent advance certain policy proposals it has to appear that the community is united behind them and that anybody who stands against them is standing against them for illegitimate reasons so that means that the number of people who are willing to express any sort of nuance about what's taking place has to be small and they have to be dismissible so what they did is they called me a racist which is ironic because I'm an anti-racist I really have gone out of my way to first of all study the question of why racism occurs and I I believe been pretty courageous in fighting against it where I've run into it so to challenge me with that particular epithet was a mistake on their part it was a strategic mistake and I kept trying to tell them while this was still internally being discussed in the college I kept trying to tell them that they should really check the concept that I'm a racist they should ask because if they did they would discover that they were actually way off the mark and then they would have an interesting puzzle on their hands then they would have to explain to themselves why they had found themselves hurling this most poisonous term at somebody who not only isn't a racist but is pretty nearly the opposite well it's it's a standard maneuver when someone wants to silence someone when someone wants to put someone in a category that's instantly recognizable one of the best ones is racist oh absolutely and and what I found is that people simply could not figure out what they would do if that term was applied to them right they were able to preview in their minds what that would be like and so many people could see that there was no escape for them right so it's like being called a rapist almost it's like even if you are exonerated there's still that cloud hanging hanging above you yes but this also actually points to something pretty important and for anybody who travels this ground themself they're going to discover this that many of the terms that are being used have been redefined but they haven't been fully redefined so one of the things that I've seen in several places is that a term like racist has been redefined so that the bar for being a racist is so low that you couldn't possibly help but trip over it but then once you've tripped over it and you have accepted that you are a racist then the stigma goes back to the original definition so it is the dodging and weaving between the two definitions that actually does the heavy lifting well there's also a really disturbing idea that's being bounced around lately that it's impossible to be racist if you're anything other than white right it is ridiculous it's preposterous anybody who looks up the actual definition of racism will discover that that's preposterous but yes that does pass in certain places as logical yeah and just it's parodied in this very bizarre way that's supposed to be unchallenged and this is a fairly recent thing I mean this is not something that existed two decades ago right I agree and the pace at which it's moving in the last few years is very surprising it is surprising but it kind of makes sense because you get into these groups of people they have this confirmation bias they lump up together and they all reinforce their ideas in this echo chamber and they all do it inside the colleges and then when it gets out to the rest of the world as we're seeing with your case at Evergreen the the rest of the worlds like what is going on over here like what is happening in school and people who are sending their children off to school are very concerned with the indoctrination of these ideas and the adopting these very rigid mindsets that the rest of the world just simply could pick apart pretty quickly well this is the most shocking thing it because I'm you know I'm I haven't been censured I haven't been suspended I'm still on the email distribution list so I'm watching the traffic inside of my college and I'm able to compare it to the huge flood of stuff that I'm seeing from the outside world as they get wind of what's going on at Evergreen and the difference is a million miles inside of Evergreen actually we are descending further into madness the the faculty are blaming the fact that the campus had to be suddenly closed due to a threat from the outside yesterday on me for having talked about this in the outside world specifically hilarious I not see you I can't use that term yet okay hopefully someday I hope it's soon and you know I must say one thing that I don't you know we haven't even talked about where this where I got thrust into the spotlight here which your listeners are going to have to know in order to understand why I'm even sitting here but but the the intensity and the out of touch nature of the discussion inside the college simply reinforces the the impression that something is desperately off that that what we really have is a filter bubble that is so so strong that even when the world sends very clear evidence that you've missed something somewhere and it's time to rethink what you've been doing they're not waking up and I love this college this college we maybe will get to talk about it but the structuring of this college is so unusual and what one can do as a professor at Evergreen if you're really dedicated to teaching it is the place to be because you have unparalleled pedagogical freedom more freedom than you'd have as a tenured professor at Harvard and you also have room to teach individually to students because our students take one program at a time they're full-time in one program and the professor's teach one program at a time full-time and they can go on for a full year so imagine you've got 25 students and you have them for a year full-time you really know every student in your class individually not just by name but you know how they think you know their backgrounds you know their blind spots and that allows for a kind of teaching that can't be done anywhere else so I am quite distressed at the fact that Evergreen is now endangered by what's going on and I really would like to see it wake up and rescue itself because it is worth rescuing I watched the is that the president of the school who gave the speech addressing all these issues George bridges yes it looked like a hostage negotiation it looked like he had a gun to his head he was literally a hostage it was so bizarre and kids are yelling things at him like what the fuck are you gonna do and and and he just has to take it it's so strange it's such a bizarro world to view it from the outside and to view these preposterous allegations that these kids are throwing at him of being racist and everyone's being racist and no one's doing anything to protect them and everyone's acting like they're in danger and their ideas are in danger and their their minds are in danger it's just so there's so much grandstanding it's so preposterous like what is it well first of all did you see the video in which dr. bridges our president is being challenged for his hand gestures and the protesters are actually policing his hand gestures that's how it's what's wrong with his hand gestures he's not doing this I think you can't even go like this to a friend because it they'll pause you right pause be right there in the middle no I think he's I mean I don't want a caricature this because I really think it's very important as preposterous is what's going on is I think it's very important that we understand it it's very easy to dismiss it because it's so strange but it's very important that we get it right I think the complaint about the hand gestures was that they represented microaggressions if you will I don't know for sure that that was the complaint but I can't make heads or tails of it otherwise what was he doing I give you can you move your hands and I think he was kind of gesturing like a person just trying to talk with emotion right so I do think there's a there's a translation which is this can be portrayed as a microaggression in some way you're speaking it isn't well we should talk about whether microaggression is even a good category but um let's just say the protesters had enough control over him that he gestured they didn't like it they told him not to he capitulate he's been on the entire time so I would say there's a huge amount of what's going on at Evergreen that is what I would call a show of force is he afraid of losing his job is he afraid of losing the support of the students what is he afraid of well if you had a guess I think he is afraid he's old enough he doesn't need another job he didn't need to take the job at Evergreen which he took two years ago I think he is afraid that this is going to be the capstone of his career a scandal in which he has allowed the campus to get out of control which he did but here's the crazy thing it's a non scandal you're a non racist who's been accused of being a racist all you did was say hey I don't think you should be able to tell people they can't show up for work if they're white they can't show up for school of they're white that seems kind of crazy and now hand gestures this is how far we've sunk that the we're not a Kent State it's not the National Guard shooting students it's this moving your hands around while you're talking with emotion that's a microaggression this guy's afraid of losing his job because of his hand motions well it goes beyond that so when George came to the college he he studied us which I can't hold him responsible for that that was a good move if he was well-intentioned he would have done that but he studied us very carefully he had a friend interview hundreds of us to figure out what was going on at the college but then he set in motion policy proposals and committees that were empowered in a way that was completely at odds with the way the school has run traditionally house well so among the many unique features of evergreen is the fact that the car the college is in large measure governed by the faculty and even the administration all of the deans are faculty members who have come from the faculty and when they're done being Dean's they go back to the faculty so the faculty has control over the college in a way that I don't think there's another college in the country that runs that way so what that means is that if you want to advance a policy proposal the faculty has to agree to it and George wanted to do some things that the faculty would not have agreed to so I'm I've told you about these full-time programs where students get this really personally tailored education and they they join a community that everybody knows each other he wanted to take those apart why I can't imagine I I can't imagine why you would I mean I I can the most generous thing to say is that he did not understand what an important part of the Evergreen model those programs are whatever his reason it was a terrible error and the only way to do it is to advance the the idea as an equity enhancing idea in other words you can say that that the full-time programs are anti they are anti equity in the sense that if you are disadvantaged you are less likely to be able to dedicate yourself full-time to a program because you may be going to school while you have a family and you have a job and so you know no doubt there's some truth to that but it doesn't you know how many colleges in the country do we have that do four credit programs and we don't need another we have one college in the country that does full-time programs and even if it is inconvenient for many people for reasons that are beyond their control the real question is can we get enough people for whom that's exactly the right model through the door and you know they're lying you know it's also the college is very inconvenient for people who live in Colorado by virtue of the fact that it's hundreds of miles away so right anyway so if you wanted to advance that proposal it had to be dressed up as equity enhancing and once it was equity enhancing it became very hard to challenge it because of core if you did challenge it then you were anti equity hmm boy that's convoluted you're telling me hmm so he wants to sort of disassemble this very unique and very beneficial model that you guys are operating under so this is just one part of it now how does this get to this one suggestion that white people step down oh it doesn't the two are connected in the following sense the president empowered he he chose people to be on what's called the equity Council of Council has changed its name several times so I'm not even sure what the current name is I think it's the equity and inclusion Council but but in any case he chose this council the council is if you count the two teams that are on it it's only a third faculty member so it's mostly students staff and at less than half faculty and he empowered them to propose modifications to the college that would be equity enhancing and the thing that they advanced the strategic equity plan is extremely densely written so it's hard to read and most of the people on our campus have not read it most of the people in the faculty have not read it in fact when it was released it was pretty clear that most of the people on the equity Council hadn't read it because it was so full of errors spelling errors and other things that would have been caught if people had gone through it but in any case my wife who also teaches at Evergreen and I and several others did read it carefully and were very alarmed at what was in it so there were there were features of the document that would for example completely reorient our hiring so our hiring process I would be up to see it revised and made better to because I don't I don't think we do it very well I think it's one of the things we were weak about but but anyway the proposal that they advanced was that for example every single hire would have to be justified on the basis that it was equity enhancing meaning racially Ecklie equity enhancing so imagine racially equity enhanced right so not just not just a policy of hiring all kinds people and not be racially discriminatory but being discriminatory in looking for certain people people of certain colors like harmony towards I think beyond that on it when I read that I thought how exactly do you hire a physical chemist and justify that this is racially equity enhancing so you would look towards like say if you had ten chemists you would try to only hire the ones that were of color yes though they're saying and that in yes I think so I mean as I said that document is so densely written that it's hard to know it really is set up I think to be dismissed so that it can be instituted and then we can find out what it really means but think about the the model that I described about how we teach at everything uh-huh that is not a model that anybody trains to teach in and the people who do it well are very unusual so then we're not looking for the same professors that are you know that would be best at Berkeley for example we're looking for unusual people who will take full-time programs and total pedagogical autonomy meaning we actually literally are free to teach anything we want in any way we want so that freedom is a marvelous thing if you have a particular appetite for figuring out how teaching should be done that it's never been done anywhere else before and you're willing to try it out and learn from the experience and advance that way so we're looking for very unusual people who find that an appealing challenge rather than somebody who wants to get a textbook and deliver the right the regular stuff if we're now going to prioritize race over everything else in our hiring then finding those needles in a haystack who are actually well built to deal with that much pedagogical freedom and that much contact with the students is going to be that much harder because sometimes the right person for the job just simply isn't going to be dark-skinned or who knows right so anyway I found the proposal lasted as did other people I talked to who had read it quite alarming at the of hiring in particular so is it meant to give the impression of diversity just by simply like look we've got our boxes checked here's a brown woman here's an asian man here's I mean is that what they're trying to do like look we've got all our bases covered this school is diverse well I'd like to put a placeholder on Asian man because during day of absence there was actually a I guess you would call it a seminar held on how Asians might just be part of the problem here yes Asians and and a problem yes did you air quote when you say the problem I didn't I'm not even sure if I should have you know the the world has become so bizarre I mean part of what problem well I think I think the translation is that because Asians are a population I don't know that is succeeding in a particular way at least from the perception of those who are deciding what these seminars look like that they actually I don't know have special obligations in this and I might say everything I've just said about Asians could be repeated for women especially white women who are playing a special role in this equity battle on our campus too so white women might be a part of the problem as well as Asian men quite clearly and so right so the idea I think I mean I have my own hypothesis about this and that's really all it is but it does fit everything I've seen so far is that there are entities within the you know you know ten years ago the phrase women and minorities was a very common phrase right and what it meant was people who had faced historical oppression in the current context that's too many people in order to to utilize these structures to to feed a certain set of populations you can't very well have all women included and so what's happened is people who are perceived as yes having been historically disadvantaged in some way but also at the moment being successful in some sense are being shoved out the coalition and then in if they feel a loss a sense of loss in having been shoved out the mechanism to get back in is to take on the role of what is ironically called a lie ship in this case which is not a lie ship at all it's an abuse of the concept of a lie ship a lie ship is really a symmetrical concept and this is subordination the subordination then we hear that a lot with the male feminist community the male feminists are supposed to be allies to women and we even read a paper that was or an article rather that was telling white people if you truly want to be allies you should not take high-paying jobs and you should only leave them to minorities yes my brother did a lie yeah that's what a good a good Ally subordinates and that means stepping away from a job etc so it's not an ally at all no it has nothing to do with Ally and in fact this is the thing that is most troubling to me about my personal situation is that if they really wanted you know mine too and I have to fill in what they means but if this coalition really wanted an ally for a quest for real equity I would be an hour right I really quit reelect right that's not what they want and so I wouldn't do what do you think that means that if if they don't want real equity what they want is a special advantage given to people of color a special advantage giving to people that were historically oppressed well let's put it this way I believe so I believe that in general at the moment coalition's are unholy alliances between two things and in this case you have the real equity movement which are people who wish to end oppression and then you have another movement that wishes to reverse oppression and they don't know that they're different because until you reach equity they're pointing in the same direction I say so one is trying to balance it out by in some way pushing down against white people and people who've historically had privilege to trying to trying to reduce their role they're trying to literally oppress think about the the story we were just talking about where the president of the college is being told how to move move his hands that's not so unlike a black person a black man let's say being told that he's not allowed to look a white woman in the eye right it's that kind of thing having been reversed this is people of color telling the president of our college how to move his hands but so it was people of color that were telling them to do this with his hands but again I got to be really careful because you know I've seen the video only once and I'm trying to remember if the people who are doing the asking are even on the screen so I don't want to I don't want to project something that I don't know for sure but it was definitely this the protesters which were protesting on some of them were white protesting on behalf of people of color and some of them many of them were people of color but even there were in trouble with the complexity because the people of color coalition that is protesting is not synonymous with people of color at Everton there are many people of color at Evergreen who are either just simply bewildered by what's going on or very troubled by it because you can imagine I mean I'm just put yourself in the shoes of a person of color came to Evergreen to get a really interesting education and didn't want to tell the president how to move his hands and then you see this happening in your name what exactly are you supposed to do that well there's also the problem the very real problem with the mob mentality and it is a common thing with human beings and they get together in large groups and people start chanting and screaming and they feel very justified and they always want to escalate it's it's very weird it's it's a strange reaction that that human beings have in large groups acting together where they just want to ramp things up they want to take it to the next level they want to shut this motherfucker down they it's it's a weird thing that people do it but I was watching it in your videos where people are saying you should resign like you need to resign like you need to resign like wow you need to apologize to that woman for communicating with her the way you did right and very respectful in an intelligent manner like it's they want to bully you around they want to push you around they want to take that professor that guy who's to be the one who's talking and distributing all the information and they want to shut you down it's flat-out bullying yeah and what I'm what I'm seeing is that almost nobody seems to know what to do about bullies especially when they're armed with a super weapon like the accusation that you're a racist nobody understands that capitulating to bullies may solve your problem in the moment but it makes the problem vastly worse over time and so anyway all I've done is apply that piece of knowledge that when when a bully challenges you not capitulating is just a prerequisite to getting anywhere ideally you want the bully to pay enough of a price that they don't continue what they're doing well ideally you would like to have a rational conversation with these people and get them to see your perspective and they should be able to consider it and say okay he's not racist well yeah it is kind of ridiculous that we're asking people who didn't have a say in what color they were born to step away from something or two did we're literally discriminating in under the guise of being anti discriminatory we're discriminating right I mean that's and it's not even it wouldn't even be hard to have that conversation one-on-one even I do it 20 on one but don't you think that that's what happening and well I mean a that you you have to get used to the fact that you don't get there all at once you plant a seed that's enough to cause them to know something about what we're saying couldn't possibly be right or we wouldn't be seeing what we're seeing the problem here is that the the mob that we're talking about is so large that even you know in the couple cases on last Tuesday and not this last juice I guess it was two Tuesday's ago now the couple of times that I was faced with a group that was you know somewhere below a hundred I actually do think I made some progress but I thought it was not durable at all because as soon as the event was over whatever progress was made got overwritten by whatever discussion happened next yeah so it is possible to have these discussions but there's something about the men that is in play here that makes it impossible to make any durable progress durable progress is a very interesting description durable progress yeah yeah because you're you're fighting against is this current movement of ridiculous ideas that that's going on through schools and we saw with Yale we saw with those students screaming at what was it the professor was it a professor or who was the put the guy they were screaming at that was trying to defend his wife's yes email about Halloween costumes yes maybe we should allow people to wear ridiculous Halloween costumes because that's part of like the fun of Halloween yes people were acting like you were saying that we should be lynching people well so first of all he did reach out to me and his point was what you were going through is eerily reminiscent he's watched the videos and yeah he was just pointing out how shocking it was I mean even to the point of my wife having been dragged in here oddly in this discussion where she wrote an email internal to our our distribution list asking the college why they were not protecting me and my students who were being actively stalked on our campus harassed doxed which students my current students but why why your current students being harassed my current students like almost all of my former students know that this charge is completely baseless and so they have been supportive so in defending you then they're being attacked absolutely like their little soldiers in some sort of a strange ideological battle they are being penalized for not falling in line wow that's scary that's real scary bullying when someone says hey he's a good guy and then someone comes after them so this is where this person lives let's find them that that has actually literally happened and what has happened to the students once they do find them well so the students have been I think the idea is intimidation right I've had students followed in the woods and that woods I've had students visited it's very scary and that I should say in just in terms of putting the context here as the college was pretending that nothing serious was going on the police called me up on the Wednesday just after the Tuesday in which I had been challenged in my class and asked me are you on campus and I didn't have class I said no I'm not on campus I said don't come to campus I said why and they said because the protesters are searching car-to-car for what they described as an individual and we think it's you and the college has told us to stand down we can't protect you what I know the college has told the police to not protect you the college told the police to stand down which means the police were literally barricaded in the police station despite their sense that they very much needed to be actively protecting people outside of the police station the police were left with no choice but to barricade themselves in the police station because they answer to the college administration which told them not to act I think because it wished to prevent a a news story but this meant people engaged in these protests were roving freely about the campus looking for people following them they you know that's so incredibly aggressive like looking for individuals in a car again to do what well that's the question I guess would be even they don't know let's say that it was me that they were looking for which would make sense I would imagine that they would have had the idea of I don't know taking me somewhere and getting me to acknowledge something that they think some sort of a hostage situation right but I suppose I didn't want to acknowledge whatever it is that they wanted me to acknowledge just as I didn't want to resign when they said I should resign I don't I don't know if they had a back-up plan and it worries me that one of the things that unfolded on the campus was that people who had a very clear idea of how things should go were they were literally they mean they were barricaded in the president's office with the president and a bunch of faculty members and staff and the story is that the president wanted to go to the bathroom and he was not even allowed to go privately to the bathroom he had to be escorted by two people who president of the college but who are the people protesters protesters had to go with him to the bathroom right so that to me sounds like literally kidnapping it's just stunning that he agreed to that it is all of it is stunning I can't believe I'm seeing it well this is PC gone amok I mean this is what everybody's been worried about this is what you are right now is the year of the tip of the spear we are previewing where this goes taken to its logical expended by the police had you been in one of those cars had you been pulled out have you been pulled into some sort of a hostage situation where they're trying to tell you you can't go to the bathroom without us like they did to the fucking president and he agreed to it you know this is madness I mean that's like people should go to jail for that well so okay that's kidnapping it's kidnapping I do think that the administration and certain faculty members have a lot of responsibility here so I think in some sense yes its literal kidnapping the students however I believe have become tools of something that they don't really understand tools of what though of their own making I mean is it an ideology and an ideology outside of the school they subscribe to or is it their own I mean what is it well I believe it is a a militant belief structure and I do think based on what we've seen on our campus it is emanating from a subset of the black population okay so I am NOT saying that this is black people doing this but I'm saying that the people who are at the forefront of it happened be in that part of the coalition of people of color and that they are advancing a set of assumptions and beliefs that they seem to imagine describe some future world that they would like to reach and it's a future world I mean it's preposterous it will never happen because what is the future world where the 400 years of oppression of black people in North America results in a a reversal of roles I think I mean I can't imagine having that thought and following it through and not realizing that this can't possibly be anything like a way forward I also see something that they've described this reversal of roles well they would like to come to this conclusion so I would imagine that your listeners having heard me just say what I said have to be wondering a little bit about me and where where my sympathies really lie but what I've seen and if and if your listeners go looking at the videos that came out of Evergreen over the last 10 days posted by the protesters I should point out yeah videos that they thought you had them look good they will find many instances in which the official order of things says well it said there's a 4 o'clock meeting on the Tuesday in which I was challenged in the morning 4 o'clock meeting that became very dangerous and the meeting began with an announcement that the chairs and the food were for people of color and that white people shouldn't use them yes I know the chairs in the food were only for people of color correct white people have to be hungry right you can't sit down right and I've also seen you know I don't remember where I saw it now I probably have a screenshot of it but I saw something where some activists put out a message a broadcast message that said a person of color needed a power adapter for a computer were there any white people who could fetch one or something like that oh Jesus I mean the thing is that it's preposterous but it is also putting in danger the actual vision of a world in which race ceases to provide advantage right so anyway it's jeopardy that it should be reversed it's just so crazy like we should oppress now like no there should be none right we should get past this right we should be anti supremacists 100% this idea I mean you imagine if there was a college in North America that suggested that white people only should eat and white people only should be able to take the seats is that what's gonna happen 300 years so what if black people oppressed for the next 300 then white people come back and say hey we're gonna have to turn this around again I mean isn't the idea that a hundred years from now white people are going to be a minority in America because the rates of birth with Latinos and black folks that will there won't be this minority group anymore that they will be in fact a majority all I can say is it's so obviously a wrong path just in terms of a it's not an honorable objective it's racist it's race it's absolutely racist and I mean it's not even it's not even difficult to see that it just simply is racist but if you say that on my campus at the moment you're the racist for not understanding why this is logic so how do people react when someone says a person of color needs a power adapter can a white person go fetch it are these white air-quote allies running these beta males and just running to go grab a white power adapter and give it to this person of color is that what's happening yeah that's the literal description of it Jesus Christ and then they have to in few years they're gonna have to go on to the workforce well and that's the thing that well this is a whole other side of the puzzle what this is really about and not just at Evergreen but this movement which has taken over so many campuses and shut down so many people who spoke with positions that were not somehow sanctioned is really a battle between two incompatible worldviews within the Academy so on the one hand you have the sciences and all of the things that function on the same assumptions that the sciences do about how you figure out what's true and then you have these postmodern disciplines which basically argue that the tools that the sciences claim are about figuring out what's true are actually tools of oppression themselves and so you know another video game rulers right yeah exactly so there's this video in the middle of the Tuesday the first Tuesday of these protests where the president barricaded with these protesters is talking to them and the protesters actually flat-out say in referring to my email that I mentioned the word phenotype and that that inherently tells you that I must be a racist to even be thinking about a scientific term in the context of this which I find horrifying because these very students stand to gain a tremendous amount they will be most powerful in the world in pursuing equity among other things they will be most powerful in the world if they are armed with a scientific toolkit with an analytical tool kit that allows them to to be forceful rather than to be preposterous what was the context to used the word phenotype again I forget oh I said that I would like us in my challenge to the new day of absence formulation I said I would like us to put phenotype aside right put phenotype aside meaning that I did not want us discussing equity as teams as different teams broken up by color and so the very fact that I said phenotype and that I suggested that I would be willing to give a lecture to anybody who wanted to come about what I understand to be the evolutionary context of racism and they did not want the lecture they assumed that if I said evolution and racism that I was going to give a eugenics lecture or something like that and so it's preposterous the the way the way this works is they've shut down the conversation before you can have it so that they don't actually know what you're going to say and therefore don't need to address it oh yeah it's quite frightening well it's it's bizarre because it's it's primarily occurring in universities it's not happening really in high schools very much it sort of bubbles up in high schools it appears by people that I talked to the been in high school and gone into universities that you see echoes of it you see the beginnings and then when it gets to college you're away from your parents you're in some new place you they everyone gathers in groups they dig their heels in the sand and they go fucking crazy well I mean there is something about college yeah and you know and we all did show them stuff in college but I also think there's a hidden reason for it being colleges which is that there is real inequity in civilization that needs to be dealt with I would say the thing that I find most troubling is the skew in policing and in the courts that results in disproportionate fractions of some populations being incarcerated which has terrifically destabilizing impact on this community so I think that that is a very real harm that would be hard to overstate and that absolutely has to be addressed just just to even make any claim on being a fair society that said it is very hard to attack the the private prison complex for example right it's a it's a difficult challenge on the other hand the universities are a soft target they can't defend themselves and they already have sympathies in the direction of you know a few of a radically different enhanced world so in effect I think we're being challenged on the basis that the inequities on our campuses are completely intolerable and that that is largely a fiction and that what really is happening is that this is displaced anger over a system that is fair that's been pointed at something that can't defend itself that's fascinating so this is a reaction to the actual real inequities of the outside world the systemic racism places like Baltimore and what we're finding out about places where they literally would not sell homes to black people communities that have just had generation after generation of impoverished people that are fighting off crime-ridden neighborhoods right or water you can drink right has right in right exactly so what the universities what what's happening in the universities is a sort of a misguided reaction to all the real inequity in the world it said not missguided it's misdirect misdirect you just pointed it the wrong thing and the reason it's pointed at the colleges and universities is that they simply can't defend themselves hmm that's fascinating and so this is occurring in universities all over the country and at a rate that's according to people that I know that teach pretty unprecedented that this wasn't the case twenty years ago that you would have dissent you would have debate you'd have discussion but you wouldn't have these full-blown ideological mobs yeah I think the thing is it hadn't been operationalized yet the thought process that led to this was post-modernism has been has been around for decades and so there were places you could go if you wanted to have an absurd discussion you could go for example to cultural anthropology cultural anthropology was captured by post-modernism thirty years ago and so if you wanted to hear people say really crazy things about what's true cultural anthropology was a place you could do it if you stepped next door to physical anthropology it was just fine and so anyway that's been in the university and what's happened is it has been how would one put it has been operationalized or activated so that it is now it is now it forms the core of a vision that college students are trying to bring about not all of them but enough of them that you can't run a college without either deciding to capitulate or figuring out how you're gonna fight back what was there a way that this could have been stopped or nipped in the bud in the years past or zero way that this could have been sort of planned for was there a lack of lack of foresight yeah this is exactly it's what I was talking about a few minutes ago if you if you give in to the bully the bully comes back stronger we've been given into the postmodern bully for decades and it's now come back in a form that nobody knows what to do with it so what was the original reason to give in when it was a more mild argument well because it was an abstraction hmm so originally the idea that that certain that based on their history certain people who had been for example largely shut out of the sciences were entitled to think without having to deal with the structures that had been built around let's say men and most mostly white men over the course of Western scientific history so the idea that women maybe needed a place to discuss what was true that was not structured by men I get that and in fact there's a very good example in my own field where the difference between the way men and women I don't mean every man in every woman but the difference on average I think played a decisive and very positive role when Louis Leakey empowered three women to go study the three great apes in order to figure out what's going on with them and so Jane Goodall figured out what was going on with the chimps because she was because she was female and because she didn't subscribe to the rules that men had written down about how you study these creatures and so it is a case where something about the way men look at the world had prevented people like George shalour who had made his mark studying lions he didn't do so well with gorillas so anyway jane goodall's female approach worked and it it is largely the reason that we understand chimps today on the other hand Jane Goodall took the scientific toolkit and threw out the rules that had been biased rather than rejecting the scientific toolkit which is what the post moderns are doing which i think is just tragic what we should be doing is arming everybody who goes to college and frankly we should be arming everybody who can't go to college with a scientific tool kit that lets them figure out what's true especially now because science is the ultimate bullshit detector and you know this era is you know hopefully this was peak bullshit but they need the ultimate bullshit detector it does seem like peak bullshit right and it seems like that that's one of the reasons why it's so important for you to stand your ground is that you you are you're being very clear in what what you perceive this situation to be and you're doing it in a very logical and a very rational well-thought-out and and clearly structured way you're showing everyone what's wrong with this it is a scientific approach you were literally using the very tools that you're trying to empower these young children young children feel like they are yeah these kids because they kid young folks yeah youthful exuberant human beings Millennials yeah I'm Millennials what I hate those words I hate those generational terms but you're you're literally using you're dealing with a dilemma and you're using the very tools that you would like them to learn from this university and take forth into the world I mean it is a very scientific approach you're you're saying like well then no this is not that's not racism and this is racism and what you're doing here is actually racism right and in fact you know the irony is so my students and really my students many of them are both my students and my wife's students we both teach evolutionary biology and students bounce back and forth between our programs so you know we have people in our community who are empowered by having an understanding of how things function evolutionarily that gives them a window into all sorts of things including you know human social dynamics and other things that affect us all all the time so anyway yes there there is a way of thinking about virtually any of the issues that most people care about using scientific rationality which does not mean that you put aside your humanity but it means that you give your humanity a tool to understand what is going on before you figure out how you feel about it and whether something ought to be done how does this university survive this how does the community survive this how do these students come out of this with a new understanding of what went wrong and in some way that allows them to save face and still be a viable part of the community that is a beautiful question thank you for asking it I really hope it works I got three things and I'm afraid I'm going to forget one of them but first of all there's one clear first step the president of the college has to step down and there are two reasons he has to step down one this is how things work I don't like how you moving your hands without talking I'm sorry Joe micro is that better so he's got to step down because a when something has gone as crazy as we've seen things go on evergreens campus there is an expectation that somebody will take responsibility so he has to he has to step down to signal to the world that somebody's taking responsibility but in this case he also absolutely must step down because this is his responsibility he set this in motion and he made this happen and so it is not an injustice at all that he should have to step down and I frankly am flabbergasted that it hasn't happened yet I do not understand how the Board of Trustees could allow him to maintain that position as long as he has but first thing is he has to step down at the point he steps down that's going to flip a switch suddenly the question is okay what now the next thing that would have to happen is the Faculty of my college would have to evidence that they actually got something out of this rather than feeling that they had been wrongly portrayed in the media or something like that if the faculty and there are many good faculty who do understand what's going on so they have been quiet because frankly they're afraid of what happens to them if they're not but but George has to step down or be fired and the faculty have to rally and evidence that they learn something and then the third thing and in some ways this is the one that is I think the toughest they came after me they came after two other people the Chief of Police of our police force Stacy Brown who they have been at empty as a utterly professional extremely good police officer who is also an evergreen graduate and interested in cleaning up policing she wants feet she's aware of what bad policing isn't what this is campus please connect us police we so it's independent of the the region right which is why they were stood down guys they are part of the administration is as control over them but the chief of police was demonized and I mean in the most disgusting ways posters of her wearing a KKK outfit in some sort of I don't know what sexed-up garb was distributed on they this is a mother of three right and what was what was the logic behind it well no I hate to say it but the logic I think was the saying that circulates all cops are bad so she was literally her her swearing-in was protested so at the very moment she took the job she was already persona non grata they want no police line in fact they advocated for that there was in the middle of this protest there was a something like a police community review but I'm not sure exactly what it's called but there was some sort of a gathering where suggestions about better policing were advanced and the protesters actually advanced not only the idea that the police be moved off campus that they be disarmed but that in fact that campus policing be turned over to what they call community policing so at the very same moment that you have protesters as judge jury and executioner searching cars for people stalking them they're telling us that actually they want official control over the policing of the campus it couldn't it couldn't be more ironic well so how do they plan to handle sexual assault violence any anything along those lines funny you mention sexual assault because the third which in addition to me and the chief of police was is our grievance officer our grievance officer and the Seibert is a also an excellent human being who is very dedicated to her job and very dedicated evergreen and has been there for a very long time and one of the things that she's been accused of is not being sensitive to allegations of sexual assault now what she has not said in her own defense she is so interested in protecting the college from its own worst instincts that what she has not said in her own defense is that she runs a summer camp for girls who have been sexually assaulted this is and I think she funds it out of her own pocket so in all three cases in my case I'm accused of being a racist in Stacy Brown the police chief's case she's accused of being a brutal biased cop and an anti Siebert's case she's accused of being insensitive to people who have been assaulted in all three cases not only are these things wrong they are the opposite of right and so glow I was just gonna say the third thing that I wanted to say was George has to step down the faculty has to wake up and then everybody needs to take a look at the fact that three four three they've gone after people in classic witch hunting style and the person in question was the exact opposite of what they were saying at the point you discover that you've been hunting witches and then it turns out the people in question are innocent you have to step back and ask yourself how you got there how did that happen to you that you ended up hunting innocent people that should be a wake-up call for everybody involved well as soon as you start talking about searching for cars and searching for individuals my mind immediately escalates to violence that's that's how my mind goes when I I know mobs and I know people and I'm I just have far too much experience with violence and I know what happens when people ramp up ideas without a real predetermined goal they don't have like what we'd like to do is get Brett and talk to him one-on-one and mate what's I want to invite him to have a debate a one-on-one debate with someone without an audience so they could sit down hash out these ideas oh hey you're working with something well how do we find them well maybe he's in one of these cars like that that's not what they're doing right right no they go we're gonna find him but they don't have a step after they're gonna find you and they do and it might be fucking barbaric I mean it might be you know we're gonna kidnap him we're gonna we're gonna force him to read this letter you know I mean what even throb early hostage shit I agree and I do think you know I don't I don't know I'm not an expert on what happens when mobs ultimately do something you know like I think it's ma sha Khan who was killed by by a mob over suppose it blasphemy guess last month but was that in Turkey I thought it was in Pakistan it wasn't in Turkey okay but oh all right I'm sorry I should that's all right but that's a different but in any case world and different it's a different world but nonetheless the point is a mob a mob thinks that it's on the right track and it's so convinced of what it believes that it ends up doing something that it doesn't know it's capable of there's also a diffusion of responsibility in a large group they're allowed to do much more horrific things you would ever do one-on-one to an individual 100% no I don't think that anyone intends that but I'm not sure that they ever do well the ramping up of things is what terrifies me I just seen it too many times where people get together in large groups of people and things escalate and no one knows why and then all of a sudden it's chaos and there's a literal feeling in the air that violence could erupt and I don't know if there's maybe you would be able to tell me is there some evolutionary echo of that from back in the day when we would get invaded by large groups of people we had to switch over immediately to some sort of a warlike mindset I don't know what it is but there's something really bizarre that happens to people in large groups and if you've ever been in a concert where a riot breaks out or a stampede where things go crazy it's scary it's terrifying well you're absolutely right about the evolutionary roots that these are programs that exist in us for circumstances and one of the things you know if I had been able to give the lecture that I proposed in the letter that got me in so much trouble with people one of the things that I would say is that the most dangerous thing is that we have these latent programs that are waiting for evidence that it is the moment to do X Y or Z and because we haven't been in those circumstances until the moment those programs are triggered we don't even we're not even aware that human beings are capable of some of the things they're capable of so we have to guard against these things at all costs if we really you know never again is a very important concept and if never again is to mean anything we have to understand why it happens in the first place so that we can repair the world so it becomes impossible yes instead of giving into the influence of these ancient programs understanding they're there and recognizing them when they go live exactly in fact maybe the thing that would be worth remembering is what happens to a drowning person when a person drowns they're very dangerous right because they their body switches on a drowning program that basically looks for anything that can be pushed down so you can get up to where the air is yeah which means that somebody can drown you know their closest kin by accident because a drowning program that they've never seen active until the first time they face drowning is suddenly online right and so that's a simple one but there are other ones too there are ones for for tyranny and I I believe things like genocide where populations that have successfully eliminated other populations have done well and so knowing that human beings are actually wired for genocide under some circumstances is well it's a sobering responsibility but it's also hopeful to me because if you know that it's there you can figure out what triggers it and you can I think we can rule it out by raising people in an environment where awareness of that program allows us to teach them in such a way that that program is deactivated and it might be the only way to be you you must be aware of the fact that there is a potential to disassociate and decide that this is the this group of people is the other and that they are not you and you could do horrific things to them and that this is a literally a part of how human beings evolved to 2017 how we got through all the horrific things that have taken place in the past and if you think about the the religious innovations that have occurred in the history of most of the populations on earth today they involve a recognition at some point where the definition of self gets broadened to a larger group so if you think about for example the Golden Rule the Golden Rule has has progenitors in the Hillel tradition but it is basically somebody saying that some large entity needs to be treated as some extension of self and really this may sound funny to people but if we are to survive the next century as a species it's going to have to be through the recognition that actually all human beings are trapped on one tiny little planet and we're in severe jeopardy and really we have to start treating each other not as other because we will you know we will be fighting each other as the whole experiment goes to hell we have to recognize that we actually face a common enemy which is the unintended consequences of the system we've built I never like to bring up Ronald Reagan as the voice of reason but he had a fantastic quote way back in the day in one of his speeches during the Cold War where he was talking about how we would bond together if we were approached by some alien life-form from another planet that threatened us how we would all realize that we are we are all in this together I had no idea that he said that it was a great speech because the conspiracy theorist went crazy you know like there's aliens man well III think this is totally right and here's the here's the the even better part I think which is yeah if there was an alien race that came to invade the earth we'd rally if there was an asteroid that we had enough time to know that it was coming and that we would have to rally together to do something about it we'd do something about it and so it is perfectly possible for the mechanisms that evolution built into us to fight each other that caused us to cooperate to fight other groups to be retargeted had things that aren't other groups that are problems and so what frustrates me more than I think anything else is right now we do face a common enemy and that common enemy is you know let's say climate change would be one facet of it but it's the system that set climate change in motion which is also given us nuclear reactors that are unstable and difficult to control it's given us economic policies that are going to cause us to destabilize as a result of the concentration of well being and power and a small number of hands those are common enemies and if we allowed the circuitry that is in us to be triggered that allows us to fight a common enemy actually we would be quite United at the moment and for a good cause which is one of the more disturbing things about Trump pulling out of the Paris climate agreement is that what what it says is that we're not in this together I mean even more so than it says that these guys are I mean he has advisors in this EPA guy is a very dangerous character that's a climate change denier and there's so much anti science going on this administration you could you wouldn't even know where to begin right but one of the real problems is that we're moving away from this group of people is trying to figure out what to do about emissions what do we do about all this garbage what do we do about all this waste it's not even necessarily just about climate change it's about sustainability it's about what are we doing with the byproduct of civilization if there's one thing that should cut across political lines it's that question yes do we do about the things that jeopardize us all together if it's one thing that should disturb us about capitalism the number one thing is putting profit ahead of the environment that we literally need to sustain life and that's something they're trying to do with bringing back fucking coal coal of all things and they have these coal miners on TV and they don't even agree with it they have that they interviewed a bunch of coal miners today that were President Trump supporters that were happy they voted for Trump because he's gonna bring back Kol and they're like well I don't know about this why is he stepping away from the climate change thing though like even people in the coal mining industry are torn on this I mean this is a very dark time in that way very dark and you know and ironic too because I mean we're now behind the eight-ball because we've put this off for so long we should have started doing this 25 or 30 years ago but even now it is actually not as hard as people think to figure out how the world might function that didn't create this jeopardy as a matter of byproducts of everyday activity it's actually not that difficult but the system is built to frustrate it so you know in the same sense if you step back from the last presidential election and you think about how is it that we ended up with two such lousy candidates for this position with such power some something in the system has to be off that we don't end up with any viable candidates for that office and it's the same it's the same problem we are we are caught in loops that prevent proper solution making it's not that solution making isn't possible it's that solution making is not some place we can go from here because of mundane reasons in our system that are ultimately going to kill us if we're not careful well it's also such a complicated structure there outside of completely radical change like restructuring everything from the bottom up but tearing it down literally to the foundation and rebuilding it how else you gonna fix this thing with lobbyists and special interest groups and congressmen a representative government it's like there's so many different areas that allow for the possibility of corruption and an influence and just cronyism it's just it's such a dark and twisted corridor that you enter into if you consider any kind of reform well it can't be reformed and it's not going we can't tear it down either I mean well what we do well that's an interesting question and I must say it's something that a number of friends of mine and I have been working on for some time there are answers which five seven years ago I wouldn't have thought possible that I now believe actually are possible and so what we're really talking about we can't have revolution we can't afford it nor will it work the power arrayed against revolution is so immense that it's inconceivable that it could it could function we also can't afford a disruption massive enough to cause the system to restructure on its own if for no other reason than the fact that we've got more than 400 nuclear reactors on earth today that require constant inputs of power or they melt down and spill not only the contents of the reactors but the contents of the spent fuel pools where we've stored decade's worth of spent material so basically we have to restructure the system without letting it collapse and without confronting it in the traditional way so we need effectively revolutionary change without revolution however notice that your life today doesn't look all that much like your life 30 years ago from the point of view of how you go about things how you navigate around the world things sweep across civilization in a market system based on utility and that model can also be used to replace the system that we have currently so in essence if you think forward what is what is the world going to look like 20 years from now it's very hard to know because you know how much change has come in the last 20 years so there will be revolutionary change at the moment it will be dictated by a market and it will basically give us more of what we think we want rather than what we actually need however the same mechanism that causes technologies to sweep across civilization can be utilized to have meaningful change in the way we interrelate with each other and the way we govern ourselves sweep across civilization so that's the project that we've been working on behind the scenes so what is the project look how does it work well it involves different people with different expertise and there are those who are expert in the technological aspects in other words identifying those technologies that actually stand a good chance of replacing the dangerous stuff that runs civilization now there are those of us who are involved in the game theoretic aspects of what it is that keeps the current system stabilized as it is and what would have to change in order to replace it so anyway it's it's a complicated effort but it is not I'm hopeful in a way that I wasn't back during occupy let's say because I no longer think that the only route forward is one of the traditional modes that we've seen so do you think it's gonna be a slow integration of technology into people's lives to the point where it's going to affect the system itself to the point where the current system the way it works just won't operate the way it does no not really what are you saying specifically what I'm saying specifically is that people have been shut out of the gains of civilization and they have been fed a small portion of the phony growth that our system generates to placate them they've also been threatened with austerity which is largely a false threat in other words they've been told yes we could do something different but you're gonna have to give up most of the things that you value so how about it and in fact the world could be a very exciting place to transform if we were to recognize the real landscape that we face rather than the story that has been portrayed that has told us that we really don't have any good options it seems that there there is still time though frankly the clock is ticking so what would be the steps that would be taken in order to make this a reality well I'm the question is do I want to say that out loud here where the entities that want to oppose it know exactly what it is before it comes I don't know how how smart that is what I will say is that there are a good number of us working on the puzzle we're serious about it and we are the things that would typically be used to dismiss us ought not be we're not looking to to be the head of some system that enriches us we're looking to make the planet function in a way that serves everyone so do you think there's some sort of conspiracy to stop this like if you actually bring it up you think that there would actually be people that would make or take active measures in order to hold it off at the past I don't think it's exactly like that I think there is a structure that has emerged that exists administration's come and go but there's a structure that doesn't and it seems to have a central principle behind it which is it doesn't like change that it can't control changes one thing change happens but it's not interested in change that could upend it so anyway it the reason that we end up with a battle between you know a non-viable Republican and a non-viable Democrat is that they have passed a test in which they do not threaten the fundamental structures underneath in fact Trump may actually be a violation of that he may actually threaten those structures and they may be trying to figure out what to do about him but but in general what we have is a system that filters on the way towards the levers of power such that anybody who gets there wouldn't use them in a destabilizing fashion which is why we saw the DNC conspire against Bernie Sanders absolutely we saw them conspire in the most direct terms and then we've seen them in court defend it by saying they had every right to do it rather than denying it yeah so anyway I'm not you know it's too easy to say conspiracy and it is too it's too simplistic because it implies that people got together in a room and said things out loud and that does happen sometimes but it also happens through another mechanism a mechanism of but scientifically we would call emergence where those structures that frustrate change out-compete structures that allow change so it may be that what we have are forces that resist change reflexively without knowing what they're doing the same way you know a tree grows toward the light without knowing what it's doing oh okay don't you think though that there'd be some benefit to discussing these potential solutions to these issues out loud and then people would sort of like pick it up and act on it especially given this enormous platform I do so it's not that I don't want to talk about the might I mean in fact we've we held a what was called an unconference in Palo Alto several months ago so it's not that we don't talk about them out loud what I'm concerned about is that a I'm only one of the people involved and so you know I have my area of expertise in in this group but there are many others or areas of expertise that I can't speak to as directly so anyway I'm concerned about unearthing the thing in a place where it will be a cartoon version of something that's actually more sophisticated than that I understand I'm not I'm not averse to to answering questions have you got him what would be the first step well the first step would probably involve a blockchain currency that had strengths connected to it that made it competitively superior to something like the dollar in other words the dollar is a flawed entity in multiple regards but the dollar depends on our valuing it and the thing about blockchain currencies is that blockchain currencies can be exchanged between entities that have an agreement about preferring them so for example a group of people could decide to pay each other in in blockchain currency of some kind based on ideals that are not the same ones on which you know our nation for example is founded so you could agree to a higher set of standards for something and agree to prefer each other in the context of business so you would you would do business with those who also agreed to the same higher set of principles and that currency could therefore displace something like the dollar well it'd be fascinating to see I mean I know that Bitcoin and blockchain at a lot a lot of these different crypto currencies are gaining momentum and in fact Bitcoin weren't we just talking about this is higher now that it has been like literally in years ever ever yeah so there's some momentum in that regard to be nice to see them used side by side you know to see if it could be possible that it could gain more momentum to get to the point where it's right now you bring up I'm gonna buy some with Bitcoin people think you're a freak right like my friend and Andreas Antonopoulos who's big in the Bitcoin movement I've had him on the podcast a few times he's written books on it and he does everything in bitcoins paid in Bitcoin he buys his airline tickets in Bitcoin pays his rent in Bitcoin I mean he's he's deep but it's maybe what is one of the thousand people in the world that might do that right although you know everything transformative starts in a small minority of people doing it somewhere so what I would say is that the cryptocurrency isn't enough in and of itself you have to couple it with the structures that are capable of solving the other problems of civilization right so someone figuring out what to do with nuclear waste that would be a nice one that's a biggie right that's a biggie and it's high on my list of of let's say fears is that those nuclear reactors are so dangerous by virtue of what it is that keeps them stable day in and day out yeah that really if people understood the danger they face based on on those reactors and the spent fuel that they they have people would be alarmed well if people just paid attention to Fukushima I mean just look at what's happening and know how many of those there are and here's the other issue you know I've talked to people before and there's this I mean it's it's it's really funny how when you subscribe to a certain ideology whether it's a liberal ideology or whether it's conservative ideology you immediately immediately adopt a series of beliefs that go along with that and one of them on the right is that nuclear power is clean energy you know and my argument to that has always been we've only had it for sixty years and look how many places you can't even go anymore I mean Fukushima Chernobyl what is it Three Mile Island give my allowing I don't know three rounds if can you go there now I wouldn't go there it'd be the best of those three but we also have the WIPP project in Mexico yeah they're the number of places on earth you can just simply no longer go is growing and it's places in Nevada where they just bury the waste where they just bury the waste Hanford just had a huge collapse so let's put it this way we now know how dangerous this technology is and we also know that what we were told when it was invented I mean everything we were told we were told electricity too cheap to meter for one thing we were also told we'll figure out what to do with the waste no I'm no and not true not true and here's what's really terrifying I mean every now and then we you know they're diggin in Mexico City and they find some ancient Aztec ruins and they have to stop construction because they didn't know was there what the fuck happens if 100 years from now they dig into the Nevada desert and just tap right into a chamber of spent fuel rods and kill everybody well in fact that's one of the problems that they've tried to solve is how do you how do you make a sign yeah for people you know a thousand years in the future 100 years right we have no idea how you would warn them off nor are these things stable I mean the thing about the WIPP project in New Mexico is that you know this was supposed to be stable for thousands of years and we had this explosion that leaked plutonium you know after decades the thing was not stable the way we were told it was and so anyway we have this terrible problem and what to do with the waste you've already got is obviously a huge issue not making more of it would be a really good idea yeah and there have been some solutions that someone there was a really young kid I believe that came out with some radical proposal for taking the nuclear waste and converting it into energy that could power cities for thousands of years whether or not it's viable you know but I mean it's totally possible I mean look if we couldn't come if someone can come up with nuclear energy in the first place the ability to split an atom and power a city maybe it is possible that someone could figure out what to do with that way some new sort of radical approach to looking at it but you can't just leave it no can just keep doing what we're doing over and over again and hope that we don't make more spots where you can't live well I mean the first thing is there is one thing we can do with it that's better that we already have the technology to do and there's no excuse for not doing it which is that all of the stuff that's sitting in pools that has to be actively cooled after something like five years it can be put in dry cask storage which ain't perfect but at least it doesn't require some system to actively keep it from boiling over and doesn't need electricity in order to cool it exactly the issue that happened in Fukushima and that's strictly a matter of money right we could do that tomorrow we could just require it and we should because it's vastly safer we could also potentially there are ways to take the spent fuel and to burn it down that does involve other kinds of reactors but ultimately ultimately I can't understand why we have not made an immense investment in fusion power were we to discover the ability to make viable fusion power which I believe we know is possible we not only would be able to power civilization without warming the climate but we would also be able to pull carbon out of the atmosphere if it turns out that we need to do that if you have effectively an unlimited source of power you can take carbon out of the atmosphere and you could turn it into building materials that were stable for thousands of years and the tiny amount that we spend on fusion research is inexplicable to me yeah we've gotten way away from the original subject but I think this is also important stuff but I wanted to talk to you about evolutionary biology all right and to being someone who teaches that and being as that's your discipline and seeing all of these I mean what is it like be a professor of being someone who's studying this stuff and then seeing all these weird traits and all these weird personality aspects demonstrate themselves in these times of crisis like seeing these these situations you're talking about people yes well that's an interesting question I have become fascinated I didn't start out studying people but the the longer I proceed in evolutionary biology the more interested I am in people and let's put it this way sometimes something is surprising but in general if you have the right tools to understand people at an evolutionary level things make a certain amount of sense they are I have something I say to students frequently which is if a situation is confusing with people very often it makes more sense if you turn the sound all the way down so you can't hear what they're actually saying because very often what's being enacted between people isn't really about the content of what they're saying it's about something else and so let's take for example my first project when I was an undergraduate I was studying with a very famous evolutionary biologist named Bob Traverse and I wrote a paper for for his class and it was about the Holocaust it was about the really I was testing the question at the time it was relatively commonplace to hear that Hitler was insane and something about that didn't ring true to me and I wanted to know evolutionarily speaking was he insane and in studying that question it became very clear that insane was the wrong description that he was a monster but he was a rational monster from the point of view of advancing German genes and that was a very troubling discovery to me that in effect what he was doing was I mean it's the worst thing imaginable but from the point of view of genes that are attempting to spread across the globe and exclude alternative genes from access to resources it was perfectly reasonable not only what he did to to Jews and homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses but the military plan the future of Germany lies in Russia the idea was that this was actually a sophisticated plan that would have advanced the cause of spreading German genes spectacularly had frankly so many million Russians not been ready to give their lives to turn the German war machine around so what I'm saying this this has to be dealt with carefully because people hear you say that and they think that you're justifying it but you know I'm of course a Jew you know whose ancestors were from Europe there's there's no part of me that isn't any any way okay with what happened quite the opposite but understanding that even though the Darwinism that Hitler was deploying was deformed and not not accurate and defensible in a logical sense the plan he was advancing was German genes attempting to take over a larger fraction of the the resources the planet Earth has to offer than they had available to them at that point in the 30s so anyway what I'm trying to say is that there's something that we we often teach students first when we get to them which is called the naturalistic fallacy it means that just because something is true doesn't mean it's good that it ought to be true and so discovering the nature of something like the Holocaust is very important in the sense that it allows you to grapple with it logically but as you're grappling with it logically people want to imagine that you're saying it was okay and that's the opposite there are many things that are true for evolutionary reasons that are completely unacceptable and understanding what those things are gives you a pretty good shot at preventing them from from unfolding it is it also really is a problem when something becomes taboo to even consider or to look at like you you you you can't look at the idea that he wasn't insane and that he was in fact rational in rationalizing his horrific acts and that there was some sort of a plan to it all and you would say that even by enacting that plan you would be insane in terms of how you think of the world and I think of the world like if we found out that Jamie over here was thinking about starting a master race and killing everybody off we would go Jamie's gone insane I mean that's like the and to say no he's not insane he has a rational plan yeah like immediately people would want justify any horrific thing they could say about you yeah just to be clear that Jamie is not doing there okay I'm good guy fair enough like sports how to take over he's into yeah but but having taboo subjects or having things you cannot consider even if you're clearly not a racist person even if you're clearly not a person who advocates genocide the the idea that intellectual discussions cannot be pursued about specific topics well the first thing if you're gonna go into evolutionary biology especially if you're gonna get anywhere near human beings you have to really put aside the idea of taboo and invite actual space you have to be able to consider everything because so much of the story is you know it goes from bizarre to horrifying you know there's also great beauty I mean one of the important things to remember is that the evolutionary the adaptive process the adaptive evolutionary process gave us not only our worst characteristics our tendency to to war and to genocide into oppression but it gave us our best characteristics to our capacity to love to empathize to be compassionate to sacrifice for others so all of those things are evolutionary products and you know the the message I try to convey to people when I talk about this is that we have to pick and choose which of the evolutionary prod products we want to honor and preserve and which of them we wish to bar from the landscape and this was really what civilization is about civilization is about taking the whole spectrum of things that we're capable of and providing a landscape for the ones that are honorable and good and making the ones that aren't honorable and good so expensive that nobody would that are engaging in them now when you're in the middle of this crazy scenario that you find yourself in and you what you know what you know about evolutionary biology and about the the mechanisms behind human behavior and how do you how do you get back to work well I'm lucky in that the freedom that evergreen offers me to teach what I want how I want you can teach outside of the school well I mean you'd be surprised my contract doesn't even mention biology I can teach what I want so you could teach like football scores I could teach dance I mean I really I mean I'm not a good dancer so I can't but but I could teach pottery doesn't matter um now what so what that means from my perspective is that I'm able to take the stuff I'm intellectually interested in and I'm able to make it my teaching life as well and that has worked beautifully I've really had a great time bringing students in on what I think is the cutting edge of evolutionary theory and many of them have rallied so you know it's a lot like having graduate students who are deeply interested in the same material and are able to play ball because you know they they take on the toolkit they learn to use it and so anyway my intellectual life is quite rich and it it involves undergraduate students which is a pretty unusual pretty unusual thing but it does work pretty well um how do you get back to work at your school though oh is that what you're asking yeah I mean how does does that even happen that's a tough question you said you you were confronted with the very real possibility that your days at Evergreen might be over well there's a practical question I don't think they can fire me because I haven't done anything wrong right so that means I can go back to work in the fall and I don't have another plan on the other hand you're saying in the fall because you'reyou're your school how much longer does the semester have well mice you had in June or July I unfortunately have a conference that I have to I mean it's not unfortunate I have it but I have a conference that unfortunately interfaces with the end of the quarter such that I had to wrap my program up early and I met with my program for the last time yesterday after the campus at close we met in the park again and maybe in the park well we weren't safe to be on campus so we started doing that as an alternative how many students I I'm supposed to have 25 I have 32 so who are the extra ones people who beg to get into the program and I couldn't turn them away Oh sweetie so now you meet in the park are you worried that someone's gonna find out where your meaning and you won't be safe there you know I mean I I don't go anywhere without thinking about it so yes I'm concerned about that so it's really gotten that that crazy in your mind that you you have to worry if you're going to the supermarket or you have to worry if you're I never know what I'm going to encounter and you know I'm not a big warrior on that front I'm more or less feel like if I encounter somebody they're probably going to be upset and especially if there aren't a large number of them actually I could probably talk to them and get somewhere on the other hand given what people think is true about me and what they think the rules are with respect to what they are therefore entitled to do I don't know I really don't know what could happen Wow well what what can be done or what should be done about some of the I don't want to use the term crazy but some of the more rambunctious students that are a part of this I mean there it doesn't seem like they're going to just change their behavior and go back to just being a normal inquisitive young person trying to figure out the world it's like they're so embroiled in this ideology it seems and they've given them so much ground it's like how do you stop this and when you when you've held the fucking president hostage and told him he can't go to the bathroom without representatives of your militant group watching and P where does it go from there well I should say I what I said five ten minutes ago probably sounded a little utopian I'm not a utopian I'm quite I think utopia might be the worst idea humans ever had so what I'm saying should be in worst cost well I mean the Holocaust was utopian I guess it was right that was the idea so so yes that I think that but most people think of utopian it's like some moment in time where we all sort of like what are we doing let's work together let's all be nice right well people I mean you know utopian ideas of utopia yes well they very impractical ideas they think they a they think they know enough about the way things work to describe a good state for things to to reach and they tend to focus on one thing that they want to make better and ignore all of the harms that will come if they engage in it so anyway I'm not I'm not a utopian and what I'm about to say about what could happen at Evergreen is not utopian in nature but I do think evergreen was as you described earlier is really the tip of something what happened at Evergreen is so extreme and the way it looks to the world is so preposterous that I do think I do hope that that the Academy is hitting bottom that in seeing this little preview of where these things go if they are allowed to to evolve their own accord that people will wake up and they will realize actually as hard as it is to challenge this stuff we have to do it because if we don't this is what happens now that said on our campus if if we get rid of a few bad actors starting with the president and we recognize that we have ended up in some new landscape where up is down it is also possible that we could find we could find a new kind of common ground so do you think you could find a new common ground with these students that are screaming in the streets hey hey ho ho these racist teachers have got to go I know this is gonna sound crazy and some people are not going to understand why when you know my family and students have been threatened I would I would even talk like this and to be honest I understand why they would say that but but the difference is can you talk to him in a small group of people where they could be reached because in indeed many of them are reachable or do you have to talk to the entire mob in which case yes it's absolutely impossible isn't it also a problem in that when people dig their heels into the sand and they decide that this is how things are and then even when confronted with the possibility they may have been incorrect or wrong or acted irrationally it's very difficult for people to admit that and reconcile and step back and maybe just self assess somebody has to blaze the trail in other words I find myself accidentally in the position of blazing a particular trail of how do you stare down a an accusation of racism so someone from that side has to blaze a trail somebody from I realize hey Brett is the opposite of racist we're being silly here we all have a common enemy in the common enemy is real racism ah good and I mean this is why I said recognizing that you have been involved in a witch-hunt that's the moment at which you know you you either level up or you don't when you realize you've been engaged in a witch-hunt that's the moment at which you can discover there's something fundamental that's wrong in my program somewhere that allowed that to happen maybe that would be a subject that someone could teach as a course you know like how campus ideology goes amuck absolutely how things go mock I mean in fact it's not exactly that and it was planned long before this protest erupted but I'm scheduled next spring to teach with another professor a program on essentially the evolutionary origins of human violence Wow so when when you think about everything coming do you have like a vision in your mind about how everything would sort of the dust will settle and this president hopefully will either resign or be forced out and then what do you do with these students that you looked at in the end they were screaming at you calling you a racist telling you to resign like how do you deal with that when you go back to school well I mean if they were willing to listen I could deal with it I the the thing that is I think hard to appreciate from the outside a little bit is that because I know that there's nothing to the accusation and because so many students know that there's nothing to the accusation it doesn't hurt in the same way that it would if I had serious doubts about myself in this regard so if they were to come around you know we we could make it happen that said that's not the direction things are going as of this morning the the internal list of the the faculty and staff was headed in exactly the wrong direction what is the list like what are they were they trying to do well they imagine that this entire catastrophe including the closing of the campus yesterday and today is the result of the I think it was six minutes I spent on Tucker Carlson yeah you got on Fox News you summoned the demon I mean those airwaves are immoral yeah yeah so have they literally said that that you should have not have gone on Fox News oh that's beyond that their point is this here we go every Green State faculty demand punishment of white professor who refused to leave on an anti white day oh it's anti white day that's even more interesting yeah Wow came out today it might have came out since we started the podcast to I'm not sure when this hit was it the college fix calm yeah I mean this is describing what's in the letter at the contents of the letter right here I've been tweeted it a few times for me we acknowledge that all of us have power within the institution who have power within the institution share responsibility for the racist actions of others furthermore there's those of us who are white bear particularly large share of that responsibility Oh God we acknowledge that we have a great deal of work to do in order to honor and live up to the demands made by the student leaders though the students are leaders oh yeah they're leaders like how in Yale the students that stare down the professor and physically threatened him they were they were actually they were given awards what they wasn't one of them like given some sort of an acknowledgment of like being a leader some will find that Jaime will find that but we acknowledge we have a great deal of work to do in order to honor and live up to the demands made by the student leaders doing last week's protests we acknowledge that students of color and others who are underrepresented and underserved have been voicing their demands to us for some time through the students of color focus groups of 2014 through their participation and anchoring the strategic equity plan for November in Cooper Point Journal and blah blah blah and we have not yet truly listened and acted we acknowledge the students right to protest and affirm president Bridges recent decision not to use the misguided language of the current student contact what is that on current Student Conduct code to punish the the protesters what is the language of the current Student Conduct code a hell if I know but B I believe what they're talking about as the president said that that students would not be held accountable for disrupting my class and then I believe he agreed to their demand for student authority over any changes to the conduct code so these students who are engaged in this I hope this is right I don't want to say something as I'm sure but my understanding was that he agreed to that demand we v mentally reject the claim the students have been violent simply because they have been loud and emphatic there is a difference between exercising the right to freely voice an opinion and in citing violence and that difference has nothing to do with the volume or forcefulness that's not true because they were they were upset that he was moving his hands calling that aggression and now they're saying that on the other hand children can scream I'm calling children from now on we support the demands made by students and honor the positive institutional change they have already achieved through their protest that's hilarious our most urgent demands below Center on the safety of those individuals who are currently most at risk at the same time mean like the professor at the same time we acknowledge that in weeks and months to come our attention will need to turn to the larger structural issues students have identified in solidarity with students we commit ourselves to participating actively and self critically in the annual mandatory trainings specified in the Memorandum of Understanding recently signed by the UF was UFE Statler that's our Union United faculty member and management bargaining teams holding each other accountable when we act in racist ways against our colleagues or our students okay well then why don't you hold yourself accountable that you acquiesced to a fucking anti white day that's racist right but but what's going to happen here is there this is going to be intolerable reeducation by people who frankly I pains me to say it but they're the most racist people on the campus I mean that's what this is this racism it just happens to be in an unfamiliar direction but it's racism and they also are going to be in charge of a sensitivity training here which to me is the height of insanity so scroll up a little bit in solidarity with students we call for the Evergreen this way administration to Center student perspectives and a persistent media approach was comple good approach to the counter that all trite narratives that are demonizing evergreen okay do you have an alt right movement at Evergreen if I read that correctly I am now in the alt right oh you're not writer I guess so are demonizing evergreen and day of absences specifically Wow assistant media approach what is the precision that you going on cut tucker carlson adds that must be it yeah so we have to break this down like it's code like we're not even speaking english we're reading fucking hieroglyphs here persistent media approach persistent media oh yeah am i alright i might be you are now i might be people think I am because I've had alright people on these to saw or but then conveniently when I have liberals on I'm a fucking raging liberal god damn it take seriously the threats made to the individual community members Oh aren't you an individual community my drink you're about to get to me here mmm use available institutional resources to protect them demonstrate accountability by pursuing a disciplinary investigation against Brett Weinstein who according to guidelines in the social contract contact contract rather and faculty handbook Weinstein has endangered faculty staffs and students making them targets of white supremacist backlash by promulgating misinformation in public emails on national television in news outlets and on social media that is a very very broad you should sue that's a hell of a bullet point huh you should sue just for that yeah you have endangered faculty staff and students but see the problem with that statement is someone can just read that now and and and use that as a quote and just start saying that as if it's fact well let let's just let's just deal with this for a second please okay so that is a very interesting bullet point the fact is I have gone on media media has come to me what I have done is I have pointed to videos that the protesters themselves put up that cause the world to say what the hell is going on in Evergreen and this is resulted the entire thing has unfolded I've been fighting this for a year trying to point out to my colleagues that they were making terrible errors this is all the result of reforms put in motion by President bridges so they are now blaming me and I should say I do think there is jeopardy on the campus had a threat yesterday from somebody have no idea how serious it was but I do believe that there's jeopardy to people on our campus what specifically was a threat it was it a threat from a white supremacist group was a threat from a pro protester group like it wasn't specific but so what I all I can say is that I got what I was told was a transcript of the call I cannot vouch for it because I don't have access to you know somebody could be promulgating a hoax I don't know but what it said was that they were coming to campus I think with a magnum and they were gonna kill as many as they could is what they said they do we could play the audio okay let's hear it yes I'm on my way to Evergreen University now with a 44 Magnum I'm gonna execute as many people on that campus if I can get a hold of you have that what's going on there you communist scumbag town I had a murder as many people on that campus as I could sir just keep your just keep your eyes open okay first of all hey that guy's full of shit bees an amateur right because 44 Magnum holds six rounds mostly maybe five might even be five rounds or is that a desert eagle that guy's a bullshit artist 44 Magnum you don't specify the round are you gonna use or does that weapon make any sense but yeah but nonetheless the point is he's Dirty Harry he thinks so Yeah right but you know III don't want to belittle people's jeopardy I have to say that might have been crazy and he might have actually been really wanting to do that and he could have done right and it could happen um I I think the Jeopardy to people on campus is real and I live right adjacent to campus and I must tell you I brought my family with me because I don't feel that they are safe there at the moment the question is how is it that we have reached the point of deciding that this jeopardy is from me well that's horrific what they've done is so irresponsible in releasing that and making a public it's so irresponsible and and and so so so silly that they don't realize that other people gonna see through that so clearly well many information and like what misinformation what specifically they should be very specific when they accuse you of misinformation they should be very specific if they're going so far as to say that you are and somehow or another summoning the alt-right and making misinformation public on mass media what is that misinformation well I know because I've been watching the the email traffic right so their claim is that white people were not asked to leave campus that there were only 200 spaces in the venue off campus and therefore this was just supposed to be for a small subset of people which is nonsense there were only 200 spaces if you wanted to go to the particular seminars that they were holding for example the one about why Asians were part of the problem so they had a seminar on Asians being a problem or a presentation of some kind that is really racist I believe so but in any case they are conflating the 200 spaces off campus with what was actually expected of us and it was quite clear in fact one of my staff colleagues put out an email boy time has gone into some weird thing but I think it was last night in which he detailed the several emails that we had seen in which the school did ask white people to leave for that day so they are there promoting falsehoods themselves designed to obscure what's going on I think because they finally understood that the world doesn't get what they were doing well do they not understand that this is a trail that's going to be released like that this is actual data and that this data when they accuse you of misinformation and then you have all this data and then you could just like release it to everybody like hey this is the actual emails clearly this contradicts what you're saying it makes you a liar right several people in fact many people have now started to fer - what's going on in the staff/faculty zone here as a cult and I think you know on the one hand that could be tongue-in-cheek on the other hand the mechanisms at work that have people doubling down on absurdities rather than trying to get on the right side of history as quickly as possible it is very cult-like and again you know the you asked me what would have to happen for us to - right the ship the second one is that my faculty colleagues have to wake up to the fact that their belief structure is has become bizarre and unrecognizable from any normal position and very dangerous in the perspective of an educator if this is what an educated person who has gone through the entire system and now has a job in educating young people if this is how you view the world and this is how you view facts and this is how you distort them and then disseminate them to the rest of these like-minded folks in this very bizarre echo chamber that's being rejected like almost universally outside of the the college I mean it's not just Fox News it's rejecting it's the Washington Post it's the New York Times they people are freaking out about your situation and recognize very clearly and very rightly that you are absolutely not a racist right and this is the the in this is kind of a lot of what I've said to Jordan Peterson when I had him on they fucked with the wrong person again they fucked with the wrong person and this is one of the most horrific things about what I find so troubling about what I think of as I used to think of myself as a progressive but what I prop what I have a problem with all of this is that the left is attacking itself now it's like it's it's there's no one who's progressive enough no one like every single thing you do is a microaggression every single thing you do is based on white privilege and therefore you're racist and unless you somehow or another give up all your money and give up all your jobs and there are people who are asking to do that too by the way cuz people asking people to give their money and put them in black banks and give them to black people I mean we're going crazy that this is this is literally it's not an individual psychosis but it's a collective psychosis that we're watching and I believe that in literal terms we are watching a kind of group insanity is this a problem with language is in some ways is this this is a problem with influence and charisma and people's ability to sort of change the way others view the world with dramatic interpretations of events and and things like emails where this is not a one-on-one debate there's a real problem with blogs and emails and I've talked about this several times but it's it's worth repeating there's a real problem when someone writes something like that specifically about another person like you and just writes it but you're not there to respond so they can write as much stuff that's not true and they can put it all down and then it's there and then someone has to refute it but it's still there so you don't even get to refute the actual document you write your own and then someone has to go and read that at a different location it's a real weird way to distribute information and it's contrary to the way human beings rationally discuss and debate ideas well I would say there are many rules that are written into the way we interact now that make it possible for this to happen so there was a instance where a faculty member accused those that were challenging any of these equity proposals as being part of a racist backlash and she was clearly talking about me because I'm the most the most prominent person objects as a faculty member a white person no so anyway she says in a faculty meeting that this is a racist backlash and I said to her in front of this faculty meeting I said somebody might want to check on the question of whether or not I'm actually a racist because if you do check on it you will discover I'm not and if you don't this is going to blow up on you and the chair of the faculty told me that the faculty meeting was not the place to defend myself against accusations of racism I said to her that's fine we're so not the place to lovely yeah right to level the accusations but I said where is the place and then the faculty member who had made the accusations said you should not expect there to be a venue in which to defend yourself you should just get used to these accusations in a separate case I was doing it who said that why Cairo that's the same faculty member who made the accusation wait a minute the person said that you should just accept these untrue accusations yes yeah I mean was your reaction to that that this is not a place for you to defend yourself against racist accusations this is a place for you to just eat shit right you just have to accept these out you said on a separate occasion we were also told that that to question an allegation of racism is racist oh so convenient yeah I'm trying to wrap behind around that one to question an accusation of racism is racist we have an obligation to believe I know I know wait a minute how that is crazy that is like that is such stupid back-ass words thinking it you know it's it's what the cult mentality sounds like inside it doesn't understand that when you say that to an outsider you know it simply doesn't add up or it's creating a structure that makes it impossible to defend yourself because these accusations are so preposterous that they realize that they have to have some sort of a bizarro world structure absolutely oh my god so is this person teach they teach media so they tell Roenick right they teach media they are currently running a program where she's teaching students to make documentaries and that program one of the students in the program filed a public records request since we are a public college you can request the emails of faculty and staff if you want them and so she had a student file a public records request from my email to make a documentary in her program so you've got one faculty member searching and other faculties members email through a student looking for evidence of I don't know what but evidence of racism well presumably yeah god yes what little half of a sentence she's going to cut out a contest with a few words I mean in fact if you can separate my letters from each other and reorganize them I could have said all kinds of things well I think you should have a student asked for the emails that came from her I bet they'd be wonderful they could be very interesting oh I bet they wonderful if she's telling you that you shouldn't have a venue to defend yourself and you should just accept the fact that you're gonna be called a race that the idea that she can call you a racist in a meeting but you defending yourself against racism is not it's not the place for that it's not the place for and in fact this whole exchange took place with the president of the college and the Provost sitting there and what is silently silently didn't say a word he move his hands that's a really good question I don't remember him moving his hands I do remember him not releasing an email after that meeting saying that in fact on accusations of racism without evidence will not be tolerated yeah well that's a pretty goddamn important I already got damn important and you just can't just there's there certain hot topics that you just got to leave alone when someone levels an accusation this is the this is the current progressive mindset the current like PC gone awry mindset yeah it's fucking crazy crazy we're all even we're all human that's it I don't give a shit where you're from I don't care if you're from your ancestors are from one part of the planet or right next door it does not matter it's who you are and as soon as you try to gain some sort of leverage position because of the fact that you think that you have suffered more oppression in your family's ancestral history we're we're way off track we're way off track the the track should be equality today that should be where we're all on this and as soon as someone says you're a racist but you can't defend yourself well then we don't have equality anymore man you're trying to have anti equality in order to bring equality to people that have been treated unethically is that what it is you're absolutely right it's structural inequity which is the irony of the whole thing is that people who were wrapped in the flag of equity I challenged them because I believe in actual equity and I was accused of being a racist for doing it well it also sounds like intellectual poverty - it's like the the the the actual structure of the thoughts that they're presenting are so poorly worded and so it's a it's so poorly thought-out and you're not allowed to defend against it well that's the that's what I was saying about the the difference in assumptions and beliefs between the postmodern disciplines and their I say the actual disciplines in the postmodern disciplines the illogic of those arguments doesn't matter because logic isn't a thing it's a tool of oppression ah well that's a cute way to just yeah throw a monkey wrench into the gears crank that's exactly what it is and what do they want to achieve out of this they just want to achieve all black professors and all white people on their knees as slaves I mean what is that was the ultimate goal you know just people running around fetching power adaptors yeah I mean I have to again I want to be really careful most most people of color most black people hold no truck with this right they they don't want this but a tiny number who do want this or maybe think they wanted until they see what it looks like are writing the narrative and that can't be they're going to undo they're going to undo the civil rights movement and that can't be allowed well not only that the real problem with any of this really crazy shit is that it gives fuel to actual racists and then it makes actual racists think that these people that are involved in these protests what as misguided as they are it makes them think that slave look we told you that these people are bad see look we told you that there's a reason why they're inferior and it just as soon as you as soon as you open the door to that like you have real problems yeah this plays right into the cartoonish fantasies of the absurd left that no the right believes in which is a tragedy it is a tragedy but I will say there's a there's a positive outgrowth of this I think which is if I look in my various inboxes that the stuff that's coming in from people that I've never heard of before this wake-up call is uniting people across every known fault line so I'm getting letters from religious people from very conservative people from very progressive people every known fault line is cut by this and people are they are galvanized by seeing something that doesn't fit any narrative they've seen before that is to say staring down an accusation like this is not common watching it stared down and the world not fall apart is is encouraging and then you know you mentioned it yourself to have the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times on the same page about this that's pretty interesting so I do hope that what emerges from this is that all of the coalition's that exists will look at themselves and will recognize that they have you know maybe not every coalition has a noble part but all of the ones that have a noble part will understand that it's paired with something that isn't noble and I'm hoping that people who find themselves ill-served by the narrative will join together and that basically you know a coalition of the reasonable might emerge well that's a beautiful hope and I share that hope with you I mean I really hope that what's happening is that in these insulated environments of these universities and colleges where things just get crazy that when word leaks out that they get crazy it's very much like cults when you hear about Jonestown you like a man don't drink the fucking kool-aid something's going on down there but these group mindsets that people fall into you know oftentimes when you're you and you're in the hive and you're in the middle of it it can all be very very confusing my hope is that as more people find out about the preposterous behavior that's going on these universities and colleges and how people are I mean these are young people that don't have a fully formed prefrontal cortex and are about to enter into the world and they're they're doing this with this ridiculous momentum of these silly ideas and there's people that want to enforce that more and more and that these people some of them are actually professors at the very college where this is going on I mean that to me is one of the weirder aspects of it one of the things that scares people a lot is the idea that these people are going to live in these insulated environments and then they're going to go and get their graduate degree and they're going to start teaching and they're gonna go right back with these same ideas in this insulated environment and never really go out into the world where the marketplace of ideas has roundly rejected a lot of these notions that they're trying to pass off through logic and debate an actual discourse not through shutting people down because of the color of their skin or lack of or you know excess amount of melanin I mean that's not that's not how human beings should be behaving in 2017 it's just not so when you see it so evident and so prominent and so so commonplace in universities and colleges there's so many people on the outside looking back looking in at this rather baffled and for the first time enraged mmm-hmm well I think what you just described is exactly how this happened the fact that the the critical race theory and the post modernist are you know third generation by now and so this has matured into a movement that wishes to reformulate the world according to what it thinks it understands but it's so confused about the nature of reality that that it's just it's hard to even describe how preposterous it looks as it as it tries to emerge because they go from being at the university to eventually teaching at that same university well there's going to be the same one but over a they come they come to maturity inside a field where these things sound reasonable and then they go on to teach them to students and so you know the intensity and absurdity grows with with each of those generations and I think had had they been exposed to the real world in the context of having to make sense in order to make a living which you know I'm not a big fan of capitalism but nonetheless just even having to interface with the world and make enough sense to get by would enforce a kind of mental discipline that is not evident here yeah mental discipline is a good way to describe it too I mean it just it seems like like the idea that not only should there not be 11 level playing field but you should force a playing field that's not level permanently not yeah it's it's crazy and obviously the world degrees or a good percentage of it it's not even I mean I'm sure there's some bias in who writes and who doesn't but I would actually imagine there'd be some pressure if you were really angry with me out in the world to write to me and I don't know I must have a thousand highly supportive emails all kinds of emails from amazing interesting people all over the world now and a few angry emails and I think I don't know if it's three or four angry emails and two of them come from inside the the college yeah I'm sure some of them must be some of the professors that realize that this is a fucking sinking ship that's on fire like you can't keep doing like this is not gonna end well you can't double down that's what they keep doing well they keep double down what what so what happens now like what what how do you just wait for the dust to settle do you I don't know I'm this has never happened to you before so that's a very unique moment in your life completely I mean you I'm 48 so your whole life well essentially we should be careful there they've actually been a number nothing like this has ever happened this is the intensity of this the national nature of it is all completely unprecedented and it's pushing both me and my wife to our absolute limit of what we can do just even fielding all of the stuff that is coming across our desks and all that said there is a precedent when I was in a freshman and in college and I you know I've I've had battles inside of my field and so what I would say is that when when one has deep principles and one acts based on those principles irrespective of the I guess what would be called optics you find yourself the one against the many repeatedly just by virtue of the way the world works and so this is without precedent in terms of the magnitude of it but it's not the first time that I've found that just simply proceeding from principles that I'm pretty sure our right based on careful work has resulted in something boiling over in some amazing fashion have you explored the possibility of teaching outside of a university or college structure have you explored the possibility of using new media whether it's a online video audio text and in terms of like publishing things and maybe having a patreon page or something along those lines well I would love to do it actually because at the moment you know the the college has been a great place to do this because of the unusual teaching model but it's becoming less fun I mean even if I wasn't at the center of this firestorm the the rules that are being instituted and the you know diversity sensitivity training that's coming in all of those what is that what do they make you do well they haven't you need to learn how to not be racist right so they have to assume that you have these issues in the first place right so they first of all why would they ever hire you if they thought that you were discriminatory and then second look what is going to be done has it ever been proven ever that you can change people through compulsory or compulsory remapping of their brain and anti-racist some sort of a what is it like it's like a two-day seminar thing like something like that well the thing is none of this makes any sense because let's say this let's say that all white people pick up racism from their environment developmentally they can't help help it so we know you're a racist okay well if we know you're a racist then what's the remedy okay the remedy is going to be some sort of sensitivity training well but if sensitivity training works then how do you know I haven't already had experiences that have done this for me how do you know right right so the whole thing is illogical and frankly I think it's punitive I think I think the real purpose is we would like to lecture you and yeah so like that in answer to your question about how I considered working outside the college system I've considered it the real question is how to operationalize it so that I don't strand my family because evergreen provides a very high quality of life we live well you know you know beautiful setting but doesn't pay well so we haven't accumulated the resources where I can just cut the umbilical cord and go take this stuff to a different audience so I would love to find a different way to do it I wasn't there way to do it in the meanwhile like you don't have to leave one to do the other well that's certainly true and I wouldn't I wouldn't be averse to starting something like that while teaching at Evergreen I really hope you do because I think you have some really interesting ideas and you're a very smart guy and obviously your heart your mind is in the right place and it seems like before all this boiled over with this new president things were going the way you would enjoy them going this individualized attention the the freedom to teach anything you want I mean it sounds wonderful in the hands of the right person you seem to be the right person is beautiful no I just feel like the whole idea of going to a place and learning I mean it's it sound like a great idea when that was how it had to be done but it doesn't take into account the wonderful Internet that we all have I mean the ability that you have now with this platform with the amount of attention that's on you right now to launch something is really you're never gonna have anything like this ever again your life hopefully yeah from your mouth to God's ear you know yeah okay well I'll take that as a piece of advice this is the moment to launch such a thing listen do it I'll help you I'll promote it I'll tweet it I'll put it on Instagram I'll put it on Facebook I'll let people know Wow thank you yeah it's just I think that's the future I think the future is people educating anybody like anybody who wants it whether you're you know here or there or do you don't have to be in a specific location and and I think that maybe a lot of this can be overcome if we don't have these these groups of people that like live in these echo chambers and constantly circulate in these same groups that reinforce these opinions and and and experience all this confirmation bias that makes them believe that this is this is all correct and the rest of the world is just misinformed and don't understand but clearly by that email that's it's a big problem as the staff itself yeah I don't want to say the staff it's whoever the administration and some faculty they're crazy they're crazy calling you all right or saying this is alright in that you're racist and misinformation I mean that is that's slander I mean it really is yeah well it's slander it's a it's also I think it's just worth pointing out kind of funny yeah I mean they should have something to back those claims up those are just empty claims they're beyond empty claims I mean you know I'm a Bernie Sanders voter if I'm all right I mean where are they yeah talk across entrada say you were Hillary supporter you know man it just have you thought about contacting an attorney I am getting offers and people are contacting me saying I should you should as long as they keep that guy's president you should definitely contact an attorney and if they're gonna put shit like that on the Internet because for every person like me who reads it and goes this is nonsense there's going to be a possibility of someone reading it and go oh that Bret Weinstein guy's a racist oh that Bret Weinstein guys alright oh he uses misinformation and in in the media and he's actively sought out this attention and he's doing this to damage the relationship of the schools he's doing this out of spite because he was called out for being a racist and we have this professor who says he's a racist and she said it to his face and he didn't defend himself I mean all that kind of shit that's how it boils over ya know I mean it's clearly it's clearly justified and they won't listen to anything else I've tried everything else so maybe that's just simply the answer I really hope you do something alternative I really do because I think if someone like you who has this unprecedented platform where you you have been launched into the public eye because so many people are outraged about this and I know you were on my friend Dave Rubin show and and you know I'm sure there's gonna be a thousand other requests after people hear this as well people people don't want this to be the case anymore and they want to do whatever they can to stop that and they also want to support people that are brilliant people like yourself that have wonderful ideas that we would like our kids to learn if they do go to college somewhere we'd like people to be educated and you these unique facets of the world and and and have a platform where you could teach evolutionary biology and and onion hindered unshackled by this fucking nonsense that you're dealing with our bridge yeah well it's a great idea and you know I don't know it may be that the unity university system is so encrusted with this stuff at this point that it it can't be freed that's what Jordan Peterson thinks talk to quite a few other professors to think that as well GAD sod he believes it as well it believes like there's just a certain amount of time left in this system where it's just it's so caked up then maybe the only way to deal with this to abandon it well then and then then we would have to reformulate it yes which would be you know unlike civilization the university system could be formulated we could start with a fresh sheet of paper and it's probably very dangerous to not have a university since you can't not have it right have to it's that it's the way we figure out what's true right and there's got to be a way to save it while cutting out all these cancerous aspects of it or started afresh you know we could leave the carcass to the postmodernist and build something that works outside where we don't have to let them in and then there'll be a whole group of people just talk about what a piece of shit you are that's locked in some classroom somewhere demonstrating all the different terrible things that you've done bring horrible things upon the college it's just boy it's such a strange world you're in right now it is really it's it's almost more dreamlike than dreams are are you sleeping that's a good question usually I sleep pretty well this one I mean partly it's just the number of hours trying to field everything means I go to bed late and then you know by the time the Sun comes up the question of how much more stuff is accumulated so less than I might I don't I guess the thing is I'm worried about what's going on I'm worried about the danger to my family that gets in the road of sleep I I know that what I'm doing makes sense even if my colleagues don't understand that so I'm not getting enough sleep that's for sure but I'm also not ripped apart by doubt it's like I've done nothing wrong so you don't have that blanket of guilt like why did I do that what could I have done differently right you know you're not you're not Kathy Griffin right now no it's so I just I really hope this works out well for you and I'll be paying attention every step of the way and if and my offer is real if you need some help if you decide to put something together and you need some help promoting it I'd be more than happy to and I'm sure there's been a lot of people listening to this that would love to hear your ideas on things great well thank you so much thanks man thanks for coming in here all right yeah me too that's it folks we're done for today we'll see you next week bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
