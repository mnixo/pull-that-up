good 4 3 2 1 boom and we're live Brian Redman I feeling buddy I'm doing great in here hungry all right sore but I love you this new studio it's so amazing it's crazy how much stuff you're gonna have in here it's gonna be badass yeah we're working on it we're making it happen before we do this I have to apologize I have to apologize for something I said last week last Tuesday in passing we were watching a Corey Feldman clip and Corey Feldman was doing this crazy dance and Greg Fitzsimmons was in and Corey Feldman had some little tight jacket on it's just weird song he was singing and I said that jacket was wearing that jacket when he was young and he got diddled it's I was trying to make Greg laugh right you're trying to say fucked up things to make comedians laugh which is what we do we get together we say the most heinous shit but I felt terrible after somebody pointed it out like I didn't even remember saying it someone pointed out and then Saturday I watched it and I felt so terrible because the clip especially like out of context like it's just me laughing about him getting diddled right and it just it's horrible anything that's taken out of context like that's gonna make you feel weird if you don't see though yes but there's no excuse like what it is it was you swing at a lot of pitches when you're doing live podcasts and sometimes you hit yourself in the dick with the bat and that's what I did it was it was totally wrong it wasn't it wasn't funny I took a swing it was the wrong thing to do was what the best way to describe it is it was thoughtless cuz I did really didn't think I was just trying to say something fucked up to make Greg laughs I wasn't thinking like this is a real person and I've watched him the other day and a movie man I saw him in gremlins I was watching gremlins with my kids yeah after actually did we did the podcast before I watched the clip though cuz I didn't I hadn't seen you know I'd do it and I'm with it but I didn't think about it I said you know first of all he was doing the Michael Jackson thing you know he wears a Michael Jackson jack and he danced like Michael Jack he didn't he said Michael Jackson didn't even do anything to him so it didn't even make sense it was just a stupid line to say but I felt terrible I couldn't sleep Saturday night I felt really bad I felt really bad I felt bad for a bunch of reasons one I felt bad because it's a mean thing to say and I didn't I didn't mean it to be even though it was it's just I was just trying to be funny you know Patrice O'Neal said something once when he was defending Opie and Anthony he was saying when someone said something really funny or the same person says something really fucked up it all comes from the same place like they're trying to do the same thing they just miss you know but that was without a doubt the worst miss the most embarrassing to me the most depressing the most what's the best way to describe it just so disappointed that I did that because he's a he was a kid you know I don't even think he actually got molested I think he was actually saying that Corey Haim got molested and he didn't well that would make sense why Corey Haim did so much drugs you know if he did get molested but well I started looking into this shit more and more recently like Hollywood molestation with children it's it's no joke man like just as it's no joke with sexual harassment and assault with women when you see this Harvey Weinstein thing and these other directors now are getting in trouble for the same thing the same kind of shit happened to a lot of kids that were involved in in these child movies you don't think about that when you're just trying to crack a joke and I just want everybody know if if you were disappointed there's no if you were disappointed me there's no way you were more disappointed in me than I'm disappointed in me I didn't sleep Saturday I had a hard time sleeping last night I felt bad about it all day I felt terrible and I went to Underwood farms you know where underware farms is mm-hmm it's a great family time had a good time with the kids you know we're picking out pumpkins and doing all this stuff but the entire time I was there there's like this blanket of like how did I say that why did I say that like sometimes you'll say something fucked up and then after you did it like you can't believe you said it like especially when we're doing this live right if you and me were just out at a diner we would probably say that and laugh to each other because no one's getting hurt by it we're just making each other laugh and we do that all the time right we say hard shit to each other all the time but when other people hear it and then the guy here is it like if Cory heard it like that's it's just wrong you know I didn't mean to have that impact and I didn't think about it it was very thoughtless so I was extremely disappointed myself but what's interesting about it trying to like look at it from a different perspective trying to like examine it like the feeling of doing something that you shouldn't have done that might have hurt someone's feelings because you were senseless and thoughtless that feeling is a terrible feeling and it's it's weird like it overcomes your whole day like I don't think anybody knew because I was still having fun with the family and everybody was laughing we did a lot of kid stuff but at the end of the day that was with me all day I mean it was just it was like a fucking wet blanket that I was carrying with me like a depression blanket and there's no there's no other way to put it then you know that I'm sorry and then I shouldn't have done it but what I was thinking while it was all happening was like this feeling of letting a bunch of people down and hurting someone's feeling do something in a mass way like on the Internet this is a new feeling like before you could people could be upset at you maybe someone you know or people you work with and it's a bad feeling but this is a different kind of bad feeling it's an intensified bad feeling especially like the way I did it because it's so stupid and I would think that at this age I'm 50 I would see I've done saying stupid shit obviously I'm not you know I'm not done like that's the fucked-up thing about me a person it requires constant diligence like you have to constantly pay attention to your thinking you have to constantly pay attention to the way you behave and who you are you can't just go off the cuff and the other thing it's making me think of you know doing this sober October thing and obviously I love pot and I've always loved pot and I've been a regular pot smoker for 20 years but what there is a difference in my personality when I'm not smoking pot grumpy more more tense less kind and I have to like catch myself before you know I get upset about things whereas when I'm high or if I some even an iPhone not if I'm if I'm not even if I'm high but if I'm just smoking on a regular basis I'm Way more mellow way more relaxed about things and way more I guess the right word is humble it's not like I'm cocky when I'm sober but I'm like really aware much more aware of gratitude and fortunate like I'm lucky and appreciative my friends want to hug people more like pot has a lot of for me from my fucked up brain has a lot of really positive effects there's a lot of really positive personality effects but I think I might be downplaying my dependence on it like I think I might have been going like that's nothing I'll just fucking quit pot it's nothing man I don't know about all that my dreams here's another thing you remember him dude don't just remember them they're fucking crazy they're all wolves and bears and drowning and falling off buildings and and fucking lava coming at you it's all primal shit wow it's weird man I'm having all these these predator dreams it's it's very strange like I had these dreams he's these carts almost cartoon wolves had these giant feet and they were like running through the woods and I'm somehow another trying to get away from them I had a dream that I was for some reason I was crawling through some fucking cave and there was an enormous bear inside this cave and it was looking at me and I was like I gotta get the fuck out of here and it was like trying to figure out not the bear was gonna come after me but I mean super vivid I don't I don't remember my dreams when I was getting hot unless I took the alpha brain before I went to sleep that that will fucking spark you up some crazy lucid dreams but other than that I would just sleep good I never had a problem sleeping I'd get up in the morning and I'd be fine but there is a there's a big difference between me when I'm using pot and me when I'm not using pot noticing the same thing with Ari knows re always gets a little more intense about things a little more upset about things he's fucking gets really mad at people on comments he fucking fights with people online he's like super intense I mean have you switched Ernie - have you done anything more since you've done this like are you drinking more coffee every day or you know - well I'm doing so much goddamn yoga because we have this hot yoga challenge and the hot yoga challenge is you have to 15 in a month well my dumb ass did one the first week and - the second week so yeah so I've been on a rampage where I've done eight straight days of yoga in a row as of today Wow yeah and I have four more to go so that's a week yeah black Ford to do though I mean I have until next Tuesday so I could kill it on Thanksgiving the 31st could be my last one but I'm not gonna do that I'm banging them all out this week we're doing it together for the first time Ari Tom bert and i we're doing together i don't want to say we're i don't want to say when because I don't want you fucking freak showing up but we're gonna do it together one day this week you also that's what Tom's biggest problem is it's just he's so busy trying to fit in you you you kind of do a 90 minute hot you know which I thought was insane because they've never done it right right ninety minutes it's a long time I do it every week but I usually only do it once or twice a week and now I've done eight fucking days in a row as of today it's rough I'm shredded and shredded my Bobby I'm burning off so many fucking calories I actually had blood work done today so I'm very interested to see what my mineral levels are like because I'm wedding out so much and I'm not really supplementing minerals that much I might have to do that I do that on a regular basis till like every three months I get blood work done to see like where my nutrient levels are and I just I just found this company I don't know if you've heard it I think it's called like simply well and it's like they have all these DNA tests that you can do so I ordered the testosterone test but they also have allergy tests they've all these tests and they send it to you like spit no bio take some hair or some like that and then it's kind of like 24 and me where it's like the DNA testing but they have it for everything vitamin D deficiencies and and you could have it like on a subscription where you get it done every they send you a new kit every three months to see if it's changed yes that's what I got it just got it yesterday so do get off this Corey Feldman thing just the end of the day I just want to say that that I'm sorry and if I disappointed anybody I'm sorry too I just when you you know comedians try to say fucked up things to each other and I was talking to Colin Quinn about this the other night Colin was at the Comedy Store shit and I told Colin I were talking I go man I missed tough crowd he goes oh I miss it so much he goes but you know what we could never fucking do it today he goes because think of the things that Patrice and Nick DiPaolo would say to each other he's like if you did that today people would have riots they would be protesting they would try to have to have the show shut down Comedy Central will freak out people get fired I was like you're probably right but that was like the best show ever on comedy sets of the Chappelle show no next to South Park okay South Park number one Chappelle showed number two tough crowd number three yeah in my opinion and South Park still going for it they don't give a fuck they had this new video game it's called butthole fractured bundle fractured but it's a there's like a part where you're like these little boys and you're dressed up as strippers and you're in a strip club getting lapped you're doing lap dances for guys so you're on the guys junk and rude it's okay so anyway these moments were you fuck up these terrible feelings like this is how I'm looking at I wish I could take it back but I can't right there's nothing you could do and if people are mad at me now because of that you're right you know I don't I'm not trying to make any excuses for myself I shouldn't said it but when you do have these moments where you fuck up and you feel terrible there are an amazing opportunity to grow you know and I think people need to look at stuff like that this way or at least I've been looking at stuff this way for the last like 10 years or so and it's made a big impact in my life because I think regular change happens in like a you know regular change in growth happens in like a grinding slow sort of progress or progression but when you when something fucked up happens when you do something fucked up and you get that terrible feeling you have this opportunity for these leaps of understanding and these bad feelings that happen they're just it's a big alarm to let you know and one of the things that I was thinking about is that human beings now the way we interact with each other like this is there's a lot of pressure now on people a Kazaa let's call out culture you know people are getting mad that people are doing dumb shit like white girls wearing braids you know cultural appropriation they're going after you know white guys wearing dreadlocks and people are mad that people are dressing up like geishas and they're calling them out there there's a lot of silliness to all this shit but what's interesting about it is everyone is expressing their displeasure and pleasure of things their expression their anger with things and their happiness with things at a level we've never seen before and I think people that experience this like if it makes sense it's one thing if somebody gets mad at you for something like you know you shouldn't be wearing that blue hat man you know I'm in the the Crips and you know we oh we only support red hats or is it the Bloods I don't even know I think the Bloods the Crips are blue right yeah if somebody gets mad at you for something it doesn't make any sense that's stupid but if someone gets mad at you for poking fun at someone being molested that that bad feeling is valid right and I think these bad feelings that like Donald Trump must feel 24/7 like there's probably I mean pardon I think part of the reason why he's so angry at people and bitter and barking at fake news I think he feels like shit all day long cuz you know this guy checks his Twitter you know he does check he reads his company he said fucking egomaniac right so he's paying attention to new shows the talk shit about him he's paying attention to late-night comedians that make jokes about him he's paying attention Saturday Night Live he can't help himself he's constantly commenting on it and he hears all these people laughing at him and mocking him and he's all these people that think he's a terrible person like I read his Twitter when he'll put up a comment he'll put up something on Twitter and then I'll read the comments under it it's like holy shit people just go hard at him you know that motherfucker reads that stuff you know he does and he's also involved in a lawsuit several lawsuits now where he's blocked people on Twitter and they're questioning the constitutionality of someone being able to block someone from commenting whether the President of the United States I mean this is a new way to communicate you don't want to hear what people have to say because it's negative well that's you know we're not we're so people are questioning this in court but I think that that feeling that's hitting this guy he might be too old for it and he might not be ready for it and his he so he's got so many things wrong with him to begin with you know with his the way he treats the world and his ego and the way he's the the non presidential and non statesman like behavior that people thought was cute when he was running for office and now all I see is a giant problem when he's threatening war with nuclear weapons with Korean shit like that but this thing is a new thing is this this swarm of bad feeling and in return good feeling when something good happens is a new thing and I think that it's gonna shape the way human beings interact with each other in a really radical way because I don't think it's ever existed like this before it hasn't really and if you if you look at it is if it's a good thing or a bad thing like I I forget what I was listening the other day where when you were a kid you used to just go outside say bye mom and then come back at night you know when it's time for dinner eat dinner then you go play some video games go to bed now it's like the communication between your mom and stuff like that is so much more intense constant its constant all day long it's like if you're not there you're getting texted by your daughter or son and it's like a constant communication where it's more parenting so that's good to FaceTime with people yeah yeah I mean remember when we were a kid that was some Jetson shit yeah Hagrid George Jetson you do it on your phone I do a phone call I was talking about on my phone the other day time like I'm doing Dick Tracy right better than Dick Tracy yeah right Dick Tracy's was bullshit yeah answer my I was in the steam room the other day and my phone rose like I can answer it yeah actually has a cell phone honk I was at my door I was like just go in I'm not there but just go in the window and pop out the building make yourself comfortable come on in so my package coming it FedEx guy should be here soon take pictures you too I like brown and I like FedEx outfits cool - we don't fuck her out with dho guard disease last time DHL is like the RC Cola of delivery service Ecola like if someone said hey do you want to own RC Cola you'd be like yeah fuck yeah it's a lot of money but you know it ain't Pepsi there's got to be some people out there that are like huge RC Cola fans yeah that have like RC Cola t-shirts on shit there's got to be dicey called super underrated that diet right would it rudder all those obscure ones like Faygo like Moo tang oh yeah I see what's that badass root beer ID see that stuff is fucking fantastic yes bottom goddamn that stuff's good I wish that she wasn't bad for you cuz goddamn tastes delicious that is the best fucking root beer on the planet that I've experienced I've tried to not drink soda as much lately that's mine it like Arnold Palmer think honor poem or summary new thing like I go through so I like that's like an old person thing right Arnold Palmer I am I get it like it's so funny I get Arnold Palmer's now I drink them all day long it's like the living delicious yeah a little bit little lemon in there now let me ask you this because I don't think that I would have ever done this many yoga I know it have done this many yoga's and I know I wouldn't taking a month off weed and I know I would have taken a month off but the month Abu is not hard I mean the only thing I'm like went the other day to a Mexican restaurant and I wanted a margarita so bad you have to wear out they have these delicious there were ribeye tacos I was like oh that looks good they look fucking with habanero sauce on I'm like give me a fucking Margaery oh shit I can't have one I really hurt me you could have a fake margarita no I wanted a beer or two I wanted a beer in a margarita but that's not hard but I would have never done this I'm I'm gonna like take a week off or something like that I would never have taken a month off if we're not doing this challenge what would you do like what kind of challenge would you do well you hang in there and stick with it because a lot of people don't know but you lost like 70 pounds once over like a short amount of time crazy Brian broke up with his girlfriend fiancee yeah same thing anyway broke up and said you know what what am I gonna do with this right you got a picture of them all skinny look at that Jesus Jesus Christ Jesus I'm still not the guy on the left hook - 4325 - 163 Wow look how skinny waxing no or right hand side dude you you're a cute little bitch yeah look at look at the phone you're holding up that's my Envy bro dude look at that phone isn't that hilarious that back then that phone was the shit and if you had that now you would assume that you live in like assisted housing I still have that phone do you yeah it's it's in a box and storage text Isis with it yeah your burner phone but this so you you sold what did you lose how much is there - 45 - 163 Jesus Christ dude 82 Wow there's more than I thought I'd lost you that's Weight Watchers right there buddy so you did it at one point in time by the way what the fuck is going on with your underwear line like where is it it's like oh I did the dance of you did that's right above the pier that's the dick look at the picture of you holding up the old pants yeah that's crazy and that's and that wasn't even my biggest pants yeah that's crazy well okay what would it tell you well what would you be interested in doing what kind of challenge well my challenge there's a talk I've been talking to Hinchcliffe about this and a few other people because one of the biggest things for a lot of us is smoking and it's a cigarettes cigarettes and I've been trying to get like we had 911 last year it was supposed to be 911 we had a month notice all of us were supposed to click on 911 so we wouldn't forget that you said click but then I was the only one that did it I did for two days and then everyone else didn't do it in there all smoking when you're at the comments or all your friends are smoking around it's almost fucking impasto nice smokes a lot Tony smokes a lot a lot of people smoke a lot at the Comedy Store so my whole thing was like hey let's let's quit cigarettes and everyone seemed down on it then yesterday I was like hey are we still quitting next month cigarettes and that was it man so you guys were gonna do in November yeah yeah I was gonna try to quit and listen why don't why don't we set up a chat or at least when I get back from Columbus Ohio I would be there next month let's think of a challenge that you could do and who would you do it with you need like Tony and split for sure no sugar this is this is you for a month no sugar no booze no cigarettes you would lose fucking 30 pounds just doing that well with the without having cigarettes I'd probably gain weight because cigarettes actually like I think it's like your heartbeat and stuff like when you quit cigarettes you start munching more like on food you usually gain a lot of weight as an appetite suppressant breakfast yeah hmm I definitely need to lose weight but I also more importantly I want to quit cigarettes like I've the the drinking I I'm that's easy like I quit drinking the other day for like four days and I smoked why I mean I didn't shrink for four days I smoked weed though instead next day I had I was like why do I have a hangover it was a weed hangover like weed yeah I didn't even realize a when you first start smoking weed used to have these like the next day like man I smoke so much weed I feel like dumb or something like that the next morning I hadn't had it I've been wild because usually when I'm smoking I'm drinking so I always blamed it on the drinking like goddamn I feel like I'm hungover well I've never had a weed hangover I don't think you're gonna have one when you start smoke you're gonna be a so fucking high you're gonna smoke half a joint and be like oh you know legit I'm legitimately nervous about smoking pot again but here's my real concern I'm really wondering like what is going on where I am dreaming so much more vividly without pot and is that a bad thing that I'm not dreaming when I'm smoking pot like am i somehow or another doing some damage yeah I think so I think I think for sure that marijuana if you smoked a lot of marijuana that you don't have as good dreams what's causing the dreams another thing you might have you know THC in your fat and so you're getting THC you know still hmm you know burning off especially since you're doing yoga it's probably like you know it's probably still fucking with you a little I don't know maybe no but I mean we got high before most of the podcast with comedians I got high before most comedy shows so that's like three four nights a week at least now I take a day or two off and it was nothing super easy to do right it was never a problem but I never took a month off so when I would take a day or two off even if I go on vacation right if I went on vacation I would take a week off people people were mocking me relentlessly online before I told everybody that I was taking the month off and he started doing always pray for Joe people who was going Joe I don't in quotes I don't smoke weed on vacation Rogan like it's not a problem it's not a problem but it it was just like you know I'd be in Europe or something like that you know we can't get we don't bring it with you you don't wanna go to jail so just don't smoke weed it was no problem so I was like I don't need pot it's not an issue and I don't need obviously I've gone through this whole month but I'm really stunned at the differences in the way I'm dreaming like stunned like I never expected it to be so extreme so vivid every night I'm having fucking crazy dreams every night and they're almost all primal they're almost all like animals and waterfalls and fucking ocean lah it's all a lot of falling like a lot of like balancing on shit it's interesting weird I think I'm too busy I'm thinking that about that lately I think I'm too busy I think I do too much shit I never thought that before I never thought that but you would think that like smoke and pot would make you think you're too busy but not smoking pot it makes me think I'm too busy makes me think that you're probably thinking clear though in some ways you know your minds not fogged with like you know you're over thinking about music instead of like life you know yeah well food doesn't not taste as good tell you the food's way better when you're smoking weed is good music doesn't sounds good I think the key to it is using it occasionally I think that's the key I think marijuana like daily you Terence Mckenna talked about this many years ago and he was a he was a daily smoker and one of the things that he was saying he was doing some sort of a lecture and he was saying that the correct way to do marijuana is to not do it for a long time and then do as much as you can stand and then just fucking hold on oh and that's how he would do it he would do cannabis when he was doing it correctly when he wasn't like an inveterate daily smoker he would do it like a psychedelic he would do it in these big bursts where he would you know and he was recommending like that's the way to do it and that people think they know what cannabis is if they smoked cannabis on a regular basis you don't really know like the way to really know what it is is to take a lot of time off you know or obviously eat one of joeys edibles yeah I don't do it it was anymore that's one thing I quit completely I don't fuck with edibles at all I would like to see what happens to Joey if he took a week off oh my god month off Joey would be violent he would attack people yeah we took a month off of edibles or whatever right did you ever give it up for Lent I give it up for Lent dawg he's gonna be here Friday by the way folks oh yeah yeah but if he did take a month off I mean he didn't take a month off weed though I don't think it was smoking I think I was just eating it yeah he told me that once he told me was I can't do these fucking edibles anymore they're too much too much time fuck it up I'm taking too much it's messing me up next time I saw him next time I saw him he's down in stars of death literally the next time I saw him I go how much heat how many milligrams oz 125 throwing down to 125 milligrams stars of death like you are a monster you saw the episode where he passed out right he's like looking at life through like slits like he's like barely cracking the page of a book he's hilarious I was listening to his latest episode with Felicia Michaels who has a new movie that a man called pervs where we went to this like when those strip things where you put the money in and the curtain comes up and there's a woman naked masturbating well Felicia did this movie where she asked me to do its in North Hollywood deep in North Hollywood where you shouldn't go yeah it's so gross and this like curtain comes up there's all these cameras just this woman they're masturbating while asking me questions and it's so hard to answer when there's like somebody doing that you're like what kind of question like just like sex questions and stuff I don't remember because it was so long ago I forgot I even did it but Felicia was on the other day and listening to Lee on that like he's leaves never been to a strip club before it but his little voice when he chimes and he's like he's scared of them he said I want to take that guy to a stress why is he scared I don't he I don't know he I think it's a money thing because he says like geez don't eat it you pay the money then they try to get money out of you someone told us stories thing about Jeremiah Watkins trying to get took him to a strip club when he's freaked out and just like ran out the back I see the same kind of thing like he'd I don't know if he's ever been to one or doesn't want to go or yeah he and he looked at the ground and walked in the front never looking up all the way to the pack and half the pack - yeah I did I did get a day this is crazy I did a show with George Perez in Compton at a strip club in Compton and let me tell you man and that was one of the most eye-opening like that exists we walk in there's strippers like this stripper just came up to me and goes hey honey look at this pussy I swallow the babies you want to get it you want some of this like a baby mama like I don't know like still baby hands sticking out of them probably blue baby what you attractive no there was there was a few but then every time you talked to him you're like oh if I fuck up I'm dead you know like she was like ghetto yeah it was pretty crazy hostile yeah what about the clientele well they they were mostly there for us like they George just pretty much we had the whole club or ourselves if it was all people coming to see the show so it was in strippers too though and strippers - so was the idea that you would get people in there for the show and then the girls would dance for them afterwards yeah and while we're doing the show they were coming and sitting on table hey you and go get some butt sex upstairs it was it was it was full-on whatever you want pretty much place like but I scary I mean there's levels to everything right like the the levels of stress and pressure that a chick has to deal with if she's a stripper in a really bad neighborhood like that that's how diamonds get developed son to get help diamonds in a fluffy pillow you know you you're gonna get Diamond on a tempurpedic mattress fucking pressure serious serious pressure man like when you see one of the street hookers walking in the back it looks like that's where they all worked time when Bryan Callen met his ex-girlfriend walking the street yeah that's harsh that is that's when that's when you just go whoa what he was outside of the Coach and Horses on Sunset you know that place yeah we're stanhope used to love yeah that's closing hours but is it yeah yeah that was a good little joint I remember Ralphie may rest in peace we were supposed to meet Ralphie there and Ralphie showed up an hour later like what the fuck Ralphie look in the backseat and he had like 13 boxes those jalapeno poppers from jack-in-the-box oh my god had gone off on jalapeno poppers poor Ralphie when he he had his stomach stapled and when he had a stomach stapled for some reason he couldn't eat meat like this there's something about the operation they did it made him have a real issue with meat but he still loved to cook it so used to barbecue we went over his house once and he he's a fucking killer cook Ralphie makes guys some garlic you sauce baby big baby barbecue sauce I was his house and he cooked like this whole thing and got my boys eating meat at the time oh yeah he got his staples removed I mean he did himself just ate right through those staples yeah he had this idea that he was gonna lose all this weight and and and it did kind of work for like a couple days well the problem was he was so big that like if he said he lost weight like you're like okay how much you know he'd say you lost 100 pounds and you'd be like um about I believe yeah it's hard to tell you know it's like you couldn't but imagine like how strong his legs must have been oh they're the strongest feet in the business like that guy could probably kick through a fucking building you think about it like if he if he's carrying around 500 pounds imagine if I took you and I through 300 pounds of weights on your back you you're just walking around with 300 pounds everywhere you go I wouldn't be able to do it like I lift weights all the time and I wouldn't be able to do it I'd be like what the fuck man you'd walk everywhere Buster walls giving us kool-aid he had those calves you know those fat dude calves they did develop this month but if you could like look at the musculature in his legs I bet if you get through all the fat in his arms his arms like normal size arms but I bet he had some jacked fucking Lee Haney quads yeah I would imagine that's a tender meat down there like it's weird when you see people that have those big calves but they're always blue like that diabetes legs yeah that's super common though right yeah there's a homeless homeless guy by by my house that I just hangs out Starbucks and he hasn't so bad where it's blistered and every time he walks a little blood squirts often do rips down his leg it's the grossest thing ever ins homeless it yeah he's fat yeah he's huge and what's weird about Burbank is there was another guy that had like this big nose like it was a like he looked like it was some kind of weird sis nose where it's like the size of like a like a pineapple and he looked like Bernie Kosar whatever that old comic and branding codes are which Bernie the sports I'm Bernie the gold sports commentator like a hardcore zone no it's like huge though you're like the only guy who knows less about sports I mean but I all the people in Burbank always like hey we'll fix your nose like people are so nice like I'll pay for your nose to get fixed and you wouldn't ya bigger than that like imagine that nose times 100 what was the dude that was the Cubs guy a lisp no you just use like really big glasses and he just talked to real crazy Will Ferrell did a great impression like a hot dog hi I'm Harry Carey hmm yeah you would figure like homeless guy would be skinny I'd be like the ultimate diet no food a lot of walking well the only food they're eating probably is like fast food like you know fats butts so fucking cheap the other day Arby's has this new steak you should go to Venice Venice no I think it's a got burgers I think they have elk only in a couple places they have venison and a bunch of places yeah venison I had it yesterday it's like having a steak on a onto but but it was only $5 and it was great it was a real Elvis venison they they do these mass executions of deer in some places where they they have to eradicate these deer like to get a little too crazy I would imagine that's probably where they're getting some of their meat from yeah cuz it's longing for a limited time only in limited places well you can only hunt them for so long like if it's in during hunting season you're not allowed to sell it commercially like hunting meat like there's it you can buy farm raised deer they might have that but I think like I think it's illegal I'm pretty sure it's illegal to sell wild game like to actually sell it sell it I don't think you'd sell the meat but I have some for you I have elk jerky for you I have I have elk salami for you what was that one thing you made me with that one time oh that was a smoked ham that was wild boar yeah Wow pig shit wild pigs so and wild pig is very sustainable those little motherfuckers they breed like crazy you have you literally have to shoot them they have a big problem with them right now in San Jose I was just reading this thing about San Jose like San Jose is trying to figure out they're they're hiring people to set traps in people's yards because in the middle of night these wild pigs come on but just fuck people's lawns up and in San Jose it's like tech industry you know

the the stairways that lead to a brick wall like you open up the door and there's nothing there or is that another crate as a crazy lady I think I think I'm thinking of a different person but William Randolph Hearst when he had the Hearst Castle built he released a bunch of wild boars Eurasian boars all over the backyard so he could just hunt them and shoot him because he was just crazy rich asshole and those motherfuckers populated the entire Northern California region that's crazy Hunter s Thompson when he was young and he lived in Big Sur he used to go hunt wild boars with a machine gun there's like a famous classic picture of Hunter s Thompson holding a knife and an ak-47 while there's a wild boar that's hanging from its back legs and he's cutting it open and about to cook it Oh

that house like with all those trees in the background all that green like that just makes you want to let you know what it reminds me of the crazy billionaire in ex machina remember that guy the guy lived in some crazy wooded oh yeah I just watched that Ferris Bueller's Day Off house that house is the shit but people would watch you fuck they'd be hide in the bushes binoculars got a new movie coming out Ferris Bueller no no no that the X marketing guy has a good movie coming erected a we watched the trailer off off air but I try to remember what it was right now yeah yeah it's some sort of a science fiction movie right yeah that's one of my if I had a top 20 all-time favorite movies ex machina is right in there wait so well done me too in every watch is perfect still is he doing that that book the science fiction book annihilation what is it about Jeff Vandermeer watch the new trailer for ex machina boy and Natalie Portman's in it oh yeah that's right they go to and like her husband died they're gonna find out yeah dude I gotta stop drinking coffee when I'm on a podcast because the flame thing yeah are you terrible is it a caveman coffee just coffee in general if I drink water I'm fine if I drink coffee I start Fleming up and I have to clear my throat you should do look ha ha that's all the bubbles we'll get out of that flim oh you know what I like to see via that's stevia soda do we have any those things are delicious where do you find them though I can't find a menu Amazon Amazon ok some grocery stores but like the so dials so taken over by the big ones there's like one six-pack in every grocery store you get lucky episode burn out and look cry something trying to doing all the audience a damn ZV of water yeah very similar it's so stevia is still fine right like there's nothing bad with stevia no I always hear like what was the other one that uh pertain yeah that's their obtain the other the gum all the clothes I'll at all um yeah what was the coconut one anyways they're all most of them like monk fruit supposed to be really good most that stuff like the chemical stuff is dangerous but stevia I think I'm pretty sure we should have Jamie choice as soon as Jamie comes back I don't want to tell anybody job Rowe Udall Steve you you want do you remember that crazy guy that was snorting stevia yeah man what he that guy was crazy that was a weightlifting singer though he was a MMA guy yeah yeah I had some awesome videos and snorting stevia talking about stevia burns off calories and gives you muscles root beer this is zero calories and it's sweetened with stevia and it's like Lacroix with that tastes better grapefruit citrus people are gonna think this is some really fucking low-level sketchy commercial man if I wasn't wearing my me undies right now I got a taste like root beer yeah legit okay here's the question is there anything wrong with stevia we need to find out I feel like there was something recently that school does stevia kill you my dad's still on the thing we're if if it's any kind of artificial sweetener your brain thinks it's real so it releases chemicals unnecessarily that doesn't have any where to go so he says it's still bad for you any artificial sweeteners right some ice is an artificial sweetener no stevia is made with a plant that's why it has a little green leaf that's what stevia looks like but isn't it your brain think like hey this is sugar though it tastes like sugar I don't know maybe your brain does man maybe my brain smart enough to know my brain is like yo bro this is fake bro this is a fake sugar bro bears don't get crazy I had a real coke the other day by accident oh yeah I went to a drive-through was late at night and I was fucking starving and I'd worked all day and I worked out and I was just like I just need to get a fucking Burger King I'm not very King Wendy's went and got a Baconator mmm yeah and I asked for a diet coke and they hooked me up with a regular coke they always do that shit pisses me off but he's so good it was so good I haven't had a regular coke in years I treat myself once in a while get a little Mexican Coke I I went to Indian out the other day I'm not on board a thinner now and I get shit on this button and now it's cigarettes killed your fucking taste but you go to Wendy's it's so much better what if you have a girl are you if you have a burger from in and out and a burger from Wendy's nice tastes a million times better you are you definitely a fucked up how does that one taste there's a show called good medley what he's saying I don't even know what you're saying there's a showgirl you really think that Wendy's is better than in a million times better than it that's a million million you I can't trust you with anything from now on you're from California though so you grew up on in and out yeah but most of your life is spent here in California I bias on Wendy's there from where we're from yeah that mean it's better true from California you know I would love to take five guys all the burger places that we know of and have a taste test with a blind taste us and you tell me which one is the best I thought you guys that will be nowhere close to the guys with bacon and jalapeno would but fuck all the rest of them I just said it five guys is good I like fuck I don't like the fries as much as I see you got a problem with your face fat burgers really way up there in the fat burger that's not many of them to compare way up there taste wise it's really really really just one like a mile away from here no I know but I mean there's just not tons of them all around the world and country pretty good all right they're pretty good really good but I think they give you frozen meat I think it's frozen meat that they retook but I don't think that's that big of a deal I'll tell you what man that whole frozen versus fresh argument I think the real thing is like when you cook it you got to cook it like right there and then you know like right like the problem with a lot of these fast-food places they have that fucking thing cooked they just nukem right and then hand them to your kid Burger King says flame-broiled but you know what they do they flame boy it then they put it in a pan with all this beef juice and they just let sit in this pan like it like kind of like a caterer you might when you go to catering where they just pull it out it's discussing the grossest burger you'll ever have in your life is Carl's jr. grass-fed burger taste at some time you'll throw it at your window it made me sick how disgusting a lot of our big fans of water burger when we talk about in and out like where they have it I think like Texas is a big place they're all Texas doubt they got a fucking big belt buckle and cow horns on their front Cadillac lot of burgers delicious fucking mind i buy the spicy ketchup from amazon that's the best I ever have spicy ketchup Amazon it's I'll buy you say it's fucking burgers good don't get me wrong I wouldn't say no if I was hungry but it cannot fuck with five guys are in and out let's do a taste test say okay what's wrong with stevia what is it stevie is short for stevia rebaudiana a plant from the chrysanthemum family which grows in parts of Brazil and Paraguay the compound that makes the stevia sugar is extracted from the leaves it's used in the UA East Asia Russia buh-buh-buh-buh-buh and is about 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar whoa when did the FDA approval in the 1990s FDA rejected stevia as a food ingredient after research linked it to reproductive problems and possible genetic mutations in rats hmm well I'm not a rat so in 2008 the FDA approved a specific formula of pure stevia rebaudiana barrios side a pure via and true via both contained the rebbe a version of stevia which is FDA approved the FDA recommended daily dose is no more than 1.3 mil agrammatism Truvia packets a day to exceed that what did the experts say if you're stevia isn't made from Reb a like for example the whole leaf extract that's sold at natural food markets and labeled as a dietary supplement hasn't been vetted for safety by the FDA for Truvia and pure via the FDA concluded with reasonable certainty that Reb a is not harmful under its intended conditions of use based on studies it looked at concerning reproductive blood pressure and toxicity effects although scientific studies in 1960s and 1980s found that stevia derived products decreased fertility and female rats and potentially lead to mutations the FDA concluded that those problems didn't apply to Reb a based on additional research that's only paid off the problem with this fucking I don't trust any studies from back in the day anymore after that sugar study got exposed where you found out from the New York Times did this whole expose on how the sugar industry bribed all these scientists to say that sugars not bad for you it's a saturated fat and they although they they pushed all the blame on heart attacks and heart disease on the saturated fat so this is Eva I can't tell what they're pretty much saying is like the Whole Foods the pure extracted stevia plants are not good for you or they're saying it's not every day that's it hasn't been vetted that's the stuff that we put in coffee that was also four year old article I was like oh there Jones calm which seemed like a good place but it was Mother Jones a good place if you have stinky feet and you're like wearing Birkenstocks and you have wooden beads mother jones is good magazine but it's they're super left-wing hippie I don't know if they're right though they might be right makes sense yeah I was just looking for some FDA results on that I mean there's no biological free rides if you talk to doctors they say look it's probably something probably going on you know like I used to think that advil was fine I think that Advil there's no problem to advil until dr. Rhonda Patrick explained to me about strokes and fucking the heart attacks and all kinds of crazy shit that you can get from consuming Advil an Advil the thing that you're supposed to take though if you're having a heart attack not aspirin aspirin supposedly prevents heart attacks mm-hmm but I wonder why like do you think it's is it something in the axe cause aspirin if I remember correctly google this I think it comes from the bark of a tree I think actual aspirin is an extraction like a plant extraction and somehow another aspirin because it does reduce inflammation it's supposed to be good for people who have heart problems aspirin blocks an enzyme called cyclooxygenase that makes your body less likely to produce chemicals that can cause inflammation it helps prevent blood clots that's important because they clog the arteries and Blink bring blood to the heart muscles in the brain which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke so aspirin blocks that enzyme and makes you less likely to have heart attacks and stroke that's pretty badass but what is aspirin from where does aspirin come from this aspirin safe to take as like a vitamin encourage you to take but you know what else can be done that could probably mimic the effects it's like when you talk to people that really understand like health ailments one of the big things they all seem to bring up is inflammation they like inflammation is like one of the number-one sources of malaise how do you say that malaise disease massive issues health health issues that people have inflammation inflammation they think is a huge factor in cancer huge factor in heart attack strokes everything like information is just fucking bad like anytime you're eating inflammatory foods that's the big problem with sugar that's the big problem with refined carbohydrates is that they produce inflammation in people like a lot of people that have like joint problems and shit they go on a low carbohydrate diet and all their joint problems go away like if you like painting your ankles and shit Wow a lot of people have found that that just changing your diet makes that go away because a lot of that inflammation is just the your body just not responding very well do you diet but that's a different people so what does it say I don't say anything about it being from a tree it seems like it's I agree with you I've heard that before I know there's something that sounds familiar but if it was aspirin or not mmm well what does it say it comes from I think it's just a chemical I think acetic acid but I think it's what is aspirin extracted from a plant google that because I think aspirin was around way before they figured out how to make like pharmaceutical drugs I think that shit's been around forever haha there was a dude there was a friend of mine who's a really funny comedian who would uh willow bark willow bark Aspen from a willow tree bitch yeah it contained willow the bark of a white willow tree contains the salicin which is the chemical known as the satay sitala whatever that's not witchcraft doesn't sound like witchcraft bark of a willow tree in the middle of the night on the so cyst you bring it to me and I would conjure it up I'll put it in a cauldron so willow tree the same as a weeping willow mmm huh weeping willow will is the one that's like yeah it has like those fuzzy things on it maybe I feel like I had a willow tree in Ghana yeah that's a pretty tree it's a nice chair whoa what's that one frosted hmm how to make aspirin from a willow tree let's find out how to do it what you gotta do let's make our own aspirin let's make toothpicks out of a willow tree that prevent heart attacks do one of those real have you could do that probably huh why not right always sucking on a toothpick instead of smoking a cigarette yes yes so that's what you want to do right you want to quit smoking yeah quit smoking is my number one thing lose weight is my number two what's number three grow your dick uh get rid of the damn rat in my house I feel like I'm diseased right now we played video a couple weeks ago of what of your your rat we showed it screaming of your rat did we play fine screaming won it I found the link late to like later and we moved on Brian caught a rat in a trap and set up cameras I can't tell you what happened the second part what what happened so there's two rats we killed one the second one with the video with the screaming one escaped for a week we didn't see it all my cameras have like all these night-vision cameras I'm like well it must have ran away so I took all my traps put them underneath the sink one of my traps was a electrocuted electric one where they walk in and they get electrocuted so I put that underneath the sink anyways it's cut to three months later it smelled like death in my kitchen you've smelled death before and you're like oh what the fuck is that sure enough I open it up and I see this flashing red light the rat had gone into the electricity thing electrocuted himself had been there for three months went in there after after a must have he must been injured in underneath my sink you must been injured it's the same rat yeah yeah why because I had so many cameras that I I could tell there was one bigger the pregnant one that we killed first then there was the father or that husband and like it was like 50 different sizes one was like you know the crazy big one was like smaller but so I look and I see this rat tail coming out and then smell like death right when I opened up the thing of course luckily I'm dating an Asian who eats fish eyeballs I was like get that out of here no she doesn't care she does she has no emotion about death so she takes it out and she was puts it in the trash can like I just told her to throw the whole thing away we're not gonna reuse that electricity thing and it fell out into the trashcan and bust open and all these maggots just come out like Oh hundreds of maggots like a burst open like the skin just couldn't take it anymore take pictures no she did I think she did I I was freaking out she definitely the rats back I guarantee you you probably had a ton of rats living in your house well what it is we think we got the exterminator out and we have one of those crawl spaces underneath my house and the whole house has been you know gridded up so there's no rats can get inside so how they were getting in was confusing one found our stupid-ass neighbor he's like oh yeah rec chewed through my screen in the back of my house the other couple months ago and he has a cat so they've been coming in his house going in his kitchen going underneath the house going out into my house so he says cuz he didn't tell us that he has a big hole in his back fuckin screen yeah but it's back screen the rats are coming out of his house it's coming in his house through this this hole and then they go in his kitchen and underneath they can go underneath the house by going under the pipes in there his kitchens I guarantee you there's rats everywhere like you can't blame this guy well you live in an area there's backyards there's horses everywhere you know there's a fuckload of rats is a goddamn Comedy Store yeah I saw sorry last night every time I go to that back smoking area I look for rats yeah and you'll see him scurrying across the top you know I took videos of him we were all hanging out in the back in the parking lot area where it says Mitzi's comedy Mitzie spot only it's fucking rats all over the place over there I hate rats man do you have rats you don't have rats at your house you have like other crazy shit right we have rats rats yeah we separate Ranchos I caught a big trance to grab never seen a tarantula just walking around yeah that's real yeah it's a big fucker in my house yeah yeah I put my sneaker next to it so people can see how big it is it was big I just I just but there but ranches are pretty pretty mellow man like you scoop a mop I put it in a box I gotta scoop them up in a shoebox put them outside yeah they don't bite or anything yeah oh my god I saw that coming out of my shoe are you freaked out to play shoes he didn't come out of my shoe I put the shoe down next to him I know but are you scared that any time you put your shoe on there might be a tarantula in it tarantulas don't scare me black widows worse much smaller than that and I see them all the time and they will fuck you up black widows or what's really scary yeah I have a lot at my house yeah that's a that's a fucking big bug right would you ever eat that yeah they taste good apparently they taste like crabs well they're in the crab family yeah yeah that's it I watched I watched a television show where these people were living in the Amazon I believe and they were cooking see if you can find it Amazon natives cooking giant spiders I mean and they had them you ever see how they do I could literally watch people eat dicks when they they you ever seen those things that they make it's almost like a screen and they put a fish down and then they put the other screen on top of it and they bury it and there no no like you cook it over a fire you know like not a screen it's like a bunch of sticks and the fish is in between the sticks you know it just it basically just holds the fish in place while they cook it over the fire they did the same thing with these these giant fucking tarantulas they cut him open slip split them up and laid them down on this this fire and just put the tarantulas out there to cook just like they would cook like a crab or a piece of fish or something like that it looked good I bet they taste good there but they're really bugs you know like they call they've called lobsters bugs like that's the thing like those those divers they call them bugs oh yeah see here they get these fuckers it's a pop in your mouth oh they get really itchy because the hairs off of those bugs they they're not bugs really they're arachnids but the hairs off the spiders so they take it just like little kids man oh they cook over the fire but hit the thing is man I think they taste good somebody told me they ate him before you know and it might have been less I think Les Stroud told me to eat him that he ate him a girlfriend would eat that right away no problem my problem with chopsticks yeah she put some of that a duck sauce on it look at these kids mine's ready but it looks like crabs look they're all excited human planet BBC that's cool but why are we afraid of tarantulas but we're not afraid of crab like no one has a problem cooking like you ever see like Alaskan king crab alive your fucking legs are like this long come in your house that's a good point you don't have to put a sneaker next to it I think it's a hair I think it's a hair thing that's another good point but roaches don't have hair the roaches freak you out yeah but that's a shell thing huh like if roaches were yellow no that's what have you well listen I hate a roach I ate a roach on fear factor they taste like nothing it's like nothing they squirt in your mouth that's kind of gross like I gagged a little bit it's warded when I bit anyway because it's so juicy but the actual taste itself was very bland what about those you guys those pill bugs or those garden bugs that yous guys used to have a fear factor those big green caterpillars that would just pop in your mouth one of those that wasn't so good what that tastes like that's not that strong still but very mushy like if I was really hungry I eat the shit out of a plate of those those roaches roaches yeah because I was in Mexico last year and we were in Cancun no damn storm man this is when beer factory here's the thing is man if I met this dude right now today I'd go [Laughter] if I saw that dude today I'd be like nice to meet you like I never I don't remember medium that's so great my memories such dog shit my memories pretty good for like normal stuff but I think I've seen too much all these people I don't know who these people are this is what I obviously met them that dude is going at town though look at him this is when fear factor was amazing yeah ludicrous man I'll give you some tips yeah one did we talk about there's like one of those stunts it's like oh no you're gonna get your cell phone way yeah Luda made up that budget gig money he's stuck in that world with the Tyrese and franchise did we talk about Tyrese in the rock feudin oh my god did we talk about it yesterday yeah we mentioned it off we didn't I had no idea I was I was on YouTube looking at something else I was looking at some automobile thing and I saw the rock and then I saw the rock dissing Tyrese and I was like this is real and I went to it and know it's real they apparently Tyrese talked a bunch of shit about the rock and the rock did a review of tyreese's album but they're also in a movie right now together doesn't matter he doesn't like them yeah the things coming out because the rock made a deal to make a spin-off sequel to the Fast and Furious franchise that's not bring involving anyone that's in the fresh area in there man Tyrese is like you splitting up the family which means nobody wants to go see a goddamn Tyrese movie that's the real problem yeah I'm on Team Rock what everyone's I love the rock you too he's a sweetheart of a guy if you meet him in person - oh you got to meet him yeah he's great at eight did a movie with him Jumanji he's fucking a great guy like a legitimately great guy and he inspires the shit out of me you know a lot of people think that meat had stuff like in the gym like push hard or get it done you know all work all play all day you know like all that crazy I find him inspirational I don't care if it's I don't care if it's simpleton stuff I think he's great I love them it was pretty good yeah we got give me some volume am I just wrapped a phenomenal workout here and the iron paradise got after it hardcore hardest workers in the room it's how we do it the number one question that I'm asked everywhere I go around the world is always how is it that I stays so motivated what are the motivating factors in my life that keep me in this psychological space number one will be gratitude I try and find a way to be grateful for every single thing I have every single day wins losses loved ones you name it my life wasn't always this way it was much different many moons ago so these days I'm grateful to the bone for everything the other thing is hunger you always hear people say well it's about being number one about being at the top or how about this you're always got to find somebody out there who's gonna work harder well I don't know that that might be bullshit but I know no one is gonna be hungrier than I am and I try and find a way to be grateful so I hope that helps it's two o'clock in the morning if you're watching this you better be doing something productive and not freaky shit well you could go do some freaky shit Saturday need a little editing but all that saying about gratitude that's real that's legit I'm who fucking works harder than that guy he's always on a new TV show he's got ten movies juggling at the same time probably sleeps two hours a night look at him I could do without all these pictures of people hopping in private jets though I get it you're rich that the private jet thing to me is is just that's a weird form of selfie you know like the private gym photos I get but the private jet photos here's the guy that that faked the private jet by people pretending to little bow-wow things what's funny is nowadays on the plane busted him I know and it's crazy because you could get a private jet pretty easily now there's an app or whatever that app is where you can rent like if you're going to San Francisco you can if you're with four people you can get like $200 plane tickets on a private jet really that you can print out private jets through an app now I think it's still pretty fucking expensive it's not isn't it like what I think it's called jet smart Jet Set the one here you can only just go to like San Francisco Vegas and maybe like Oakland but it's cheap it's super 200 bucks 250 bucks 150 bucks go to Vegas yeah private jet and you could if you can rent out the whole jet because you're friends you got a reserve it and time and make sure there's only after after the Vegas Massacre tickets were like 70 bucks in it to Vegas like how does that work does the airline just decide no one's going to vague we need to make it cheap and easy right where do they go in cahoots with the the casinos like I wonder if they're in cahoots with the casinos cuz here's one thing that I noticed you can't get a late night flight out of Vegas oh go home well I think that's because of noise order or you like the same with Burbank you can't fly out or what time do they stop for like ten you probably you can leave LA at 1:00 in the morning right anytime night so yeah would you feel weird staying at Mandalay a bit because I mean we used to stay at man oh they pay all the time yeah I think I've stayed in that room yeah almost positive I stayed in that room probably half because that was a corner yeah we it was always dope sweetie I think the 40 does put me up in that room way back in the dizzay I'm almost positive I looked at that room I'm like God that seems like super familiar yeah yeah I'd stay there I mean fuck okay it's one guy one crazy guy now he's dead but if you go online and read all the fucking rumors and all the theories Jamie is one of them I was looking at facts I'm not going into conspiracy stuff there's the chance he's kind of a truther he's a Vegas truther there's reporters looking into it I don't need to do that job for them they're looking at what do you think what do you think there's a second gunman no 3/4 4th the time do you really think I I'll just say this much of it while I was happening I was listening to police scanner audio and I was just following along the story the story changed and I had questions on Wyatt James seems super normal sitting around listening to please get her audio oh you mean multiple shooters from multiple hotels I'm not yeah that's because he was shooting towards multiple hotels and then shooting straight towards me I'm just alright but no there was some reports of people shooting people in New York New York and there's a but here's the thing you have to take any consideration whenever there's a mass shooting like that there's chaos one of this chaos you're gonna get all sorts of bad information people just like they see things that's not their no.1 news where the shooters were coming from people thought there were shooters in the crowd I have friends that were actually there at the thing that dodged bullets one of the girls who works for the UFC she was one of the ring card girl she was actually there and she said as she was running away people were dropping right next to her like she's trying to run and people got shot like literally like a movie balloon people dropping and falling down right next to her one of her friends blew out her ACL because the guy got fucking shot in the head and fell and landed on her sideways and blew her knee out damn it blitz Aryans said I hit that woman next to him has her head blew up yeah he was running away making a video I just saw some girl get shot in the fucking head he was right there at the concert fuck man I mean that guy and that shit for a long time I mean I don't like to read too much into it but that whole family's fucking crazy the father was a serial bank robber who used to do all sorts of charity work so that people think he was a nice guy and then he'd do this charity work and you know hey it's just me just nice mr. Fred and then mr. Fred would go rob a fucking shitload of banks yeah he had mental health issues years yeah fucked up though the father was a nut he was a real sociopath and then the brother the brother did like this rambling 30 plus minute interview where they were talking to him after the murders and all you just kept talking about what a great guy his brother was and his brother was so smart and my you you know he was the type of guy that if he wanted to just fly to Japan and have sushi yeah or kill 50 fucking people like it's nothing like what are you talking about your brother's a fucking serial killer your brother's a mass murderer you know you know shouldn't be talking about what an eccentric character you know he wasn't like us you know he would win win win at the casinos and they comped him everywhere and it's real weird his brother talking's like a guy who's crazy who's trying to not seem crazy that's what it's like it's like a guy who's trying to pretend like hey I think just like you guys do I mean I'm perplexed that fucking Apple does not fall far from the tree when you got a dad that's a psycho like that and he's raising kids like it's there's a high probability that all those kids are fucking psychos - this guy didn't do anything until he did this that's another thing that's fucked up it's not like this guy had this history of violence he had planned this and apparently gone to several music festivals and taking hotel rooms overlooking the arena probably plotted out in his head when they found a note people at would the note say would the note the note was ballistic calculations he was doing ballistic calculations like drop of bullets like you know if you're shooting someone and you're you know you're at a certain distance like some hunters have like a sheet of paper that they put on their rifle site and the rifle sight will say like at this you know hold here you know at 500 yards turn turn to 7 or 6 or whatever whatever they've calibrated it Out's this guy had those calculations written down on a piece of paper while he was gunning people down out the window straight up psycho it's just hard to believe that's a real person and if you believe people that are you know quote-unquote experts and these sort of mass killings and these psychological outbursts they think that they come in clusters that like this happens and then someone decides that I want to be the next guy and they do it somewhere else or Clinton Trump is I guess supporting and he's gonna get release at all of course they tried to kill him part you don't think they're trying to kill Trump do you think it's gonna show anything I don't know I think someone's trying to kill Trump though do you think if you had a guess I isn't anyone ever every presidents probably writing threatened but not just threatened like do you think there's ever been a like a meeting where they got behind closed doors like some shadow government type shit and they said um do we do this or what do we anyone do this I'm gonna do this what are we doing we're gonna do this this guy's talking about to see it there's like a recent thing where he was blaming the FBI for something about Russia saying the FBI was involved in suppressing information and everybody's like do you understand that the President of the United States is questioning the integrity of the intelligence community like how crazy that is letter he loves to do that though he loves to make everyone else seem untrustworthy I mean that is his thing like his thing is about fake news the failing New York Times fake news CNN they did fake news that like word exists two years ago and then now like it's the its I don't you can't go a day without fucking hearing I do not remember the term fake news now I remember right before Clinton Trump became president I remember talk to my mom about how horrible everything was and I remember going the biggest problem I have it's with this fake news and that was before fake news was talked about on TV but I was talking about fake news on the onion on Facebook I was saying like like my sister keeps on posting this bullshit's fake stuff that she's posting and I was getting mad at my sister it's like fake news I remember my mom goes there's a lot of fake news and then literally like up two months later everyone's talking with it that's fake news was kind of obvious though that was like and they said that I killed a mountain lion outside the Ice House for my film you know that was like fake news there's another one there's someone said that I disarmed somebody at The Comedy Store a buddy - a cop actually sent me a text saying hey way to go that's a tough situation to be and I was like what he's like you just saw him somebody at the comic store I go what I'm not disarming nobody what the fuck you talking about I just thinking that through what happened next I would guess or I would say is that people started manipulating those websites to not be parody or satire even yeah but they would make it look like a local news channel in some part of Pennsylvania West Virginia and then make a really salacious clickbait story but have a bunch of Google ads on there and I've seen those those got weaponized apparently a little bit and weaponized I went that's the word I would use because they were being turned into BOTS right those kinds of and that's what spread the quote-unquote like fake news of today well I was reading a story a thing was on Digg about a Russian troll farm like that they have these businesses like these troll farms are like their businesses it's like it's just like do you work at t-mobile no I work at the troll farm what a fun job that is so great well you are one of their trolls dude see spice oh yeah we've brought that up many times Russian troll farm that weaponized Facebook had American boots on the ground okay that article makes me annoyed Maya you're annoying me weaponized is that's all annoying me like how is it what's why is that term that's such a loaded term weaponized so let go to it let's understand what she said Twitter CEO shares tweets hold on a second is that Jack I'm trying to get Jack in here is that conversations Twitter CEO shared tweets from Russian troll farm according account claiming to be a black woman that's so good mmm Rihanna collects her humanitarian award year from award from Harvard she kicked off Women's History Month with a bang reads one of the tweets Dorsey shared from crystal one Johnson in March 2016 that's hilarious oh this woman like is tweeting all this shit pretending she's a black woman but really it's it's an account made by the Russian internet research agency with links to the Kremlin that is wonderful crystal one Johnson do you think they killed her account go to our account see if it's legit I hope it's still there just just highlight it crystal one Johnson please please be real please be real please be real tell me if you think it's real Bryan yes I yes oh she's still up it's gone it's count suspended Wow god damn it Jack that said that was what she used to look like I know that was somebody else's account hood Oh someone who saved it oh that's her tweets that's the account this is amazing like you look she has a picture of a beautiful black girl laughing you probably didn't learn this in school and then she has a pic says Amelia Bassano is the lady who wrote all of Shakespeare's plays because she was black they would not publish her work she died in poverty because she never received his dime for work Shakespeare was illiterate and could barely write his own name [Laughter] because it's funny positive Blackwell so people will over share that let go go back up to that tweet that doesn't show you how many people retweeted it that's wonderful that's wonderful I mean that's like so obviously not true like she's pretending that some black woman wrote off shit I mean isn't that like wouldn't that be like the ultimate thing like the white man the white male privilege of Shakespeare allowed him to steal what is that and freek was actually an African American is no way is that real this is the real and Frank Oh believed it then annek we sure Frank Jackson she was a Jew from Africa the real land of the chosen people oh my god that is amazing but that's gonna that would trick someone who doesn't use the white a lot you know whitewashed fake no she's like she's pretending to be a crazy radical feminist someone else responded this was a response to that tweet by some random person Oh delirium swag oh that guy's probably Russian too how many people that you contact on a daily basis are actually just Russian trolls half the Internet I feel like I'm could be yeah but they're what they're doing is very clever though like it seems legit it seems legit right like like that seems like a crazy person like I've seen many many crazy radical black activists on Twitter that say things that aren't nearly as ridiculous as that or that that's more ridiculous than or that's less ridiculous than what they say I mean this is one if it's part of the problem I mean that's the right way to work to phrase it but like this is going on all over the internet in different forms and variations and it's being used and not so like nefarious ways but mmm it's being used for potentially good I don't know what the good would be but someone has probably figured out how to use these BOTS do you remember before retweeting was an option on Twitter people would write RT and then they would write what you said yeah I used to encourage people to write RT and just make up a bunch of shit that I said and and and then I would go this is outrageous I never this how dare you and people would just say the most ridiculous shit like I love the taste of cocks and they would and and you know Artie Joe Rogan just finally coming out I was like god damn it and but I just I don't remember when I did this but it was like the early days of Twitter because I was like this is got it you could definitely just do that right and then people would believe that you said a bunch of racist shit or a bunch of gay shit we just open that back up now do you I like it there's part of the what I like about the Internet is like did you read or did you listen rather to the radio lab podcast on Shia LaBeouf LaBeouf no I did it's fucking great I sent it to Jamie it's fucking great what is it called again Twitter truth trolls yes you have to find it because they took it down how do you take it down I just got enough you had it already downloaded on your phone because you are auto download radio lab podcast so when I went to go find it I had to go search for it there wasn't I sent you that link they had taken it down the next day or somewhat as people thought that they were endorsing endorsing that trolling yeah exactly they should be endorsing it it was awesome what the 4chan guys did was fucking amazing this is what they did Shia LaBeouf his name the booth whatever that fucking crazy assholes name he was doing some weird art piece where he like stood around with a bunch of other people and it was like he will not divide us he will not divide us they would all say that and then all these 4chan people found out about so they showed up started yelling a bunch of fucking trump shit still alive right now the cameras don't know this went all after that whole thing ended they ended up like selling this to another company or our people when they're handling all of it now so shot okay so this he will not divide us thing right he would go to these places and say he will not divide us he will not divide us and people would show up and they would show up with like texts and shirts on with Pepe the Frog they would wear make America great again hats on and they weren't even necessarily Trump supporters they're just people trying to have fun right they're trying to fuck with people right so what they did was shy LaBeouf put up a flag in the middle of nowhere that said he will not divide us and then had a livestream where you could go and look at the flag as it's waving in the breeze right they found the fucking flag they found out where it was and the way they found it was genius and it's all detailed in this radio lab the fact they took it down is actually making me mad why would they because what these guys did was awesome all right first of all it was brilliant they found social media posts that showed that people had met Shia LaBeouf in some place and I say his fucking name about they found out that they had met him in some weird place in Tennessee so they triangulated where he would be right so then what they did was they went around they had one of their members go around with a car and beep the horn so they could hear the horn on the camera and once they heard the horn on camera then they knew he was there or then they knew that the fly was there so then they found out where it is by the stars they looked at the fucking stars and they figured out where the area is because when it's nighttime you can see the stars on the live feed and they figured out what constellation it was they went to the fucking flag took it down put a make America great again hat on and a Pepe the Frog thing up there and the guy walks up to the camera goes fuck Shia LaBeouf so great the fact of Radiolab took that down that's depressing why did they do that did they not understand what's happening here it's like when he was moving around they found the log cabin he was in and they're like let's look for rental cabins that match the wood pattern they're around 3000 rental caverns in lapan Lapland we just need to match the wood patterns easy enough I fucking love this I don't understand why they were mad but this one I understand I understand why Radiolab would take that down once you go back why did Radiolab take down the twitter truth or trolls controlled truth trolls whatever the fuck is so great you listen to radio I've never listened to radio love but what is it it's an amazing podcast it's really good news or it's one of my favorite podcast they have all kinds of crazy get on I mean they have stuff on all sorts of different inch Oh Radiolab removes its truth trolls episode from podcast feed I suppose I was trying to find the actual because it's a while what but it's saying that they removed it right that was someone right but obviously they removed it editorial radio labs decided to take down this episode some listeners call this out saying that in telling to capture the flag story in the way that we did we essentially condoned some pretty despicable ideology and behavior oh come on to all the listeners who felt that way and everyone else please know that we hear you and that we take these criticisms to heart I feel awful that the things we said could be interpreted that way that's on us it was certainly not our intention and we apologize come on folks you guys are missing the humor of this these these aren't despicable people they are saying things that are ridiculous because it's funny like there's a lot of people that say a lot of fucked up shit online do they actually mean this stuff or are they saying it because they are anonymous and because it's fun to say fucked up things online that you're not supposed to say I would say the latter I don't I think there's a bunch of people that are really legitimately fucked up online there's a bunch of other people to think it's fun because they're stuck at some goddamn soul-sucking job and some fucking cubicle somewhere and they have access to the Internet and so they go on message boards and they fuck around and they troll this asshole Shia LaBeouf is a dumb-dumb all right he's he's a fucking plagiarist I mean this guy's been busted for plagiarizing like giant chunks of other people's work right like what did he get busted for plagiarizing he's in jail every couple weeks for being an asshole and being drunk and like really cool I think that that gig being a fucking movie star is insane I think it's insanely pressure-filled it's way harder than what we do in terms of like dealing with all the the people that like you and managing all the relationships and brief history of Shia LaBeouf copying the work of others yeah it's like a ton of shit what does it say he plagiarized an apology to Alec Baldwin in 2013 the abruptly quit what would have been his first Broadway show orphans due to creative differences that is he couldn't get along with Alec Baldwin according to reports LaBeouf decided the best way to explain his departure would be to tweet out a photo of his email apology to the cast and baldwin by name unfortunately parts of the pros sample a man owns up dot-dot-dot a man ellipsis a man grasps his mistakes was ripped off verbatim from a 2009 Esquire article titled what is a man people including the articles author noticed hmm yeah that's that's not that bad but it is that plagiarized a bunch of shit he plagiarized his directorial debut his short film Howard can't or.com premiered in the 2012 Cannes Film Festival until it was posted online December 16 2013 that viewers began to notice that the film was almost an exact adaptation of a graphic novel that's it the one by Daniel cloves best known for Ghost World closed told budge BuzzFeed which bought much of this story to public light brought much much of the story to public light the first ever her the film was the morning when someone sent me a link I've never spoken or met mr. LaBeouf I've never seen even one of his films that I can recall and I was shocked to say the least when I saw that he took the script and even many of the visuals from a very personal story I did six or seven years ago and passed it off as his own work yeah Wow I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind he then apologized for plagiarism by plagiarizing a Yahoo Answers post from four years ago my god he says copying is in particularly creative work being inspired by someone else's idea to produce something new and different is creative work Oh huh well that's not totally copying what he said from the Yahoo Answers but it's pretty goddamn close whatever he's obviously got mental issues and whether they're real or whether he's trolling or whether he whether he's a psychological meltdown because of all the pressure of being an actor this shitload of pressure and being in transformers some of them are great don't get me wrong I met a lot of cool actors a lot but I would say 10% of them are useless that's a that's a big number that's a big number I would say 3% of comedians are useless might be in generous yeah with the open mic recessional professionals yeah three percent three percent me maybe five three percent of just loopy but at the Comedy Store it's even less like paid regulars The Comedy Store I would say it's less than one percent oh yeah that's totally different because when you're including all comedians and you're talking about like the cruise ship comedians many of the comedy store comedian or I mean comedy class comedian flappers flappers the whole establishment tell jokes on stage yeah I ran into a buddy of mine he used to work on Fear Factor and he's now doing stand-up in Burlington Vermont he didn't start until he's in his 40s Wow yeah I just said had a fucking dream I've got a dream I've got a dream and he just decided to start doing stand-up comedy in his forties Dean delray started at a really young really was 38 or something I want to say Dean was soon as 40s as well yeah cuz Dean's in his 50s now yeah I don't think he's been doing comedy for 10 years no he hasn't no I didn't started open mics with him he's pretty fucking funny now man I'll tell you what Dean had a set the other night at The Improv he made me laugh hard he had some funny jokes I don't want to say what the joke the bit about but it was about people don't wear condoms it was fucking really well-written he goes on stage more than anyone I know he actually writes down each time he goes on stage if he doesn't go up two or three times a night he freaks out like he has that's he doesn't date he doesn't have any relationships he just does stand-up a hundred percent oh what's that about there's a date I don't know man that seems like not a good time that's he's he every time I ask him about it he's always like cuz you know I don't want it to interrupt with my comedy he's so focused on comedy well as he did a comedian doesn't always go bad look at Tom and Christina and Natasha Leggero I was good yeah she just fucking swings monkey bars from one comedian to the next I think she's pregnant now yeah she was awesome a door was a joke she was on Fallon and a joke I don't think so I think she actually think Moshe kasher is fertile yeah like a good Jew juice yeah good that would be great parents they're fucking smart as shit it reveals the worst parts of being pregnant in 2017 oh she is pregnant Wow she has a nice little belly girl that's interesting because she was kind of cranky last time I saw her The Comedy Store that makes sense she didn't look pregnant that cuz she had so many like things on I guess yeah well she's she's well-dressed yeah she's uh that's interesting there if you had to pick like the funniest comedian couples there top three it's like rich vos and Bonnie McFarlane out there I think I got to give the fucking title to the mommies I give the title of the Tom and Christina absolutely I think they're number one as far as funniest couple but Moshe and Natasha right up there they're both legit real you know top-flight stand-ups and they actually get along somehow also the water champs I don't know Tom and Christina do you have a champ they have like real competition with each other see who's the water having a person at the personality champ contest well tom is in fucking the throws of our yoga challenge and he's lost a shitload of weight Christine was just ranting about it like how great he looks he looks awesome dude he that fucking guy when we did that weight loss challenge he lost like what was like 40 something pounds and then just ran with it never let up never never went back to his old ways of eating and just stayed fit worked out constantly yeah and he looks great like there was a picture him the other day that somebody put up on Instagram and I was like Jesus Christ like look at him he's skinny he's gotta go get all new pictures again cuz yeah doesn't inside yeah he doesn't look this well that was Bert was talking about that like his mostly stories photo he's got this big ol moon face and now you look and he's uh he's all fucking thin it's sexy well we got to wrap this up dude I gotta I gotta abbreviate this one and get this out of here quicker peg most can I recommend a show for you please there's a show that I can't get enough it's called good mythical morning have you ever watched this shit Jamie so it's these two guys and it's really interesting how they filmed it because it's it's for all the kids loved it and adults love it and they're these two guys and every day they do this show and it's only like maybe 15 minutes long but every day it's something different like we're gonna taste test 10 hamburgers and we're gonna figure out which one it is or we're gonna see if we're gonna play this game where one one thing is Kauai balls and the other thing is gummy Kauai Abbas and whoever loses has to eat the cow balls and it's like they take parts of Fear Factor they take parts of just like interesting things like we're gonna taste expired food from 40 years ago they're constantly eating stuff every day like it's really great i highly recommend it's called good mythical morning they also have a podcast called ear biscuits rhett and Link are the guys I did a form of hot ones it was one of his off shows when the end between seasons that me and him went to the hottest chicken place in Los Angeles was a lot of chicken place Howlin rays and it's now it's now it's both amazing chicken every where's it at Helen Rowland Ray Allen raised downtown you should that's the episode but how in Ray's is Nashville hot chicken and so they have like the hottest chicken and they also have chicken that's not on the menu so we ate the three hottest chicken and one that's not on the menu me and him why is it because it's too hot like you we had to sign papers like it's it's you're not supposed to eat it yeah it's what happens well you should watch the episode but pretty much I'm gonna leave me with a cliffhanger yeah but after we did it he said Sean says that was hot than anything we've done on ever done on hot ones really and me he left immediately went to his hotel room me and him I went to my house 45 minutes I'm just crawling like laying there like crying I fall asleep I wake up I'm shitting blood like it's 24 hours of hell and lately being hinted like I wrote Shawn like are you in the same boat like this is that bad it was that bad so if you go to hell and raise I recommend getting the mild or medium hot but do not get the hottest and don't ask for the hidden menu item hot because it's like horrible unless you want to ruin your life but did when it was over did you feel good sort of like a near-death experience no I felt like I was who listen if you listen 18 hallucis Christ I mean I was eating paper towels at parts just because it was too high yeah do you try milk no we had ice cream afterwards that we should supposed to help right yeah ice cream kind of helps but getting the oil like that my my idea was get the oil out of my mouth because it was my my lips were getting and so what is the pepper that they use it like Carolina was Carolina Rita ghost pepper it had a bunch of them in there Christ so you eat like ghost peppers yeah and I ate all if it's horrible did chip now you can buy I think it's $4.99
