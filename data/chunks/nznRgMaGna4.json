this dog we're good all right we're live sort of sort of rollin rollin rollin rollin dog so so we were talking about the game we stopped because we figured this is probably good for the podcast right re finally paid off the bed we paid it off in a big way man big way in a big way so if you remember I when we were doing the weight loss challenge it was like whoever wins decides yeah the sporting event we're all sports fans basically you know and and I said at the time I was like let's go see Barcelona I think I wanted to see Barcelona play Paris in you know some tournament Cup some Chow a tournament that they were playing in and I was like you know two of the premier teams and it would be fun to go to Europe and make already pay for it you know so I told him that he was like I'm going to like fuckin Malaysia so never heard from him again and four months later you know how it all it all played out and so when he got back he was getting fucking slammed by people because he was supposed to pay up this bet you know right and people were destroying him you know that I mean online they were just like well sure you're a piece of shit probably worse than that but anyways once we got it we got to like hanging out was we did the sober October thing he was just like right before that actually I think he was like which means like what do you want to do right he's like you know you picked the event I go I'm a big college football fan let's go to national championship game now remember in 20 at the end of 2013 season 2014 FSU and Auburn played in the Rose Bowl out here and Burt's an FSU alum I'm a big FSU fan I was like let's go to the game and I remember that we met it was like we got somebody who had student because they both always on the national championship they allow students to go to the game for pretty expensive much less than the general public can go for in other words there because you want students have the ability to go to see their school play so we got like student tickets for I think there were 350 each and that's pretty expensive you know especially for a student but I remember Bert treated me he bought the ticket from me and we went to that to that game and he left that fucking halftime of the national championship game why'd he leave he was I'm tired we gonna see the kids I've been drinking he just left you there yeah we were sitting in separate sections but I was like are you fucking so I was like texting him he was like so you were by yourself and he was by himself yeah yeah he knew more people at the game because a lot of his friends that he went to school with we're at the game - but I'm like you're gone did you just see the kickoff return that just the the the lead just like swung he was like alright so alright psycho shit for it I still give them shit for it but it ended up being just this amazing finish so anyways when I tell Ari I want to go to this I'm kind of thinking that's the ballpark like because that's the only experience I have so the games in Atlanta he buys tickets and I'm like I go you're not flying coach you know that he's like no you champ you first Bert Brooke his coach Riggins coaches all good mostly bill extension oh cool but Bert end up going from somewhere else so anyways he bought the ticket he got an Airbnb a really nice house you know for a few days in Atlanta and then it's a you know it's the big thing is game day I'm thinking like oh that's cool that you got these tickets and you got you know but I think it's like reasonable and then we get to the stadium it was a total fucking disaster to get in because Trump went to the game so it was raining it was wet Secret Service everywhere to our lines to get into the venue and I paid a guy a security guy a hundred bucks to walk us through the line which is which was almost impossible because it was so packed but I don't know he just started walking us through the line like in front of people people were yelling at the security guy which was like so uncomfortable he's like a young black kid and like old white people were like the fuck are you doing he's like I'm security and they're like you're not security you piece of shit like right to his right in front of us I was like god damn like I just have never seen someone flip out like that what we were doing was highly unethical we shouldn't have done it like we just weren't gonna wait in that line and then Bert of course Bert in a crowd like that he's like it's okay I'm famous we're famous guys like yelling that to people which is like no he didn't oh absolutely he's like he's everywhere we went if he went to a restaurant they would come up like hey can I get you guys something to drink and I he'd be like do you reckon they're like was he serious I think it's part of his like you know whatever style and then and they were like I'm sorry so part of a joke or part of it yeah kind of a joke he's joking but I'm not he's like halfway in the middle because one time one time he was like we're famous comedians and the lady was like oh I know who you are he was like serious he's like weird but it's like you see him in his element it's like him in with crowds is really like you realized he really enjoys it like he really enjoys the large groups he enjoys being recognized he fucking like sometimes we were walking and people were like hey you're the guy I've seen you on Facebook he's like you my picture and then we were talking about how like people would say like Tom and I'm like yeah and they're like hey and then they would walk away they wouldn't come over to me they're like hi and then they'd walk another way but with Bert they're like I hug you and take the shirt off they say love they love it and he's like in his glory with it it's perfect so anyways we get through this horrific line into this unbelievable 1.6 billion dollar stadium that they built in Atlanta I mean it's fucking amazing it's such a beautiful just standalone stadium you know so state of the art it's incredible we get in there ari got us 50-yard line so right in the middle like 20 rows back I'm like these are fucking amazing like you couldn't ask for better seats it has like some Club access for like free booze free food catered food prime yep Jesus I'm like how much did you pay for these tickets yeah 103 $500 each whoa I was like ari are you fucking shitting he's like Wow yeah it Wow unreal man that's amazing I mean those are those are great seats dude like those are absolutely amazing seats you know when the MacGregor Mayweather fight was going on yeah I was hearing that people were buying tickets for a quarter million dollars that's fucking retarded that's so dumb to pay that much money you say that right yeah but you're balling pretty hard right now I mean I'm back I'm at is a yeah I thought about some of the shit the year you can do now yeah that's true I would be like that's impossible yeah we were talking about Jeff Bezos before the show who's now the richest man in human history it's like it's inconceivable honey he's worth a hundred and five billion dollars right which is just like what the fuck he's like the eighth biggest landowner in United States you know that he just buys crazy yeah and I'm not stunned no of course not yes 300,000 acres of Texas whoa that's a lot that's a lot yeah that's a big slab yeah I'm sure he's just bawling out pretty sure his DC home was either I feel he was either a museum or a hotel before he was like make that shit my house now I wonder what he's like to hang out with cuz there's a photo of him see if he could find this photo of Jamie there's a photo of Jeff Bezos from 1993 and he's got like a vinyl banner yeah above his desk that says amazon.com uh-huh and it's just him in this janky little fucking Ikea desk yeah like bad clothing yeah yeah kind of chubby yeah I've been away she's got some muscle he's jacked and tan and probably got a supermodel for a girlfriend does he know he's got a wife for Kevlar yeah normal yeah really she's an author yeah how long I know he doesn't schedule morning meetings so you're hanging out with the kids really yeah Wow I read all this stuff I wonder why he's going so hard hmm you know when you hit 105 boo-boo-boo-boo-boo billion yeah you would think you'd go yeah we're good I know I think you just start really collecting because you're like because you know when he bought the Washington Post you know it's not like he's like I love journalism right be cool to own a newspaper you know I mean like what do you at that level you're just like I like waterfalls are there any for sale or something you know he's got washed in Post is one of the weird ones where you get a link someone they'll send you a link and you click on it and it's a Washington Post article and it says you obviously love great journalists right sign up like fuck off they don't even give you the free reads I feel like New York Times will give you ten free I signed up after I you know I kept clicking those I know Washington Post I feel like click number one they're like do you read this you want pay or not yeah I'm not paying yeah I mean I support paying for journalism but I feel like I should give us a taste you know a little taste it's tough to trust journals in these days it's tough to trust like how fucking weirder your articles gonna be that's true it's her journalism's tough watching news has become man I remember when it started to skew to personality and taste you know now it's like off the rails it is off the rail that's where the money is I know but it's like you were totally just going with who like you're gonna watch you can select what do I feel like leaning towards yeah and then you watch that Tucker Carlson yeah or you know yeah yeah Rachel Maddow yeah there he is that is that picture oh my god isn't that crazy yes he looks nothing like that now yeah it's 105 billion will do he's just sitting there with that amazon.com banner I hope that's still hanging somewhere in his house yeah he probably shoots loads on that thing what do you God yeah crazy that he started I remember Amazon being a book thing yeah being a place to buy books and remember thinking how weird like an online bookstore why won't you just go to the book store store you could see the book right like and all those books are shut like they closed there's only a few left well I know a guy who got a deal with amazon.com to publish a book is like when Amazon started publishing books and they blackballed him because of this cuz he had had traditional outlet deals before and you know his books would be front and center and Barnes Noble and all the different places he's a pretty popular author but as soon as you went to amazon.com they're like fuck you and they just shut him out they shut him out of all those doors yeah and I was like whoa like there's like a weird book war going on that I didn't know about they're both probably I mean those book people were trying to keep their business model going and thriving you know and yeah but doing it by threats is never the way to go probably not know I mean the best way to go is when Amazon publishes a book that people actually want to buy in your store you dumb Fox show it in your store you know I hate about these uh super-rich guys they'll never they never in their interviews have like the only one who will talk like what it's like to ball at that level and make it sound fun and like the things you want to ask is Mark Cuban I've seen him in interviews be like oh yeah I got last shit and like knows that like that's a genuine curiosity for people like how fun is that you have to 747 he's like yeah man it's pretty cool right and he talks about it but I saw this interview with gates and this guy was asking all those questions he was like you have to worry about like when somebody asks you to like when you asked for something that someone's gonna try to ask for more because of your known wealth he's like you know my charity really is just like dodging all those questions yeah I like the fun shit that everyone was right he just kept going back to his charity we're like we know you're a fucking charitable guy tell us what it's like to own six planes bro like what kind of shit do you have like this is an Adu house it's like 70,000 square feet or something well he's got a house I think it's on Puget Sound it's somewhere in the Seattle area yeah it's Medina Medina or Medina says that what it is I think it's what it's called it's so freaky look at that looks like you're not an AdBlocker what are you pulled up would you pull up 19 crazy facts about his house oh okay 123 million dollars disabled you're a blocker so we can read it so we we were in Seattle and there's this thing that's near a bridge where you you go under this bridge and they have this these clear walls where you can see the salmon swimming up the salmon ladders they have everything set up with these clear like glass walls you can watch her it's really pretty badass yeah but the guy who was there who was the you know the guide of this thing who's explaining us you know how this works and which kind of salmon you're looking at and the whole deal he was like you know my uncle worked on the bill Guto so he starts talking about Bill Gates house where Bill Gates house is and where he lives and I remember thinking like how weird must it be if you're so rich that all everybody wants to do is talk about like hey my friend worked on your case huh and I was like well what's it like and he just starts describing skills well he has like some sort of a submarine access in case he's getting kidnapped like someone's trying to jack them they can get in a submarine and shootout into the river I'm like what yeah I don't know how much of that is even true because this guy seemed like yeah he was missing a little piece of his brain yeah start really adding stuff like how much of this is urban myth I know that they were reporting even like I don't know when that house was built 10 15 whatever years ago that even back then there was shit in his house it was super high-tech of like if you walk in a room music would play and as you left the room music would died out and pick up in the next room so that you know it had like which that I think you could probably a regular person could probably do something like that now but like that was unheard of yeah I think you wore a pin you can pin on and that pin as you walked into different rooms recognized that you were the person so you had specific colors that you liked so they'd be like backlighting those just like to be his kids like he's big on he's the one that started that Giving Pledge which is like for billionaires to give the overwhelming majority of their wealth right to charity so that you don't pass on billions to your children right you like so his thing is like I'm gonna leave my kids money but not like crazy money what you're like yeah that's you know I totally get the idea behind that but also like if you grew up with his you know you're his kid and you're like oh we got Lions this year and then you're like you know you grow up and you're like I'm a whatever a photographer now my dad left me five million dollars but like five million dollars is great it's great but my thing is like it's such a step down from what they're used to I feel even remotely bad for some fucking kid who gets five million dollars from his I don't feel bad what I'm saying is that that adjustment has to kick you in the balls I mean the exposure that they've had the lifestyle is like it's not it's unfathomable to us like we can't even it's beyond their just like it's like being the the Prince you know it's like you're Ned Sultan of Brunei and then he's like well go fuck him I mean up there probably well-adjusted I don't know why I assume that but I think that like he and his wife seemed like such reasonable people that I bet they've you know prepared them for for what's coming well they've got to figure out a way to make it on their own and how do you get a kid to do that that's tough right you know how do you get a kid to do that who's who's growing up like that right yeah you think about that with your kid like as you're starting to ball out of control yeah I think about it for sure like how do you and then like how to not you know you want to prepare your kid for that and then how does how will a boy I don't know maybe especially boys align with their dads usually in a certain way you know like well kid compares himself to you and your success but you don't want him to feel like you know he's less than right in your shadow sure especially what if he goes into comm oh my god have you thought about if your daughters were to go I mean my 7 year olds hilarious she's really funny is she ever like sure she's like this she doesn't know what the fuck comedy is now she just knows how to be silly she's on a TV not really no she flipped through Netflix and makes fun of me really yeah nice jeans dad really yeah she's just ruthlessly funny she goes after it seven-year-old is day younger yeah yeah she goes after it all the time going after jokes that's hilarious yeah she's she's really funny but I see her becoming like a youtube character or something well how do you had it what do you think about as far as like them not feeling you know overwhelmed by your success or status do you ever think about I think it's less likely because they're girls mm-hmm you know but I was actually having a conversation with Neal Brennan about this last night we were talking about another famous guy I don't know him that well so I won't use his name but he has two sons and at least one daughter the daughters highly motivated he's not worried about it at all she kicks ass in school she's awesome the sons are fucking insanely lazy and they just sit around they know that when they turned 26 they get a giant check and they're 25 now boy they don't do shit he's super worried about it I wouldn't do you know yeah that's a that's a it's like a nightmare man well it's like it's so hard to actually do something if you don't have to mm-hmm it's so hard to to make something happen in your life right to start a business to enter into a career to become successful at it to really focus and try to get good to the point where you're successful at something you have to have a fire inside of you you have to have a need to achieve yeah if you already have a Ferrari and you're already living in a mansion you already have ten million dollars in the bank you already have all your bills paid you don't have to get up in the morning if you don't want to yeah the idea of just becoming this discipline machine it's out there to try to kick ass in this life be self-actualized so hard so hard to pull off you can't you gotta like dial back to on the spoiling I think I went to high school with a grand son of a billionaire and they they were very present in like the area you know and you know they drove like used cars the the grandkids I'm saying and had obviously they could have gotten way more but it was like instilling this you're not just gonna coast through everything hmm and they got jobs and as far as I like I know about now what he's doing now is like he's working you know he's really working even though he's gonna inherit like just crazy amounts of money Brian you know but I mean part of it too is just the nature of that person I think you can try to not go crazy with um you know taking care of them gifts and all that stuff but some of that drive has to come from within no matter what your socio-economic level is yeah I would imagine some of it I think there's people that are grow up rich that it doesn't matter doesn't they're they're just they're gonna succeed yeah they love it they like succeeding they like working hard they like getting things done yeah but then there's like what causes a kid to be a lazy fuck you know like you come home the kids on the couch just with their feet up and they don't yeah did you do what I asked you to do I was gonna yeah but something happened Mike called and fucking I know people like cars oh yes yeah I think is something wrong with just I mean I know people like that who you want to shake yeah you know the fuck is wrong with you but they I think a lot of times they just it's almost like they fear doing the thing yeah scared they're scared what if I do something mm and I suck at it you know that kind of thing there's definitely that yeah there's well you see that in a lot of like amateur comics that are sort of starting to make it into comedy yeah you see like a lot of like sabotage didn't you know that stress of you're just doing open mic nights and then also and you starting to get paid in and then some people start moving forward and other people get left behind sure I remember those days of course I remember thinking like my boy there's a lot of people here that are sabotaging themselves oh yeah oh yeah see the stress of because stand-up in particular so open-ended like you could make of it what you want you put in as much as you want you either can be successful or not depending upon how much you focus on it how much talent you have how much Drive and discipline you have and a couple breaks couple breaks a bunch bunch of factors yeah and sometimes those factors are just too overwhelming some people and you see them just start tanking it they're drinking at the store every night yeah yeah because it's it's scary that's the truth that it's scary yeah I remember and people handle it different ways like I remember the people who'd be like they would just say like this is a you know this isn't gonna work out I don't know why we're doing this don't talk to me anymore yeah you're fuckin so negative but they doing that just to sort of eliminate that pain of failing yeah you know they're just trying to like just address it now yeah come on we're just normal guys yeah we're gonna happen you know I will just get a fucking regular job we'll be working for Amazon or something yeah you know what I'm talking about man yeah there's people who are like yeah this doesn't you know you can't make any money doing this I remember that a lot too is like you can't make any money doing this I was like whoa you can't make any money right now doesn't mean you not gonna make money later they're like how you gonna get to later because there's no money now I'm like you know it's almost as weird do you remember the development deal of years were you around during the development deal I was just a detail and I was at that where they were like they were like ah two years ago you would make $6,000 yeah I was there for the development deal years but I kind of was working during most of it was during most of it I was doing news radio when it got really hot I was doing news radio and I remember that there were comics that would go to Montreal they would do the Comedy Festival they would have these sets and they would come back and they had half million dollar deals and they were there was sitcoms and they were convinced that it was all fucking happening for them yeah and I remember I had quite more than one conversation with one of these people that were trying to put me on their show comics that have never since like do not hear from them usually my show yeah bro my shows guaranteed is what's gonna happen it's guaranteed go to air it doesn't go to air there's a million dollar backup deal like they had all this stuff that they were telling you about like they went the opposite way instead of like being like terrified of the future to the point where they were just like letting themselves off the hook they were super confident in this weird delusional it's definitely happening for me thing odd man yeah it's odd to subscribe see that would always scare me because I'm more my my just more life perspective is like you don't you don't react until like the check clears yeah no it's always like wait and see well those people that it was interesting because they none of them made it yeah none of them and they were all convinced but it was a weird convinced it was like a view what yeah like you're not even that good tell my guys you got lucky man you had a pretty you're kind of cute you had a pretty decent set in front of a very willing crowd yeah and someone took a chance on you because people are going there was a nutty time I guess we should describe it to people there was a nutty time where they were just chocking around development deals like a regular person who probably had no business being on stage to get $100,000 development deal yeah I literally just missed that I think they said that the last big one that they talked about was like oh five they're like that was like one of the last big six-figure development deals which is basically you go to Montreal you know which is the Just for Laughs big festival all the executives go they all basically party for a week yeah it was like an excuse to do work and then you know they were signing people up with those checks and we literally I went in the oh seven new faces class and they're like ah two years ago someone got eight hundred fifty thousand dollars for his 15 minutes that 850 he's like one of the big last big ones that failed like they they had a record there was like a tallying of like this person this person this person this person all got them and nothing came of it and like went all in in o5 on a couple other people and then that didn't pan out some so they're like it's fucked these development ills man now it's done no never it never happens now you know you never hear about them no I got one in 93 I got a development deal in 93 Wow yeah for the festival Wow yeah I went to the festival with a deal that's crazy yeah I got to deal with Disney yeah now they that shit never happens it was the weirdest thing in the world because it was I went from being fucking broke yeah like you know oh I'm making $300 this weekend if I go to this place and do a set on Friday night yeah and then you know you got six figures yeah did you think were you like this is crazy right now I think I got a hundred the first time and then there was a second part of it where I got fifty it was just like what yeah it's I was eating lobster every night didn't you say that I think all right he thought I had a gambling problem so funny it's like nope just like like okay yeah and he was like how are you spending so much money and I was like I'm just spending money like this is how I'm gonna live from now on yeah he's like that is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life why I was right yeah cuz I was right yeah you're right it just took a chance yeah that's so cool it could have turned out terribly wrong but the the the thing that was weird about it that was the most incredible thing was that once I started working and once the money that the check came in and I didn't have to think about my bills anymore there was a physical feeling of relief like a physical feeling of relief yeah to go from being broke and have no idea how you're gonna pay your bills just trying to hustle up a $100 sad or a $75 set somewhere to go from that to just not having to worry about money yeah instantaneously suit Aeneas Lee you know after taxes having you know X amount of dollars in the bank and just going what that's in the bank yeah that's crazy I know but then the feeling like a lightness of being like like I felt physically lighter like it's so much of your like it consumes you for so so much of your life is like then there's this bill and there's that bill it's like it's on your mind all the time yeah you know like I know I got these weeks of work lined up but like and that other things gonna come up so I better I need to call it because it's all you think about but I think it goes the other way too I think that when you get to like this Jeff Bezos level I think then all the sudden it's a burden because I feel like there's a lightness the lightness is like Bryan Callen had a saying once and it's I've repeated a bunch of time because I think he nailed it he said you want to get rich enough so that you don't have to worry about your bills and you don't have to worry about how much things cost when you go to eat at a restaurant yeah that's great because everything else up to that is bullshit that's true it's true yeah yeah all that other stuff like acquiring stuff and yeah jewelry and shit like that like we're dealing with all that no you're right and it's like there's that thing to when like you have enough money to go to restaurants and sometimes you'll go a restaurant and they're like and the special is this kind of neat and there's a lobster on the side and it's sixty nine ninety five and you're like not a problem yeah I always feel like it's weird when I tell you the price I know you're like freaking gonna embarrass me here at the table I'm good but it's it's an odd thing like sometimes they tell you the price and sometimes they don't sometimes they just tell you the special we have a rack of lamb sounds good nice restaurants a lot of times there's multiple items just as a market price yeah that's a weird one and you can just be like I want that and they're like you said so they just bring it to you and you're like that's $400 like what yeah what kind of market is this it's crazy but don't you think that if you get to the point where you were worth 105 billion dollars just to focus on you alone it's a lot yeah it must be overwhelming must be overwhelming and also it's like to the Bill Gates thing is like it is the thing that everybody probably wants to ask you talk about oh yeah it's like everyone knows you have a 15-inch dick is limp it's crazy it's like knowing that about someone it's all everyone so yeah I think that energy you feel that everyone's like you're super rich yeah cuz we're all fascinated especially in this country with you know accumulating wealth it's like I feel like it's I feel like it's heightened here yeah for sure well I mean think about how much of the culture is about ballin yeah you know I mean it's all about young entertainment culture is all about diamonds and stepping out of whistles dude I don't know his name they showed him getting a jewelry that he bought and you saw that and it has an emblem with a 69 and it spins and he's got like diamond teeth and then he had like he had like 200 grand in his waistband he just took it out was like stacking the money it's just like it's a fascination with like how much shit I have and should I could buy like that's part of the culture now it's been going on for a long time it has been yes coming up from poverty that's what it is right it's the the idea is that these guys were all like super poor and then they made it and here this is what happens when you make it it's cut you know what it's kind of also we see that in like hip hop a lot here but it's also what you saw with a major drug traffickers they all come from extreme poverty all of them El Chapo Pablo Escobar super super super poor and they accumulate in crazy amounts of wealth and then they're like look at all my shit yeah I know it's like you see this like the parallel it's the same thing yeah like when Pablo Escobar oh my god when he had hippos and shit mm-hmm yeah he had when he built his prison you know he was about served time but I'm building it and there was soccer fields and then he would fly in national players like play soccer with me today yeah okay and even after all that he was like man I want to be yeah I'm gonna get out here I'm leavin yeah somebody helped built his own prison yeah Colombia they'd had parties Joey Diaz got me on this show because I watched narcos which is a great Netflix series and then there's another series called surviving Escobar and it's it follows Escobar had a right-hand man his right hand hitman killed like 300 people for him named John haidle Velasquez Vasquez and it follows him from like the day they got Escobar and this guy turned himself in and it shows him in prison and how he just ended up starting another cartel from basic from within prison it's a fascinating series yeah that's it there's a new Netflix question I think what happened was that I feel like it was a seems like it was a Colombian series that they acquired is what it seems like I'm not sure but it's really good I mean it's it's all in Spanish with subtitles but it's and that's the real guy in that picture right there is that guy still alive yeah his nickname is Popeye and he fucking murdered so many people and they had such a dedication to their bosses that's one of the things they followed them like religious leaders you know like if he's in an interview Popeye this guy saying if Pablo Escobar had told me to kill my dad I would have done it whoa like I wouldn't have hesitated either like they have such devotion to the boss does that movie that's coming out now about the lady from cocaine Cowboys the fuck we sell de Blanco who sell does yeah and it's Jennifer Lopez knows Catherine zeta-jones right and she actually they made her like not as hot really yeah I mean it's she's like 80 now years old she weighs 650 like bird yeah you know we took pictures but a picture before we went to the game together pose together right I have a t-shirt on Bert has like a hoodie like this with pockets and then a jersey over it so it just looks so much everybody everybody was like Jesus Christ Berg did you put on for that picture because he has like six layers on right it was all they were all you look pretty slim there though already got fat for a while did he yeah yeah re gone into serious candy addiction Oh quite a bit mmm which is fucking terrible for you that sugar fat just getting fat from nothing but sugar yeah but he just decided to cut it out as the weight yeah you look good you look good that was a long time ago though but the way he did was pretty interesting just said I wanna be fat anymore that's a good way to do it didn't join Weight Watchers didn't do anything here's a body that responds to that pretty well too though you know like I feel like there's different there's definitely different body types and he's the kind that could probably make a slight adjustment and see things sway well I guarantee with bird it's booze with if bird just cut off the booze I mean he would lose a massive amount of weight he goes so hard he goes so hard it's crazy it's a bizarre yeah he goes hard man to the point where I was really stunned that he made it through sober October Oh stunned I think he really responds to challenges yes he likes he likes the challenge like you know he always joke how he speaks in hyperbole and he's always just like yeah if you go like I bet you can do like definitely do it it's always mediate yes without consideration of it he's like I can definitely if I can do that yeah now Ari said when we were hanging this weekend he cuz birds like I'm definitely doing definitely doing the LA Marathon and I think it's in April and always like if you do that I will show up in rollerskates I will fucking kill you man there's no way there's no way and we were you talking about like you can casually roller skate a five minute mile yeah - really not even yeah blows no sweating no he's like good after after 10 miles I mean your feet will hurt like so just push through it like why why do you think you can push through something and somebody else can't well just fucking push through it well beat you I was like I'll go take a nap and get back and then still be like no well he ran a half marathon he did and he did surprisingly well I didn't think he would do that how long did it take him to run a half marathon want to say it was like in the 240 something like that right something like that maybe to 35 to 45 something that so is that is that a clean split like can you say oh that means you would do a 5 hour marathon not necessarily slower yeah you'd be so yeah at second half everyone that I've talked to said especially that last stretch like that was last 5 miles are supposed to be the most taxing you know yeah I mean while my friend cam Haynes is running a marathon it's really great really crazy really crazy fucking psychopath I know and you watch him you know I pull up his Instagram and I'm like just fucking positive man just do it yeah he's getting up every morning before work he has a regular job he's running fucking miles and miles at 6:00 in the morning and I heard what say and the only thing that like made him seem human was him talking about there was a time when he said it was hard to run a mile or something yeah he was like yeah I remember when it was hard to run a mile I'm like seriously you had trouble running a mile yeah when he first started running like everybody else Ryan's a weird thing man maybe doing it a lot more yeah but when I do it now - its I'm kind of amazed I think back like where it used to be difficult and it's not difficult there anymore like well how come it's not it's almost like your brains like well what happened like what changed yeah how come I can just run up this section now and hustle through here and push through around this corner and get up to that Ridge and go over the top and then to the next top and that's where I stopped now yeah why did I get so much further yeah you brought your body does it's almost like your brain doesn't want to believe that your body can get in better shape right like you know you can you know like when I workout and have worked out for a long time and I'm I'm fit and I'll do like rounds in the bag or something like that I know I'm not getting as tired as I used to be but I don't want to believe it right it's that is weird why your body is like your brain is it's like trying to keep you from progressing in a way I don't know it's like your brain has memories of the times where you were getting tired doing stuff that you're not getting tired anymore I'm confused what's happening here I've been doing I hired a trainer and part of our workouts has been bike Sprint's like stationary bike errands fuck man do you get an Aerodyne sprint or do you do just like a regular bike sprint I mean it's a stationary bike so I don't know what type of Ike it is but it's like it'll be like a maxout 30-second sprint and recovery I've never felt as close to dying and really oh it's like I mean especially I'm like the third sprint it's like you know lungs heart mods are it's just like yeah I I have a whole new respect just for cyclists just doing those fucking stupid Sprint's I do it's just it's so taxing you know it's just where'd you get this guy I found him just searching and I met him and then started doing where he's just been giving me like one on one and I've been doing just mixing it up so like we'll have like strength days where it's like power days you know like higher weight lower reps and then he'll throw in core stuff and then we'll do high rep day so I like the mixing it up like I get bored you know and of course it's been fun to like work out with somebody who I mean knows his shit and it's been like super challenging what's his name you wanna know his name just give me his first name there's two dudes two different guys two different guys you go to two different guys you have two trainers I got three extra hashtag Paulin I guess so I'm talking about guys how your kids gonna relate to you man the guy had three trainers dance auntie horse daddy's got a six-pack oh yeah I got a trainer I got Micah Sean and Kelly so how do you mix it up why do you go to three different people as you can - yeah just to make it challenging and different yeah just did a different shit really that's the truth really yeah just to do different shit because I know that I'm gonna get something different out of them on different days and how many times a week are you working out now if you've got three different trainers you must be hitting them at least once a week I'm doing like three or four days a week yeah shape mm-hmm I'm super strong man yeah I don't know why but just because your family's yeah some girl goes oh my friend that works here at this bar is a big fan of yours - Burt will you sign the back of this to her he was like how about a video and then she goes okay takes his shirt off in a black cigar bar in Atlanta okay and like everybody yes and then he takes the camera and he goes like up his stomach but of course she looks like that's of course and if you were this is him and oh yeah I saw this like what happened here dude he just he's we're buying booze buddy was dancing oh yeah I'm just him he got the vibe going man I'm telling this his natural element he's also about 19 drinks in nineteen dollars yeah boy he looks hammered yeah I mean that whole that whole store was dancing with him there was people walked in and knew him are he's drunk to look yea good hearted dancing he dances like the whitest fish fan ever that's so true it's like jumping up and down with his legs together these guys knew him yeah hmm it was he was in this he was in heaven man boy what what a weird life that Bert Kreischer lives he's really is the party guy oh yeah there's the machine I think for a while I was like that's your act I'm your friend but that's your act and then I hung out you're like that's really who you are man you really the party guy he enjoys it yeah but it's so rough on your body I don't know he pushes through man it's amazing he gets up the next day I was like okay I'm really feeling it but you're like you don't notice right you know you know what I did when we went out to breakfast on what was it Monday I think it was Monday yeah that's a breakfast the day of the game and my friend Justin lives in Atlanta comes over picks us up we sit down at this breakfast place coffees and we order breakfast he orders eggs and like you know toast and bacon or something then he's like alright and then as the waitress walks I go oh oh could you send him a waffle also like in front of him you know he's like what I go you like waffles scarfin yeah yeah I know he wants to do another challenge he was definite about doing something he keeps bringing things up and makes these videos re through one at us yeah yeah which I think actually would probably again it's something that would benefit him the most but other people would get benefits from it too was the go phone free social media free for a month oh that's re re does that all the time that's like me asking you guys to do jujitsu ya know but I think like I I respected the challenge in terms of like yeah I do look at that shit too much I think you know yeah it takes it takes too much of your focus away which like already talked about and then of course Brett was like easy like it's not easy for you you're on it he brings his charger with him when we go when we went out I was like why he's like coach my battery runs out like you have 70% how we're gonna run out he's used it a lot he's always on it so I was like that's actually a good challenge for you because you are consumed with it but he was like I don't know he was pretty hesitant to accept that one the problem with that is it's a it's a tool for work that's the point but Ari's thing was like well you could have your assistant the guy that helps produce your podcast you could send him things and be like hey you got to post these things you could post these promotions for my shows and blah blah blah but you can't be on there consumed by likes and consumed by comments and and that whole thing I don't know it was just it was it's not a bad idea it's not a bad challenge good luck with it I'm out yeah I don't know I mean I think the physical stuff is really really interesting yeah the physical stuffs the most interesting even like even for me a guy who does yoga on a regular basis doing 15 of them at a month was like wow I got a lot to make up well it would be another good one I don't know but let me tell you something that the last nine days I did nine days straight you know of yoga mm-hmm and it wasn't the last nine days I had plenty of time to go but I just decided to burn it all out in one shot I was like I'm learning a lot about myself like I've never done anything that's that hard 90-minute hot yoga classes nine days in a row with no days off okay if you just don't give yourself a day off your body starts to adapt to not having a day off you can accomplish way more than you think you can yeah that's what that shit taught me you ever have like those I remember being on the road once and having a deadline for a writing packet it was some type of submission or they were like I was getting paid well you got to send it in by this guy like tomorrow yeah and I was doing so much writing in the hotel room and that when I submitted it and everything was fine I was like man I could get a lot of work done in these hotel rooms good but I needed that experience to tell me that yeah cuz all the time I'm just sitting around these fucking hotel right you're just watching TV flipping through the channels not doing shit watching those fucking pawnshop shows yeah like I just wrote fucking 20 pages yeah yeah yeah if you just make yourself do it or you have like for me I have to have a don't have to but one thing does help is want to have a schedule of shit that I've wrote down like I have to work on my act for an hour a day for five days you put that in there yeah like that's I give my eye I think that's really reasonable I give myself five hours of writing a week that's always do since light it's light work I've been working on it more since I know my special my special comes out tomorrow Oh number three in the pipe bitch yeah yeah I'm excited I'm excited for it but I also have that that special anxiety you're like oh oh it's back to square one but that's where the material comes from right totally yeah of course and I actually I personally don't know everyone works this way I definitely work better when it's up when it's 100 percent out in other words not like the month to you know it's coming out in two months when it's actually out I feel the fear and the drum I have more I create more yeah when I when I know it's all it's gone now yeah it really fuels me me too yeah same thing but it's the scariest fucking thing in the world hair yeah yeah it's it's scary because you're you're so terrified of being up on stage with what I what I call without weapons yeah nothing yeah so you have to like really focus on getting that shit done yeah and then I find myself going to the store with notebooks I'm going over the shit before they just really tightened in yeah I'm doing a couple spots tonight like yeah I have like like one day yeah and then one day yeah tonight you can go up and just whip out some polish smooth yeah I can sharpened weapons well I actually thought about it and it's like you know I've been I have been for the last especially month or so really focused on the new stuff and I go so tonight's the last night do I feel like doing like well I do I want to say that thing one last time and I was looking over like the the bits and I was like not really I think I'm done you know yeah so I'm trying to focus on just all new now well it's we're being forced into this position yeah in for a good thing because you have fans because the fans want to hear new stuff and it just makes me think about that are you always used to pity those old guys back in Boston that never wrote yeah that they had that same hour that they would do for a decade that's worth so nuts to me it's crazy to think about now because back then there was no social media and none of these guys got on television so if you didn't go to see them live you did not know their material yeah yeah that's really wild it's crazy to think that that was the norm and that guys would polish an act together and put it together and then they would just work and they would never write and I fucking never write I feel like the norm now without question I feel like it was kind of debated for a little bit is definitely when it special comes out like that shit is gone yeah I think that's accepted now that like you're done with that totally well I had a conversation with someone at the store a year ago she did a special and then after the special she was still doing the same material I go what are you doing I go she goes why don't think most of people see now I go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I go I guarantee you if they're coming to see you they're paying to see you they've seen your work yeah like it should I why I'm in new material well why the fuck are you touring yeah like you can't be touring no well the same exact act that was on Comedy Central just six months ago and you can't no no especially people are paying you know they it's it is weird and that you will I ran into it a bunch of times but it's definitely the minority which is the person who's like why didn't you do that one bit right you're like because because you know it go watch that on Netflix yeah yeah I I think I don't met had told you but I did one people were asking me to do some bits when I was touring I think it was not 2017 2016 they were like do are you gonna do this bit in that bit so I just doing one show at a club I was like I'm gonna try this this thing out this encore thing so I did my help I did my new show and then I said so people will ask me to do some bits that you know or whatever I forgot I got into it so and I got this huge round of applause and then I would be I would start it and there would be like a big big applause I would go through the bit to complete silence like they were just watch me do the bit they know and then when I would end it another round of applause I was like that's horrible like that was the worst feeling ever and the reason because there's no laughs cuz there was no surprise like they're like yeah of course they knew the whole thing yeah I did like the next bit I was like you might you know whatever no this one and it was the same thing like oh yeah we do know this one and then I go through it and they were like yeah I know that was my one attempt at doing you know yeah I don't even know how to do them yeah no it was and and then that people were like I was like I forget the next line they're like it's this like people knew the bit better than I did yes somebody asked me something about the bit about people breaking into the White House the woman who was guarding the front door the white house by yourself that's on their last yeah and I had to go back and watch it again I was like oh I forgot all this yeah I literally forgot how it worked I forgot all the different beats and it's not in like in a day it's not gonna come together well no terrible I did a private event in Vegas for these rich guys and I was like just flew in and I was talking to them like five hours before the show and I was like just you know I mean like I'm I'm doing my current show and they're like oh we were hoping you do this this this and this though and I was like all right so I went up to my hotel room pulled up Netflix started watching and making notes and then I downloaded the album so I could listen to it and I would walk around and I was like I didn't know like forgetting the thing that you think is a throwaway is actually like a connector yeah the thing fuck and I was doing like half-assed versions of it at the show Wow they were still like onboard with it but I was like that's not how that goes I knew I was fucking about how many specials do you have out now you have thrilled which was a kid CD CD right and white girls white girls CD CD and then two hours there completely normal completely normals a special mostly stories a special and disgraceful it comes out so five hours of recorded shit yeah like stop and imagine that if you had to like do your whole catalogue like a Bruce Springsteen concert yeah you know I mean the thing about like a Bruce Springsteen or any of those guys is that on any given night you could bring back that one and really get it sharper again for like five nights yeah and then kind of drop it and then do it you know I mean yeah we go like that's old I don't do that yeah and it just it just goes further and further away from your mind but they have to if you go to see Bruce Springsteen and he doesn't play Born to Run yeah like what the fuck kind of piece of shit show is this I wonder I wonder because I feel like the well yeah then again though he's famous for doing like for our shows yeah so maybe he never does skip it because fuck suck I have so much energy and I mean he's on those Trump diet pills he's got to be he definitely looks tired in every photo of course and I'm married he's married he's doing floor yeah he's always like doesn't know should I just bail on all this God God incredible this is the the the inside story about Bruce Springsteen and his concerts is always that people get bummed out on his wife they're like they like Bruce without his wife they're better than they like Bruce with his wife they're like a friend of mine her like his energy change yeah her friend is a crazy Bruce Springsteen fan she goes to like tons and tons of concerts sees him every year all like multiple times a year always I'm crazy and the people that are like super hardcore see there's a different energy that he has Wow I got the wife sick the wife sick is she sick she's not here yes I think you fucking pumped when the wife's not there sings with his wife right wife's a part of the band right she does what the the tambourine or something that's important can't imagine touring and working no you know with your wife all the time my wife and I we always talk about how like it's really unique we can do our podcast together and we have fun doing it yeah but like when anyone but she leads this it's not like a guy I think when someone will be like hey do you guys ever tour together she's like that's gay is fuck she's I don't know we're we're two different people we do our own show like no it's like not well you guys are in a rare situation - we are both really good it's usually one of yous really good and the other one is a yeah bad okay yeah she definitely not too bad she's and she's uh I can't wait man she selling tickets yeah Adhan shows I'm just ball now you give me my night you give me shit yeah no I'm excited for I think she's one of the best comics in the country and she's awesome man she really is yeah christina pazsitzky don't sleep on her no yeah yeah I mean I remember saying that to her one night like four or five years ago at the store she fucking crushed in the or and I came up to her upset we go no bullshit you're one of the best comics alive yeah that's set that you just did right now does one that like it's not just funny but it's insightful she's smart she points out shit that other people aren't poison real writer too yeah right so like writes a lot how does she bright does she sit in front of the computer and paper and a computer and then a pen and paper but yeah a lot of notes lot of writing a lot of actual like you're talking about spending that time working on you gotta do you know that's the difference between someone who produces a lot of material and someone who doesn't like I've had these conversations with people before with like oh I only write on stage I was like alright yeah why is that because it's the only way it works or is it because you're lazy and this is how you justify it it's probably more that more that yeah yeah that I write on stage stuff it's like you know I do too yeah I write on stage stuff but don't be like they give it out is it but the thing that drives me crazy is I see them giving it out as advice to other young comics don't write on paper dude okay right but is that the only way and is it the best way and isn't it possible that you're missing I think what happened was to was like when Louie got like really really popular and he was just like I never write anything down that became like folklore and a tent-like attractive to comics I feel like oh I got to do that so he said he never writes anything yeah doesn't write doesn't even write down like bullet points really yeah just all of his head so then people are like you know I think I think I heard I started to hear that more when his fame really exploded and that was a big thing you know I was like not you don't eh it down no okay well I guess if you're doing stand-up every night three or four nights a week or three or four times a night like you're doing those New York sets and you're constantly working yeah it's like constantly in your head you can get away with that I would I guess you could but like I would I always like having um at least a bullet point list mm-hmm like even at when I wasn't writing anything long form down I still like to have that oh what can I look just to see it all yeah like look how the you know how the how the movie plays out and I should move this over here and this should be right here I couldn't imagine not having any of that written down but I just think that the more time you spend focusing on it whether it's the more time you spend just writing stuff down or looking at bullet points or the just the more intention you put on things more attention the more focus definitely it's gonna you're gonna have it's gonna be better you're gonna know it better it's like getting good at anything yeah you know you put a lot of time into it yeah it happened for you yeah comedy writing those one of the weirdest ones cuz everybody does it a different way yeah you know everybody's got their own weird sort of style and it's no one can tell you exactly how to do like you you could never tell Theo von how to write a joke right no especially him his acts so odd yeah you know I know then you're like mispronounce things but like yeah that's like but it's it's like disguised so well yeah you know it's like it's shit like that were you just like how do you come up with that yeah was it an accident the first time like that you know and then like I remember Carlin he's right on no cards onstage with no cards and clubs and then kind of shuffle through them like that's shit and throw it on the ground I saw him and I saw him one of his last tours that Universal amphitheater and he for like his last because he called them like individual pieces like his bits were it was really heavily about the writing yeah like the specific wordplay the flow you know rhythm patterns Oh his comedy was very melodic like that and when it got like when it was like one of his closing pieces it was like five pages he brought out the pages and he's like I'm gonna read this because that's how I memorize it because I memorize it by doing these shows and reading this so just so you know for this thing I'm gonna look at like he told the six thousand people that Wow and then he would you know but and then flip the page he said how was it it was funny man it was great it was what it was like the second-to-last special and I remember the like it was a it was a really well constructed piece of writing is a little threw you off a little bit to have him be reading it you know but he I would say when he when I saw the show that piece was probably at least half committed to memory and he was still trying to like you know repeat repeat repeat so that it would be in his memory it was still really funny it was still really funny well he was also helmet how old was he like 69 70 right I think he died at 70 so didn't yeah he looked he looked older because of you know he went hard in the paint too had a pain pill problem for a while I remember there was a time when he committed himself to rehab and I think was wine and pills mmm he was taking pain pills those goddamn opiates man they have people they don't get you yeah but you gotta think that your memory must eventually at some point in time start to give out yeah when you're doing these long monologues oh my god long long monologues he would write out his whole act like the whole hour and then just start doing it mm-hmm yeah it's like if I do one every year like reading a like a book almost and he said sixteen months was a turnaround yeah well one yeah yeah every year he ended up doing 14 specials that's crazy yeah what are you up to now you have quite a few like if you combine albums and specials one two three four five six seven I'm on my eighth it's a lot it's a lot you're gonna catch him do number eights coming up yeah you know where you're shooting it yet Boston are you are doing in Boston yeah was I just change my mind ooh sorry Boston would it be at the world birth yeah if I'm if I I have one other idea in mind that I'm still bouncing around on my bed at my house I'm thinking about that really yeah be great and you kids room while he's sleeping that's awesome what did you think of Chappelle's two specials I thought it was really interesting to see him do this big polish special in a big place and then do the little special in the belly room I was like this is this the belly room felt weird man well I mean I personally my take on it is like the second one the belly room and we're in the practice of calling that a special but it's really not a special in my opinion what you're seeing is what here at least indefinitely in Los Angeles if you live in San Francisco Denver New York places he likes to frequent what is what you see Dave Chappelle known for in these cities which is he would drop into clubs and like spill out everything that's on his mind so I mean I don't know if it's more like semantics but it's like it's not a special to me it's like you're seeing one of the best guys ever do a workout set like do a loose riff it's only been six seven weeks since the special was shot that is that plays before it right win which he toured for like a year with that you could see how like polished and you know I mean so I think it's really cool if you're a big stand-up nerd to see the other one like that's what happens a lot in those cities that he he'll just fly into and be like yeah here shit that's on my mind and and that so you're seeing like it's it's it's masterful but I think it's like I don't call I think of it as separate than a special you know like because it's special to me is like you tour you prepare and then like you present it right I mean I know I understand that you'd be like well yeah it's a separate thing it's a special but I'm saying within that there's something really specific going on which is like this is like in the moment almost all topical commentary and like that's how that dude works he he's just well he will walk into a club be like I wanted to get on stage and like just talk about he oh he loves topical stuff so it fits perfectly but it was it's very different it's I mean you can see the the total different the contrast especially if you watch one after the other yeah you know you're watching toured proven like worked out stuff and like here's some shit I thought of basically last week right right right but a whole hour of it which is really crazy yeah I so prolific yeah and the the fact the way it worked is doing the two of them together that way you get to see the big polish special and then you got to see the fuck around workout set so it's like if you watch the big polish specially like I need more yeah it's really interesting to see I think just to hear people go back and forth on which they liked more I thought that was really interesting I've seen a bunch of people at least online I'll say they like the ballet room you know well the belly room was so intimate to be in that room I was there for one of those shows it's so interesting to be there when you're watching someone film in front of 70 people yeah it's so tight and small you know you're kind of naked a little bit you know yeah and the people in the audience were they were fucking on the show I mean the people that got those front-row seats they were they were featured prominently in that net oh yeah yeah kind of makes you entertain the idea of like a really small special what that would be like yeah there's there's different kinds of comedy right this like the comedy that you do for 70 people is just not exactly the same as the comedy that's known for 700 or 7000 and the way you present I mean he was he basically sat for most of that yeah so that's that's different you know I mean usually if you're in a big 2,500 seater you know I got like chill sit on a bench less you're Marc Maron Marc I think yeah trans or Cosby old-school Cosby yeah yeah he was always sitting even as he got old yeah and Cosby did it not just old-school Cosby but old old cop yeah old old Cosby you're right do you think Cosby auteur again no no I think that's done it's over yeah yeah I think so well I remember when he was touring from allegations would not I think would think it's not worth the trouble really I think so yeah I think Louie or again you think so mmm-hmm yeah yeah I think so too yeah yeah I think he'll take like a year off yeah and then he'll do some shows and people get mad and then it'd be yeah and then like if you know the real thing is like the corporate side of it like in other words channel or network that would want to let's say host show the special but he has such a dedicated no one's website following is like what he ended up developing he's sold shows and and made millions you know when people were doing the like download my special thing mm-hmm I think he could book a venue shoot something and go back to his five dollar model and do really well no I'm sure he could and people would be really interested to see it of course Netflix would have him on they still have his old stuff her wife years old stuff yeah I mean I yeah I was on a flight after right after all of it went down I watched is the special from DC which I thought it was really interesting to watch it knowing the DC one was that the latest one okay 2017 huh but just to know that it was like right around the corner that he was gonna get busted yeah yeah beating off in front of people is this it's a weird thing to get caught doing - yeah got all the things that people have done that they got caught doing all the rape accusations and all the horrible shit like his is the most pathetic and also kind of the most innocuous yeah just humiliating just beaten off in front of people I know it's like his kink it's what he likes but it could be way worse you know like what what he actually did not saying it's a good thing to do people know hey watch me beat off yeah yeah I know a bunch of people he did it - apparently laughed yeah quite a few comics that I've talked to that know people that he did it - yeah I knew somebody they did yeah yeah and what'd she think not happy but like you know I don't know man it was like weird I knew it for a long time that story yeah and I mean I said it before I was like what I mean I knew it and then like every other person I talked to in comedy knew it and we were all like that's fucked up but also I mean this doesn't excuse it at all either but there is something about something at least as you know that something somebody did a while ago yeah so it's like Oh am I supposed to bring this shit up to him right you know like how do you know but but the other thing is how do you even know that they did it because one of the things that happened during the whole like did he do or did not do it thing before it came out was someone had told me that it was bullshit and that what he had done is take some pictures with female comedians with his dick out just being silly and stupid and like and and then tell him please delete those pictures we're just having fun you know I don't get in trouble I mean the story I heard was very specific yeah and like you know is basically one of the stories reported and then the times and I was like I remember hearing that story and the person was not you know was pretty upset about it and and then a lot of people heard the story yeah and then I don't know you know another year would go by in two years and three years and you're like okay I mean that's bad but like SARS my role in it you know everybody who knows the story now it was just one of those things where you'd be like yeah that's fucked up story you know I mean it's not someone like hey you know that guy he fucking punched someone 15 years ago real asshole you know that sucks you know but 15 years ago is a long time right I mean kind of it's like is there is there it's not to like minimize the wrongdoing but like I sent there some part of the conversation about how people mature and become different people as they get older I'm sure a lot of people that are in their 50s and 60s you go like you know who are not celebrities you'd be like do you know that when this guy was 26 he did this fucking horrible stupid thing or something like Jesus but you're like whoa you know there's a long time ago now I mean that was kind of at least that part of the conversation exists in this it's like it's it it's something really bad he's being punished so that's we're not saying that it's it definitely has not been excused because he's being punished but it's also old behavior yeah like that's the Dustin Hoffman thing yeah Dustin Hoffman this is where it gets really strange a lot of his stuff was 30 years ago right what 1985 and shit it's like so I think part of the difference - between the Hoffman stuff and Louie and maybe everybody else is Louie's admission right that's very different because even like the stuff I heard with Hoffman he is like he's definitely trying to justify versions and the behavior and like that's what people did you know is that what he said oh yeah he's like you know on the set like you try to like get you know you have to break the tension or there's there's a monotony to it and so people would have these conversations and say so it's like he's trying to appears he's trying to be less accountable for what he said yeah whereas Louie was like these stories are true right so it's I think all those things end up affecting how your redemption goes because they're like if somebody's like I did this shit I was wrong right and I think in this country people love punishment like are you punished for the thing you did we hate like somebody getting away with something so part of him I think coming back will also be that people realize that he paid a price he lost deals he lost shows money right I lost a lot of fuckin touring money yeah it's that day is it probably at least a fifty million dollar day for him you know with everything together so this is that crazy yeah I mean what a weird kink jerk-off people yeah I wonder how you develop I mean do you think that you could even do that like I was trying to think could I even asked some hey do you mind if I jerk off in front of you and then just get hard and actually well that's the thing I imagine he had to be leaking right like before that liked to come that fast it had to be something he's thinking about like all day you know and like hanging out and then like hey do you want to hang out like you want to come back or whatever might come and like so as he's getting closer to doing it I'm sure it's it's it's the only fuel that's on his mind you know so it's like it's like to ask me that I'd be like well that's not Mike King so you're like hey could you go from fully flaccid to come takes our fucking weird kinks are weird you know like I had a friend and him and his girlfriend used to tie each other up they'd tie each other both up ball gags yeah the whole deal and he loved it he would talk about it with like great glee yeah I'd be like why are you like tying each other up like what are you doing yeah that's fucking great like it's just something about like trusting that person to put that rope in their mouth and like I wonder how much that how many of those kinks develop later like you realize it later as opposed to like the the more common theory that everything's tied to childhood so that like you have been you must been tied up or something as a kid once and then you somehow relate that to sex but I wonder if they--if like you can be 28 minutes tying thing is fucking awesome I guarantee you can you just date one crazy person like if you have one girl who's just a wild animal in the sack yeah I just wants to tie you up you're like all right let's do it yeah and she doesn't you love it and it's amazing and as we need answers where's Jim Norton when you yeah oh yeah he would go deep with this he gets all sweaty and shit and it's nice to bug and I yeah blinkin yeah yeah nobody embraces their kinks more than him though yeah I can admire that so yeah yeah everything whether it's trannies or any anything that he experienced trends that's a he says it knows training so he does yeah he's definitely supports the industry so yeah it's weird you can't say tranny the tranny is somehow or another negative yeah look these are noises what we make and now Chapelle was like that was a thing he like brought he got a lot of shit on the old one mm-hmm or the one from a year ago yeah and so he he brought up the topic and but he's a trans people yeah I was real specific on that part yeah I guess the last one he's like fucking Chinese man well there's certainly a lot of thought police and going on and there's language policing yeah and we have to wonder like how much of that affects the way people actually feel and how much like and how much of it is just people trying to control the way people communicate and and dictating the languages because like when you go to the far end of the spectrum there's these new gender pronouns yeah that there's there's looser yeah there's like 78 of them yeah which I think are utterly preposterous absurd absurd absurd you just you're make-believing you haven't you've make-believe language you're inventing all these new words and it's not like there's some universal agreement going on and everybody it's not like remember when Miz was the thing yeah there was mrs. and mr. but then there was Miss mmm and Mister was married or mister was not married and women were like well what the fuck how come we don't have one of those yes so they came up with ms miss but it never really stuck no look nobody uses ms no it has to be like a real formal you know raiven them would you say MS I guess they were ever in writing they might you know might write MS if it was like I don't know a piece of the journalism or something to it to indicate the person is single status I never hear that yeah but you don't hear it spoken no but they were trying to push for it for a while yeah and that was something that was like on the borderline of being accepted by the common vernacular yeah shit it is sir I am some wonder like how many people are just professionally upset at shit that's said wrong you know like they they're just their reaction to everything is like it's like their their job is to police and react right no fucking no no that's not okay what about it's like almost how academia exist today you see like the way that people are on campus is it's like fucking that is not a reflection of the real world no to consider everyone's feelings at all times why it's not how shit works no people get upset and get offended at things that's fine but like that everyone should like dial back everything they say to make sure everyone feels protected that's not how it works what's been really interesting in the last five days there's been a battle going on in my Twitter mentions that I haven't dived into it all really but yeah but lesbians have been going at it with transgender people Twitter mentions and this is like long-going conversation they're going back and forth and remarkably civil but what's interesting is all these lesbians one of the things they've been saying it's been worse dive in every now and then I read some of it and go and what tough this is crazy I gotta get out of here yeah but that lesbians were trying to say that a lot of the violence that happens in supposedly lesbian relationships is actually transgender men to women where they switch over and then they're beating up on their girlfriends and that they're bringing their masculine toxic violence into the world of lesbianism and they're not willing to be honest about it and there was all this like this crazy debate going on back and forth the study was citing statistics of how many wonder how accurate that is I don't know how many women in was she was a lesbian and she was pretty pretty not that you were a fucking expert 100% on facts if you're a lesbian right but she was pretty adamant she was a lesbian that's like right yeah well the other thing she was saying lesbians like women and she doesn't know any lesbians that want to date a transgender woman like that used to someone who used to be a man and is now a woman she was like that's not what we're attracted to we're good and actually women wouldn't that kind of negate the argument because they're like she's if if formerly male transgender women are beating up their lesbian girlfriends than there are lesbians out there there are some that are dating and attracted to these transgender women yeah that would it doesn't get it muddy there right yeah yeah yeah so she's saying like we're not into that it's like will your stats then don't back up your argument because that's clearly what you're indicating you're saying that these transgender women that were formerly men are dating women yeah I think she was saying and people she knows her friends so like Elizabeth and Sarah aren't into it so that's supposed to it's like how else could you know I mean you don't have like a poll like how many you gals out there and to eat and pussy like eating fake pussy yeah yeah that's a wild stat to consider I'd never thought of that yeah and there was this going back and forth with lesbians versus transgender women and then they started getting some people started getting hostile like let's just cut the shit you have a y-chromosome you're a fucking man and there's a lot going on there was a lot of you want us to assume and not just assume we want you want us to just go along with the idea that you absolutely are of the wrong gender and there's no way that you could just be crazy yeah there's no way you could actually have gender dysphoria there's no way you could actually have a mental illness it's impossible and that's that's one of the weird things about any group right you're gonna have a certain amount of people that are mentally insane they're mentally they're gonna oh yeah a group any any group there's a sir if you have a thousand people there's a certain percentage of those people that are just going to be insane yeah but when it comes to gender we're supposed to ignore that we're never supposed to think like you're out of your mind yeah no you're out of your mind yeah yeah you know you're definitely a woman born in a man's body and I dude I tell you I support all the trans rights and everyone doing all this stuff the only thing that I ever go like that doesn't seem right is with athletics oh yeah that's the only thing where I feel like it's not that I don't feel like someone should be able to play any sport and compete but like when a dude transitions to becoming a woman it's like I play basketball now it's like come on man yeah like I get it you're you you're the right to live your life and play but like you have all those skills that you developed as a man and now you're playing against frailer smaller you know yeah like that to say that like you can't bring that up that that's offensive is ridiculous to me well especially when it comes to fighting fuck yeah that was the big one and that was where I really understood like how bizarre and the defense is yeah how cult-like this this ideology is if I see you transition to a woman and fight women fucking to have what 12 murder charges that would be the fun part it doesn't make any sense now of course not the bone structure is so different and people that deny that are fucking crazy I know that's that is silly man like what if what if I like transition whatever any one man and there's a power lifting well people have done that and they're winning and breaking all these records Hawks they are yeah and why are we like why are we not stopping being like that doesn't know that doesn't cuz we want to save people's feeling exactly and silly what's really fascinating is in the process of being super progressive you you go towards the most maligned part a section of society which is like transgender people and so everybody else who also has been marginalized by society like women mm-hmm women get put on there they get put in a less protected category and transgender women right so a man becomes a more protected class of woman yeah then a natural-born woman herself that's very interesting it's crazy it is it's very true also yeah it's crazy because all these women that got beaten up by that man who became a woman started fighting in MMA fought two women before ever disclosing the fact that she used to be a man because she said it was a medical issue that had nothing to do with them which is just shows you how completely insane the logic behind all she still fight this Wow but now everybody knows she lost to a woman she did yeah an actual woman who wound up yeah I said actual fuck off yeah that's wild right that a woman beat good no she's not good cuz she's not a good fighter no she's just strong yeah like there's nothing you don't look at her and think like oh she fights like Chris cyborg or she boxes like Claressa Shields no she's not that unbelievably talented right she's just physically ways a different yeah she's a fucking man yeah she's a man for 30 years had children this was when I knew it was crazy I got in a conversation with someone in online with this woman was like she's always been a man I go even when she got another woman pregnant and had children with her and she was yes even then she was a woman she was a woman she's a woman that fucked another woman and got her pregnant okay why just hang up what what are we doing I know like this is so crazy you got a tap out of those kind like even Bruce Jenner when he transitioned to Caitlyn Jenner and then eventually got his his surgery right her surgery become she said even before the surgery though it didn't change anything I was always a hundred percent a woman okay then why a surgery well because you're thinking that gender is just with genitalia I mean mistake you personally and that's that what is it it's it's genders not just genitals that's in your mind right so so it's all so that's why you show reconstruction just said something fucking stupid and I just let you know how dumb that was so what is the difference someone said that there's gender and then there's there's biological sex and that gender is the operating system and biological sex is the hardware ten percent agree yeah makes sense outrage over transgender female weightlifter who destroyed their rivals by hoisting 19 kilograms more than the runner-up now she's a contender for the Commonwealth Games yeah yeah guess what oh my God look at the size of her fuck laurels it god damn gorilla say international weightlifting debut in Melbourne pounds more than the second place yeah why in the fucking holy fuck yeah can you imagine if you're a biological woman who's been training and working hard all her life yeah and then all sudden you have to compete with this and you're like I'm first place it's like and she's giant like look at the size of her head or formally male head yeah that's a giant woman that's just a way to get medals well it's sandbagging yeah that's what a lot of it is that's fucked up man that is that's what it is what a lot of it is that's enough and people don't want it not fair yeah sandbagging if you don't know what it means is like you would get that in martial arts tournaments like say you would have a tournament and the tournament would be like four blue belts only would you have one rank above white belt and then guys would be like a black belt in judo and they would enter into the blue belt division and everybody right about now yeah but he's sandbagging like you know what they're doing yeah and everybody knows what they're doing you see that shit and you you see there's there's a lot of that where people just want to win and the way they can win is by competing against people that are not on the same level sure if you don't think that people do that when they switch over from being a man for thirty years and then competing as a woman and not tell them and just start smashing these women so I don't think there's something in that you don't understand athletics you don't understand competition you don't understand sandbaggers and you don't understand the kind of people that wouldn't tell people about that in the first place sure yeah but they don't want to look at it that way they want everything has to go through the filter of being progressive so you have to err on the side of being the the most open-minded the most liberal and the most progressive yeah which I'm a hundred percent for if women want to fight a transgender woman if a woman wants to I think you should be able to ride bulls I think you should be able to skydive I think you should be able to do fucking bungee jumping I think you should do a lot you should be able to do a lot of ridiculous crazy dangerous shit you should be able to do flips with BMX bikes why shouldn't you be able to fight a man yeah why shouldn't you be able to fight a transgender woman a woman who used to be a man you should be able to if you're a man you're zero yeah if you're a woman rather than you're 130 pounds you want to fight 130 pound 100% man no no transgender no nothing if you want to do that you should be out too yeah you should be allowed to I don't advise it I think it's a terrible idea for you yeah you're gonna get pummeled well if it's a good fighter it's just what is this what's going on here bodybuilder we show me Jenn power the article says this person can't decide to compete as a man or a woman and this is what they look like I can't decide whether to compete as a man or a woman that's what he used to look like on the left yeah fucking Haim and then oh my god it was super jacked and now he is on the right and easy but he looks like he's still a man he hasn't transitioned yet he lives his life as both see this is where you're seeing that there's some of these fucking people of mental illness yeah there was an ideologue where this one guy who's also a girl switches back and forth and under pressure he changes like he's Paul or he's sending and this is what on what radio labs a podcast and but radio lab is so fucking left-wing and I love them they're amazing but they're so left-wing and so progressive that they are unwilling to note and and even even address the preposterous nature of this fucking person who's like I just switched now I'm Cyndee right now now back to Paul went back to Paul in the conversations in the conversation like I just turned over like oh you did oh you're this special creature that can just go back and forth and and switch genders or are you fucking crazy Paul / Cindy yeah we would never have violated Paige's wishes in the story it's an unfortunate understanding what he's what he pulled up is there note when they had to change the whole story remember they had to go back because they got mad that they extended them in the original how they missed gender if she goes back and forth they had to keep up at the moment so they misgendered how were they called her a him or him or her which one's the misgendering a miscommunication was between the reporter and the actual person they were talking to yeah the person is fucking crazy you can't just go back and forth and back and forth like cut the shit you know a masterís the upcoming they will remove references to the name she no longer recognizes does that mean that afterwards she decided to go full female that's what happened we can't you saw me Craig for man so at one point in time during the show she switches back to Cindy Sydney Cindy's light you can see looks happy Cindy's loose she doesn't care psychiatric help at this point at one point in time we here's the thing you're not allowed to say that when it comes to gender when it comes to anything else if you like oh I recognize it as a wood elf I'm a wood elf you know that's how I that's why I identify yeah I'm a sprite just be in the forest flying around with the butterflies like people go oh you probably has an issue that guy schizophrenic yeah but if it's a guy who's built like Brock Lesnar yeah who's like you know I've always identified as a small thin woman and people are like yeah whoo damn cool yeah you should respect that yeah we should respect that when it comes to gender gender is weird thing that we allow all sorts of very illogical havior well yeah like these 78 plus gender step by the way they're adding more there's more like they weren't enough there more gender pronouns now than ever before like if it's a guy at a bus stop who's like I am the president you don't go like should respect the fuck out of that right now right you just like ya identifies as the leader of the free world you should address that no you're supposed to be like hey stand over here yeah when it comes to gender we're supposed to we give like a lot of leeway let a lot of things slide get it's true yeah and I think it's for a good reason I think the good part of is that we recognize that there are people that really do wish that they were a woman and would like you to call them a woman and why not let let the guy become a gal sure and maybe they'll be happier that way and and it shows I guess it shows acceptance and kindness on our part to just allow that to happen true but the problem with that is the goddamn slippery slope and a lot of this weirdness that's going on is people trying to control the people's behavior and one of the ways they try to do that is try to get you to use words that they've made up yeah this is where you're seeing how preposterous it is the level the number of pronouns is also 78 I mean I just recently and somebody saying like I don't identify like I understand that concept it's not right to hard to understand but where it's like I also have free rein on a hundred words that you should possibly know to address me why yeah it's like what do you fucking why are you bothering everybody yeah what is that what you get off on will you become special that way yeah of course you get special right special privileges special attention you get it's just special consideration I remember I'm trying to remember if my yeah yeah yeah I've had on my profile on Twitter for a long time like if you read my first bio sense but nobody respects it well I didn't even know Zim yeah sim is a big one it's bit I know sirs azh ER or zer yeah Zim's yeah yeah those are these motherfuckers there's just so many what does it say we were really feeling dog cunts what does it say they're really feeling dog cunts and want to thank the people of Australia for bringing it to our attention well that we saw this this clip or this guy if you hit view there he's like doing this video and we just heard him saying I've never heard somebody say that he I can you play it or no I don't know he [Laughter] he's like fucking and then all these Australian people were like that's right that's one of the things we say like what does it mean I actually got really great explanations of it about how how common it is they rarely see this guy wrote well first of all guy goes no no problem that's that is how we talk here a dog in Australia is like a dirty rat or an ugly person or a dishonest person we use it to put people down so it's like you know if somebody you say dog a dog like it's like a shitty person ok so it says some row there's a lot of shit cunts here - I like shit he said it's to insults because dog is a common insult so Dutton this guy is a total this guy's a total bogan which is a like a white trash redneck now the guy said if you say you fucking dog cunt - the wrong type of Aussie you might get stabbed with a sharpened toothbrush multiple times and they said it's a snitch in bogan slang oh so a dog cunts a snitch a dog is a snitch yeah so a mad cunt is a good bloke a sick cunt is a like a professional BMX rider a fat cunt is Bert and a dog kinds of shitty person Wow if you see your mate and he ditches you for a girl and a night out and he's a fucking dog cunt if you see your mate your buddy ditches you for a gal it's a fucking dog cut night what's he supposed to do like what you can get laid supposed to hang out with you man you guys had plans I don't at certain point in time yeah like what if she's really hot like that changes everything heat up to more crime if she says she wants a hot banging out right now then your friends being a dog time for getting upset at you I think hmm interesting okay interesting you know what since I'm not working with her I'm having a hard time pulling hot chicks names for references on the fly yeah why the other day I said Jennifer Beale from Flashdance like where what hey man this special place in your mind that's hot I guess yeah I think we all go to like an era yeah I would do that Tim their fucking Kathy Ireland smoke show oh yeah yeah that's cousin there was a time when I was really struggling to her where yeah probably yeah I mean I'm sure when like that Sports Illustrated was coming out I was probably 13 or something so yeah that would have been primetime Wow that era looks like when you discover what a hot woman is woman is yeah she's like someone's mom now no definitely don't McPherson that's what she used to look like Yeah right there it's got to be so hard for those women to let that go yeah and to be that hot yeah celebrated for it and now to be just like a regular nice lady with poles nice gal someone's mom yeah I think of the thing about the S I said when the sports when the swimsuit issue would come out is that they they were kind of household names and kind of not so you felt like you knew something by learning their name do you know what I mean because it wasn't a movie star a swimsuit model was like learning that name I'm talking about like as a teenager mm-hmm you in a bizarre way you thought like you knew them better because you knew their name you know it's like I would be like Oh Kathy Ireland Elle Macpherson and then people would catch on but you'd learn their names and feel like you knew something oh no it's really weird really yeah I think so like you were better than people that didn't know their names I think at 12 and 13 definitely was it like a sports thing yes it's like knowing stats like that good six nine to 45 so you could really fucking movement you know you feel like you know more yeah that was always a thing right when you were young to be able to pull out for stats and and players names to know the entire lineup it's clearly crazy I know I saw this thing Artie Lange do you know that he can name for like 40 years who played in World Series and like like the two teams that played but I'm talking about you can be like 1958 he's like that was Cardinals versus Mets game for this hat like he knows he knows like a span of 40 or 50 years by memory Wow like that's some that's some really really ridiculous stats to know well he's a fucking banana baseball fan yeah but this level of it is really I've never seen anything like that before why doesn't he do like sports radio then he did for a while didn't he he was that thing that he did with Nick DiPaolo wasn't that like a sports radio show I'm not sure I'm not sure what is he doing now he checked himself into rehab right I think so cuz he was doing the show with Antonia yeah and then I think he checked himself into rehab I think so yeah which is good yeah he just did he did that last or the new season of crashing the HBO show Pete Holmes show he's one of the guests or one of the snow he's one of he's a catchment breath Oh is he I think so because he was on it the first season and yeah he returned he loves the drugs yeah and the hard ones he's a true addict yeah yeah yeah no wonder he's so funny though hilarious and that's like I said that that sports knowledge he has it's fucking crazy do you have sports knowledge you have a lot of sports knowledge no I mean I know some some random things right no I know some things like I mean I basically like I said I like college football and so like I can I can hold a conversation with different levels of college football fans like I can I could talk to a superfan and hang with them in that conversation but I'm not like I can tell you every championship game for the last one no no right I remember people teams winning and stuff for sure but I don't I don't have a level that you'd be like dude what type of autism do you have like that is like so like savant level shit where it's like you're such an expert in one field you know like all these weird stats he retained when that like that yeah you know there's you ever seen Al Franken draw the United States like that no he's got this weird ability to draw every state like he yeah all 50 states he draws the shape of them puts it together in the in he draws the United States by freehand really yeah that's very like his ability to do that like look at this look at this this is before everybody grab butts legitly that's already impressive yes that yeah no he does the entire country completely free hand and it's an accurate map of the country how is this possible because he's a real patriot this is one of the things that's kind of disturbing and sad about the soul Al Franken thing the worst they got out of him was that he may or may not have grabbed someone's butt when he took pictures with him I don't know if he did or he didn't this is basically incredible and he's resigning he's not gonna be a senator I know he's done and but they didn't get him on anything like completely horrible it was just like he may or may not have squozen someone's but few people's butts how many knives a few butts a few butts a few butts like five or six that's really impressive actually yeah it was very impressive and that means yeah I mean just California the whole deal look come on oh there's Alaska and Hawaii did you the state um yeah mm yeah well he was all high on his performance yeah he just was feeling I'm the fucking king of the world I could see how it could happen I had my butt grabbed a bunch I'm taking pictures of the women for sure after shows yeah I've never grabbed mine ah that's just not I don't do it but I could see how people's butts would get grabbed bill Bert was talking about on his podcast it's like this is a particular type of woman in her forties drunk little loud getting kind of crazy gonna grab your eyes I grabbed your ass they'll say like can I looks like I pinched your nipple or and they'll say something and before you can even say no boom they're going for it go for it yeah yeah yeah and they're always boozed up they're never like yeah that's always alcohol yeah yeah alcohol is the catalyst for all shitty behavior in decision-making by the way did you see that born strong doc you see that what's that born strong is this documentary about the World's Strongest Man competition no it's really fucking interesting man and then these guys are such fucking like not normal species of human you know I was like the Iceland guys yes they're doing those powerlifting competition and they do I like to go to the Arnold Classic every year these guys these guys are such fucking beasts man I mean it is like it it's not I mean this two dozen eleven hundred pound deadlift what yeah Eddie six-foot to 400 pounds yeah he's so unhealthy for you to be that well that guy is interesting he was a national champion swimmer whoa yeah as a kid like a thin guy yes lean and thin and he he's competing against guys most the guys he competes against are like that guys the next smallest basically everyone all the other guys are like six eight six nine 410 420 430 and the the the swimmer guy has to eat like all day and they explain the physiology look at that size of that guy 6 8 for 27 I mean they're just Jesus crazy so they're so crazy but these this level of competition is this is the guy from Game of Thrones right here he's a competitor to but it's like the physiology of eating that much to sustain the muscle mm-hmm eventually you have to put on the weight like you need the fat and they explained how you know this guy's like his physique is like that he's just kind of put together that way but mostly guys have these big barrel bellies and a doctor explains how at a certain level of consumption the these guys all basically get bellies you know like because people are like why they have to get fat and just as you think that they start explaining it so when you're that big and you lift in that much weight you have to be fast yes that's basically what the guy says hmm but the game of thrones guys not really that fast but I think it's but he's the one of the unique cases where he is actually like built to be a fucking Viking in other words the other guys are eating so much to sustain themselves be able to pick up and recover from all this crazy weightlifting he's a guy who bike is essentially born walking around 6 8 3 95 or whatever yeah like he's a unique freak huh the other guys have to eat crazy amounts of food I mean they show what one he's got he's it would blow your mind he force feeds himself like 9 times a day and he has to he said he has to yeah and has he ever tried did not do it and see like if he's less strong I think so yeah I think that force feeding yourself makes yourself stronger yeah yeah it really is interesting I mean like why why do you get stronger if you're fatter or do you need that much food to keep the muscles up and if you just eat that much food to keep the muscles up there's gonna be a certain amount of fat that's what kind of I think that's more of the the way it goes do they talk about steroids no not really no a bullshit documentary then I don't feel like they did fucking guys no one no one no one wants to admit it that's a weird thing about that world that's the swimmer guy look at him Wow he was all lean and yeah gay porno he's yeah not that he was I'm just saying if you were gonna there's a film about a guy working out in the backyard and a bunch of guys showed up to suck his dick that'd be the guy real-life the fact that one of those guys could just become a woman and just enter into women's weightlifting competitions and they would be like she's a woman she's always been a woman shibi the competition by an astounding 600 pounds was really crazy yeah beat the second runner-up by 40 pounds no big deal normal super normal that happens ya know everybody does it no no we're gonna look back on these days and it's gonna it's gonna be standing sort of observation on mass mass thinking like groupthink like what happens when people are scared of expressing themselves honestly yeah and in expressing controversial points of view because the time and the culture yeah like what it you know what what ramifications it has like by the way here's here's what's weird I'm and I don't know if it's good or bad it's not a judgment call but I am I know so many people whose children are now transgender a lot yeah like five or six we really I didn't know any before like Oh whole in California yeah yeah but one of them in Canada but yeah really important what's this Toronto Furies Jessica plot is a CWA chels first openly transgender player now she used to be a woman and now as a man used to be a man now as a woman and she's playing women's hockey okay fuck that that's crazy fuck people yeah hockey guess who's an all-star this year it's Jessica yeah take take that fucking Mountain from the Game of Thrones put them in skirt yeah see how many people he plows over like goddamn human bowling ball oh my god that is so funny it's just if you're gonna place boards there should be but they're on physical freaks that are women there's no doubt about that there's some women that are just physical freaks and there's some women that also takes steroids that's and that's another very controversial issue because you have women that are ingesting large amounts of male hormones and changing their physiology and then they also compete against women but then there's women or just women yeah what about them how about looking out for them how about not letting them get their head smashed in less not fair man that's bottoms down to it's not fair but it's also it's just it just shows you how silly people have gotten and about how weird we are about looking at things and that everyone is so and because they don't have they don't really have a personal stake in the game everyone is so concerned about being viewed as be incredibly progressive and open-minded yeah that they don't want to quit so it's a really interesting point because if you really put yourself in a competition you care about say like it's important to you to imagine yourself competing and something where it's important to you to win yeah they go but then we're gonna have this person and those are the circumstances you would you'd be the first one to be like fuck that yeah that is not fair and those women get talk called bigots yeah it gets it's really strange yeah that is very straight those women get like attacked online like I guess lunch women that didn't want to fight that transgender man who became a woman in MMA and they got called bigots and transphobic that and the transgender people that community is like super aggressive about defending that intellectual turf mmm defending that idea see that's an interesting place is like work where you go because you have to have empathy for let's say this transgender person who's like I want to compete and you're like yeah you should be able to compete but how is how is this circumstance fair to both sides you know to those women that that are they also want attention part of part of the wanting to compete is also wanting attention yeah and wanting everyone to know that you're a man to transition to a woman and that there's look there's a lot of energy in that there's a lot of people that are paying attention to that and and anybody who says no that's preposterous people they want their privacy when it comes to these matters and they they're not they don't want to be open to the ridicule bullshit bullshit they want attention 100% that's why they're competing yet they're doing it's why they're letting everybody know that the first openly transgender woman it's a lot of this is about means some of it is about transgender rights it's about transparency and showing people how many of those folks are out there sure a lot of it's about horseshit yeah there's a lot of attention a lot of it I mean for you to sign up for that competition when you know much what lovely attention-getting especially things like powerlifting and MMA like to deny that there's some sort of a difference in the male frame there's also a lot of horseshit when it comes to like what actually happens to the body yeah during transition and how much strength you lose and how much bone mass you lose and there's a woman named dr. Ramona crud SiC I think that's her name and they interviewed her and she's one of the very few people that's been interviewed about this it's an actual endocrinologist that's not a gender transition doctor because that's what a lot of them are a lot of the people that talk about these things and have these these discussions about these things that are hashtag experts yeah they're actually transition doctors so they have a vested interest in sort of expressing the ideology that there's no physical advantage and that these women you know they once they have been under these hormonal treatments for X amount of years they become physiologically a woman and there's no distinction between them and a biological woman but this one woman dr. Ramon acrostic she wrote an article for I want to say was it was either SB Nation or Bloody Elbow I forget what it was but they interviewed her and she was saying not only do not lose bone density but you maintain it because you're taking estrogen it's like well the idea is that like a man is more bone density they're thicker they're built different yeah and that you would lose a lot of that in your transition to being a woman but you don't lose the bone density because estrogen is actually what causes people to maintain their bone density when they're older when they're women like that's one of the things that happens to women when they get older you get osteoporosis yeah what part of the problem is that your your body doesn't produce as much estrogen isn't used to and so you have a lack of bone density one way to heighten that is a supplement with estrogen yeah interested actually maintains bone density yeah so it's a good but they're not the same as men because they don't have testosterone anymore and if they're not taking exogenous testosterone they're definitely I have a disadvantage against men but they still would have an advantage against men about against women rather they were a mechanical advantage of course but it's also a mental it Vantage there's a reaction advantage reaction time is quicker with with men than it is with women like there's a bunch of weird 3d space recognition advantages that men have it's like and then there's the thing that people want to pretend that there's no difference between men and women there's that group you know about that group no but that seems like so stupid to even entertain the idea no that's this is a common thing among the most ridiculous of the progressives is that there's no biological difference in the sexes what but it is dumb but it shows you how insane a lot of this thinking is is that this group think this mass progressive thought process yeah that they just accept things that they're totally irrational and then repeat them as ad nauseam like we played this one clip where there's it seems like it's a transgender man - a woman - man who's saying she was talking there's a Jordan Peterson debate and she was saying there's no biological difference between the sexes and I'd be happy to unpack that for you oh really oh you'd be happy to unpack yeah biology sure and just no difference at all in our biologists no it's not real okay there's no biological basis in Jin sex Jen what yes I'm sorry you transphobic are you a bigot is this an this is an expert no but she's teaching at a college oh that's yeah that would follow but that's what a lot of lots going on there's a lot of that going on in colleges where people are teaching unbelievably ridiculous shit I got a piece yep go for it Tommy buns hasn't done the three hour podcast so Wow there's now the kind of bladder for it we can't go laugh about it just go well it's too late we'll go live with Tyron and he comes in earlier later people were parking in front of our garage again fuck heads so young Jamie this game that Tommy buns and Ari Shaffir and Bert Kreischer went to this was a game that you were interested in as well I was watching it it's actually a really really good game they were they took the side of Georgia who turned out to not be the victors but the final five minutes of the game was insane in you as non football fan could probably watch it and enjoy it too really yeah now let me ask you this because this well I was gonna ask is there any other sport like football that has the kind of attention on the college level because does basketball have that kind of attention to people care as much about a championship game in March in March March Madness that's marketed damn but not baseball baseball no no they do have a College World Series but nobody gives a fuck about summer when no one's paying attention hmm but that's it as far as in terms of other sports right and there's no other ones yeah I was just trying to think wrestling is they'll got a little attention but it's very small but in their world they sell out arenas and whatnot it's just not televised right but in wrestling it's really only other I mean it's like wrestling fans that are into it and it's not a national thing even then knife I'm pretty sure not every college has a wrestling team just like they almost all have a football team and let's all have a basketball team they don't all have wrestling teams yeah you know one of the things that they were highlighting I was reading this article about the coaches and about how the coaches were getting these large bonuses for victory and they were it was they were saying how crazy it is that the kids that are playing aren't getting any money but that these fucking coaches are making shit tons of money and that the university profits massively from these successful football programs and yet these athletes who are damaging their brain damaging their body and then a large percentage of them are never even going to go on to a career in professional sports so I was just pulling this up this this summer I think it was right before the basketball season started this scandal it happened hit the world Rick Pitino is I think he might have been running the athletic program in some capacity I don't know if he was the ad but he was definitely that he's like one of the top basketball coaches in the country and he was getting 98% of the cash of this deal they had with adidas and she'd know about this deal that's so much he raked in 98% of the cash from the University of Louisville's current adidas deal how is that possible it's it's it's hard to explain how it can even happen if you watch the movie blue chips from the 90s they sort of almost tap into it but this that was at 15 years even before this is happening so there's a whole extra world going on look what he said this is funny the reporter asked him if some of the proceeds would be shared with the University he says in quotes it's for the athletic department junk reply how do you say his name Jurek Jurek replied yeah it's for these student athletes it's been earmarked for them ah in fact under the current deal with Adidas which explained which expires July 1st ninety-eight percent of the cash provided by Adidas goes to one person Rick Pitino the now suspended head coach that's fucking crazy look at the next sentence he's like God 2015-2016 for example 1.5 million went to Pitino under his personal services agreement with the apparel company law just $25,000 went to the program according to the contract obtained by The Courier Journal under the state's Public Records Act the year before the department got 10 grand and we got work he can recruit its so he can recruit the kids to this school because he's got the name and whether or not he's got some sort of ability to sell them also you know I don't know that but he can bring them in because he's got a almost a franchise of national championships or at least ability to be on national TV and tournament I'm telling you about like he'll get your eyes on there which gets you at the NBA contract which is the old old dream I can sell that they can sell that dream to them those NBA deals are the best fucking deals in the world the the guaranteed contracts to play and the shoe deals those shoe deals are big dude the shoe deals for those guys for NBA guys for the top-tier guys which is of course a very select few but it's 9 figures before they ever play ball like they're signing like hundred million dollar deals Jesus or they play professional basketball that's crazy yeah there's fucking amazing outrageous amounts of money I mean we were talking about Under Armour about how one what was the player that said nobody wants to play an Under Armour's Kevin Durant said that and they'd sank the stock like by saying that because universities have deals with sneaker comps and that no one wanted to play for Maryland because they didn't want to play with Under Armour who do you want to wear Under Armour and everything just went they've been struggling ever since really yes it's amazing to me the way Under Armour has been able to compete period like that is so outrageous that that's a former University of Maryland student athlete I think it was a student athlete and that he was able to start an apparel company athletic company and really actually compete with Adidas and Nike I mean that is so nuts it would be like you starting a fucking car tomorrow and you're like yeah you Porsche BMW or a joke are what you like like it's fucking that it's that's how nuts that is to break into that field really yeah fuck yeah it is man that they have that shit so locked down they have such deep pockets their their levels of endorsements and like what he started doing the Under Armour guy wouldn't even pay like now they have paid endorsed athletes but at first people were just liking the gear he was like one of the first ones that developed that you know that like tight fit breathe right like compression gear right and like he developed some of it and would they give it to like former like people he knew at University of Maryland were now like in the Pro I like this shit and so does my boy you know throw us some more of that and it was like that it was like you know just kind of a very organic way of developing of like somebody be like if you bake some and you're like that tastes good like you make me another one for me and my friends it was that I was reading something really interesting where they were saying that they're they're fuckin up the brand because they've put them into counts doors mmm that they're trying to raise the sales and by raising the sales they put them in the discount stores by putting them in the discount stores they're gonna change the way people look at the brand it's not gonna be worth as much that's probably very realistic man that's very interesting weird people think so weird no like if you saw a pair of Nikes at a discount store would you like cool folks north cure we're not like a what that wouldn't that means zero to me ya know and they had mean and Nike has outlet stores which is like discount now yes you know so that's that's kind of weird but it is true about how I mean the other one is like that big baller brand they're basically attempting to compete in the apparel world that's the VAR ball right yeah that's the guy that gotten that crazy thing because his son was arrested yes China for shoplifting yes the China he was in China yeah he was shoplifting and then Trump says he got him out yeah and the dad says he didn't get him out yeah it's that that's him man and then the dad is you know Trump's calling the data fool yeah what happened that Trump's I mean well that guy is very brash levar ball oh yeah yeah yeah but I mean I think you know that guy knows what he's doing man as far as as far as PR definitely he knows he's gonna say some wild shit and he knows people are gonna be like oh my god what did he say and then he knows that that gets him more press and like it kind of just feeds itself right and people act like he believed the fuckin crazy shit that asshole just said and he's like yeah that's what I do and that's why you keep putting me on the show it was like Trump when he was running for president it's the same school of thought and now though that guy so he has a son named Lonzo plays for the Lakers who's a first-round draft pick like a top-tier player from UCLA then his other son was two more sons one of them was on UCLA's team this year got arrested for shoplifting in China if he hadn't been released if it wasn't hi blissfully you know highly publicized thing he definitely could have gone to jail for a while in China they don't fuck around you know right so but anyways when he got out and came back Lavar pulled him from like from school from UCLA and also pulled his sixteen-year-old son out of high school and flew them to Lithuania where they're now playing both of them are playing professional basketball in Lithuania and professional professional air quotes Jamie did the air quotes that's gotta be in a big air quotes yeah well I mean there's definitely some some good players that come out of there but it's like I mean it is a circus over there if you see like how it was when they arrived it was it's like some it's crazy the reception you know so what is he trying to do now he's trying to start some new league he's trying to a couple things he started a brand big baller brand and you know that's like their ball and baton and came out with these shoes they're basically $500 retail sneakers and if you're like that's expensive because you're not a big baller bitch that's why that's like but are they like made by a real organization well Dita's no no no no they're not made by definitely not and he and by the way the Sun that's in the NBA turned down real money like real fucking money because he was like I the the father demanded that you basically pay to develop this brand from the big apparel my guys like give us like a billion dollar contract and like developed this brand what and they were like no we're not doing that and he's like well they're not gonna talk to you about endorsing my slides yes 100% yes then now he's had like there's so much conversation about the brand that he's definitely elevated like the awareness of it what we don't know what nobody knows is like to what level are they actually selling this apparel you know like are these cuz they have everything they have shirts and shoes they're getting they just got it rated an F by the Better Business that's right cuz their shoes are not the ones they sold the previous sold a bunch of shoes and there's like the ones that people are getting or not what they bought so people are pissed there's no way to return refund or exchange them yeah and they're just telling people they're literally I think I read that the customer service people told you oh you must be a Brooke baller then yeah not satisfied yeah that's literally oh my god but he's also I mean he's so anyways he's the belt he took these kids to lick the Wayne you know they're gonna play basketball he's like he basically says they're gonna be on the Lakers and my three sons are gonna be Lakers right so we have no idea really realistically whether the two younger sons even have we don't know to be fair whether they're gonna be MBA quality players yet you know like that clearly one is the one who's on the Lakers but so we don't know if that's gonna pan out in any way shape or form he also talked about developing a league for like kids that are coming out of high school that don't want to go to college and play in a league where they get paid like a salary you know a reasonable salary mm-hmm which is an idea that a lot of people think is fascinating I don't know logistically whether he could pull that off you know that's kind of right I mean but but the idea is one that people have talked about for years because college athletes generate a lot of revenue they're getting fucked yeah athletes are getting pimped out yeah a hundred percent especially in like football basketball well you were telling me well I was talking to Jamie when you went to pee yeah about how big the game was thinking God and I was saying is here what about baseball's baseball like darling no nobody gives a fuck about college baseball basketball is a little bit he said that's madness definitely those those are the big college football get that's big and it's worth billions of dollars many billions yeah yeah which is crazy those kids aren't getting paid that doesn't make any fucking sense well I got a free scholarship Joe get go school for free and low oh great get to $25,000 a year's worth of free education yeah fuck you I tend to agree Jamie there's a couple kids that interesting story came out earlier this year he's on one of the teams that did really good UFC or UCF I'm sorry yes yes kicker was a youtuber as the season started and he got in trouble because he was making profit off of his likeness on YouTube so they took away his ability to do that I think he left the team oh my god fucking monsters no what do you don't own people that's what drives me crazy yeah it's like you don't own people they're providing a service that makes you an extraordinary of money yeah yeah you're keeping all of it like that Pitino thing 1.5 million is for left angry yeah I get school 10 grand oh that's the argument I know I think the the thing about asshole that people who who really argue the free education thing and like how that should be a value it's because they ain't worth a shit like that's why they think that's awesome yeah your skill level is not impressive right and you don't generate millions and billions of dollars so you go it's fucking $100,000 worth of free education there it's like yeah but like I'm bringing ten million to the table bro that's the thing and here's the big thing how much damage are they getting in that four years how much damage they doing to go out in football yeah in high-level Division one FBS football a lot of those dudes are playing they're playing basically with you know the the next NFL players so yeah they're yeah they're fucking each other up fucking each other up and the odds of their body getting damaged to the point where they never compete professionally are very hot oh definitely yeah so if you think of like there was a statistic about NBA or excuse me NFL players like how many of them make it into the fourth year and it's very low yeah the not for long league they really call it yeah they say what they call that's the nickname for the NFL oh not for long yeah the average NFL career is like three points some season so yeah yeah so think of that you're you're basically trying to do to outrun that through college yeah and then make it into the pros yeah that's why you really from a business perspective you really have to support guys coming out of college early to the NFL oh I mean there's people who are like some people have already the fuck out of here I'll read a book yeah well I'm balling go back go back with my free time man yeah go back you're still only gonna be 25 years old in your careers over that's fucking nuts I know there's millions on the table millions yeah 22 come on hello you ever think about poorly you would handle that I think about it now a lot if I had been 22 and some rich it was like wow I would definitely not have been like yeah able to handle that well yeah I think about that hardcore I think about like what if I won the lottery when I was 20 like what go nuts you go nuts you got diamonds in my jacket man check out diamonds on my teeth it's my buttons are all diamonds on my dick hole yeah yeah I think um it's like we were talking about earlier about a guy being rich and having rich children struggles fucking very important for you yeah it's very good for you it's very important for you it builds character it builds resolve respect no yeah yeah respect money that like how many professional athletes who make millions of dollars work out as hard as my friend Cameron hands right think of that that fucking guy is a regular job dude works for the Department of Water and Power in Oregon does he really yep 95 regular job during his lunch hour he doesn't work 9:00 to 5:00 he works like seven four and one of the reasons why he's got an extra hour in there is cuz he runs during his lunch break so he takes like two-hour lunches and runs for two fucking hours runs the hills and then comes back and finishes out the rest of the eight hours of the day what that dude feels good all day though just savage yeah he doesn't feel good he doesn't want to feel good he's happy I'm saying he's happy in pain I don't know man I mean he gets shit grimacing in pain he's like this shit hurts there's like it there's a mindset of those people though that can do those ultra marathons that's a different world inside your dome and your room yeah that's some darkness in there you're trying to what was that woman that smashed all of the court needle Walter yeah did you listen to the podcast she's amazing she's nachos and drinks beer eats candy she's eating candy but she's hanging out with us what's going on her brain man that's what I want to see I want to see a CT scan she's a straight-up Savage I'll tell you what us alone how she had some sort of retina edema where she was almost blind because her contacts fucked up or something like that and her her her eyeballs were bleeding and she couldn't see and she fell cracked her fucking head open like like blood pouring down her head still one couldn't see couldn't see who where her feet were while she was running her brain cannot be the same she's just tough there's there's mental toughness that some people have that is almost unexplainable like you don't like what makes them that tough mm-hmm I don't understand it the ability to block out all the negative voices the stop noises I mean well think about personalities right like a personality like Burt could be the life of the party right That's not me I'm not that guy yeah I've never been that guy right I mean I can I can if we're all hanging around together we're all drinking I can make everybody laugh yeah be silly we could all have a good time together but I don't gravitate towards that thinking that kind of behave whereas Burt can walk into a liquor store and having everybody sing along to I would die for you yeah yeah it's got his phone out and people are dancing and yeah it's it's a genuine personality time yeah that's who he is that's his personality type some people have that personality type where they'll get up at 4:30 in the morning and you know it's dark outside and they relish the fact that they don't want to put their running shoes on and they don't want to hit that mountain and run they relish the fact that there there's gonna struggle they like it they like it yeah they like the pain they like the the stinging of the the lungs as they're your lungs struggle to fill with air but like it yeah true yeah they like also the fact that other people can't do what they can do they like the fact that there's people that are in bed that are comfortably asleep while they're out there doing it and it gives them an edge sure yeah what what makes a person's personality to be this outgoing extrovert like Bert Kreischer what makes that stoic individual that can sit and go over you know you know an accountant who can just sit and go over things for hours and hours a coder someone could sit in front of a computer and go over 10 12 hours a days with a certain mindset yeah it's a different kind of human yeah yeah because that I mean that both of those personalities I could never entertain you know yeah just so far from what I am I'm fascinated by personalities yeah I just find a there's so many variables like as to what makes a person who they are and and how it changes over time and who you know who you are the more you consider yourself and like I did a podcast yesterday about meditation it was all about meditation dan Harris from Good Morning America who's big proponent of meditation and this guy Jeff Warren who wrote this book a head trip very very interesting guy who is his meditation teacher and we're just talking about thought processes and and the mind and a managing the mind and managing the way you do things don't do things and how much of these little weird kinks and pitfalls can just trip you up and fuck you up in your life like imagine louis c.k without this desire to beat off in front of women like let's say he did that ten times in his whole life mmm-hmm imagine if you could get to him before those ten times and go hey man look you're a real nice guy you've always been like friendly to people you give good advice as a comedian just you can't beat off in front of people yeah we gotta it's gonna cost you like fifty million dollars one day yeah what yeah you think so yeah yeah one day is gonna cost you fifty million dollars we just beat off in front of people no one's gonna work with you so just don't do that don't do that or here's what you could do pay a hooker and say I want to beat off in front of you and she'll go okay and then you give her a thousand bucks you or whatever costs and you beat off in front of her you could do that [Music] but like what would make a person what makes a person tick really yeah what what what is it inside your head like it's all your experiences really that become your personality I think there's that these your experiences there's managing your particular biology yeah you know there's so many so many different things yeah cuz like you you're at the age now to where you can see like with your children you ever see how they're a certain age now but you go like I saw that trait in you when you were one oh yeah you know yeah yeah you see like the stuff that's natural in someone mm-hmm the natural personality trait and then you sprinkle life on top of that starts to develop who the person becomes well your son is probably just now starting to talk yeah you know you'll start to have a little conversation with them then you start to see you in them and that's where it gets really weird you know you've inherited all my craziness you see that in your kids nine-year-old in particular really she's got a lot of my crazy in her yeah and you totally see yourself oh yeah she gets obsessed with things assessed or she just she'll just do them like all day long like we went on a vacation and we were walking back from the resort she did cartwheels all the way back from the resort to it to the room it was a half mile so she's doing cartwheels over and over and over again she just gets nuts about stuff these are the kind of thing we're like hey probably stop doing that no let her do it I know I don't I think as long as your kids aren't hurting themselves and hurting other people the more you say hey don't do that the more they're gonna want to do that sure it's natural yeah what I try to do is encourage healthy things that's it I try to like when it comes to like candy and sugar and stuff like that I try to tell them yeah it tastes great tastes amazing but you're really only supposed to have a little bit of it for your it's bad for your body you know I don't I don't just give them this hey you can't eat candy yeah hey you can't do that I'm like it's good it's fine let's have a little bit let's enjoy it but let's understand what it is like let's be aware of what it is but don't be afraid of it don't run from it don't you know yeah nobody died because they had an ice cream once a week sure you know it's not gonna hurt you just don't have it every fucking night yeah I just don't get crazy don't let it become a part of everything who you are and one of the things that I do the most though is encourage them like what are they what do they enjoy doing what do you enjoy doing you know like my youngest one loves art loves to draw loves it's just constantly drawing this I'm like let's draw let's say let's look let's do smart it's fun it's like there's something like find out whatever it is where you can find this avenue for expression and and I want to encourage that as much as I can because I feel like if there's anything in this life that'll guarantee you some satisfaction or some feeling of accomplishment or some some some way to fuel your passions it's fine something that really hits your switches find that thing like you found it right you found it but stand up yeah totally mean but you imagine doing something else other than stand up no of course not I mean at this point I don't know I tell people that all the time actually it's like that's the thing you become aware of I think when you get older you're like I'm so lucky that I do the thing I really like doing the most yeah that's really the thing and then you meet people like I mean people all the time but like I talked to people who you know I'm just not happy with what it they're just like I'm not happy with my life and this and that I'm like what is it you really want to do and then I don't know like real question real question if somebody wanted at trade lives Jeff Bezos wanted to trade lives you get to be Jeff Bezos you get one hundred five billion dollars but you can't do stand up anymore no cuz I love it I love it yeah that's so hard for people to imagine yeah well no because like I mean that that I know that sounds like a comical amount of money and that like who the fuck would turn that down but it's like I don't really feel like I'm turning something down because I have I get so much pleasure and joy out of doing what I do so you imagine I made that deal and you came back to the comedy store and you're watching somebody just kill like nah man you gotta take your spaceship home now you sitting around writing things down I think you're funny and you're never just getting into people you take yeah see if you can make it work do you remember Tom agna mm-hmm he's a really funny comedian and apparently he lives in Thailand now and just fucking retired on his writers guild money really and you know his mortgage is like 500 bucks a month and Neal Brennan went to see him last week in Thailand really yeah and he was a comic yup he's a funny comic I knew him from Boston really good guy there's Tom Magna really good guy that he's retired their lives in Thailand good for him just on the beach just kick him back and apparently he writes still he'll still like ripe right stuff for people but doesn't give a fuck anymore good for him in yeah I mean I hear about things like that and they go wow he did it he figured out a way to do it you figured out a way to get off the bus yeah I don't think I'm getting off I feel like I'm gonna George Carlin this motherfucker keep driving it yeah I feel like one day I'm going to die in a hotel room somewhere 80 years old on yeah I don't know I mean sometimes I think about like how like God am I mad how much longer am I gonna do this for it does it feels like there's too much time still ahead of me you know I mean no but I mean like I go like hey I'm gonna do this for 25 more years or something that's fuckin nuts the only thing that excites me as much is outdoor stuff so you really love that shit yeah kind of jealous of all your hobbies but not not I mean just that you I'm jealous of the fact that you're passionate about like hunting shooting pool jiu-jitsu you know archery oh shit I'm like goddamn it I wish I had like that much passion for at least one other thing you know I just think I'm crazy I think I find these things and then I get obsessed with them yeah you know I'm lucky that there's like I have to manage those things like I better be careful like I'm lucky I don't know how to fix cars if I knew how to fix car like I had I entertained this idea for a while of building a car from scratch really of getting a frame and then starting to put suspension on it and I said no you've got to stop like you can't do this this will take too much time you can't do this I can't and I would like it I would like it I'd start wiring things I surprise you don't move or at least get a place in the woods I think that's gonna scared of that too yeah it scared of that too you know when we lived in Boulder I'm like a lot dude I liked it a lot I went to that house yeah it's beautiful yeah so peaceful up there right amazing just woods and mountain lions eating your dog and shit this is weird yeah but I I don't know man I just have to for for me it's always like make sure like there's almost like there's two Me's there's the manager me it's like hey hey hey hold on before we for we embark on this journey let's take a look at where this could go wrong let's take a look at where this can go before I release the hounds and then there's the other part that's like just wants to just go go for it there's no things you know I want a hobby though dude do you what kind I don't know whoa hunting with me Oh hunting I'll go to arrange first to see how much I dig I've been shot I've shot an arrow bow and arrow but it's been like 25 years I got a range here oh you have a range here yeah as an indoor archery range in this place okay this weekend I'm getting a thing called techno hunt installed techno hunt is of you ever see that video game where you hit a golf ball in the virtual golf ball screen yeah they make that with archery you're doing that with bow hunting here yep so there's the animals walk across the screen you shoot at the animals with a regular compound bow and instead of having sharp pointed tips yeah this is this is the game right here you have a tip that has a flat head like the head of a nail mm-hmm and so these animals walk across the screen and you literally shoot at the target and like watch they'll show you like it's gonna be like yeah see watch out it hits where it shoots it mm-hmm what you would want to get right there right behind the arm BAM perfect shot so that's gonna be like thank you so it shows where the the thing hit and it shows your score and your vitals and stuff like that's very cool you're gonna be really in depth it's crazy they re uh Burton I went to top golf you know what that is oh that's in Vegas right yeah top they have exactly they have one in Vegas and they have like I don't know 25 locations oh yeah we stayed we stayed there for like hours hours like we thought we were gonna play like a round but it just became addictive and fun we just kept kept doing it what'd he do it's not just driving so you have like a bay right right and then like your own tea and right and you you know three of you put your names in the system and you get a real golf ball and they track the balls so like when you hit it there's targets that you can go for points nose like re hit the flag in it like so you get like eight points and then it'll be like your next balls worth double and if you hit the blue flag it's gonna be like sixteen points so like and and then there's different games within the system you can go just for like chip shots you can go for distance anyways we just man I thought we thought we were gonna play like an hour I think we saved four hours that's crazy and and we were all like we gotta find another TopGolf like we were really really into it man you guys don't even play golf no I mean I know those two used to play like I already said he played regularly a long time ago same with Burt they both had much better shots than me but I was equally obsessed with it like I didn't care that I was even shitting the bed why I was having so much fun doing it there's so many different things you could do that's why when people tell me that they're bored I mean unless you're broke and there's nothing you do but even then there's so many physical activities that you do that are free no you don't understand I'm not bored I didn't mean I just like you know throwing myself into an activity like that so you need a hobby I think so why'd you get into Jitsu no no I don't like a guy I I did see the gun I never liked I think I never liked I never liked wrestling I did I wrestle know you hate it yeah I just don't like having like guys on top of you yeah and I don't like you know my neck being jacked or any of that shit like I never liked you know how about more time I like throwing punches yeah that's cool I like that yeah I just taking them muy Thai class I don't know how to kick the bag learn how to hit the paths maybe learn how to use your defense push away I like that maybe photography I like old ladies tries to pinch your ass after show Hey sweep the leg sweep the leg knock her out what take her down Oh get some good press next day did you see that thing with Josh Homme from the Queens of the Stone Age kenton oh yeah yes yeah apparently the the later story is like what her flash was really fucking bothering everybody Oh was it yeah like that she wasn't supposed to have a flash going but that was not okay the way that that shit went down man yeah you're supposed to go hey lady turn the fucking yeah and he was wasn't part of his thing like I was trying to kick the camera like kicked her in the head or I said he was kicking equipment around he accidentally kicked he made a bunch of super yeah he kicked her in the face yeah like the camera is like right here and he kicks the camera hits her in the mug yeah no he fucked her well in his defense though he might have been like super frustrated if that was the case it's almost like flashing in his face by the way I can totally see you know losing your shit on stage think it's happened to everybody I see it but it's not okay kick it no no no I'm saying something I wanted to kick someone have you for sure I mean over the course of a whole career yeah oh yeah I've wanted to kick someone you know what's interesting I watched I did long beach I did that was it the terrace theater forget what theater is in Long Beach big-ass theater in Long Beach yeah great theater really weird because there's no you could never have this theater today it would be completely illegal because there's the the way to get out like the rows the rows are like 70 seats long mm-hmm there's no aisle in the middle there's I on the left side I on the right that's it but the whole span in front of you is just seats it's amazing to perform they're still there yeah that's the place yeah yeah look at that oh yeah crazy man you gotta get up take a piss you got a piss in here in the middle you're fucked did you forty peoples especially if you're overweight if you're a big fella and you're trying to get through all that yeah but anyway when I went there I they informed me that that was where Richard Pryor did his live in concert from 7:00 nine mm-hmm that's we recorded and I went back and watched it after I got home and I was like holy shit this is crazy he pulled up to the same dock where I pulled up he walks in with his wife goes through the same back area that I went to then I watch it and in the beginning of it there's a fucking guy in the front of the stage who was getting it like Richard Pryor's on stage and he's standing there taking pictures of Richard Pryor while he's filling is special and Richard Richards go and sit down motherfucker stop taking my picture he's saying yeah even in 79 yeah take a picture and it's just a guy in the audience it's not a professional photographer well you see that phone thing are you gonna do that yes I'm doing that you are that that is okay isprobably tell people for my shows up coming in Austin Houston and Durham North Carolina there's a company called yonder yeah they take your phone they put it into a bag and you want to keep you keep your phone but they have to open your back when you leave so you're not making any phone calls you're not doing any text you're not filming you're not doing anything I watched Chappelle's special when Chappelle did that and I was like this is it yeah and it was fucking amazing how much more tune in people are yeah like when they don't have their phone yeah especially just checking your text and every time you're onstage I mean how many times are people just standing there filming things I just did a show where was like fourth row dark house and you just see see the light yeah fucking beacon of light yeah and I was like doing I'm doing the talking I'm talking and then you know I'm just like trying to finish a bit and then I did I'm like hey man what are you doing what what are you what are you doing he's not even listening when I ask him what he's doing and then his friends are like hey he looks up I go what are you doing see I'm doing it's for work I know you bought these tickets to do work and he's like I just I got to do it I go no no you're lighting up the whole room I go Billy don't realize I go there's like 15 minutes left and he's like all right and he flipped it over like put the phone down not not two minutes later he's back his phone back on it back doing things I was like and I actually knew to not say anything at the second time because I didn't want to I didn't want the show to be about that sounds like this is gonna be negative yeah right but thankfully the staff noticed and they went over there and I don't know what I'm doing this from now on I think this phone thing may look I think some people don't like it that's okay but it's gonna make a better show here's the thing so people know because I know a little bit about the yonder thing too is like if you're like well what if I need to you can actually you can leave the show room yeah and they'll unlock it for you you can make your call yeah in the lobby but it's just keeping people tuned in tuned and not distracting people I want to see loved the Beatles show yeah maraj fucking amazing the Cirque du Soleil show is incredible I've heard incredible this guy in front of me has his brightness Jack to the fucking roof and he's texting people like so while I'm trying to watch the show this guy has his bright phone yeah and he's just sitting there texts hitting yeah it's over and over and over again completely disrespecting all the people around him everybody's just got to go like this yeah because the place is pitch black a lot of this stuff is going on because there's like this stuff comes down from the ceiling and people are descending and they're doing this acrobatics and this dickhead is just constantly on his fucking phone yeah it's like just do you want to fucking experience things for a minute you know I'm like you go to Cirque de Soleil you go to Joe Rogan show it's like you fucking went you decided to go to the thing like don't you want to experience the show yeah just watch the show for a minute you got to force people because there's a certain amount of people that are just not going to deal it's it's not cheap it's not cheap you know cost money yeah but I feel like it's gonna be worth it I think so too and I'm definitely gonna do it for my special oh yeah because my last two specials I've I dealt with people sitting in the front row and second row to stand in there holding that phone up in front of you this is holding it right at you like you don't think that's distracting you know maybe that's weird live your life I think it's especially good thing to do in a big big venue yeah yeah yeah so that's it folks so if you come into Austin Houston and taking your phone and put in the back you did your special in Denver right at the Paramount yeah it's fucking great place it's great shit it's still it's still my favorite man it's my favorite city I think if I move anywhere it'll either be there or maybe Seattle those are my spots I would love to live I love actually downtown Denver I would also think it'd be amazing to live like 20 minutes outside of Denver yeah go to it gold and live in the woods I really yeah I think it's in my future do you yeah I do California I don't think I don't think I might do it in like the next couple years but I think in my life I will move to Colorado at some point um yeah I really love it I love to all aspects of it like I like the culture I like I like the outdoors I like the people that I mean they're always having meet great people there yeah they have all the infrastructure you want from a big city you have access to everything yeah great restaurants you have great you know they're big sports they have entertainment they have everything you want the people are cool as fuck to they really are it's just they're not pretentious like a lot of people that live in LA or San Francisco or New York yeah they're very laid-back but you know they're surrounded by also I think there's something about being surrounded by the Rocky Mountains I think it's good start taking yourself seriously you just look out yeah yeah fucking the vastness of all this it's insane there was a great night man I had such a
