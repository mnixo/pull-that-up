hello freak bitches they've got they had two wings of the of the psych ward they're like one like they've got the standard-issue harmful to yourself or others you know like committed for the involuntary psychiatric hold then they've got the something out so they'd be extraordinarily you know like the extraordinarily qualifying individuals you know and that's you the something out swing yeah so it's said they had me on the southern out swing and like whoa yeah and like my roommate was like fucking like like like hiding in the closet from like fucking demons oh dude it was I mean I've been hearing voices for like a couple of years you know but nothing like this oh do you there's evil you're the best I have angels and demons you know like someone would tell me like you're worthless you need to die and I would be like trying to suffocate myself to death you know well yeah I mean not like with anything I'm just holding my breath that was right but the whole thing was I was hearing voices because I was huffing so much nitrous oxide and while while you're doing ketamine while I was doing cocaine I never smoke this joint just fucking relax you make me feel so much better about myself I used to watch interventions yeah I'm worried about your health more than I'm worried about like you overdosing you're over it's a it's a slow deterioration of your fiber yeah like the stuff that keeps you together you're talking to me Ryan I'm fine now I right now I feel like I just worked out yeah I'm a bit when they're like this and I'm into something else award like people are like that not people one guy I remember one guy like shit on the fucking ground and was like breakdancing at it like try to like dude he was his goal was to like spirit around its breakdance yeah I mean it looked like this breakdancing but he was like he took a shit he's trying to smear it around as much as he could dancing and that's you know you're talking earlier about like how our culture you know we repress all this really natural stuff and make it a problem when like what it doesn't need to be a problem I've always wondered why that is and I wonder if it has anything to do with our our need for innovation and for like growth and for productivity and if the idea of like somehow nerve suppressing sexuality makes people concentrate on being more productive and more successful so that way you can kind of earn sex and if sex was more free you wouldn't get as much done and I wonder if it's some sort of a weird workaround that almost like the construction of this advanced civilization is sort of it's like it's it's invented this path that sort of ensures productivity and one of the best ways to do that is to make people compete like in a very very efficient and ferocious way for the attention of women and if this the attention of women was like easily achieved there would be less ambition and there would be less so in a sense suppression like leads to more materialism it leads to a more obvious expression of that materialism like you want the big house you want the nice watch you want the nice shoes and the nice clothes and in wanting all those things you want all those things because sex is like difficult to it and advice sex was easy to achieve you'd be a little bit more relaxed in your needs because like ultimately the physical needs kind of like trump all the other stuff you know I could do you want do you want a nice watch yeah I mean it's okay why do I want a nice watch well they kind of look cool okay but do you want a nice watch because girls are gonna recognize it yeah well the girls don't give a shit about a nice watch they just want to suck your dick well fuck that watching right yeah well you've just summarized the argument of Freud's civilization and its discontents really yeah that's what he says he says civilization is the product of repressed sexual energy being redirected into productive activities huh well I'm sort of reversed it I've reversed it almost like the nation is so yeah right because because it's the result of that it wants to continue and amplify that like any system wants to you know persist right so because it's the result of that then there are in built-in mechanisms for perpetuating that cycle of repression redirection you know dangling the carrot I mean if if capitalism could stop us from breathing and then charge us for air they would and you made this one tweet which again I think it's fairly innocuous I actually know completely innocuous totally justified the first tweet the company you were working for makes in response to it they call you their former community leader was that how you found out you were fired practically so I can run you through the timetable you want so the the beginning of the day what company was it again well the company that I work for is called Turtle Rock Studios a bunch of really talented artists who are making an incredibly ambitious game called evolve and so the game was the game is and was and still it is really awesome but the the the company you know game development we work in a slightly different clock than most of corporate America we work we go in at like 10:00 a.m. and we leave at like 7:00 p.m. because we're usually up until really late late in the evening so I really don't even wake up until like 9 o'clock every day most days so that day I woke up and my phone was kind of buzzin and blowing up one of my one of my really close friends and colleagues at the time text I mean he's like hey by the way you know the stuff you tweeted about the other day like some news outlet picked up on it some small you know thing an ultra group exactly her I wanted to capitalize on that on that net sensational headline and so he was just give me a heads up and I was like oh yeah you know thanks whatever to me at the time I was like whatever like I know what the group heat that I don't want to name the the site but but I know what they're about like they do this all the time so I was like whatever and then so maybe I jump in the shower and I get out and I've got text from like our GM at our studio like you need to go radio dark on all social media period and I was like what I was like what and so I texted aback I'm like is this in relation to the article that the one article that no one else picked up on and that like you know half the comments were like that dude that's totally not what Josh was saying and the other half were kind of reacting sensationally to it but like the other half even on the comments of the Oracle we're like you're taking him out of context right and that was the entire extent of the controversy circling me at the time and then 45 minutes later I still haven't left my apartment to go into the studio you had 45 minutes later my email stops working and I'm like like I'm not dumb not stupid I'm like they've literally just shut off my email and then so I tried calling them and you didn't take my call and an hour later he's like yeah we should we should probably meet it like the Starbucks around the corner and I'm like what like you you don't want me to come into the office and talk about this like you don't want to hear my side of it you don't want to see what's what like it's just done and then they issued the statement that they made which was like the literally putting the match to the kerosene so maybe there was some kerosene maybe there was some like potential for outrage and then when they fired me it turned into this huge thing in the gaming industry around like was that right was that wrong so like the vast majority of people who would have never even heard about that or even would have cared that I tweeted that kind of like everybody heard about it mainstream heard about it like Mark Cuban's started following me on Twitter like if you were if they were afraid the NBA was gonna get pissed at us for me for weighing in on it then you know their kind of reaction to had made it like 50 times worse yeah I wish I was in [Music]
