young James ready launch five four we can do eight one we can do Tom Papa is a motherfucking author I'm a man of letters now you're an author I'm an author I've always uh admired that and secretly wished that I had not even so secretly wished that I had the discipline write a book you do have a discipline you just have to focus it on Matt you can do it how long did it take you to write this about two years that's too long don't cut that short okay like a little pamphlet how long before you started writing the book did you think about writing the book uh I've always kind of wanted to write a book deal I know well yeah on this one I had pitch doing a book I don't know like six years ago pretty much the same concept and no one was into it and then a couple of years ago through two three years ago a publisher contacted my agent or whatever and they had interest so we made a book deal and that changes everything because now someone's waiting for you yeah you know you got to turn stuff in and they make books and probably smart did you have an editor that like went over your stuff and said this is too long this is too sure yeah they were pretty great they were pretty they just left the material alone there was a couple little things where they're like you know you're repeating something or and that but mostly it was grammar kind of things do you want to say it like this right this isn't technically grammatically correct but would you you know typos right that kind of stuff they were pretty hands-off about the actual material and is it is it a book of essays is it your life story what is it it's all on family it's called your dad stole my rake and other family dilemmas and it's broken down by by everyone in your family like the basically thing is as a comedian I've been writing about family and looking at all everyone's families for so long so I'm gonna write about all of them so it's mom's dad's cousins aunts uncles all broken down in chapters like that and so I talk a little bit about my family and then I just talk about funny essays about just life in general like going on family vacations or why are you eating your shirt um I don't know exactly there was a really cool photographer Sam Jones who's decided to get wacky he just this guy is like this amazing photographer just unlike Clooney and Damon and all these people and I asked him if he would help and when I showed up we've just taken some regular shots and he's like I have this idea and it's brought out this giant shirt and put a tie on it and and just shot it and came up pretty funny I look like Dilbert yeah we're beaker I was just trying to figure out what you're doing that I guess I guess what you're doing there is get people to try to figure out what you're doing there yeah they stare at and they're like maybe if I buy the book I'll figure it out I understand being goofy yeah when you write a book yeah think man someone could be reading this thirty years from now 50 years from now that is as comedians you write something in the morning you bring it onstage they tell you if it's funny or not you know what you're working with you go back and forth this is like it's permanent and no one gets to review it until it's done so the nerve-wracking part of it was like okay it's done I'm pretty proud of it I've like edited it like crazy I've worked on it for a long time will people think it's okay well they do not think it's Hackel they think it's good will is the writing okay all that other stuff and it's been out now for a week and the review I can tell the reviews are good like the people are reviewing it and writing about it and calling and just people just randomly and it's I'm over the hurdle the anxiety of is this a good that's not look is over yeah people like it it's funny and it's people are saying I can write so that is huge it's just calm me down completely cuz you know you know like I said for 30 years what everybody's like takes a dump on it you leave some that are really fucking bad yeah it means some comics someone should have just walked in while they're writing and grab them this is you're doing something terrible for your future for a long time well people gonna refer to this rich people in these like really self-righteous defensive modes and they're writing things down and maybe like five years from now they'd be like what the fuck was I thinking yeah they're in the middle of writing it and I've read some some shit oh my god really yeah yeah yes horrible stuff yeah I know I'm I'm I'm relieved I'm not excited I'm just relieved like oh okay it's good it was good I thought it was good I hoped it was good my editor said it's good people are saying that they're laughing when they're reading it like editors who don't normally say that kind of stuff so writing book writing with writing stand-up like how do you divide your time it was it was tough you to stand up whenever I'm working on something else stand-up kind of I work on it at night you know and the book was I got into this rhythm of going in every morning get up at 7:00 going with my coffee and sit there and that was book time until noon and I would try and just just work on that and make it but that wasn't for two years that was like the last you know year to eight months kind of thing before that it's a little looser I'm trying to get it done and stuff but that real discipline of like coming in every morning sitting down and seven days a week just writing just write wherever I was whatever I was doing I had to make sure that I had that time if I'm on a plane with him in a hotel I'm on the road I was just writing the thing all the time it just became because he's you know the biggest challenge for me and I think a lot of writers is that you judge yourself as you go you're like is this good as I'm intended to do but you have to just get it down and know that it's bad just just get it down I want to write this chapter on crazy ants so I'm just gonna write it and spit it out and then I'm gonna go to work on it like a bit you know like like stand up and just go back and just start editing and peeling back and peeling back now is using when you're doing this I did it all on word like yourself word hmm and have you ever seen Scrivener do you know what Scrivener yeah Scrivener is really interesting I did my last special on Scrivener oh yeah the first time I've used it for for writing stand-up and what's good about it is on the left hand side you have like all of your different subjects yeah and you click on each subject and like there'll be a whole column so like I had the title strange times and in the left hand side this is this is what it looks like when you're looking at the chalk the cork board so the cork board is one aspect of it where you have these little cards like index cards and you set these index cards up and you you know you write all the different things on the index cards but you can organize it outside of the index cards there's also on like each index the index the cork board it corresponds to each individual subject like say like say if I'm doing a bid on desks right uh-huh so I have desks on the left hand side and then I'll write out all the stuff on desks but though there's also a cork board tab right and then so I have all the different things to make sure that I covered all the notes and yeah good do you not like it a lot yeah I'm gonna try that what I like a lot this is not really showing why I like it uh-huh well I like it is because you can have you can move all those little chapters around and and move all the bits around like for stand-up wow that's great yeah that's really good yeah the organizing it gets so in your head it just starts bogging you down yeah the good thing about this was that it was essays so each one's like 4 or 5 pages right mm-hmm so I would just be like literally just open up the file and go dads alright I'm gonna go to work on this one dad no gifts for dad and then just boom just edit that put it away going on the next one you know just I could just bounce it I didn't what I'm trying to say is I didn't have to keep tract like a novel right I didn't have 300 pages of flow you know they were all just hits so it was kind of similar to stand up that way hmm you know like I could just go to work on them but it's fascinating I I really loved it like I've had friends that have written books like Colin Quinn came and did a book event with me a couple weeks ago he's like and he wrote a book he's like I'll never do it again I just hated it I couldn't stand it I hate it and he's a prolific guy he writes a lot mm-hmm for is that I mean those does one man show he's always a man show on US history yeah the guy writes a lot but the writing for the book drove him crazy I really loved it I couldn't believe that you could look at a five page essay and find something wrong with it every time you looked at it every time why am I saying this they know this why do I have to say he sat down at the table and ate his breakfast he ate his breakfast you know like you could just peel stuff away all the time and get it as as a direct as possible and I started to really just love the love that Jordan Peterson told me he wrote his first book and it took him 15 years because he went over every single line every single to act like a critic wanting to find fault and everything that he did Wow until he felt like he got it done he was on a cold war she really wanted to make sure that he had the subject matter completely locked down yeah that's daunting like you're dealing with something that people can fact check yeah people can fact check what happened to me and putting my sister in a garbage can you know what I mean yeah it was family it's all about family it's all about like the joy of being with other people and and the aggravations and all that kind of stuff so it was just and I write I you know I have a lot of that in my act mm-hmm so it was definitely in my wheelhouse like I'm the other one I'm not writing books about the Cold War gonna write another one I am gonna write another one have you started yet no I haven't which is uh I have a couple ideas and and the publisher wants me to write another one yeah so already yeah I think that's good sign yeah it's a good sign it's we're the number one new release and family humor so it's like you had any potty words in there mmm very little yeah very little how many like 10 it would be a lot got any C words in there which one the cot word oh my lord yes there's a hole there's a whole chapter this is the problem female just period yeah now it's uh it's actually pretty clean I don't know if there's uh I don't know if there's anything in there there I think there might be one or two words one or two questionable yeah there might be a shit or yeah I don't think so though mmm it's pretty clean yeah good for you and he put anything in there on bread yes there is yes the final chapter is uh just eat the bread really yeah it's called just eat the bread and it's all it's all a chapter of basically using bread as a metaphor for just enjoy your life right don't don't turn it away don't get all balled up once in a while just a little just do it should I segue it's my big announcement you got a big mouth I have a huge Joe Rogan podcast announcement what is huge the book is huge and it's a great Father's Day gift and everybody should but I buy it but as we all know from being on this show that I am the Sultan of sourdough yes and my reputation as a baker is because of this show hands down from doing your show your fans are so awesome and started just sending pictures of their bread we have this non-stop relationship of help Fred they still show me their failures they're constantly sending I mean these interactions I'm in cities people are bringing bread and when I would travel I would go in and visit bakeries when I was on the road so the big announcement is the Food Network asked me to do a show about bread and baked goods whoa so I have a new show coming out on the Food Network on Labor Day called baked with Papa Wow and I travel around kind of like a diners drive-ins and meeting these amazing people that make the stuff getting their stories these families these Turkish families and Italian families and whatever and then showing all this amazing amazing stuff that they're making all because of this show why I have to thank you a hundred percent it is it was a hobby of mine that I completely loved and got into but after doing this it just kind of exploded and and now we're going to be I just finished shooting them all that's awesome yeah yeah how many just shoot we shot eight and towards eight different cities New Orleans New York Detroit LA Cleveland Philadelphia New Jersey northern New Jersey which is where I grew up yeah eight different ones it's gonna start in Labor Day so silly I mean literally you know how many I've been writing scripts I've been auditioning I've been acting whatever to be on television I start baking bread with my daughter that's that's my show it seems like that's the best way anyway it's the thing that you actually enjoy and really love you know it's a hundred percent find that thing you're really passionate about and turned that into a show rather than yeah some sitcom that you're really not that excited about other than being on television that's exactly right like I had no I was doing this anyway yeah I didn't have any of the stress of like trying to get a show on the air like when I've written pilots you're like I hope it go this was just so natural because it's just what I'm doing so it completely and you hear that a lot well just it's just you come from something you love and something you didn't and you hear that a lot you're like well I love working in an office and having a girlfriend I'll make a show about that no you don't not really you know really but uh but that's this actually just it you can't force it it's just it's just organic and this one was organic did you link up those different cities with comedy shows did you do end up in those cities when you were traveling I did just like pop in and Neal Brennan and I did a show in New Orleans I did a show in Cleveland when I was there just as I like pop in I didn't like promote it and do it while it was there so you're just concentrating on filming yeah I was just concentrating on filming we've gone for like three days I'd meet like four or five different bakers and it was cool just you know just dealing with these people was amazing that's awesome that no one gets into baking because they're an asshole you know what I mean no one says I'm gonna bake cookies and they're an idiot fuck these people bake them cookies and they're gonna like no no it's I mean it's a food is a fascinating thing to me yeah I mean I guess this is a good time to bring it up as any you know obviously Anthony Bourdain took his life yeah last week and he was a friend of mine it was real that was real hard Friday was real hard I woke up and I got a text from my friend Maynard from tool uh-huh Maine and said so much for the Keenan vs. Bourdain celebrity jujitsu match you know and and he's like fuck and I was like oh no what does that mean yeah and so that I googled it and I saw it was like oh shit man I can't fuck Wyatt yeah just what why had to hung himself like what yeah I don't how close were you did you know his demons was friends with him hung out with yeah got fucked up with him did you get a feeling that he had that in him I didn't know that yeah but was really weird was like he'd been saying really recently that he'd never been happier he was talking about his girlfriend saying that they'd never been happier didn't know he could be that happy didn't know someone to make him that happen oh man I'm so terrible who knows I mean they might have they might have broken arm who knows yeah I mean who knows I don't know I don't know I don't I don't know I mean no idea sometimes people when they say I've never been that happy you're catching them on these ups and downs you know some people some people huh you know people get manic right I don't know if he was but some people yeah up and down tell you what he liked to get fucked up yeah you know I he liked to drink yeah you know and he enjoyed it it was it was something that he enjoyed yeah but we did an episode of this show we went hunting for pheasants in Montana I mean we cooked over this campfire he cooked bland tastic and really and then afterwards we drank whiskey and smoked weed he goes deep he goes deep really yeah well I'm sitting down Mike I'm gonna just try to catch myself real the world spinning deep breath deep breath he's like where's the fucking weed Wow but I knew we drank I didn't know he smoked weed yeah yeah he um he had a heroin problem yeah when he was younger and he kicked it but he didn't feel the need to just be sober yeah that was kind of interesting about him that's a thing bright when ya get sober from a drug they feel like they have to get sober from everything yeah that did not feel like that and he by the way like he would drink but when he was home like with his kid he's homeless right he didn't drink at all lucky we don't have that he would only do that when he would be on the road right so he only shows stretches of time and he didn't drink it all in he was am addicted to jujitsu that was that was a really yeah he's doing jujitsu like literally every day now when I was hanging around with them he was he went we were in Montana he went to Bozeman to find a local jiu-jitsu club and trained with them in the morning she just trained with everybody I never hardly ever do the road yeah find a place I would just go to the gym and workout right wouldn't but he was so into learning and getting better at jujitsu do you know if he was on prescription for depression or anything like that I dunno that's what I'm so suspicious of like when you heard of like Robin Williams and Chris Cornell yeah there's like he was on anti-anxiety medication anti-anxiety medications a big one that's stuff like it even you know in their you know in their long list of side effects it's always suicide laws yeah and then if you mix it with other things like alcohol in this and I don't know at all who was on what but it seems what bothers me is that it's not part of the conversation well Robin is a different take because Robin has Lewy body disease mm-hmm he had a heart attack he had significant issues with that my friend dr. mark Gordon actually wrote a paper about long-term anesthesia like when you're under not long term but like long duration or things like open-heart surgery right that there's a high instance of depression afterwards a lot of people coming out of these big-time operations where you get anesthesia for long periods of time you have significant dips in their hormone levels afterwards and it's very you know it's not like a free ride getting put under yeah and having opened up and yeah I mean your body goes through massive trauma your bodies are holy shit we just had our chest plate split open and ya know your heart gets worked on people were inside of us yeah and there's a significant correlation in mark Gordon's opinion between depression post-surgery post-surgery depression they think it's something that people need to look at he had that obviously because he did have heart surgery for a long period of time the depression after that because I know people get I always thought it was just a mental thing of like you know surviving something like I remember Letterman on a show up like weeping and like bringing his staff on his stuff I always I didn't know as a hormone thing I was thought it was just the trauma of surviving that I think it can be both and I mean I'm sure I mean I'm obviously no doctor but he was I'd say you're closer but he was explaining it to me yeah the that there is an issue with this right and so Robin had at and he had some serious neurological disorders yeah and then there was a there's a quite a few other things too right they're all so complicated yeah and then whatever medications this is the thing right like what are these medical what's wrong you know you don't really don't know now but Chester from Lincoln Park he was on a shitload of things and he was but he was very troubled I mean if he was a guy that was he had some real problems but he was also very medicated I mean look we have the highest suicide rate among middle-aged people in America than ever like the numbers of the numbers are through the roof and there's also this pharmaceutical opioid crisis at the same time and I just feel like you know people are on this shit that's really affects your head and your mood and it says right in it like you you know I remember I had a friend whose brother was depressed and this was you know the eighties when we were kids and the the game lack of a better word of trying to get the right medicine for him because when they when they prescribed the wrong one things got out of hand I mean like really dangerously out of hand and then they finally find the right meds and then he kind of like no there's no like obvious path yeah like the problem is it's like say if you have some particular type of infection they give you antibiotics if you have you know poison ivy yeah they know what kind of cortisone cream to put on your what have you when when you're depressed yeah there's there's so many different factors involved in depression there's your actual life right there's what's going on in your life like are you taking care of your body are you exercising you have loving relationships with your family and close friends or do you feel distant and detached you know do you do not have anyone in your life like romantically do not have a job that you enjoy all those things factored into the way you feel about life and from the time you were a kid sure your whole life oh your whole life and then on top of that you have like legitimate mental illness right and you have depression because your brain is not producing enough serotonin or dopamine there's so many factors and people try to self-medicate and you know I know a lot of people try to do it with extra so exercise apparently seems to be as effective or more effective than most SSRIs and anti depressions I heard that I don't know if I'm right but I remember hearing that whatever your body manufacturers are secretes when you exercise is similar to what a lot of these drugs have in them well you definitely get runner's high right right yeah there's high you actually you're runner's high I don't know the exact mechanisms involved but it has something to do with the cannabinoid receptors so it literally gives you a high that's similar to almost like a marijuana high right yeah you get your euphoric oh yeah you get like I love it yeah I love running and just feeling even when even if it's not identified for me as a high like like smoking weed my whole rest of my day is better mm-hmm like there is death there's a happy little thing going on that's you know I'm not flying but I'm definitely not balled up and anxious the way I was before the run yeah that balled up an anxious thing I have my own theory about that I think the human body has physical requirements and I think if you don't just because of the design of it the fact that human beings have lived for thousands and thousands of years either hunting or gathering or running away from danger or your body's like constantly in action right back then yeah we essentially have the same bodies as people that live ten thousand years ago our DNA is very very similar right and I think we have all these requirements that we don't meet him and there's so many people that just sit down all day and that's all they do they walk to sit down and they sit down again and most of their time is sitting down whether they're watching television or sitting in front of their computer yeah and that shit is terrible for you terrible yeah and you feel it you just feel shitty yeah you just you feel bad I was in after the after the Bourdain news I was traveling outside of Chicago and it just kind of clicked in my head like you know you're just thinking whenever you have someone that inspires you and especially if your friends like you were you know it's just you can't get it out of your head kind of a thing it's me and your balled up anxiety is even worse and I just instinct instincts really got in put on my running shoes and just went for a run because I didn't want to sit and think about all of it so much you know and I just felt better like I was it wasn't euphoric again after the run but I was definitely better than before yeah I feel like especially when you're traveling and stuff like that but he did you Jitsu all the time mm-hmm these are puzzles these are puzzles we can't solve yeah who knows I don't know what was going on yeah no and there's no way to ask him obviously yeah but I mean when I travel one of the first things I do whether I'm coming home or going there's work out yeah and I didn't this weekend because Friday when I got there I'd worked out Thursday so I'd worked out that day already I ran that day and then yeah I got there Thursday night woke up Friday to that text and I was just like fuck man I didn't want to do anything I cried yeah I felt like shit I got a bunch of phone calls from some friends and then I had two shows that night and I was like I just got a just got to get on the horse yeah her up and I was a little worried I was a little worried that I was gonna be like moody or weirded out yeah but once I got there I was fine yeah I was with the Santino and Tony inch cliff nice so those two guys are great yeah just had a fun time we talked a little bit about it and smoked a little weed nice got up there and just had some fun and the energy of that crowd I saw your Instagram of the crowd and there's such a beautiful theater that's an amazing theater you can't have two it'd be tough to be depressed with all those fans yeah yeah we did two shows two they're both great wow they look awesome great food people it's a combination in the big city and like Midwest like friendly people yeah yeah and the summer it becomes a totally different City - yeah I was own I'd always gone my whole career in the winter and then literally just like three years ago went in the summer I was like oh man this place is amazing the parks and the festivals and it's great even in the winter though the winters gates they're in December and January III yeah it's like they're happy to be inside that you came through the cold to see them yeah but but but back to the food thing I mean the stories that Bourdain told through food where's just I mean amazing that's why he reached so many people you could sit with that show and he really took his time and you've really felt like you were you had been there well he's after he left us an episode yeah he made me think of food as an art form yeah I never thought of as an art form before watching no reservations his original show yeah I watched that show and I just would feel like oh this is not what I thought it was I thought it was just like oh this guy knows how to cook yummy food that's great right but then then watching his shows like oh this is art like these guys are treating this like a painting or like a sculpture or something like that and yeah and they're passionate and and they're all tattooed up and we rose right they're artists yeah they're just artists that cook that's right exactly just it might as well be making music or what happened pan whatever it would be drawing they're artists at its best yeah you know in the same thing like within any other art form then there's people that just crank it out and see a way to make money and like you can tell there's like a difference but once you need stuff from an artist you're spoiled then you then you're like these people don't care as much technically this is lasagna but it's it's it's interesting the approach is very it's very contagious yeah oh you you watch the way they cook and you watch like their their passion for the food it makes you hungry you want to eat and you also want to try it yes I do yeah I always want to try always always it's fascinating you like you know I going around and meeting all these bakers it's like they all got into it because there's a love there and then it's really hard work like these people work there you know two o'clock in the morning they're baking you're like in there I know it sounds so silly but anytime I had walk into a coffee shop or a bakery or something and just see that like a whole display case filled with stuff it seems like it's always been there right and you don't really know meeting the people these poor bastards who are making it every day two o'clock in the morning yeah it's hard hard work and the only way it seems that they can continue to do it is because there was that initial love of it yeah that deep deep love they learned it from their grandparents or they just went to school and figured it out and they just hooked them and that like it's enough of a big bang explosion of love that they stay in it for like you know ten years and make a business out of it my grandfather used to walk to get bread every day we would he lived on North ninth Street in North New Jersey oh yeah and which was at one point in time an Italian community right it wasn't when he lived there when he died but but when I was a boy we would go we would leave his house won't visit and stay there we'd leave his house we'd walk like three or four blocks down the street through this bakery that he had been going to for probably thirty years yeah and these people this was like an old Italian bakery those white paper bags yeah put the loaves in and he'd go there they would go there every day and get Italian bread every day every day get fresh bread yeah and you know and the bread was good for about a day or two like if you got the second day was getting a little dry and yeah they'll but if you got it that day boy oh you slice that bread and yeah you know my grandmother made homemade pasta she made I mean from scratch where I'm from you know flour eggs add the whole thing make lasagna make these and it was just fuckin sensational ah it's the best it's the best and you know there's that thing like when someone makes something really good in the community it changes the community because people will walk to get it in the morning yeah like just making something real quality all of a sudden it's like it just starts attracting people yeah it's fascinating it is fascinating yeah did your parents your grandparents come over from Italy yeah they were born there yeah oh yeah what part mom well different parts but Sicily and Naples so that's mine this is Lea Naples you know that's funny yeah this is so is rogen which that's Irish that's my grandfather it came from IRA I don't really my grandfather on my father's side came from Ireland my grandmother on my father's side came from Italy so 1/4 1/4 Irish that's funny but we were 1/4 German all the rest were Italian yeah it's amazing so did they speak Italian yeah yeah they spoke dialect - oh yeah you would you know what the fuck they were saying even if you spoke Italian like if you spoke proper Italian and listened to my grandmother and my grandfather yell at each other and what the fuck they were saying it's each other so much too so cuz they really yeah I was when I was a little kid I go over the house I'd have to hide they would start yelling my grandmother was late for everything everything she ever did she was late for and my grandfather's noise Joe my grip my family was very unoriginal my father's name was Joseph my grandfather's name is Joseph yeah my grandmother's name is Josephine name is Joseph so it was like a lot of fucking joke your grandmother grandma grandma grandma but when when I was over there I remember my grandmother was always yelling at my grandfather's like we gotta leave we gotta leave don't wash me Joe don't rush me and that she'd get crazy they would fucking get crazy I was only scared of marriage I felt yeah I was part of the reason why I was scared my grandparents were always yelling sure those wanted to get the fuck away man just how they communicated back then though I remember my wife my grandparents to like just shock like like like like veins in their neck popping out well if they that they grew up in the hard times man yes when my grandmother had a stroke and when they were taking care of her they started finding these little pockets of money that she had squirreled away in the house all over the house like coffee cans passionate because during the Depression yeah people just they realize like oh my god it can get to a point where there's no food like nothing nothing yeah and people starve to death like yes that's really possible it was the reality and the United States going through that was far better than like say Europe post-world War two yeah Accor or the Soviet Union where you know it was worse there oh fuck man people starve to death who knows untold how many people starve to death in the Soviet Union starve to death I know this sounds selfish but I only thought of it in terms of America of course the whole time oh of course look whoa Russia Russia took it really bad Russia took World War two very very bad and these people that grew up during that era I mean my grandparents came here my grandfather came here I think when he was seven and it was during the Depression so it was like the worst yeah of the early times and you know my grandmother similar age they just had this this mentality like you could all go away they had they had seen it yeah it was burned into them and you know kids today everyone's like fucking leaving food on their plate and no one's worrying about where it's coming from and everybody thinks they had a totally different mentality they were scared big time yeah I mean they had they had enough and they would save everything every little piece a little something you know like tinfoil I mean and think about how messed up it is that they go from that they go from the depression they get out of it and then you roll into World War two like these people they dealt with a lot of different levels of stuff that we didn't have to deal with yeah I mean Tim Kennedy who was a guest of mine recently friend of mine said something very profound he said hard times make tough men easy times make weak men yeah but hard men make easy times yeah you know nice you think about it that way yeah all right hard times make tough men tough men make easy times easy times make weak men yeah it's like a fucking bro cycle people are always like kids today these kids today don't know well it's because they haven't gone through now you can't you can't manufacture that for them my grandmother this is a funny story on 9/11 I was in New York I was at Newark you don't hear that a lot by the way this is a funny story 9/11 but I was at Newark I was flying out that day and we watched the second plane fly

across right into the you know small the plane look small but you just and you so insane so I sit down I just sat we just and I was sitting with an artist a middle-aged man who was an artist and and then we heard about the Pentagon as we were sitting there and he opened up his little art case and had all these razors in it like razor blades and stuff from his artwork like how you know he's a commercial artist and he's like this is all gonna change he said you know people are just they let me on the plane with this and we're just sitting there like just freaked out like calm but freaked out and I was calling my wife who was in New York and I woke her up and we were trying to you know talk and she was going to the thing and at one point that the artist I was sitting with just looked at me like in my eyes like we were trying to understand what was happening he said I think we should go home now I was like yeah yeah right of course we should after sitting there for 20 minutes yeah so I can't get back into New York I can't go back into the city Times gun gun by and I'm out in a cab going up the parkway in New Jersey and there's just dust where the towers were and I'm like holy

that's how they live both my grandmother's are that way just completely like plow ahead plow ahead don't get caught up thinking about everything that's happening this is no sense in it we've done that before yeah and you get nowhere so let's just keep going this way well having a war that affected people the way World War two did were the entire need not just the entire nation was involved but the whole world was involved in this conflict to stop evil yeah it was a different time you had an evildoer yeah you had a real I mean obviously Isis is evil obviously North Korea there's a lot of evil in the world yes not like this evil empire that's invading Europe and dropping bombs on people it's not the saint it's not no Nazis that believe in eugenics and want to create an Aryan race and like that was handling camps and not stopping spreading telling people were coming and they were the most sophisticated in terms of engineering and right like I mean they they have to this day I mean where do you get all the fucking engineers in terms of like automobiles top-end like a OD BMW there's those people were making shit for Nazis back then yeah I mean that's how they were co-opted by the regime did you ever see like one of Hitler's cars there's a outie from like 1930 something that was made for Hitler yeah it's like they were designing engines yeah planes and they were super super advanced super advanced no and you had this real you have this real evil focus like it was like okay the world has got to come and go get this one guy it's him I don't know I mean I wasn't there but it seems more black and white than the way the world is for sure I mean there was a thing called Operation Paperclip that happened where after the war we scooped up all these Nazi scientists secretly and some of them were like Lidge like Wernher von Braun the guy who was in charge of NASA uh-huh he was a Nazi really a hundred percent the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if he was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity and he was the head of NASA he was the head of NASA yeah they took monsters well and they brought those monsters over here and those monsters helped us make of the Apollo rockets jeez yeah and then some of the monsters went to Soviet Union they took some of those monsters okay and it was work I mean and there's no reason to whitewash that either there are real monsters real like they hung the five slowest Jews every day in front of the of the rocket factory in Berlin where Wernher von Braun was making rockets for the Nazis oh my god yeah they had these Jews that were slaves that worked as well I mean there's people that were alive today that have those tattoos in their arms right that talked about meeting him there and she and they they would hang the slowest workers oh my god yeah in the front of the factory keeps going to work mm-hmm doesn't split doesn't leave a country what did you do and then now in Nazi Germany yeah you know how the fuck did you get out you were a slave no not the cheese's baron the guys who were working on the guys who were working for the right like to see the people being hung and still hang in there they were Nazis yeah I mean he wasn't they were all in yeah I mean whether or not he agreed with the ideology wholeheartedly I mean I didn't have a conversation with him I don't know if he's DN for pragmatic purposes he was frightened to it yeah but get a disguise get out of there I don't think they could you know those glasses with the mustaches does that work yeah you go to the airport you take it off like oh it's like NASA guy well there's like a rocket there was a slow slide I'm sure into that I mean the yeah the the slot wasn't that slow but from World War 1 to World War two as it escalated yeah I think it just got to this point where they're like oh my god like what are we doing when they started having concentration camps and killing all these Jews God terrifying yeah and those so he took a lot of those guys brought him over here they worked for work for the US government man oh man I have a 67 Volkswagen little beetle sweet little car sweet little car a little towns no but he's solid and yeah you can't get around every time you minute you think you know this was the people's car this was the you know this is the the early Nazi Germany Hitler on the at the at the plant you know being very proud about this car and stuff well here's a league way of looking at it too you have a 67 right yeah that's like if I had a 1998 car that was produced by Nazis what do you mean in 98 because it's 20 years old 20 years from 67 mm right hey literally yeah it's that era yeah I mean it's so close so close 20 years yeah that's nothing that's nothing god yeah that way is that that cars that's in 20 years removed from Hitler being in power did you literally did you do that randomly let's see that's literally was because that's my car really my car is literally unless you're actually heading back color different wheels different hubcaps now but I mean be to a tee my friend Jimmy lawless had one of those wore in high school it was so light it was crazy so great he had a tiny ass little engine in the back skull four cylinder brain that's a big when you see this little beetle you don't think Nazis you think have you seen what they do they take an older 911 inch and and put them in these yes yeah make them fast I know they do that with the buses to but you look how little those fucking tires are I know I mean that they ain't got any traction no going around turns what that thing is like hey yo they were smart back then though with their engineering which they put the weight of the engine in the back yeah there has such a different effect there it it's kind of amazing to look at all automobile manufacturing in the 30s before the war come like there was enough metal for everybody there was enough ingenuity the French card oh it's the design is so amazing there was a real moment of inspiration and creativity and then the war came in this like all the resources and all the people and everything got dampened down but man they were flying in the 30 yeah what's interesting though is there's another resurgence in the 60s especially in America American cars in the 60s were fucking amazing yeah and then the gas crisis got them yeah right the seventies there dog shit yeah it's been terrible so bad so useless ah my mom had a Pinto bad car but like I'm a muscle car fan right yeah like for me the golden era was like 1960s - somewhere around 71 at the last of the great cars like 71 Barracuda is still pretty badass right but then 72 starts look little shitty Mustangs yeah once you get to 75 their dog shit six but by the time 1980 rolls around just fucking like those things on fire because of the gas well it's be gas crisis came they started making cars cheaper and they were just lighter they tried to make them more fuel-efficient so and something happened to the way they look the yams acting like shit yeah look at that so it's terrible now I want you to so this is a 1979 yes piece of shit now I want you to google 1969 Mach 1 and get ready for this motherfucker 1969 Mach 1 booms son click on that black one right there click on that how do you go from that and ten years later you have that boxy piece of shit look at that red one the upper right-hand corner man that looks like it should come with Steve McQueen oh good Glee Glee moogly look at that thing what a fucking car that is that doesn't doctor was a Steve McQueen and a naked gal in the back Stephen Queen at 68 go with the 19 go 1968 Steve McQueen Mustangs a green one yes boom now look at that that's more than the gas that's some bad something happened in the company something happened with life yeah something happened in Ford look how gorgeous that is God I mean that is a fucking work of art that there's the lines on that thing look I'm a 76 Toyota Corolla one 1976 I want to show you what a badass vehicle I was driving around yeah that yellow [Laughter] orange here's the thing that thing would start up every day yes a hundred percent that's the difference it might look like a piece of shit and it most certainly does that was it that was the color baby shit Orange and I put a racing stripe along the side it's really I had a horn and at the plate 200 different tunes do so happy hour happy birthday yeah everything I to see be in it boy I could contact my friends on my CB you got a CB we're going to the Dairy Queen over did your friends at Seabees - yes friends with TV arias their party I'm not sure going up at Dairy Queen okay get me a blizzard in a minute explain that to me how do you choose what channel you're on you just choose you just saw word we all knew we were on channel you know four or whatever how many channels are there not that many actually so how close do you have to be like 10 miles so within 10 miles you could use it yeah we weren't thinking I had a Toyota Corolla with a horn to play 200 songs I was curved I was having a blast I was so happy to be out of the house but isn't that amazing 'king about this now oh yeah how often people use cell phones and such what what with people thinking back then like why didn't they get CDs on their cars I don't know it's a good question why wouldn't everybody have one I don't know and it was specially then it was like the big trucking year it was a convoy - big convoy yes Woking in the band it had it come on come on Smokey and the Bandit had it in this Trans Am yeah that's right they were talking to each other what year was that I think he was just he had a 79 Trans Am yeah I was gonna put it at 78 that uh Seabees exploded in the 70s when the oil crisis caused the miles per hour on the highways to go down at 55 and truckers started using them until each other where the best gas prices were Oh Network started up people using C B's because I would have thought that they were exploded because they were using them to tell each other where the cops were yeah like smokey in the Bandit yeah dude when I was in high school it was 55 miles per hours of speed limit which is just fucking torture that's torture like what are you doing to people who do you think you are telling people to go 55 miles on the highway on the highway yeah and with a 400 horsepower engine that Steve McQueen car fuck is that all about in my Toyota Corolla it was just fast enough we change speed traps was like the third thing listen yeah yeah I would imagine that would be a big one I mean that's yeah Waze is pretty good for that Waze is like yeah he's spotted ahead you're always a snitch yeah they blocked the freeways - in protest of the lower speed limits did you try remember that I remember the death today oh they all got hideous blocking yourself stupid remember when these morons where we're blocking the highways remember when people were doing that like around San Francisco there was recently yeah well I go they walk like four approaches they would walk out yeah just walk in the highway yeah whoa what the fuck was that about thank God people stop doing that yeah you want everyone to hate you well it's not just that it's like you're stopping people from being able to get to a hospital um you might cause people loved ones lives and they did well that's what happening when he closed down the bridge he has a couple people died because of that because they couldn't get to the hospital they were how was he not in jail for that haha guys the worst house he non-jovi you should totally be in jail other people went to jail for it that is just fucking straight corruption just to make that call the audacity that you would have to have just the balls to make that fucking call and say shut down your bridge that guy was some Eminem's so arrogant do you remember seeing let me cook with it close the beaches and he him and his family were the only one on the beach oh yeah yeah oh yeah dispatch says everything just his body says everything let yourself get to that state yeah Bob and he had an operation - oh he had a stomach stapling did he really and we get through it look at that fucking blow every beach was cool every state beach was closed I think on the fourth of July and him and his fat family were just sitting there on the beach just Eric what a nephew - everybody look at that there's extreme nobody else allowed extreme arrogance and while the beach is closed down for the budget he he ordered him closed right because they couldn't pay for people to watch the beaches it was yeah it's like one of those pissing matches between you know who's going what for the budget and Ally sand portrait of him look at that someone made one of him in the sand that's hilarious yeah the 4th of July look at him in his little shower sandals oh I think the kids call those slides they call them slides you know the kids call those sly hate slides I call flip-flops just long huh when I see someone in the airport with slides on I just want to punch him it's a lot of dudes have slides in the airport with socks on ok because it's lazy you don't like lazy it's lazy yeah but I hello Solomon running shoes that don't even have they don't have laces they have like this little tab you pull and you pull it down and it tightens up and you open it up and it's like velcro yeah but you're still pulling a tab at least there's a little something there what it is yeah just stick them in your feet and flop flop out of the ears flop people like that cuz the lazy school will be as comfortable as possible very very excited about this it makes me so angry but why because your 25 year old man sitting on the floor of an airport waiting for your thing next to your shower sandals it's not a lot of people do it though it's not a lot of people do it but enough people do it with the socks and the slide yeah so much I don't know why does it bother you more or less than flip-flops um a little bit more which is pretty crazy because I really railed against people with flip-flops like Bert Kreischer wears flip-flops everywhere disgusting these kind of grow it's so gross and people act like their feet don't have your feet have a real bacteria between the toes there's like a real there's real germs in there and then they're just slowly slipping them off and putting their but with hose in the magazine rack but Bert is like this life-of-the-party type character that's part of his this thing it's this thing I love I love him too he's disgusting he was there's a video of him on a fucking skateboard flying down his street with flip-flops on I'm like dude do you understand that damage to your toes that you could do for the rest of your life your toes gonna be fucked up if you crash he flying down the street the flip-flops on he's hilarious but no I mean at least at least he's a character like bigger-than-life character you just a flip-flop and you don't care and your pants are hanging off just to get on a flight to Boise just come on my boys let's pick up boys I love boys I'm just what's the issue cuz it's a shorter flight I didn't want to be like you can't even get it together for a short flight you know it's disgusting there's word it is weird it's just come on his ideas about footwork I judge people when I see them with ease ease on yeah yeah there's like six months ago right when he gave me the in the box right there I've contemplated running in him running through like a career and filming it because people love these things so much but I don't want to run home are they expensive because I like running and shoes that are actually supposed to be running in yeah they're expensive look at him he's upset j-jane is one generation younger than me so his like idea what these things are is different than my I feel like they're mad at you for saying that right now some people are some people think it's hilarious that you would do that it's not running oh yeah yeah yeah I know they're mad at me but they're dumb if we're mad at me for what I would do with a pair of sneakers you're fucking idiot alright thinking about sneakers too much what do they look like sitting here in this fucking box I'm not joking I mean I didn't plan this out there here's about here people who are into them are like oh my god you got in there you

message me can I come in as your as your co-host I'll just listen like everybody else that's really cool yeah it should be interesting yeah he wants to get his model 3 up to some high level production and once it's done the time away no model 3 tests on the model 3 yes he's close concentrating on yeah he's just yeah once he's got that they just delivered their first 1,000 flamethrowers this weekend yeah what's up with that to do it just to see what happened like I don't spy one and you couldn't do it take it out back you couldn't do it as a flamethrower so he named it not a flamethrower so what it's called yeah it's called not a flamethrower it's that way you can company not a flamethrower Wow like some airport hangar to pick them up okay but people get killed by these things wait a minute is there much mariachi band play if they're having a good time through our thing yeah it's the big unveiling that's what you picked them up is that real yeah so go back up to that photo of the flame thrower that's Jesus Christ look at that fucking thing pretty cool oh my god that's amazing yeah I'll just gotta buy propane maybe to refill it and connect it and it seems like it's gonna cause a house fire what's the purpose of that - when you when your enemies come close lot of bullets you you hide behind the couch and or if they're in the movie alien yeah yeah they have flamethrowers yeah you need to burn them instead of shoot them because it's a you're on a spaceship if you live on a spaceship oh right right right what are you gonna do with the flamethrower my boyfriend asks me and that's her that's the author out there blasting yeah it's alia she doesn't even have the stock against her fucking armpit she doesn't even know what she's doing look where she's got the stock tuck that into your arm honey yeah but there's not a lot of kickback I don't believe throw rock do that like you're a goddamn professional you exercise with trigger control - what about its internal discipline I didn't realize many tunnels he wants dude he wants us he's doing everything he's making flamethrowers yeah he's making these gigawatt factories these gigantic batteries that are powering Australia yeah I mean Nevada he's a very very unusual human being it's amazing it's just there's walls just do it you have an idea just do it she does not know how to handle that gun somebody saw told me they saw him they saw him speaking and about the tunnels mm-hmm and because he's got to get approval like there's different things he's got to get past and he doesn't just want a tunnel like from here to LAX he wants multiple tunnels so like if you're going to the United Terminal it takes you right there if it goes to the American one it takes you there it's gonna be a whole like ant farm of tunnels all through the city what happens if we get an earthquake what happens if there's a tsunami do those things fill up with water and is everybody drown inside those tubes it says the tunnels are weatherproof mmm it means when it rains yeah that's yeah what about an earthquake I don't think earthquake is weather mmm no I know look I've been given claustrophobic lately ooh why I don't know look at what why had a couple little instances where i was like i've never been claustrophobic before 1994 Northridge earthquake no damage to LA subway tunnels 1989 Loma Prieta Northern California earthquake no damage to tunnels 1985 Mexico City earthquake no damage to tiles which were then used to transport rescue personnel the tunnels were in shape but there's a big rock over the hole that gets you out of the tunnel a building fell on it yeah try to the elevator won't take you out now you're stuck in that little elevator living it over the rest of your life to death in there he's trying talking and you get clipped by some other guy on a test like going 120 miles an hour in the tunnel run over it was doing it to rap because the tunnels not big enough for you to walk in while there's cars in it no I think they recently changed the plan which is good yeah these things called electric skates which people get on like a subway car like a thought yeah it's like a car getting in there but small like only like 16 people yeah sure right to the airport shoot right to downtown yeah yeah it'd be pretty cool but I don't know if I claustrophobia will kill him he's gonna be and then there's nothing the Hyperloop he's doing that Hyperloop thing - the Hyperloop is the that's the fucking train that goes to San Francisco - yeah dude yeah the fuck just keep doing it but this is the crazy thing it's one guy like houses one guy that innovative he has he that smart I don't know he's uh but is he funny he's pretty funny sometimes he's a comedy fan names a store yeah he's middle of the storm it was it Largo with Johnny Depp sex oh right got that loose though that's the only flow he did good smart guy smart that was my only time I worried about him I saw like you know some events as I know what is he doing you probably just get some of that crazy puss I just googled hi pearls beautiful not being with him I know he is doing that but I might not be the only person or he's just involved in the project it's a different well he's also involved in the fucking rocket project SpaceX he's going to Mars yes that's what I wanted to ask you rule if you talked about 3d printing Oh couple dumps yeah we've talked about it - I just watched the recent vice on 3d printing pretty amazing home Oh God yeah well um who has one that guy Burt grace your fucking puppet guy Jeff Dunham Jeff Dunham yeah he sits with him he makes a lot of shit with him he was on Opie and Anthony back in the day apparently he's like a super tech geek yeah and he was on Opie and Anthony back in the day news talk he had like one of the earlier 3d printers really yeah they're getting really really complex Mike they're making human babies hearts they're making human ears there he is making the Achmed mobile controlled chaos Jeff Dunham so he does all this stuff himself he's a fucking character Jeff Dunham yeah interesting guy that's amazing you put anything and the computer like actually there was sure like a dishwasher and anything the guy wanted to manufacture the part it's inside the dishwasher the computer says no we can improve on that part whoa and we're gonna alter the shape of it and I have it be like this and then it makes that and then you use it wow it's getting so crazy you want sound washer human cells and they're making ears and you know skin and it's amazing they think that in the future you won't be buying things you'll be downloading schematics yeah and then getting the raw materials writing the raw materials you'll have like in your machine somehow or another and it'll make whatever you need like say if you need french press right it'll make a French press it'll 3d print a French press for you you won't go to the store and buy one you'll just like download the whatever it is you don't need a manufacturer and no one's gonna be in this business of making presses less I mean less and less and but the thing is like more and more demand will be for things like this table right there like craftsmanship or someone makes something for you right right yeah which is you're kind of seeing that now like people are getting you know there's all these these restaurants that are like kind of farm-to-table and wooden metal and everything's like rustic and everything's like kind of retro if when his armpit hair that's not what we're talking about Wow they had razors a long time ago there's no excuse for girls to have armpit hair isn't it funny guys it's fine I've armpit hair do you have armpit hair I did you do yeah if you don't have armpit hair I'm like what happened disease bro were you in a fire at alopecia does your friend have a flamethrower it's like like if girls with their junk like okay here's a perfect example bought whole hair on girls right like when we were kids can't get enough standard it was normal it was there was chaos right just how you grew it was just a big fucking pile of whatever nowadays if you're a gal you're young single gal you got butt hair bottle hair you're taking some risks right you're like I don't care love me who I am yeah you must be into older men because that's the only one that can for who I am like um no no we're not doing that anymore we're trying to evolve and yeah first thing that's evolving is women's hair you gotta start somewhere like how many women when you go to the beach how many women shave their legs all of all of them that's fucking crazy like yeah it's like the the grooming standards that we've imposed on women like the cultures imposed on women it's pretty crazy it's fucking great it's so crazy in comparison to us like you and I yeah fucking hairy armpits shit I have one patch of hair on my back oh yeah wolf just like one side I get it like when the American we're all from London the transformation sequences yeah like I stopped quarter way through yeah it's fine I mean the standards yeah it's weird it's very weird it's weird but it's Oh what it's also weird is that people who are really poor women who are really progressive still like doing certain parts of it that for me is a man watching it is always like yeah we're all the same let's own it and stuff but I'm still gonna put this big big line on my eyes to make it look like I'm gonna put extra lashes on to make it look like yeah it's weird like the what you choose to sculpted eyebrows and shit eyebrows some dude sculptor eyebrows yeah they're gonna work for those guys because they're in starts with an F ends with a T and it rhymes a faggot no a cabaret start yes it's a bundle of wood no it's uh it's yeah it's very bizarre I always feel like but they also like it's empowering to feel good and it does make women feel good yeah be in heels well then there's a lot of standards for gay folks like gay guys they do it way different and by the way when I use that f-word I should not use that and definitely wouldn't use it for gay guys we know you consider the source gotta be careful though be careful in today's days day and age yeah but people know you're a good person some people don't they know you're making it a blur it's a dangerous time Lisa Lampanelli thing what happened she was screaming it at an audience man like like really completely which arts I think it just happened last night I don't know I heard it in the radio she's like screaming you sons of bitches did you see that she yelled at them called them sexy bitches on stage nuclear meltdown fan hens or $100 to shut up she goes oh she have blue on her hair yes she's got blue in her hair nuclear meltdown someone tried to say something a middle of her set she just goes batshit crazy she went nuclear on a fan who gave her $100 to shut up in the middle of her gig why would someone why would someone pay her at a show to go try to get her to shut up so one after someone from the balcony called her a cunt it all went downhill from there how long is it gonna be before you can't say that word anymore probably good till like next Wednesday yeah we're running the sand in the hourglass yeah like I said like when I just said faggot I felt it like ooh this is a dangerous time to say that word yeah don't say anything yeah no no no no even as a joke you've not even calling an individual person at just saying the noise that is that word like it's getting down to the like you'd caught up to call it the other F word yeah yeah one word it's clearly established right you say it all the time people even say it on stage and a comedy set they'll say the n-word right say V n-word and what they won't say it now yeah and if they do say it people oh yes yes forget it from the crowd and get it now that's gone but Jane retarted about yeah pretty much yeah I think it's probably buddy but you can say it but the way you're saying it you could say retarded right right the n-word we know you wanted to say I know I'm too scared it's the word bigger but without the B with a different with an N in it I can't even do that I'm doing I can't even say bigger but without a B with an N that's how tricky it is I'm just feeling for the keys in my pocket damn it were terrified Jamie you were telling me about who what was the rap concert where the girl got on stage and she was saying yeah that Kendrick Lamar concert which so I guess there's a song that happens a lot you can see lots of videos of the crowds singing all the words which has a lot of n words in it including white people in the crowd correct yeah lots of that's the only way yeah so in this video sama right grow up on stage who's obviously drunk like kind of almost set her up to do it she said like two or three times he stopped it stopped the whole thing well what did she say it's an efference to just it's a it's in the songs oh so she sits along yes she was doing like karaoke like a song lyric and then they turned on her that's not for you that's only yeah that's mean yeah I had a bit from 2009 yeah my spike TV special okay woman gets on stage [Music] Delaney oh and she's gonna do it oh my god she's just he set her up yeah it's terrible though we started that here we go he's mocking her already yeah she must be so nervous he kissed all together love they probably got me down but again that is song are we playing this over to the radiators you pulled let's find out what happens [Applause] [Music] Oh very Jesus Christ they start lately [Applause] that's terrible this is crazy you gotta make one single word oh I'm sorry yeah you did I'm sorry but there [Music] [Applause] all of the thumbs down get off your set the noise but he says that we love you can't say the noise that's mostly its mean we live in hilarious and preposterous times I mean that is so strange that is his song yeah he wrote it a song he wrote the word is his she loves him she loves him she's at his concert he gave her the microphone played the song she's singing the song that he loves yeah that he wrote now no audience loves and everybody's like you did the wrong thing you made the noise so wow that was bad she's so help doing it though and this little crowd looks mostly white yeah they're all screaming [Applause] okay I know this is why I stay home don't go to if there's a lot of people there yeah you can do it you can do it if there's a bunch of people there if yeah but if you can't do it if you're by yourself no onstage by herself in front of those people you can't do it but if you're in with them you could do it yes and that was mostly white that was a lot of white there in the course in that one white people are ridiculous it's so confused I mean this is a strange time I was gonna say I did this Spike TV special in 2009 and there was a do you remember that old commercial with the girl comes home and her dogs start talking to her like Lindsay I really wish you wouldn't smoke pot you're not the same you smoke pot and I miss my friend yeah I had this whole thing where I was like I was like first of all whatever that chicks on she's not on pot cuz if you were on pot you'd be like wait a minute my fucking dog can talk right how long you been able to talk did I had my whole fucking life you hold it like this is the first shit you said right you know and I went through this whole thing and I called my dog faggot this guy this was like in the beginning of political correctness right 2009 he this is a gay guy said this to me he goes you can't say that word that's our nigger that's our word right that's what he said right he literally said I go wait a minute what did you just say yeah and he said it's our nigger we're allowed to say it you can't say it I go that's the gayest shit I've ever heard oh I'm talking to a dog yeah I'm talking I'm angry at a dog because I've had this dog my whole life his first words out of his mouth I tell you I love you every day and and what do you say you say I wish you wouldn't smoke weed yeah hey fuck you stupid I smoke weed not go to work and I pay for your food faggot like that was that was the joke that was and he got he got like you know like these rules are preposterous isn't supposed to be about intent okay isn't supposed to be like yeah I'm supposed to be conveying how I feel and the words are supposed to mirror my thoughts right like when you have magic words that you can't say and in this case with the n-word it's even crazier because it's like some people could say it you could say it sometimes sometimes you can't say yeah it's too heavy what black people could say it why people can't but white people can say it if we're in the crowd and they're yelling it out but as long as there's an A on the end of it yeah right exactly the ER is what gets you in trouble well look racism is disgusting all racism racism against Chinese people racism against white people racism against every of course against black people of course against everyone judging someone on something they have no control over yeah that's what it is like you well you're born whatever you're born Irish German Italian African what you're born it's not you yeah you you're just who you are Yeah right so racism is disgusting but is that is it racism when you have that girl on stage and she's singing that song that she loves that you sing it's your song like that's not really racism now so when she's singing along and everybody's you racist you fucking Nazi like what are we doing because this is what we're doing here is where we we've gone into some ridiculous zone where it's not doesn't make any sense because we know that's not her intent no exactly right this is electoral exercise exactly it becomes like a word game it's a little puzzle kind of thing that we're doing to trap this person you'd say she's very innocent up there they all know she's a little drunk it's kind of like setting someone up to do something yeah it's pretty gross it's just weird but it's weird that it's so universal like that crowd that was probably 20,000 people though yeah I had a weird thing on you know I'm I I'm on the show live from here the old Prairie Home Companion show and you know I'm the writer for it and stuff had right around and appear on it and stuff anyway I'm very involved with the show Chris who's this bluegrass guy who plays a mandolin who's a amazing the kindest person you'd ever meet like super super sweet sweet person like like mr. Rogers in a way like it's to that level of kindness and he sings everybody's birthdays and stuff and he sings different songs and as a tribute to everything he loves all music he loves everything he sang a Kendrick Lamar song he sang a little bit of it in like because it was his birthday that week and he got so much hate online that a white person can't be singing that song what is the song about it's uh I don't know but it wasn't that wasn't the thing it was the n-word it was that he was what's the cultural appropriation that he's not allowed to sing and meanwhile he's singing bluegrass Indian music right I mean from all around the world this is a a kind soul celebrating everything hmm and it really freaked him out cuz he is so nice he couldn't believe the hate that he got from it that now he's super sensitive about singing that music at all it's not logical it's not one you have to put your foot down and you consider the source so culturally we have to put our foot down because we're going down this very strange illogical road where you could just decide what's evil and what's bad and it doesn't have any bearing on the thought or the intent behind it is look they went after Bruno Mars like get in the just get the fuck out of here yeah they accused Bruno Mars of cultural appropriation what culture he's everything he's everything because like the per meanwhile what is he doing where anybody would accuse him of cultural appropriation he sings his beautiful fucking song oh he's the last light in this world he's amazing yes I love that crowd the guy's amazing voice is fantastic and his songs are fun and they're catchy and the I love listening to the I saw him in Vegas in concert it was just the most uplifting bright thing you know what me happy though is that a bunch of black artists said fuck you he's great like what was the original charge just fuckin with the social justice warriors were going after him for cultural appropriation all these like super progressive angry fuck heads mulcher whatever man it doesn't have to make sense this is the thing they're just looking for targets yeah it doesn't have to make sense this is not it's not like a logical progression like Oh Bruno Mars is it's not like oh he's stealing from these old blues singers and he's not crediting them and he's oh come a white guy from Kentucky that's not what we're dealing with right we're dealing with a multiracial guy who sings these beautiful songs that they don't they're not cultural appropriation even if he was white and ya know exactly it's just a joy of music and music is a mix of everything it's a mix of all of us of everything that is good Brian companies are saying like his style but if that's the case then here's the case I'm a fuckin huge fan of the Black Keys The Black Keys a lot of their shit is blues a lot of it is old blues like it sounds so similar to some great old blues sure is a culture appropriation I mean I don't love them are you saying they should stop doing what I what I love to hear no come on I mean what are we doing yeah that's crazy but what is it what what you know what the other part of it is how many people are really complaining about that stuff it's a very small amount so small but it's enough where your friend got scared he did get scared and it literally amounts to probably three tweets you know anybody it's like but those people that's the only noise people aren't saying wow I love that version because they just like it and they're normal people it's these haters that just want to do it and but the people in control of it have to calm him and make him realize we've got your bad days rhabdo now that Zell fuck can fire him if it gets loud enough it doesn't have to make any sense yeah that's where it's squirrelly dude they fired speaking of Prairie Home Companion they fired Garrison Keillor I know they fired him removed his name from everything because he hugged a lady and his hand went down her back yeah and then he apologized sent her an email she said it's fine they went back and forth with it didn't do anything else no history of sexual harassment sexual assault no history of anything terrible years later when all this meat to stuff comes out she comes out with that yeah it was dirty business yeah it was dirty it's dirty but it doesn't it's not logical right it's like there's this fever feeding frenzy that goes on with these things it's mob mentality yeah they just want to tear people down they want to tear people I really believe that you have to in all these situations is consider the source like you really have to consider it's like when the steroid thing went down there were like people came at Barry Bonds harder than everybody else because he had a rap for not being a good guy people did not like him regardless of that oh so when it happens people can they come after him harder than they came after Sammy Sosa yes and yeah much harder than like Andy Pettitte or you know he was a pitcher for the Yankees it's just like a nice guy and they doesn't yeah you know but if somebody is a problem Jose Canseco Jose Canseco was a problem because he ratted everybody out oh yeah that's really what that book called juiced yeah Boyd that goes into everything that could made him persona non-grata like he just kind of disappeared he got written off yeah from that book yeah people just decided fuck you yeah that's interesting right it is it is yet too much of a snitch I guess yeah man people just didn't respect him after that yeah because there were so many people that were also doing it and he was the one that ratted everybody out and profited off of it yeah there's some there's some justice some street justice in that mm-hmm I just think that there's a little it'd be really careful with call but it's just there's also an issue that everyone has access to social media and everyone has the ability to complain about things yeah sorry buddy there's a world right so there's a lot of noise at the end of it yeah you get the real sound like like there are things that happen that are really bad and when something happens it's really bad yeah the the Twitter mob and all the people that go after these people for something that's that's legitimately off all sure it makes sense yeah I mean it's there's there's justice to it yeah but there's also like this constant looking for targets yes that it seems like they're that's kind of a hobby of some people yeah like that is the swing honeybees just to go out and pick people off yeah it's awful it's a it's a horrible thing it is I mean you know because and it's cousin tit at its best it's a really wonderful thing right it's a celebratory thing that you have this community that you share with and think about like you can see things from all around the world you could see cultures you could see young people doing amazing things in all these different little tiny spots around like I mean in so many ways you know it's beautiful but then there's just like this little dark underbelly of like hate there really just is good and bad in the world and there are there is good and bad in the world but there's also people that are just very frustrated and looking to vent that frustration as often as they can yeah whatever targets they find to be viable yeah it's not like they've carefully considered the issue and carefully considered this person's stance on it like no for me one of the big ones was the Roseanne Barr thing because Roseanne Barr what she said seemed racist right you look at it on the surface she called that lady something like a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes right and like well Jesus is calling black woman an ape yeah she said she didn't even know that woman was black and then you see her photo and you go oh okay that woman is very racially ambiguous oh yeah I talked to her on the phone she told me oh yeah did not know that woman she goes you really think that I would call a black lady Planet of the Apes I'm not fucking stupid and her literal words she goes I didn't know she goes I just was fucked up on ambien and drinking all weekend and tweeting a bunch of stupid shit her own words right she's like I didn't know what I was saying right and no one cares though no one cares that you got a lady who has mental illness write a history of mental illness is on a host of different medications is on ambien as well and drinking and smoking pot no one cares you you compared a black woman to Planet of the Apes right and then all these people made these memes where they put a photo of that woman next to that woman from the Planet of the Apes right and like you know you see like why she was joking around about it but it's totally off limits so they've sided she's is horrible racist forget about all her years of well you know people loving her and well she also has if you go back to the source kind of thing it's like you know she there's a picture of her dressed like a Nazi there's like Jewish I know but there's like there's enough she's always tweeting bombastic stuff mm-hmm so when she's got issue it's not yeah so it's not like it's not like somebody like Rachael Ray just making muffins and all of a sudden one tweet comes out she's in that area and I think when you're in that area and you're spewing hate and you're throwing fireballs and stuff whether you have good intent or not you're in that arena you can get burned by it yeah she's a Chenoa to me yeah she's a total shit stirrer remember the national anthem she grabs her car fits in the ground and apparently everyone fucking was super she was scared right after that because that's a patriotic thing oh yeah you don't fuck people people were mad I remember that the the issue that with Roseanne to me is not even that tweet not even even the the recent plan of the apes one uh-huh it's an earlier one that she made five years ago which is much more racist oh really about yeah about Susan Rice where she said Susan Rice is a man with big swinging eight balls that and that's you're talking about an absolutely black woman yes there's not there's something there those like that's the thing it's the source it's like there's this person that has all of this kind of stuff and she's always going up to the line and you know not crossing it but maybe sometimes crossing and then you do it you're gonna get popped do you remember when Imus got kicked off the radio force and about some some gals who were athletes who called them nappy-headed hos oh yeah of course and that was like whoa yeah man you know look you want to play in those fire arenas you can get burned right now occasionally you drop some bombs and it's great yeah and you make some but if you're a shit stirrer right if you're trying to drop bombs occasionally but the shit's gonna land on you sometimes like racist bombs are the ones that get you burned the most we have not healed as a nation we're this very confused we net it's like you know we grew up like with an alcoholic dysfunctional fathers and there's like there's a sickness like when you talked about how there's only 20 years between Hitler and yeah my Volkswagen coming out is not all that much time between the that most heinous part of that to today I mean it's what's less than 200 years to life times its raw less there were lot of times between us and slavery I think like just recently like the last person last african-american person who was around during slavery just passed I mean we're it's you know what I mean we're we never healed we never had a discussion we didn't go to therapy and forget about just slavery how about the civil rights yes I mean how about his life people hosing people down with fire hoses and siccing dogs on them those in if not our lifetime just before we were born and still today there's still you go to certain parts he'll pop and stuff off and people you know as a white guy you walk around you hear people say shit because they think you're they're safe around you and it's look at you you'll still around this guy bread this guy just bakes bread and stays home that's why I do it I tricky you know what I mean like we have a that is our disease in our in our culture there is a disease that we haven't met it out yet so of course like any if you're gonna pop off about that you're gonna be it's why why are you are you that makes you feel like that all of your Roseanne yeah that's her whole thing is getting this little reaction other people yeah I mean a lot of comics that's their thing right saying little little little controversial things to get a spark out of people that's fine if you and and look you know I have a sensitivity I don't even I don't want to go in that arena cuz it's just I don't even do what people yell at wreck it when people yell around me I don't like it it's not me anything about anything I just we're only here for a little while why are we gonna fight that's where I live but there was there are people and they yes and they and they can read there are people that do it who can read tweets calling them horrible things and it just kind of you know bounces off them they don't really care I don't think they read it that's a is that what they do yeah well if you read tweets that about people that say horrible things to you I mean you gonna respond to them are you gonna engage in a dialogue and then other people gonna join in you gonna respond to all them you won't have any time there's no time you won't your whole day will be taking up that with new people jumping into the fray it's like if you want to have a fistfight with a mom a mob of people you can't really do that yeah discussion with a one-on-one person but if you fight a whole crowd of people like that kendrick lamar if that lady was like fuck you bitch i'll say that word dives in the crowd starts throwing haymakers get fucking killed yeah but if she has a discussion with like one of those white guys doing this boo boo that was just yelling it out himself if they put you put them alone in a room and she said okay tell me why what I did was wrong and he was like it's just fucked up you can use that word you know you can't use that word it's like motherfucker you were saying it no no I'm saying with everybody else and I make the noise with my face I like I open my mouth like I'm I said but I don't say I don't say I kind of start it and then I let other people end it I like do the end part or I'll do the gum part I don't do the image we I don't do a whole word because that way I'm not racist it's so complex it's too crazy but it's not complex it's stupid it is complex but what's complex about that well not that just that issue but what's complex about that to me is that you have a whole crowd of people yelling responding this way like it's on their minds right they're having these discussions that we are trying to move things forward other people are trying to move back that is complex let's try to move it back who's actively saying I mean other than like white nationalist groups that everybody pretty much hates other than themselves I guess I move it back and then other people who think that maybe that they're being that it's being reversed and that they're being hated on now when they you know white like young white who just wants to have a good time at the concert and sing away well but why are you attacking us I we're we're trying to be this way someone put up some vias at a school that was criticized by a Dean and was taken down they put up these signs that say it's okay to be white mm-hmm fuck google that because this was kind of crazy and that this whoever this Dean was or whoever was that he said guys these people they put up these signs that said it's okay to be white Wow all right and and people were angry yeah it's like white lives matter that's the thing no just that statement right it's okay to be white like why would anybody have a problem with that like you know why do you feel you gotta say that what are you thinking about the people that aren't white what do you like yeah that's what I mean it is complain it's too complex or is that fucking stupid here it is sign saying it's okay to be white found at Maryland high school what does it say something at 5:45 a.m. and removed by staff before students arrived for classes also they discovered them we're taking this seriously oh my god they sent a letter home to families informing them that the signs were discovered on ten doors at 5:45 a.m. and removed by staff before students arrived for classes we are taking this seriously and are investigating this incident wrote Rene Johnson the school's principal our research so far has indicated this may be a part of a concerted national campaign to four meant racial and political tension in our school and community the same flyer was posted in other cities and communities this week okay but here's the question do you disagree with the sentiment of that statement it is okay to be why it's okay to be Chinese it's okay to be Indian it's okay to be whatever the fuck you are Yan okay to be racist maybe if they wrote it's okay to be right it's not okay to be racist maybe they wrote that would that be an issue that would have been that would have helped right that would have helped when you you know you walk into your school campus and all of a sudden there's signs up everywhere that normally there are no signs well if they think they're a white person and they feel like they're being openly racially discriminated against is it okay to say hey it's all right to be white is that okay yeah there's yes of course so what's wrong with that sign because you pop them up in the middle of the night and put them all up on it and Hank Easton come in with your little lunch bag and you're gonna teach your Spanish class and on your doors a sign that says okay to be wait you just your knee-jerk reaction as well what are you doing the fliers appear to be a part of an online campaign that is detailed on the web form 4chan okay but is it a that but is that saying that fortunes talking about this online campaign or is it saying the 4chan started this online campaign I would lean towards that because it was Halloween night and they discovered on the this article was posted November first so not like it's just a fun Halloween prank but like people do do that stuff yeah you know it's like yeah it's totally okay to think it and you know it's like the guy with the bumper stickers all over his car it's like the there those guys are a little more unhinged than the other people it's like yeah I think it's okay to be white do I have to make a sign do I have to go get copies do I have to get some tape do I have to sneak on campus do I have to put it up there there was an article in washington post google this this woman wrote this article why can't we hate men and it was published in The Washington Post and of course had a photo of Harvey Weinstein who's a disgusting man right right and this is like the perfect example but that is literally like it's like does that mean well I'm the worst white man Hitler yeah and why can't we hate white men right it's all white men or Hitler why can't we hate white people is that what the article well the article I don't know what the article says I didn't read it but I mean like how could you write an article that says why can't we hate men well you because you want to get unless you're trying to say we can't hate men because men are human and we've got to give everybody a chance and we can't generalize even if men have done horrible things I'd have to read it I don't I mean it's definitely the the headline is made to make you want to read it it's click bTW yeah it's great exactly it's fascinating how about we just take the hate out guys can't we just do that what's wrong with just tom pump was a big sweetie come on can't we just get along who are big sweetie come on you're gonna be here how much time I would much rather live in a world where you go with your grandfather and get a little a little bread and you come back home and they yell at each other and you make a meal you know what I mean like why are you spending all this time because I mean there's people that need to spend the time to move the culture and do things and protect themselves that's not what this is this is people trying to get attention for their work they're trying to get attention for their quick beady little articles and click beady little things yes of course little campaigns against people that's what it is I mean people yes that shit all I would have had to do with this book is is write something about Trump in it and that people could soundbite right right and I'd enter and have a lot of people be like what is it and get everybody talking about it right right that's what they're doing they're trying to make up make noise so people look at them and they make more money well and then is also I mean there has to be a thought behind it like that men have done some horrible shitty things so the but the idea of why can't you generalize well you can't generalize because you're a nuanced human being man you're supposed to be able to understand the functional well every one is different literally every yes every single there's 150 million men the idea of why can't you hate all of them well you can if you want to but that's it's a ridiculous way to live your life no exactly exactly so you means if are you are you straight and you were attracted to men and you have to hate them all and quarantine yourself away for there's a lot of those guys right there's a lot of really good people out there it's Father's Day how often does that have to happen with with people who are homophobic who hate gay people yeah rally against gay marriage and rally against gay rights and then you find out that they're really gay yes oh my all the time all the time all the time almost every every one per religious guy yeah he was gay some scandal always comes out oh he was sleeping with yes oh it's they're so common it's cliche yeah right exactly yeah it's that missing you look for it when someone you know talks about gay it's a sin against man yeah we should lock them up we should do this from Oh someone sucking dick on the sneak tip we're gonna find it yeah find it I mean that's that is what people do I think what I like about what you're saying and how I feel too is that we need to be nice to each other we this this whole idea of this gotcha bullshit and this attacking people for things that don't necessarily make sense without without nuance without the the understanding of complexity of human interaction with no concern for that at all yeah because you just want a target you know we have to shun that stuff yeah that's the scent that stuff is just pure foolishness and it's bad for discourse it's bad for community it's bad for the way we communicate with each other generates more hate and it's it's also a generalization a gross generalization which is just the same thing as sexism it's the same thing as racism it's the same it's the same thing why can't we hate men is a gross generalization yeah that's - I don't know what the article said that statement that's a gross general you can't because you're a nice person right assume you're a nice person yeah cuz we cuz we don't hate how about that how about we try not to hate them all you hate Justin Trudeau that guy seems like a sweet guy seems awesome here Trump remains weak yeah in an amazing suit Trump called him weak and dishonest yeah no I mean you know the culture has enough hate I think the campaign has to be yeah for more kindness okay that that's a great picture him sitting there with his arms crossed and they're all leaning yeah on the tables listen to us just listen all angry yeah no no wonder what they're talking about right there like should we go to lunch like spaghetti we don't have spaghetti Donald we don't have spaghetti it's a make spaghetti make some fucking spaghetti could someone gets me make me a fucking pizza okay you just give up with everybody else I wonder what they were that is a great picture though yeah that's great with him being the only one sitting down as an arms crossed he looks like so spoiled and her the look on her face yeah she's like is that the woman from Germany yeah Merkel she's got seconds of her own I have to deal with this guy sisters on the table first yeah what are you doing for Father's Day what do you nothing nothing nothing of hanging every day's Father's Day it's true hey I don't want to I don't want any special treatment I don't I don't celebrate my birthday mm-hmm I don't want anybody to give me Christmas presents yeah do they anyway yeah of course but I don't I'm the same way yeah dad is just supposed to be there I like having him around I wanted I always tell them I want to see your faces that's all I want I got all the gifts I got all the love you got everything I get if I get hugs every day I'm more than happy totally I don't want like some fucking cake or some stupid shit my day there's no Father's Day brunch there's no like you know having to race through them all and get flowers for Father's Day they just let us be some way around from some woman heckled in Chicago there was like a says like I was talking about I was actually it's a pro-woman piece it's a piece about how we forget that women make all the human beings right this idea that women are supposed to do everything that men do plus they also make all the fucking human beings so I this it's a law it's like this complex or a twisty row that I take people down with this right there's a lot of like misdirection and yeah and anyway I say it and then later on I'm talking about something else and this girl yells out we make all the people and I'm like I just said that five minutes ago I go I go that bitch is one of those chicks it celebrates her birthday all month long but it's like that's what I don't want to be I know the person that wants the attention like this is it's my father's day it's Father's Day the whole month is Father's month finally we're getting ours no no we got it easy I'm the same way yeah I just want them around in the house let me see your faces through is not that's a harder cake no the reward is actually in being a father it's the greatest thing ever yeah just hold my hand for a minute just come up just be like yeah hug me miss the little squeeze yeah and we're good and I think they like that too like I don't know dads don't want you running through the mall like you try to find stuff for us and also dads buy everything anyway dude I went to the King Tut exhibit oh yeah downtown how are they amazing oh yeah crazy they've things they're from 3,300 years ago Wow they constructed them

has cams on it and it works on a totally different system the fact that you fucking people are running a goddamn museum and you don't know what a compound bow is really pisses me off right now there's a little of it gee mr. Roker Mike did we just thought it with a bow and arrow I took a photo of it and I took a photo of what it says what it says there cuz I was like legitimately angry I was reading this thing where it says compound bow here it says here's what it says it says gilded wooden compound bow with glass and calcite inlay it's not a cop what team if thought it with a bow and arrow it's a ceremonial bow a compound bow damn one of those bows that I have in the back there there this is this is a very new modern creation you fuckin with Tutankhamun you're like obsessed with the bow and arrow well to you well yeah and it makes me angry you're wearing an archery shirt right yeah nobody has archery shirts where's archery practice every day to me I know news that's like if I was looking at a jujitsu diagram yeah and they said this is kung fu like hey you fucks yeah this is important this is Brazilian yeah that's why I love boomerangs yeah boomerangs though but the boomerangs the shape of them they were not designed to come back that's interesting like oh I wonder like when they figured out like that was designed to as a weapon yeah but just not not enough of a curve for it to return to the thrower so it just means to hit somebody it's just a good you know way to throw something and hit it I love boomerangs they're pretty dope ha they're cool it's cool design oh I would go find open fields and yeah you don't catch it like it doesn't come right back it comes back and like sails slowly down like in a spiral at the end you know what's fucked up though about this tent King Tut exhibit is you really got the sense that he was an inbred really his the shape of his head was all fucked up and he had a club foot like he was in but he had two children that were not mummified with him that were stillborn uh-huh so and he married his sister his father had a baby with someone else and then he married his half-sister he's banging his half-sister what they did they they were this they were constantly inbreeding in the royal families try to keep the bloodline pure and to try to keep all the money in the family ugly yeah that's did you ever see his head would his head is shaped like uh huh Jamie pull up a photo of King Talking Heads beanhead skull he had this weird shaped deformed skull and a clubfoot and all the depictions of his body yeah because it's a weird yeah his head like look how big his head like stuck up in the back no we're he was essentially inbred like there was something wrong with him was he a good king I was only around for a little while he was it's just because we found his stuff I mean it's not like he had that much global impact or did he that's a good question I'm not I'm sure but played a weird little story is amazing of how they found it in the exhibit they have this IMAX movie that goes along with the exhibit oh yeah fucking badass because the IMAX screen is gigantic right yeah so when you're there you get a real sense of how big these structures actually are right but they were looking for it for five years this guy this British guy and this kid named Hussain who was the like he would get water for all the workers uh-huh he was clearing like he had these water pots and they set him into the ground so that people could come scoop water while they were digging in Japanese yeah well they're trying to find this tomb and he found a step he put the this water bottle down and he cleared some dirt away and he found this flat rock just randomly that rock was this this one of the stairs that led down to the tomb and it was the only tomb that they ever found that was completely like untouched really yeah grave robbers yeah grave robbers had found every other tomb because they really they tubes were miles away from the pyramids because I mean they probably had tombs in the pyramids that were raided and then they realized after a while I click we got to hide these things right so they took them way far out miles and miles away and they they put them in these like hillsides and they but then thieves found them there too she's so so it was that one like underground did they build it that way or over time no was underground it wasn't it yeah yeah Wow that's amazing so me was a cool way to discover something yeah is it one kid and who's the first one in the tomb - because he was tiny cuz when they busted the hole they busted a hole through the wall and he climbed in with a light and sound and you see anything down there Billy well yeah that's part of the film is the archaeologists like looking through the hole and seeing like the gold and all the chip through the hole my god thousands and thousands of years completely untouched amazing that's amazing then you take that one thing and a big giant rock ball starts rolling after you whoa like Indiana Jones yeah that's remarks if it is really interesting because like they had like a glove a linen glove that was 3000 years old really and you're looking at this linen glove and they had sandals they had the sarcophagus and sandals like he had like these sort of you know decorative sandals so how long were they making that stuff even before then if that's 3,000 years a year so even before that I had a guy on recently dr. Robert Schoch from Boston University and he's a geologist and he is one of the he's one of the first people to propose the idea like one of the first like real scholars to propose the idea that the Sphinx is far far older than people think it is and that it's not from 2500 BC but it's from way before that perhaps maybe 10,000 years old than that because it has water erosion all of it can only have come from thousands of years of rainfall yeah so it's the implication of that the implication is there were well his his take on it which is really interesting and he really scared the shit out of me and blew my mind mass coronal inject ejections so something from the Sun some gigantic solar flare mm-hmm that created unbelievable havoc on earth he was talking about lightning storms that were like the Lightning coming down like sheets of rain in a hurricane and that it like just covered parts of the earth and lightning and killed everything and killed off mass mmm just mass numbers of human beings large mammals although it's responsible for there's a there's a big mass extinction that we really don't understand what caused somewhere in that range of around 10,000 years ago right and he attributes that to this mass coronal ejection and that this this huge Sun this burst of energy from the Sun caused these unbelievable chaotic storms that killed who knows County I said so is it like like a thunderstorm a hundred he's like no times a million he was like sheets times a million sheets of lightning coming down like rain in a hurricane oh my gosh Majan lightning just just cooking the earth for like a long period of time or just like one big storm long period of time like so the Sun just kept people that started living in caves and they built these dwellings inside the earth because that way where that survived they could survive where the radiation wasn't coming down it wasn't going through the earth to get to them so houses tents anything that you lived in that was outside that those those people were dead the only people that live or the people that lived the Heather houses carved into hillsides is there evidence of this yeah yeah yeah everybody's geological evidence which is visit a mainstream thing or is kind of wells he kind of that's possible as mainstream right whether or not it happened then is up for debate it's also the end of the Ice Age and he thinks that's the reason why the all these ice caps melted and this was what caused oh that was part of that has a massive shift in the massive shift in the the global temperature jeez yeah that's crazy I was just reading a thing about the Ice Age yesterday in The Times that about how the ice changed Manhattan all the five boroughs like that's kind of where the ice kind of came down to was around there and seeing how receded and what it left behind we were but there but the civilizations weren't really living around then right what do you mean during the Ice Age of course there were they were well there were some civilizations I mean there's established civilizations like there's some structures for gathering well there's some structures that have been absolutely linked to that time a big one is gobekli tepe which is in Turkey and they have they've absolutely dated that to 12,000 years ago so what's fascinating about that is they didn't know that people were capable of building these gigantic stone structures 12,000 years ago and they've only uncovered a very small amount of Quebec Lee Tepe it's a huge huge site so do you think that there's still tons of stuff we could discover out there that hasn't been tapped yet like under the oceans or yeah for sure yeah well if people lined it if these guys are right and here's the thing they what they think is that there's been there was a big dip and I forget what his term that he used to describe it but it was the there was a Dark Age that was created by these mass ejections and that civilization particularly in Egypt had reached a very high level of sophistication when they were capable of building these gigantic stone structures and right they had all this amazing architecture and engineering or to move these huge stones and then there was a big die-off and that for thousands of years people essentially were knocked back almost down into Stone Age and then regrouped and this is but this cataclysmic story this story is in Noah's Ark it's in the Epic of Gilgamesh which is around some air which is where Iraq is like they all talk about I'll talk about the floods and Catalina's chaos and Brad not punished everyone and everyone died this is like a part of human history many different versions of like right what exactly happened yeah but he's pointing to geological evidence which is fascinating because at one point in time nine around 9,000 BC the nile valley was not all sand the way we see it now but it was a tropical rainforest and so for thousands of years before that it was you know torrential downpours and rain and that all this was the reason why the Sphinx enclosure has these deep fissures that are indicative of rainfall and water erosion for thousands of years not just instantaneous flooding from some giant event but from thousands of years of rainfall of rain is constant rain yeah and so that would predate the the idea is the current established timeline is that the Great Sphinx was created somewhere around the time that they believe the great pyramids were created now the Great Pyramid they've they've they've done carbon dating that indicates that that was somewhere around 2500 BC uh-huh he thinks that that was built over an older site that was from many many years before then he has all these photos oh yes our construction methods that they've done where they've taken a really old site from maybe many many thousands of years ago right and put something over that like sort of like the analyst build on top yeah with the Parthenon and the Acropolis right they built it over the Acropolis right we're an old thing yes that they don't even know where the fuck you came from yeah what where that old thing where it's from so the idea is that this old thing in Egypt in particular is a product of an old civilization from many many many a thousands years ago last so long ago that the the distance in the gap between the people who built the pyramids and the people who originally built the Sphinx is far greater that are greater than the hour distance between us and the people built the pyramids oh really yeah yeah that's amazing this is how fucking crazy it is it's so the thing about this Cleopatra is she's closer to the creation of the iPhone then she is to the creation of the pyramids that's the real deal that means I really yes that's established Egyptologist geologist this is not controversy yeah yeah yeah this is just a fact she then they click but they think that at 2500 BC that represents only the new construction in Egypt and that before that if you go to 10,000 BC and before there was a whole nother civilization there geez that's amazing yeah it's amazing and that this is when 10,000 plus years ago this is when these cataclysmic events happen and all these people died off and much of what they knew back then was lost right and they rebuilt what's so scary about that is that it sounds like it could happen any day Oh something had happened with the Sun and all of a sudden we're dealing with some other big solar flare comes at us and we're in trouble what did it say Janet there's an article in Business Insider about coronal mass ejections Oh like Hisle Ronal mean go back to that this is a different thing now coronal sounds like a ball what did you just have high-speed solar winds increased lightning strikes on earth yeah but what was that last one though coronal mass ejection was it do you have to subscribe or something was I had it up for five minutes a night it was all red but I was saying that like they could let me go back to it what do you mean what's it doing it's not it's acting wait I gotta find it it's King Tut this is what happened with Indiana Jones then he can't go back why is it there yeah we're shockingly unprepared for an extreme Oh Oh looks like you're using an ad blocker just dissemble the a blogger Business Insider's and here goes we're shockingly unprepared for an extreme weather event that could fry Earth's power grid now that's something that What did he say it happened what year did he say that it I don't want that to happen eventually having we're like transformers blew up all these different where they would do the Morse code and shit yeah yeah the ball that shit and exploded because of this coronal mass ejection or a gigantic solar flare and this is a documented one and they're saying if this documented one is Karen ting of that happened today yeah we'd be fucked all the electric would puke yeah we wouldn't have to go on Twitter anymore yeah that would be amazing yeah but you also wouldn't be able to go to the grocery store ooh and your Tesla wouldn't work eh but I would get my compound bow and go home really that's so crazy that we've what's crazy is that you were these civilizations were able to build up and they get knocked all the way back and then build up a similar way right if if you're talking about the Egypt one yeah right they came back kind of in a similar way if the pyramids and the Sphinx are that far apart yeah that there was something in the DNA and in the brain space it was that evolved they tried to come back the same way what are they interest if not the same way in in a similar way yeah I mean some of the people survived right and some of the people that survived must have had some knowledge of the construction they pass it down from generation to generation but you know you're dealing with thousands and thousands of years where they weren't building things like that and then they figured the way to do it again yeah it's interesting how the fuck did they be so how did they become so smart that's what's interesting because the great pyramid X perhaps maybe just has superior genetics but it's also what they were showing in this video that I watched it in the imax thing yesterday was that the area was so unbelievably fertile that there was so much of an opportunity for them to grow food and there were so many animals there for them to hunt and RAM you know in the agriculture that they had a chance to sort of establish a civilization because it was such a rich area with natural resources established civilization and that civilization just kept advancing and moving forward and that it was all eventually weakened by civil turmoil that civil turmoil then the pharaohs lost their power and as the pharaohs lost their power then they were invaded and you know from across the sea yeah well no from inside of Africa over inside Africa yeah if you look at yeah the Nubians took over Egypt at one point in time well different you know different people in Africa were going over there and looking at all the shit they had and also the Library of Alexandria was burned by the Muslims was it a lush area like when I picture Egypt I picture like a desert no right mm-hmm is it no the Nile right I was a river right in the river like where the wetlands were filled with animals and they grew food there right and what they're thinking by this predating of the sphinx with dr. Robert Schoch with his proposal is that it was initially created back when it was rainforest and was unbelievably lush so incredibly fertile and then slowly as the climate shifted and that climate shift could have corresponded with that coronal mass ejection so it could have been something of a massive event that slowly or even rapidly shifted the climate I would like to go over and see it I always I'm a little scared to go there to raise me both buddy yeah that would be a cool I mean where what else would you want to see that's that profound she's walking when you watch the IMAX movie I can't recommend enough it's quick too if you yeah short attention span it's like 45 minutes right but when you watch them walk next to these enormous statues yeah I mean these fucking statues the Pharaohs are so big now you see these little tiny people walking by and you realize like oh my god look at this these people had done something unbelievable well yeah the this the pyramids and the Sphinx though there's so much easy there's so much why just they're exactly right exactly don't what did they figure it out yeah how did they what happened why are they the only ones at the time I mean it has to be connected to resources right because if you go today there's parts of the world where people are you know and some impoverished parts of Africa in particular where they don't have a lot of resources or people are fucked right they don't have any opportunity and they're in a terrible place and it's just a really shitty time to be alive you're not advancing at the same time you can go to like the Bay Area really some artisanal cheese shop right around your electric car and you know I mean ya know exacting that on earth yeah simultaneously yeah it's just purely what's available yeah yeah like and what mine's like how many Elon Musk's did they have in the Egyptian times right because it was just us you and I yeah we're kind of dumped right be honest yeah not that bright yeah we're not venting tunnels I mean just getting by yeah if we smoked a joint and started talking about who would make fucking tunnels and then your car goes in the tunnel and shoots really fuckin crazy bro fucking love that idea but nobody would take us seriously and nobody would let us dig and then we just fall asleep but yeah must have been a bunch of Elon Musk's back in the Egyptian well that's what's amazing is like there's this there's like this genius IQ we're like all the magic happens you know like where the Einstein's live worthy even yeah where those big leaps kind of happen and everybody else could be really smart but not to that level where you're actually shifting the world right you know and maybe that's what happened maybe there was just one genetic freak in the Egyptian world that was there because diet and stuff they were able to survive and soon it could have been a slow process too because you're dealing with thousands of years of prosperity - yeah over thousands of years they have many many many generations to think things through me right think about what's happened on this continent just over 200 years just 200 go back 200 years ago nothing's here yeah that's crazy it's crazy just 200 years ago yeah I got it so where are we gonna be like thousands of two thousand three thousand years ahead here who just here yeah especially if you let Ilan must make his tunnels everywhere there's gonna be so many tunnels it's get to the Grand Canyon in ten minutes little pod but that is what is this channel there was an 18 18 Novi nights later - Wow Wow that's nuts only a hundred years ago look how much they all look how much Spain owned New Spain Viceroyalty of New Spain is all Texas California Arizona Nevada yeah that looks like Montana Colorado she then look at the Oregon County Oregon country Wow shared with the United Kingdom North with United Kingdom nobody had vision country Michigan territory Missouri Territory Michigan was on both sides of the lake look at that is it so Michigan is on the left and the right of the lake PT u P Upper Peninsula oh but not the right side where it says Michigan territory that's not Michigan anymore that's Michigan the other side is Minneapolis for Detroit and all that stuff is in and there's the Upper Peninsula above Wisconsin right but they're not both Michigan right that's Minneapolis up there yeah yeah but where it says Michigan territory oh this Wisconsin right that's what I'm saying on my bed sorry I see it says it right there it says Michigan on both was just hit with a solar flare he just lost his money look at his disputed between Massachusetts in the colony of New Brunswick UK so that's Maine right because they have Massachusetts I was grabbing but Maine was like we're not sure what with what we might keep it we might not you realize how fucking far up their maintenance there's a lot of mosquitoes up there like me like Massachusetts when you look at like where Massachusetts is yeah you know and then you go above Massachusetts it means means big first place that gets Sun sunlight in the morning fucking giant man yeah huge right and where's New York New York right down there look at that right next to look at Mont on New York goes that's yeah so look at Massachusetts so Massachusetts was two places look it was Massachusetts and it was Maine right look at that so because there's two Massachusetts then just like there's two Michigan area I'm gonna keep all of it so this is 1818 I want all of it that Ted Kennedy it's my kennedy territory Georgia South Carolina so all those fucked up southern states are still there it's all filled with Native Americans we just came in and like let me have this I'm taking that well Texas I mean they were fighting off the Cheyenne you mean those ranchers they that was not established territory you there that's one of the reasons why Texans are so fuckin hard man they wait yeah they were at one point in time they were a republic before they were a state they were like this weird thing when they were kind of like not even a part of the United States oh really yeah just so wild that just happened yeah yeah we're talking thousands of years for your little Tutankhamun's yeah yeah little fuckin a little guy with his club play me a little bonehead yeah thousand that was thousands of years after King Tut people were taking wagons and going across the route just going yeah yeah how crazy is that think think about 3,000 years later people are still shooting bows and arrows at each other yeah 3,000 years later just completely wide open thousand yeah so why right so why weren't the Native Americans before we got here putting up those big statues well they lived a very different life yeah they lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer life right they have this incredible virtual connection to the land and to the animals that they hunted and they had a very very fastening there's a bunch of different of course Native American cultures but they had a very fascinating connection to their earth and to the animals and the worship that they had the the yeah means reverence they had for the animals and for life the trees it's just crazy when you think about how people were living in Europe at the same time yeah yeah exactly just completely a totally different thing yeah getting syphilis we're in powdered wigs banging their sisters yeah so when they showed up and had gunpowder and all the rest of the Native Americans didn't stand a chance what's crazy to me too is at how many people that were Westerners they joined Native American tribes and and we're living with them oh really yeah yeah it was common yeah it happened and no one no one moved the other way like no one went the Opera for Native American cultures decided hey I'm gonna move to the city no there's those are the saddest pictures of all time when you see those Native Americans put in suits and ties and hats and standing there everybody takes pictures ah hard shoes in a city Oh brutal it's so bad you know what must have been really interesting you know we're talking about your VW yeah it was from you know 20 years after the the war with the Nazis yeah what about those Wild Bill Wild West shows yeah they had those Wild West shows where they had men who had killed a bunch of colonists yeah and like there's a guy I think his name was Moll it was his giant Indian guy who's his fucking murderer who had killed a bunch of the settlers uh-huh and he was they would tour with him Wild Bill would tour with this guy and they would do on their their Wild West Show their shoot gun they didn't do like put on a show pretend to fight each other coming for people was like a recreation of what it what must have been like is when they you know captured territory from the Native Americans my god these do these wild west man that's how they made their living it became a big things like the movies see if you pull up the wild West shows from the 1800s fascinating time is that crazy because it's just just after this had all happened that was how you're telling stories nobody knew about it you'd get your little weird newspaper to read a little story no one really knew what was going on ajan how little you knew what was going you knew nothing yeah Town Crier would come in here here main game up the top of it it's now Massachusetts no one knew anything back nothing that Pawnee bill shows the only genuine Wild West touring America this season over 1000 people and horses employed Wow every equestrian nation in the world represented Wow two performances daily weird and startling free street parade look at that name calamity jane i love this this is just a show business guy i wonder if there was a comedian in it Wild West shows man and this was like early 1900's late 1800s yeah when was it it says 1902 1903 1904 young a few years after the you know they were still going a war with the Native Americans is that a picture right over the hand crazy yeah there's another one they had a reenactment they do like Custer's last stand and train robberies and imagine to see that like 1901 New York you had no movies yeah nothing yeah this was your movie oh my god it must been amazing and you still like I had to try to make sense of it all what happened yeah how do we get here especially like you said having the real guy there who you know could at one point just turn on everybody and start killing people in the audience yeah yeah there was one guy who try and see if you could find that Native American Wild West shows I think his name was mall mall I think that was his name still gonna remember his name look at Buffalo Bill look at the Hat just the showman and Sitting Bull he was a movie star hanging out together geez Jesus Christ look I'm sorry we took all your lamb but listen just hear me out I've got an idea we put some makeup on each other and we go out we do these shows listen we got whiskey a lot of white with white women while working we tour around we make money we charge these dopes we do two shows a day and we're out do you think women wear like these guys that see I'm fuck oh my god look at them look at they probably scalp people yes The Avengers Custer by killing and scalping yellow hair also called yellow hand which he called the first scalp for Custer James jeez yeah big ass show but here's the thing man that just happened all this just happened we're talking about 1900 I'm a hundred and eighteen years ago it's almost a human lifespan yeah like this is this this convergence of human beings was so recent killed these more probably like movies and radio yeah people like a for sure probably looks like a movie production like when you see Plus that's probably shot each other a bunch I'm sure there was some venereal disease involved yeah didn't they they had guns they were actually shooting guns uh they had like competitions and shoot shoot off there's less than three to four hours show well that's why the Western was such a popular movie for decades because it was so fresh in people's minds I mean you had you had grandparents that you know right new this time right right we think about the 1950s Western yeah a hundred years after the fact yeah right that's like us watching something about something that happened during the Depression yeah like like Once Upon a Time in America or something like that yeah yeah yeah right choo choo that is the coolest but it's what's so funny about it's just show business it's it's like the beginning of show business you only figured posters I mean all of it how much of it has really changed you know you put on a big show you make a cool poster you get these people to come buy tickets 2.5 million tickets sold Wow Wow you know what's really fucked up dude there's no comedy back then oh stand up well that's what I was gonna ask Mark Twain when was Mark Twain running around cuz he was kind of like the first stand-up he would go do these shows and he writes about it like it's a stand-up before when was he housing around well they do use something probably the first yeah he was talking about things that didn't work for a laugh and yeah how Holbrooke storing as him he's over again well when did he live what was it was the the lifespan of tween so that's an interesting case you know in Mark Twain yeah they use the n-word all the time in in huckleberry oh yeah big time and they're removing that now they were moving it we're moving it who is they're editing it and removing it from the books the publishers yeah oh come on that's I mean you know you want to learn about a culture learn about at a time well one of the characters in Huckleberry Finn one of the main characters was nigger Jim yes his nose his friend yeah yeah they removed that the n-word really yeah that's not we accurately well that's sanitizing history and that's a mistake because you don't learn from that Jamie pull that up pulled up the censoring of Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn Mark Twain had to build a little writing room out in his out on his uh one so he could smoke a cigar is out there because his wife wouldn't let him smoke cigars yeah so he built himself a little shed just to go sit out there and smoke good for him I just want to see when his lifespan was old Twain yeah he was funny you ever read Twain yes he's very funny really lady reading um what does it say here Jamie place the word with the word slave whoa okay look at this a new effort to sanitize Huckleberry Finn comes from Alan Gribbin a professor of English at Auburn University at Montgomery Alabama who has produced a new edition of Twain's novel that replaces that word with slave peers in the book more than 200 times was a common racial epithet of Al Queda used by Twain as part of his characters vernacular speech and as a reflection of the mid 19th century social attitudes along the Mississippi River there is a so effort but that doesn't mean that it's been done there's a ride at Disneyland I want to say it's either Splash Mountain or I think it is Splash Mountain flash Mountain at Disneyland which was based on a really racist old cartoon that you can't get anymore called southern tales I think it's called southern yeah it's a the Himalayan thing no no that's that's the Matterhorn with the Brier yeah yeah Brier bear Brier Fox yeah Bryan Firefox Firefox yeah the that whole thing is like it's a southern ride and was singing ducks and we we went with a guide and the guy was explaining to us that this is all based on a really racist old thing you can only get like bootleg copies of now oh really yeah so this is super racist old car so they had like the tar baby and right the tar baby thing well what is it it's southern tales right is that what it's called just keep seeing briar fox listed a bunch of times Song of the South telling the song of the south I think that's the name of it right it's called song of the south I think that's it I think that's the name of it right now that I think about it yeah but it was a Spanish super racist yeah I believe it there's a lot of bad stuff back then what is it [Music] yeah this is zippity-doo-dah they sing this in the in the movie it's a pity dude is this race why is this racist well that's what they're asking is this racist song of the south well right now it's just a guy singing yeah I don't think this is the racist part I think the reason why you can get this online is because it's not the racist stuff uh-huh because this is just the guy singing mr. Bluebird on my shoulder yeah my oh my so song of the south the move see if you can find song of the south it's all yes what the clip that popped up when I go yeah yeah 81% liked it Tomatoes 7.3 on IMDB so it's on IMDB 1946 Wow maybe it wasn't mark twain died in 1910 so that means that he was walking around as an old dude doing these performances you know late 1800s yeah and so maybe that was the kind of the beginning of stand-up comedy go back to that go back to that page you were just on and that Snopes article on it where'd they do a fact check on the song of the south you see it up there yeah was I was gonna was this a double I was gonna double check it before I wanted to see what this says it's true was it say that oh a song of the south and n-double-a-cp is song the south unavailable on video in America because of the NWA CP threats status true Wow yeah so was that racist wonder what it was there was so much racist shit back then try your rabbit sorry Brer Fox Brer bear library what does that mean a breyer like stuck in a briar but they are - er we can say it yeah Brer Rabbit Brer Fox it's Brer bear so that was the idea that they're stuck in briars the minstrel tradition of Uncle Remus stories the major objections to the song of the South had to do with the live-action portions film being criticized both for making slavery appear pleasant and pretending slavery didn't exist even though the film that's that kind of you're caught in between language sapphic potential you just said even though the film like Harris original collection of stories is set after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery still is folklorist Patricia writes mm yeah that's fascinating so that's kind of interesting especially you talk about the when you talk about the Huckleberry Finn part like they're saying okay take that out yeah and then then this one they're saying they had an objection to making it seem like slavery didn't exist right that's why you can't take it out of Huckleberry Finn because you need to know that this existed we need to deal with it yeah understand it rather than sanitize it the problem is defending it right like you can't do it you really it's almost impossible to defend that the use of that word like if you wanted to defend the use of that word you say well we want to put that word back in a book people like what do you racist right but you can't you know you that this you talk of rationally this is history yeah right exactly rational right there's no rationality when it comes to dangerous forbidden words right as you saw from the kendrick lamar concert right I mean that's yeah wonder what Twain would say do you think that ultimately like this is all gonna sort itself out like this all this political correct craziness and this kind of shit that this is just a little rough patch of chaos that we get through on our way to establishing a new way of communicating with people a new way of appreciating each other and then you know all this even the anti-white racism and anti male sexism and all the stuff it's just a you know the wave going this way and then it'll go that way and then it'll settle in the middle of yes and then we're learning from even these missteps like why can't we hate all men or you know anything like that that we learn from these missteps and the outrage that goes these missteps and we say oh I understand why this woman feels this way she's probably abused by men and dealt with asshole men and asshole bosses and I see these people like Harvey Weinstein in the mainstream media that have abused and violated and victimized women yeah and that it it's gonna balance itself out and the only way it goes is you have to have outraged and then correction and yeah I mean that's the way history seems to go it seems like you know there's you would think in certain ways like oh we don't have to work that hard to abolish these evils but then evil pops up again and feels like okay no it's still here we still have to deal with it yeah and you just hope at the end we all end up like Bruno Mars we all look like Bruno Mars and everybody's happy because no one knows who what anybody is yeah just having a good time and we're all a little darker and not totally white not totally black and everybody's but wait I mean what about white people I like looking at white people I like some white people I like I like the whole I like the fact that we have variety in the way people look like some people look like seal and and and some people look like there's like a super white lady like oh you cool kid binnacle Kinmen a bitch is why Jessica Chastain yeah white so what you're almost red yeah yeah it is good to have a nice mix yes do you think it's fascinating we're still these very tribal you know we talk about that all these thousands of years and what we've done and where we've come they're seal still like this this just instinctual tribal element to a lot of humanity you gotta have a dick like an axe handle to wear your shirt like that look at that shirt like his shirt all the way but with gold chains hanging out with a white coat ya know you're packing and he's got sunglasses on a night which so is a bold move that really only black people can pull off yeah exactly just owning it look at them slang and dick and singing song you don't hear about him anymore man well you never

I got these two speakers and like there's all these like layers and piano tuning keys yeah there's all this stuff that comes out of you know when you're sitting in front of like good speakers yeah you hear all the layers to the music and I'd be like wow it's like hearing and knew all over again I was so like hearing it new yeah he was I mean I guess he still is he's still alive but he's all fucking down yeah a real artist and so different than like try naming someone who sounds like seal yeah I can't the Black Keys no no no he's a fucking original man yeah supervised for essent I don't know is he's got a very unique style yeah there's a lot of those what's unique about there are a lot of artists that have this really crazy kind of unique style they don't become accepted from the mainstream by the Maine so yeah right like there's you listen to KCRW in the morning and there's like a lot of weird experimental stuff but not that many people know they exist seal was able to make that like a so you're one of those hipsters who listens to that channel you and Henry Wallens w in the morning morning's I listen to radio in a decade for real yep where do you get your new music I don't come on

girls son of a bitch came along fucked everything up when you're saying I liked hip-hop and stuff and I still do but it's a very you know old white guy waves doing find it when I find it I know it must be over like why that I found Kendrick I was like oh so this is a done right once you find it it's over yeah I don't think that's enough to kill Kendrick Lamar's momentum now you know he's got too much momentum yeah but it was like okay what I mean if it got to me you know and I tried like I try to listen to music but you know it's different when you're young and it just hits you and you're

nothing about it comes on two weeks does it really Tanja is producing nas's nabob well I'm not saying that doesn't prove as good music I'm just saying this sneaker killer Mike I like killer Mike there you go yeah I like a lot of stuff but you know it's a big it's a big range if you listen to bluegrass and hip-hop it means you're just kind of tasting it all I feel like music is a lot like movies in that people are constantly making new stuff and you can't see it all or listen yeah it's true I mean think about movies they have been making movies since whatever the fuck they started making movies yeah and every week they come out with new movies you're right no one ever says hey folks you know we just realize if we keep making movies you're never gonna watch The Godfather yeah I'm gonna watch taxi driver you're never gonna watch the classics I'm gonna stop making movies for a while I'll let you fuckers catch up ten years off now my whole startup and again ten years you know just cranking them out it's going even more because now you can just make them on your phone like the technology to be able to make a movie so you can just do it dude I mean the phones that we have now our dog shit compared the phones will have in ten years yeah Soderberg just shot a whole horror movie on his iPhone did it really yeah what is it it's called unsane whoa yeah yes girls it's trapped in a mental institution isn't there a horror movie that's out right now called hereditary what is that about is that a good one really good play the trailer I love trailers sometimes the trailers the most enjoyable part of the movie sometimes I have to give you too much though oh yeah they do that with comedies man they give you too many goddamn punchlines give me some volume crank it we get in trouble for this I don't will you pulled from you turret trailer we're helping them yeah I mean if you're long as you guys are like talking we're promoting them we can maybe stop at 39 give me some books Gary it starts with a dollhouse that is a scary design for an architectural here a model good mask man walks in it as you soon that was cool it made it look like a real room slums underground it's not the production company's under strange noona faces here today I know my mom would be very touched and probably a little suspicious Gabriel burns in it my mother was a very secretive and private woman from the producer of the wizard show which which I didn't say it was good though oh and what's her name baby she was once we made it differently shortcut no she was a very difficult woman what sometimes I swear I can feel the bitch is crazy got a kid with mental problems look at what demons you she looks good private friends the generations The Exorcist take care of me you don't think I'm gonna take care but when you died she's coming up grips you with real heart wasn't an unspeakable kind this looks good at the end Wow I'm honored dad it's like some guys to piece this does a very scary I just don't want to put any more stress on my family that looks good that looks scary I can't see it why can't you see cuz I can't see anything when do you see things I'm talking about we just said looking about do you ever watch stuff yeah go to the movies you do yeah when do you do that whenever I can from your writing books and bacon bread take a couple hours off go to the goddamn movies writing is killing me I really haven't my father said let's hear the other day watch it on the watch this movie on the plane like I haven't watched a movie on a plane in two years what was the movie that Eddie Bravo said he saw for like six minutes and then he left was a big blockbuster movie oh yeah was it Black Panther no no it was the Avengers oh the UH that new one the wasn't Deadpool because that I think it might have been the Avengers or something that New Avengers one that everyone loves but does it make sense they could have walked out of that so quick remember what it was love this makes sense period when you go to the movies how often you go to the movies once a month month month yeah maybe once yeah I watched some on flights you know when they come out I really get too much of a chance you know what I really enjoyed that Tom Cruise movie about Barry seal made in America oh yeah yeah I was pretty it was good yeah I was pretty surprised by that that's a good goddamn movie you forget how good Tom Cruise's - he's he's great yeah I mean all of the crazy talk show stuff aside that guy is amazing well he's a Scientologist yeah stuff but he makes good movies but people who are out of their mind make good shit yes as that's part of the thing yes part of the being good at stuff he's some of the crazy assholes yeah good shit they really do a lot of times if you can harness it word if you can harness it and put it into into something it's good moving man yeah all right off mission impossible ah yeah come on Cruz yeah comes out in a couple weeks I'm just gonna live that's what I hear go crews go gets to the end and he lives does all his own stunts shit he's gonna drive that thing he just he just does that yeah he does a lot of stunts crazy news anything he's 53 or 54 and he's still doing all his own stunts yeah it's pretty badass yeah he was in a was that Jack Reacher movie though that was a turd ran another one was I don't know I think it might have been John wick gonna be doing a third one of course they're doing right on wick yeah killed I repeat he was in was an awesome movie I think then change the name of but I don't think that's what it was originally called but no he has to keep redoing the scene he goes back and they ends up like don't everyone say yeah movie The Day After Tomorrow oh right wasn't that we used to be called killed I repeat edge of tomorrow edge of tomorrow that's right that movie was fucking badass that was a really good science fiction movie but it was one of the ones that came out what year did it come out jun 14 2014 1 2001 Durst and this I understand this yeah yes Scientology is highly critical of psychiatric meditation yeah they prefer you stay crazy you don't know what you're you know Matt have you done the research I've done the research yeah you're glib Matt you're glib but Lauer didn't handle it that good either you're supposed to go we'll explain to me the mechanism of the day what's happening with these psychiatric drugs and what do you pose yeah and why do you think that you understand the biological makeup of all these different human beings and that none of them should be taking psychiatric medication yeah that's a crazy thing to say that you're smarter than all these biologists and medical scientists and all these people that have concocted these SSRIs and different have you done the research have you done the research are you glibness we're making Top Gun - right - ever tell you the first time I did Letterman when Cruz was on it they ever tell you that story no I was doing my first letterman I'm super nervous and I'm just trying to tell myself you know just like any other show it's just like any other show right you know Tom Cruise it's his first time he's on the show in like 10 years 15 years and he's on and I'm watching through the monitor he's running up and down the he's running up and down the hall the theaters like saying hi to people at during the break no yeah he's like hey he's like running up and down and having this great time like it's just it's just another show it'll be okay and then they bring you downstairs and you're standing outside this door like to go onto the stage and he says good night during the show and he the door swings open and a very sweaty Tom Cruise is like nose to nose with me he's like you're next and he hugs me he's like whew it's great out there it goes bouncing up the stairs I'm like what's gonna happen to me up this is terrifying he totally took all of my coolness and just chew on a strange guy yeah but the energy just he was like Oh an electric eel and I'm just like it's all right I can get through this be such a strange strange guy yeah when he gets into that like I'm laughing thing it just gets weird [Applause] oh no wasn't such a high-altitude that it would have you know I'm standing in the wings right now what are you thinking like what am I gonna say first yeah do you think with those things how things are such a little weird sprint how's my tie how's my tie right what's my first line what am I gonna say try it casual yeah I guess there's a heated interview from Matt Lauer play that it's right there it's coming up now there it is here's Matt Matt had a full hair back oh yeah look at that he's got all that hair 2014 look at him handsome bastard the story breaks down on a lot of different levels and in one way it's to each other already yeah not the best father in the world when we were working on on the story originally three years ago Steve and I came up with this idea of making an amount of family it's okay that was a good movie okay I'd loved um yeah me too of course you do that real sense of like where we're gonna go yeah well that's what I think it would probably be like if we did get invaded to to be robots like that yeah that'll be cool here play some of that before I was a Scientologist I never agreed with psychiatry and then when I started studying the history of psychiatry I started realizing more and more why I didn't agree with psychiatry and as far as the Brooke Shields thing is look yeah I understand I really care about Brooke Shields wonderful and talented woman and I want to see her do well and I know that psychiatry is is a pseudoscience but um if she said that this particular thing helped her feel better what's the Mersey antidepressant or going to a counselor or a psychiatrist isn't that enough Matt you have to understand this here we are today where I talk out against drugs and psychiatric abuses of electric shocking people mm-hmm okay against their will of drugging children with them not knowing it's got good good effects of these drugs do you know what adderall is do you know Ritalin do you know now that ritalin is a street drug do you understand that the difference is that a male though madam as well answer your question man I'm asking a question I understand there's abuse of all of these now you see here's a problem you don't know the history of psychiatry I do aren't there examples and might not book shield to be an example of someone who benefited from one of those drugs all it does is mask the problem Matt and if you understand the history of it it masks the problem that's what it does he is pretty aggressive Tom Lauer yeah Mikiko not getting Tamera wasn't being shitty he's just a pink bow meanwhile he's right about a lot of it he's definitely right about adderall and Ritalin that so he had abused it but abuse just because someone abuses it doesn't mean it doesn't have uses you know it doesn't I don't I've met people that are on adderall and they say they need it I don't know if they're right yeah but the guy who developed adderall says that it should be for about 4% of the population that's a lot like got four people out of a hundred and their room for 100 people four of them cranked out and doctors are cranking it out like 30% like the patient's they see yeah it's like super high the guy who made it said it's being abused well I'm sure it is and amongst journal if you've done the research Joe have you done the research well I know I understand about I understand it I understand psychiatry but he's right about little kids and ritalin and I had a neighbor they drugged their kid at the fuckin Ritalin it was weird cousin wrong with the kid he just had energy and the parents were working all the time they just didn't want to deal with it I put the kid on Ritalin terrible they were bad parents that's terrible I was watching it happen I was like whoa and then they zone the kid out they got him on some shit and he was just like like a weird little zombie kid after that oh my god that's terrible could have been an artist could have been someone great right that's the takes away from him you put a kid in the classroom and you make them listen to boring shit all day yeah I don't want to do it you think well there's something wrong with this child Yeah right no that's kind of actually a freethinker he's actually gonna do some kind of ritual yeah he's got energy let him figure it out do something great he's bouncing off the walls yeah let him go outside yeah because he's not turning into a robot like the rest of the class but that's what we need we need robots we need workers what we can do with the 3d printers we can totally with human skin around the outsides they're gonna ship the 3d printers to Mars and have them make all the stuff we need on Mars right there you don't have to ship it do you think in our lifetime someone's gonna fly to Mars and live there yes you're looking at him I've already told my family I might not come back but I'm gonna be a pioneer come back if you go there you're not coming back I know I'll die on Mars pretty cool no you won't be able to do sets up there mm-hmm yeah well because by then commies gonna be all hologram so you'll be able to like beam you into a room yeah it'll be me at the Comedy Store doing a late-night set but Mars is that good enough no I you don't for us yeah we won't feel analog you won't feel it it's an analog experience yeah there's no energy transfer mm-hmm yet think some day yeah they're gonna harness your energy it'll be that good yeah I think you'll be able to bang people weren't there yeah I'm gonna make them with my 3d printer with human cells and then bang them we're setting up this is why I made you well that's that's an interesting question right there's people that are there considering the ethical implications of making a headless person that you would harvest your organs for like say right if Tom Papa decides I'm gonna make a headless Tom Papa right and I'm just gonna drink like a fish and scoop the fuckin liver out of this asshole and stick it into my body yeah I was pretty cool it's great yeah if your grandpa needs a liver and you want to keep grandpa live harness all those parts yeah but what are the what's the ethical considerations someone just told me that there's if you need a part if you need an organ or something you go to the states that have no helmet laws how crazy is that I was just in Chicago Chicago doesn't have helmet laws oh really dude watch these people run the highway but you know what does the elimin home and then in Chicago they don't have helmet laws but they can't split lanes right and when I went home and these fucking guys are just driving right next to cars and whizzing them between lanes and I'm like what's more dangerous is splitting lanes more dangerous or is it riding around with no helmet I don't know scary though both of them have you ever read in a motorcycle yeah for years like 15 years yeah look at you so my kids were born yeah I went around the whole country on my bike feeling my wife and I on the back for five weeks I think so like we did must have it's one of my big story I do miss it I mean like I see bike I've been looking at more would you a motive would he had like say if you had a summer house like in Big Bear something like that there at Maine nobody up there just drive around get a nice bike up there that I was like that a slow I would do that I got to get a house freedom I love it you're so focused cuz you don't want to die it's one of those things that you're just so focused on you forget about the whole rest of the world locked in so nice does sound good I know I've been looking at bikes lately please see people that get fucked up by bikes it's not good now especially here I know you don't listen to the radio but if you do out here you hear about radio motorcycle accidents like every day you know who's really yeah like oh there's traffic on the 5 there was a motorcycle accident it's like wash it I know because it's music that's what you let's do well on the radio well they break in once in a while and say there's an accident or something if I'm not listening to Sirius XM or bass or you listen to Sirius mm-hmm what do you listen to sometimes they listen to comedians sometimes I listen to the news and I have a Sinatra station a coal train station mm-hmm yeah music you know I'm a hip dad yeah yeah do you think your kids think you're hip dad no no humiliate just how it's always gonna be which is cool they like that they like knowing that the dork is there and he loves them yeah that's the whole key yeah but don't you love making your kids laugh oh yeah oh it's the best fun a lot of dads can't make their kids laugh really yes they can make him laugh in a goofy way but when you can let make them laugh in a way that you know is really funny right that's like you know my young stand-up funny my youngest is fucking funny yeah she's really into it too she's really into saying funny shapes got good timing it's good it's funny my little ones the same way yeah well they realize that's how they get attention yeah you know they're wise asses yeah you say something they say something funny everybody laughs and you're like whoa that felt good yeah get some a little charge and what's funny - is that probably the same thing that she has that mine has is they they're not doing it for you they're doing it purely for them to mock you yeah they victimize you yeah you're all mock you what's it like being old and mock you they love to mock the fact that I'm bald yeah I know they mock that I can't see watch me use a cell phone and not be able to navigate just dad just give it to me oh they know how to use electronics in a weird way oh wait to it like they know how to edit videos and show life I'm like how do you know how to do that like I mean they don't even have a phone completely they like use my wife's phone and they're making videos make how the fuck did you know how to do that there's a little video editor programs and shit cuz I have a young brain I can learn things very quickly very quick my eyesight is killer I can learn things quickly the eyesight killer is a big deal but I think it's oh the brain is so plastic yeah the the mental plasticity is just yes they figured out oh yeah you swipe right oh you do that then you highlight that and spread this and touch that and you edit you don't want that you want to filter so you go down the bottom I always my kids were with my wife at a party the relatives when I got home yesterday they weren't there and I face time with my daughter since well how's mom she went and she was bored at the party she's like how's mom I said has my doing at the party she's she's doing okay she's inside she's her to repeat a couple stories a couple times but she seems to be having fun and one day they'll be us yeah it's great I'll be their version of us yeah raising their own kid going what the fuck I've got kids now and you'll be like we're this new baby that they made kids cute here take them going fishing let me have a little kiss let me get some sugar from that baby cheek now I'm out bye good luck changing the diapers yeah can I babysit Friday no yeah oh that's for you I'm working do you think you'll be working to the bitter end to the end yeah there's no part when I hear people say that they're gonna retire like anybody just in the world say I hear retirement right I know that's one thing I'm not doing right why why would you retire and when I make stuff until I go I want to put out stuff and see what that stuff will be later on who knows well it's also you've chosen a path that it's just perfect for you yes you you actually you're not working because you have to go to work you're working because you enjoy what you do right it's just really what I encourage everyone to try to attempt to do this this this thing that we're taught in school to try to find a good job that pays well that's wonderful advice but it's not the best advice the best advice is try to find the thing that you love to do yeah because if you can do that then you never have that feeling that most people have when it comes to work most people have that feeling like oh I've got to go to work right you never have that never but that's it's also I think there's some luck involved in that for sure you know there's also decisions yeah you make if you don't have that luck to try to make that luck happen yeah you know and then there's also talent there's also like some people want to be a comedian and they really would never will be yeah just can't I think being self-aware of what you really really want to do as the person mm-hmm not thinking of it even in terms of work just but being looking at yourself enough to know what you're good at and what you enjoy right and then follow that path whether it makes a business sense or not that's the best thing you can do yeah you don't know where it's gonna leave it at least you're heading in the direction where it's stuff you like and it's stuff you know you have an aptitude for so wherever you end up in that area will be pretty close to happiness you know words of wisdom from Tom Papa author of your dad stole my rake available now is it an audio version there's an audio version - would you use your voice nine hours nine hours and everything god you did though some but I read a lot of books on tape or I have a lot of books written read to me yeah the real problem is when you know that it's not the author and you hear someone have some sort of bullshit half-ass connection to the words they're saying now I know I'm good that's why it was hard to do actually because it's 9 hours of reading me got a read a whole book but also I have to be me behind it I gotta you know they don't want me doing a phone inversion how many hours of the time did you broke it into two it's like four and a half each day that's it's hard it's hard to do stay on point for that long it was a thing like when you get out of there but also you know when you go in those booths like even in this show like times different here yeah it's different here than three hours somewhere else three hours is oh we did three hours see see there you go crazy exactly it's different you there's something going on with the timing you're engaged mm it's not like three hours out in the world yeah yeah well time warp yeah it's a total time work yeah it's uh whenever whenever I say I'm doing the show is the people who there's like three hours like that's not a thing it's no you're just doing it with you and I you're just doing the show believe me it's a thing with some people some people you just squeezing blood out of the walk know I could do this for four hours easy easy easy you're beautiful man you too man I'm sure your books hilarious although I haven't read it it's a great Father's Day gift for you right I'm going to you thank you cuz you don't get gifts from your family gentlemen we did it [Music]
