and we're live how are you sir how are you good to see you again I'm thrilled to be here thanks for doing this man thanks for having I know I should tell people before we get started I did not know when I asked you to come back on that you were heavily involved in this whole vaccine debate what I wanted to have you on to talk about is tropical diseases because I remember when we did that sci-fi show you explained to me that some ungodly percentage of people that live in tropical climates are infected by parasites that's right well my day job is developing vaccines for tropical diseases we developed the vaccines no one else will make because they're for the world's poorest people so we call them tropical diseases but there really are diseases of poverty the vaccine issue the the advocacy issue around vaccines and autism is kind of a new thing that I got drawn into just because I'm a parent of an adult daughter with autism and I make vaccines so it was a natural that I'd get drawn into it yeah so when I said that you're gonna come on then I got inundated by people that are you know the vaccine thing is such a polarizing issue yeah that's awful and so many people seem to think they absolutely know what causes what especially when it comes to something like autism which is it's a huge issue in this country it's a huge issue around the world and it doesn't didn't used to seem to be the question is was that because it was undiagnosed was that because it just there's it's more prevalent today what do you think what is your take on well I don't think we really know one thing's for sure we're diagnosing people with autism who we diagnosed with as something else in the past you know whether it was you know really horrible diagnosis we'd use pejorative terms like mental retardation what's the matter Jamie just tell you the clock is off oh okay sorry sorry should we start again no no it's okay he was just saying he was just telling me that our clock is screwed up because the daylight savings time right sorry I'm totally unrelated towards the whole countries raucous critical yeah yeah so so we don't know we don't well you know what one thing is clear that the number of diagnoses is going up but part of that is because what we used to call pejorative things like mental retardation now get thrown into the autism category the other thing that you absolutely know so well you know now we call it as part of the autism spectrum we also because autism often has a lot of Associated intellectual disabilities not always but sometimes the other is that I posit is that based on aptitude tests like how do you how do they decide what sought is yes they they have a list of diagnostic categories but it's not pretty sir it's not like you could test someone if they test positive for a disease that's right that's right well as although it you know one of the interesting side pieces to this is you know the there's a group of people out there who self-identified themselves as the autistics and they get very resentful or hurt when they're called a disease or disorder they in because they say well we're not in epidemic we're we're a person and they that it's part of this whole neuro diversity movement which is quite interesting neuro diversity movement right they say they're neuro-diverse that they you know maybe think differently from others and they respond differently than others but they're not quote abnormal and and I think they have a good argument hmm I heard a crazy argument once when someone that so the point is that it's you know the the impairment like Rachel my daughter it's not so much for autism that thoughts her you know ability to have partners or to have a meaningful career it's the fact that she has profound in her case profound intellectual disability that goes along with it so when when they say that people have there's a spectrum right and some people who are autistic have incredible abilities that's right they have incredible mathematical abilities musical abilities language abilities and then some people do not some people have wood issues yeah but the Rachel's case my daughter it's she has a pretty good verbal IQ eighty ninety which is a very low performance IQ in 40 she can't do simple math she can't count money fortunately Goodwill Industries came to her rescue in our rescue and now she works there two hours a day sorting clothes and and that's been really meaningful for her to get a paycheck oh that's great even it was minimum wage yeah right just to do something you know right that doesn't feel part of the mix yeah that's huge that's huge for everyone r absolutely yeah absolutely but so there's no there's it's not like you could test positive for syphilis or you can test positive for the flu right although now you know as I say you know so that's why I don't like using those those terms because it it puts people on the autism spectrum as though they have a disease right or which I don't like to do but if it is a disorder well you know now we know there are 99 genes that are linked to autism but why is it a bad thing to say that you have a disorder if it's just a disorder people have disorders well a fact well you know a lot of the individuals in that that self-identify themselves autistics don't like to think of themselves as a disorder they like to think of themselves as different it's different but not necessarily as a disorder right but that doesn't help us when we're trying to discuss it does it yeah it gets very it it's it's hard gets hard to talk about well also they're trying to stop you from talking about it in a certain fashion which is actually accurate right you know when they have an issue there is an issue to say there's no issue is kind of ridiculous it's I mean there's a reason why so many people are so concerned about autism and vaccines and just autism in general whether it's an environmental pollution factor as well what they like to do is they like to make the distinction between autism that neurodiversity thing and actually having intellectual disabilities that go along with it okay maybe it's a bit of semantics also but they feel strongly about it right now if we don't know what causes autism what we do we do well we're getting there very closely so we've now there was a very important paper produced written by a group at the Broad Institute at Harvard MIT which was one of the premier genetics genomics organizations in the country and they've now identified 99 genes it's a it's a huge team of scientists not only at the Broad including psi does a bailar College of Medicine 99 genes involved in autism all involved in early fetal development early brain development in the first and second trimester of pregnancy so now we're starting to really get our arms around what autism is and that's one of the things I talk about in the book I mean we we have learned so much in the last couple of years about autism how it begins early fetal development well before kids ever see vaccines and that's one of the reasons I say vaccines did not cause Rachel's autism vaccines don't cause autism because autism was already underway in early early brain development is it possible that some people have this tendency towards autism and it's exacerbated by vaccines I don't think so um I think what what happens is the sequence of events happens during pregnancy but the full clinical expression of autism often doesn't happen until 18 or 19 months of age like Rachel for instance wasn't actually diagnosed until 19 months of age and there's some fabulous studies now showing that that clinical expression of autism actually coincides with a big increase in the expanding of the brain you can actually show on cereal magnetic magnetic resonance imaging cereal MRI how the brain starts to the brain volume starts to increase and that's very important because parents will often remember oh my kid got vaccinated on 18 months of age or 15 months of age you want to link the two but now you can go back to 6 months of age and as a studies done at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill showing so that you could do an MRI at 6 months of age and they can predict now with they say with 90% accuracy which of the kids will go on to develop autism and then you could take it what do they sing what what are they saying they can see star I have you have to go we can go into detail in the paper but they can see certain things on signatures on MRI that tell them that this kid is going to to develop okay so in fact there is a way to test positive for autism done with this serial MRI that's what they think right that's me and now we have the 99 gene so we can even take it back further by doing what's called whole exome sequencing sequencing all the DNA all the expressed DNA of an individual in Rachel's case we did that and we actually found a mutation in a gene controlling neuronal connections which makes a lot of sense if you think autism yeah of course so so there is a way to show whether children will be more likely to develop autism and there's there is a way to look at their brain through fMRI at a very early age and and also do the muscle do genetic sequence so it's not simply a matter of how they perform on cognitive tests that's right that's right we're getting much better at getting arms around the diagnosis why do you think there's so many people that have these anecdotal stories of their child getting vaccinated especially large doses of vaccines when they hit them off like ten in a row and then all of a sudden or meters measles mumps and rubella is the one that gets repeated over and over again that's the one that made my child have autism I've heard that so many times and I've heard it from friends from friends that have children that have autism they had a child their child got the measles mumps rubella shot and then immediately there was a very distinct change in the child's behavior well no question when you get the measles mumps rubella vaccine many times kids cry and things like that and then autism will then begin sometime between the first and second year of life so it's logical to want to connect the two but now we know it's not even plausible because we know that if you go back to that MRI at 6 months of age or go back prenatally we can even determine which kids are going to go out to develop autism so even though this and that complementing it complementing it our massive epidemiologic studies done on over 1 million kids that in fact a new paper was just released this week showing that kids who get the EMR get the MMR vaccine are no more likely to get autism than kids who don't who don't get the MMR vaccine and the conduct converse is also true kids on the autism spectrum are no more of likely to have gotten the Emma vaccine the kids not on the autism spectrum okay so so it's the combination of that those big studies of over 1 million kids together with knowing what autism is that completely rules out the possibility right so these genes excuse me the end the issue with these genes and then the ability to scan the brain with the serial MRI and so you can tell which children have the propensity is it possible that children have all these issues and then do not get autism or do 100 percent of those children with those issues get autism that's a good question I don't know I'm a vaccine scientist so I'm you know the not about the well well I'm a biologist problem of vaccine scientist who's really tried to do a deep dive on autism doing research on the book versus human development right right okay so so what you're saying though is that if a child does not have these mutations and does not have these issues that are present and during a serial MRI that they will not go on to develop autism is that true as far as we can't as far as we can tell so children without those issues who get vaccinated have have no problems which most children have no problems right yeah I mean the you know we've learned a lot about the the risk of vaccines and the numbers are extraordinary I mean the risk of a severe adverse event happening after getting a vaccine is roughly on the order of one in a million between between one and a million and one in ten million so and I found an Internet report wants as a delight likelihood of getting struck by lightning is 1 in 700,000 so it's you know the like having a severe event after a vaccine is your bet ads are better of getting struck by lightning then and when you say severe event what do you mean by severe event though oh well there's actually a table that's put out by the National Vaccine Compensation Act includes shoulder injury that's one encephalitis a shoulder injury yeah that's actually and from the actual injection you put getting injecting it in the wrong place oh so it goes into the joint or something like that yeah yeah is that common no no so there there have been issues where children have adverse effects and reactions to vaccines what do you attribute those to but one you know one in a million I think you know in some case biological variability I think in some cases in terton Lee if it's a live virus vaccine like the measles mumps rubella vaccine and you have an underlying immune deficiency that wasn't picked up before then that virus can replicate better but very rare things like that right so as far as you know children who are healthy who get a vaccine is it's not biologically possible for them to develop these traits these mutations in the genes and these issues that you see present as best we can tell right now that seems to be the case right as best you can tell right now is a it's a great thing to say right but for people that are like hmm on the outside like what does that mean I'm not a doctor I'm not smart enough to understand what doctor Hotez is saying right yeah what does he say well we can tell can we tell so here's what we can tell okay no studies and over 1 million children that there's no link between vaccines and autism that's number one and and so let me let me parse this I hope you've been to bits so there's there's the studies on a 1 million children showing that vaccines do not cause autism that's part one the second is that and then I'll do a deeper dive on each of them the second part shows not only is there massive evidence that there's no link between vaccines and autism there's no plausibility because we know so much about autism how it begins in pregnancy incorrectly so let's go back to the first part the first part is studies and over 1 million children one of the things that the anti vaccine Lobby does is they played this game on what I want - not really a game but what they quote what they do is play this kind of thing of vaccine whack-a-mole because at first they alleged it was the MMR vaccine and now came out out of the study that was published in The Lancet in 1998 then another group came along and said no no we didn't mean the MMR vaccine we meant the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccine and the scientific community not only dum AA dee bunked the MMR linked they debunked the thimerosal Ling then the anti vaccine lobby came along and said no no we didn't mean that we're spacing vaccines too close together then they changed to get round again saying now it's the Ala more aluminum in vaccines so and then each time the scientific community responds with massive epidemiologic study showed there's absolutely none of those things are true and do you think that it's just when you look at say if there's one in a million that has an issue with this and there's and that's not autism so whatever whatever those issues are that they hear these stories and these stories do accumulate because there's 300 plus million people in this country and over 10 20 years of 1 million you develop a significant history of cases where children did have issues with vaccines so these people hear about these stories and people are terrified obviously you're I have children you become very overprotective of your children you worry a lot right and then you also don't know like why do they get so many shots all in a row like that why does a baby get ten shots in a day that seems crazy well they don't get ten shots in a day most of the vaccines are now combined so for instance in one vaccine we can vaccinate against diphtheria pertussis tetanus polio Hamas influenza type B which is a terrible cause of of meningitis and in some cases not even hepatitis so one shot soup well it's combined and there's all sorts of studies showing that it's safe to combine them and it's fantastic now you can vaccinate with one shot against six diseases so and these are life threatening disease right so the only concern is the child's immune system when they're bombarded with this one do so a lot of times it causes the does it be tired or their gets sick the blindness the immune system is not bad right that's another kind of it's nice number that our misunderstanding that's put out by the anti-vaccine lobby remember the child's got the intestines and the respiratory tree is is this or are organs of antigen presentation a baby on average is exposed to hundreds of new antigens every day so the idea that you're gonna quote overwhelm the immune system with a vaccine against six diseases just doesn't make any sense mmm again this is all phony baloney stuff put out by the anti vaccine Lobby let's let's be clear the anti vaccine lobby owns the internet right now they've what does that mean what that means is they've got they've put out now by some estimates 500 anti vaccine websites so that every time you put the word vaccine into a search engine whether it's Yahoo or Google you're gonna get anti vaccine misinformation that's number one second we know now it's amplified on social media like Facebook other forms of social media so third you know look at the Amazon site I mean it's it's incredible so my book this book the good news is it's I think it's right now it's the highest-rated probe vaccine book on Amazon the bad news is overall its ranked about 20 because there's 19 other phony-baloney anti vaccine books so hey that's oh the Amazon is the biggest purveyor now of anti vaccine books and wait it gets even worse then you also have now they've become politicized they have political action committees in multiple states lobbying state legislators about fault with applying them with false information about what VAX vaccines do so and and the problem is we don't have a robust system of pro vaccine advocacy to counter it so we don't really hear as much as we need to from the federal government from the CDC from the Surgeon General so unfortunately in this country the defense of vaccines Falls to a handful of academics like myself and you know I'm an academic I wrote a book what chance do I stand this major media empire that why do you think that exists why do you think there is this major media empire that's against vaccines that's a great question what's the motive what's the motivation number one and number two where's the money coming from right right there's real money behind this millions of dollars behind this to put out phony documentaries and phony books what's a good phony documentary to point to well I'm a little reluctant to do it say it because they're sold it teaches and and you know I don't have the means to defend a lawsuit and the correct that's these documents which I usually don't name specific understand these documentaries what do you think their motivation is do you think they earn ously believe that vaccines do cause harm or vaccines do cuts I use me autism I don't know I mean is there some kind of other agenda that they have I mean we do know in some cases that the some elements of the anti vaccine Lobby are promoting phony autism therapies right they're doing terrible things like this thing called MMS which are bleach enemas what yeah bleach giving bleach Anna must Achatz you couldn't achieve the children bleach why bleach because they're cleansing the immune system cleansing them of toxin though it's really awful stuff and they're doing chelation therapy which is very dangerous what is that that's where they they claim you know kids are overdosed with toxic metals so they give a chemical that actually can chelate the metal but it can kill at your calcium and then put you into a fatal arrhythmia as well they're also who is doing this chelation therapy well you can Google okay it's or whatever so these doctors like in some cases there aren't doctors unfortunately or other health professionals and what does sure you study the evidence lady gets work there's no evidence and then and then they're doing hyperbaric therapy which is really bad so and some hyperbaric therapy is bad well for doesn't do anything for autism that's okay but it's it's good for recovering from injuries and yeah under certain selected sir but who knows what who knows what it's doing to a young kid right I mean so you shouldn't be doing that the then the other then that's one so how much of this is being driven by financial motivation peddling these phony autism there means I can't say my sense is that's not the big piece of this yeah there's also some reports not Russian BOTS and trolls that are amplifying this and sewing political instability in rhyme tree but again you add that all up the phony autism therapies the Russian Batson trolled in my mind that really doesn't get our arms around the big driver this thing so I think we really need some good investigative journalists to look into this well do you think that there's some sort of a concerted effort or do you think that's your but just a bunch of people that really believe that vaccines do cause autism they don't truly understand the science and they haven't talked to someone like you and maybe they have this idea that's cemented in their mind and they're not willing to look at it objectively and look at the full spectrum of possibilities and look at the science behind what you guys are saying because in their head they've been saying vaccines cause autism they've been saying it for so long that once someone gets that and they're connected to that it's very difficult for them to shift gears people have a really hard time not being married to an idea yeah no I agree that and you know when I talk and I spend a lot of time going around the country giving what are called Grand Rounds lectures to hospitals and medical schools pediatric Grand Rounds so I've had the chance to talk to a lot of pediatricians and nurses and nurse practitioner and even and more and more than a few parents my impression is most of the parents are who are called to be so-called vaccine hesitant as is the word of the day are not really deeply dug in I mean you can yeah you can have a conversation with them and explain to them like we're talking now in a very you know non-technical way you know the evidence showing vaccines don't cause autism and the lack of plausibility given that it that it begins in pregnancy and they'll vaccinate their kids there is another percentage and I don't know what the percentage is whether there's 10 15 percent that are deeply dug in and are wholly invested in this conspiracy theory that the that the government is in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies and blahdy blahdy yeah and then if you try to talk them out of it they just think you're part of the conspiracy so it's sort of a no-win approach there but but most parents you can have a good conversation with most parents yeah it's not necessarily even most parents right I mean what what you're dealing with is these people that maybe they're into a bunch of different alternate therapies a bunch of different kinds of cleansing and you know there's a lot of that nonsense that you find online where I mean look there's legitimate but I would I guess but I guess my point sorry that's okay please good no but I guess my point is parents don't get the chance because they're so inundated with phony anti vaccine information that I do a Google search yeah or whatever you know whatever search they do so what do you think should be done should there be a probe vaccine documentary that makes sense I think thanks for that question I think there's three things that need to be done I think first of all some of this anti vaccine media empire needs to be dismantled this mantis mantled and in that I can say whether they're wrong or right like shouldn't I mean it seems like there should be some sort of a debate right like if there's someone who's saying that there's some evidence of vaccines cause debates you're saying there's no evidence of vaccines cause debate no excuse me that vaccines cause autism and you're saying there's no evidence that vaccines cause autism there should be a debate where there's some sort of a like some sort of a monitored conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this down yeah but that that has that's a two-edged sword too because you know then it gives some false legitimacy to the anti vaccine side it's like debating the smoking caused cancer yeah but doesn't it isn't there already a problem I mean it seems like if there's this many if you do Google search and you're just overwhelmed right with anti value seems like the fight has already been lost if that's the case that's right so giving them legitimacy looks like it's not necessarily giving them a legitimacy it's giving them if you given you rather a forum to dismiss their legitimacy yeah I think you know part of it what has to be done is means and and this gets into all sorts of First Amendment issues and I'm not a lawyer but you know the the idea that Amazon now is putting out all of these phony books and phony documentaries well they're just a distributor right yeah they don't have to go over every book that they sell with a fine-toothed but maybe they should I mean I've mine tooth comb but maybe there should be some screening maybe Amazon maybe Facebook should all be hiring chief scientific officer x' to you know putting some stops on the dissemination of information because it's harming children right I mean I mean this is the reason I get passionate about it the reason I actually wrote the book is kind of interesting I it actually happened before all of these big measles outbreaks that we have been having yeah I mean I noticed that in Texas there was where I my laboratories at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine we noticed that there was a steep increase in the number of kids whose parents were opting them out of getting vaccinated to the point where in Texas we have over six almost 60,000 kids not getting their vaccines in the state of Texas and those are the ones we know about we don't know anything about the 325,000 homeschooled kids so we probably have over a hundred thousand kids not getting vaccinated all because of this misinformation campaign and I was really troubled by the fact that there was no response to it and that was drove me to write the book so the point is now Texas is very vulnerable to measles outbreaks and I say measles more than the others because that's the most highly contagious disease what's the danger of a child getting measles so is there any benefit to a child getting measles in terms of their immune system no there's no benefit and that's one of the phony books they put out yeah Melanie's marvelous measles I mean it's it's awful so what did they say in that book they say build your immune system it does not it does not it's remember after so let's go back a little bit smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970s through vaccinations one smallpox was eradicated gate radicand measles was arguably the single leading killer of children globally 2.6 million children died every year of measles because it causes measles pneumonia encephalitis talk about permanent neurologic injury that's a bad actor measles and then deafness at all and then through global vaccination campaigns we brought it down by the year 2002 about half a million kids dying and then the Gates Foundation put up seven hundred and fifty million dollars to create the GAVI Alliance the Global Alliance for vaccines and immunization we've brought it down now to a hundred thousand but now measles is coming back Europe's a disaster right now we've got 80,000 measles cases in 2018 in Europe and now it's coming back to the US and so my worry is this me the anti vaccine media empire isn't it started out as a fringe group but now it's really affecting public health allowing a deadly disease like measles to come back do you think if there's some sort of definitive evidence that shows to the general public like you could you could show it to them like this is what causes autism we've narrowed it down to these genes and it it has nothing to do with vaccines if you give these vaccines to people without these genes there is no way they're gonna get autism they get autism specifically because of these variations in their genes you just you just summarize the book right yeah but I mean that we need more than a book yeah it does disturb me when I hear about all these kids getting measles and and not just measles but means in some places polio is made a resurgence you know well polio you know we're down to about three three countries that still have transmission of wild-type polio it's Nigeria Pakistan Afghanistan so hopefully we're getting our arms around polio but measles has now come back roaring back with a vengeance it hasn't having people contracted polio outside of those areas I mean those are the areas where it's a problem every now and then some cases pop up we had some you know wherever it and this can get it on to a whole nother topic wherever there's collapse in health systems infrastructure yes is during from war political instability these diseases can come back they can come back and the people that are vulnerable the children that are not immunized that's right and when you're immunized you're not vulnerable that's right yeah this is it's a really confusing thing for people because on the outside they will people always want to think that big pharma but I've said some terrible things about big and the reason being is painkillers because painkillers and antidepressants and there's the SSRIs which are over prescribed and the painkiller one kills me because I have no people directly that have been addicted to these goddamn things and the doctors are passing them out like candy so people look at big farm as being oh these are the monsters that push this they're also the people that give you things that save people's lives yeah there's a lot going on there yeah I'm know I'm a little big defender of of the big pharmaceutical companies I mean one of the things that the empty backs the insults that anti-vaxxers hurl let me as they say I'm a shill for industry they say I'm secretly taking money from Merck and yaksa Smith glass all crap I'm we don't I don't take a penny from them and I and I and that's it's not even how do you say just but you from the University I get paid by the University and some of that some of my salaries offset by not grants from nonprofit foundations then this is because like the Nationals right and then they say I'm secretly making millions of dollars for our vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis and Chagas what you do with all that money because my wife says if only that were the case right these are diseases of the poorest of the poor elementra make up a penny on these disease so in fact you know one of the frustrations I have with the big pharmaceutical companies is we've gotten will have made a lot of progress of their vaccines we've gone all the way from discovery through early phase process development and manufacturing and IND filing with the FDA investigational new drug applications but we're getting kind of stuck at phase one phase two clinical trials because we don't have the big pharma money to take us all the way the licensure so I've had a lot of meetings with the big pharmaceutical companies to see if they can partner with us and so far that hasn't happened so has there ever been any discussion or any interest in creating some sort of a compelling documentary that's Pro vaccinations that can counter all these things because there's there's quite a few health-related documentaries that I know are horseshit because I've talked to actual real scientists and clinical researchers that say like all these things are saying it wrong and this is why they're wrong in this you could show this they're wrong and then when someone says hey I saw this document it says that all you should eat is toast you could say listen man you got to go here and watch this and it'll show you why that's nonsense right is there anything like that right now there's any discussion not right now there are some discussions but we're a long way off from that and the problem is the anti-vaccine documentaries are being distributed widely sold and and those people that are talking about it here's the other problem whenever I talk to someone about them as I've been doing this a lot lately or to talk to someone about something that passionate about I go what books you read on it it was like well I saw this documentary well very and there are books yeah in fact there's 99 bullshit in nineteen ahead of mine right books that are written by actual researchers people that have spent decades in labs understanding what's going on you don't really you know you don't get a lot of that from the people that are anti anything right well that's that's what I wrote the new book it's a very confusing thing for parents because you're scared you know you have this little tiny baby that you love more than anything in this world and then the doctors say hey we've got this round of vaccines coming and you're just terrified that you're gonna do something to your child's can you turn your child into someone who's compromised yeah and and the point is problem is these diseases are back now and so it the agency to vaccinate is now more than ever I mean remember right now look what's going on in Vancouver Washington right now where the measles outbreak is under way the ones who are at greatest risk are infants under the age of 12 months not yet old enough to get their vaccine so that if you're a parent right now living in Vancouver Washington you're terrified you're terrified about taking your baby out the Walmart ER because they can take that vaccine because they're never give you access right right so now the disease is coming back because the older kids are catching it and the and the anti vaccine lobby uses terms like personal liberties and medical freedom well where the personal liberties of this parent now who terrified the taker in when you say to her infant anti vaccine lobby now I know that Robert Kennedy jr. is he's a he's a big one he's a big one and he seems like a very intelligent guy how could he not be aware of the science behind this is he getting wrong what what he's getting wrong is just about everything you know he's formed an organization called children's health defense and and start he had a press conference about it I think it was September October of last year it is probably one of the best organized anti vaccine groups out there now he's doing other things other than vaccines he's doing a lot of things about environmental health and things like that I don't know any part of that business I've only followed what they what he does with vaccines but it's all it's all nonsense why is he doing this about vaccines don't know what's as well I mean you have to ask him what's his motive would he be a guy that you would want to have a debate with or have a discussion with but again I mean I I'm I'm uncomfortable with the idea of a debate because it's like it's like debating I don't know it's like debating a Holocaust denier or whether the Holocaust exists I mean not that this rises I understand what you're saying but if you're again I want to bring this up if you're complained there's 19 books ahead of yours that are anti vaccine books you've already lost the battle like it's time to regroup and maybe regrouping would be confronting someone with actual scientific information I mean you are a real doctor you're a guy who actually studies this and you're a man who understands the science you're a legitimate academic you could you could actually put a dent in this with a real conversation yeah potentially potentially yeah I mean what would he be able to say like what is his taking on it well remember he's uh he's an attorney and he's he's very clever right and right now he knows how to presumably knows how to do arguments in court and what am i of a scientists right but do you think that he wants to deceive people or do you think that maybe he's just incorrect in his accumulation of data yeah I can't say what his motivation is but um his his his information is is highly misleading hmm now what else is you say the lobby is this an organized thing good question I mean again we need somebody who really wants to do a deep dive in this and kind of dissect out the pieces yeah to understand but it's it's impressive what you've got out there in terms of the hundreds of websites and you have vacation on social media and everything else is it are there just one or two or three groups behind it or is it a random collection of organizations right that that needs to be looked at that does need to be now what what do you think is causing autism and in your personal estimation do you think that it is a that there's a rise in the factors that are causing autism or do you think that it's a rise in the understanding of these variables that contribute to it that you could diagnose people with and that before they were previously undiagnosed so I think most of it is that that we're just diagnosing it more we're including individuals in the autism category that we didn't before and by the way the numbers are about to go up even more because we're getting better at diagnosing girls and women with autism which is also quite interesting we used to say it was ten to one boys to girls and now we know there are a lot more girls and women on the autism spectrum it's just that they're usually more verbal and they can camouflage it better but they have very high rates of comorbidities like obsessive-compulsive disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a lot of the teenage girls with eating disorders now they're finding could actually be on the autism spectrum so the numbers are about to go up again I mean that's just an example I mean is I guess what you're really trying to get at is it is it beyond that is there is there an a bonafide increase beyond the number of diagnosis and and that one I'm still not sure about yeah I read an article about early onset gender dysphoria being connected to young girls or autism right you know there's a disproportionate number of girls with gender dysphoria who turned out to be also autistic right I've heard that as well yeah that's actually so it's really fascinating yeah think about now unfortunate and fascinating at the same yeah there's there's um there's a nice paper by a very good environmental scientist named Phil Landrigan who used to be at Mount Sinai now I think he's at Boston College now and he publishes about five or six chemicals in the environment which if you're exposed to for long periods of time during early pregnancy your child will be born with some features that resemble do you know what those chemical so I have to remember I talked about it in the book on what one of them is depakote valproic acid which is a psychiatric medicine used as a mood stabilizer or an antidepressant so prolonged use of depakote during pregnancy has been linked to something that resembles autism as a common medication it's a common medication but now that we know this information we don't use it anymore and so one of the things that i've been saying to you know people like bobby kennedy and everything else if you really want if you really think there's some environmental linked to autism we've got a list of at least six chemicals during early exposure and pregnancy that are probably causing mutations and things like that that are leading to autism why aren't we and why isn't anybody looking into that hmm it's just crazy I mean so all the focus on goes into vaccines and it kind of sucks all the oxygen out of the room so that you know really understanding the search for autism gets delayed or in some cases doesn't get pursued at all or the other thing that happens in many state legislatures and things like that the focus is so much about vaccines that we don't talk about what autism parents really need I mean what do I need for Rachel we need you know employment counseling and help we need mental health counseling what do we do after we're gone Rachel right now is living with us I'm turned 60 my wife is you know 58 what happens to us 10 15 20 years from now there's no roadmap right so so all of that gets shunted aside because of these phony-baloney anti-vaccine argument that's why I get angry that's when I start to realize these guys in addition to affecting public health are actually hurting autism families as well well that makes sense I mean and I can completely understand why this would upset you especially as a scientist now when you're talking about these various chemicals that you think do contribute to or possibly cause autism maybe we should really concentrate on that and and publish something about this is this something that these are an article that people can go to that says something about this there is I I talked about it in the book in the book and I could if I opened up the book I could provide it for you is there anything that people can read online about this without going to your book probably you know one of the problems that we face in this country is that we put a lot of scientific articles behind paywalls right as a real source of frustration for me and why do they do that well one of the reasons one of the things that I've done now is I'm one of the I founded a an open access journal called the Public Library of Science neglected tropical diseases so that anybody with a computer you know an internet connection and a printer can download the articles free of charge and we need more of that that's great but right now if someone wants to find out these chemicals they have to buy your book or buy some sort of access to scientific pay yes I'm not sure what that particular paper whether it's behind a paywall or not on the book there I mean besides measles what other diseases are more prevalent now because of people not vaccinating their kids the ones that there's three diseases that I worry about the most actually for well whooping cough is another one so that's one but the other one I worried about is the flu vaccine kids aren't getting their flu vaccine last year and the 2018 flu epidemic a hundred and fifty unvaccinated kids died of influenza despite the recommendation of accident can you enlighten me on this because what I've been told is that sometimes they get the flu vaccine wrong so you can get vaccinated but it doesn't doesn't protect you for the strain of flu that everybody's getting well so that's again something that was heaven idea I was heavily pushed by the anti vaccine Lobby here's the story you're right last partially right last year the there was not a perfect match between the between the the virus and the vaccine the killed virus and the vaccine and the wild type flu strain that was out there but it was good enough to prevent you from dying and it was good enough to would likely prevent you from being hospitalized so would in effect even if you did get that's right because it was enough cross protection so that it would it would mitigate the symptoms that's confusing to people because if they have the flu they say oh well that it didn't work that's right but it did because it preventing you from getting sick and dying and and again that was that was a message that never really got out 20 okay so let's talk about someone like me who's a healthy person I've had the flu before but I don't usually get a flu shot that's crazy you should watch the knowledge especially now as you're getting older was because flu is one of the leading it's probably the single leading infectious disease killer of adults in the United States but every time I've had it it's really been like just a couple of days out I rest well you got a lot of fluids you got lucky my friends yeah well you know sure I mean let's so if you look at the eighty thousand adults who died and the influenza epidemic of 2018 in the United States you're right a lot of them had underlying things like diabetes or non-communicable cardiovascular disease or underlying respiratory disease maybe they were smokers but that durst but they're still thought but they're still thousands of individuals who are perfectly healthy who died of influenza that we know so and you don't get your flu vaccine you're taking a terrible check and and why not well I mean what what are you risking by getting the flu fax I'm busy bro you know what you know you know where I you know where I get my vaccinations Walgreens even better like we have a big grocery store chain and Texas a big supermarket called h-e-b to get it up the nose I get now I get it I get the injection right the pharmacists the farm all of my vaccines I've gotten for the last few years have been given by the pharmacists interesting so couldn't be easier are you have you ever gotten the flu since you've been getting the vaccine every year uh well you know I've gotten I've gotten sick with like a cold like a like a sore throat and feeling crummy was that a mild case of flu I can't really tell okay but you've never gotten sick right after you got a vaccine some people do right no some people do get a vaccine and then they have an adverse reaction to sometimes you know after getting your vaccine you can get you get some soreness and you can feel maybe a slight fever for a few hours or a day but usually it's you're fine what is that what is that yeah what is that fever why are you getting a fever because the Cina stimulating the immune system and stimulating the inflammatory system so even though you feel like you're getting sick because the vaccine is actually good for your immune system that that's right and you're not really sick I mean it's nothing like is nearly as bad as getting the flu the other vaccine neither you're getting up there you have to start considering is the shingles vaccine Shing Grix and that's a that's a great vaccine it hurts though for a couple of days do you take care of your immune system in other ways do you take probiotics are you cautious about your diet I'm not as clashes about my diet is I should be I'm a junk food a holic actually well that seems like a terrible thing for your health it is a terrible thing for my health and something my wife is working on it but that seems ridiculous for someone who works with health yeah yeah sometimes man I just I get it right how often what how often how often do I steal a bag of chips or something like garbage uh I don't know no no hopefully not every day but you know maybe a couple of times a week oh that's what I Rachel my my daughter with autism that's like our thing is to go to the it's called the burger joint door to Shake Shack together to get a cheeseburger what sticks the sneaks on fries so mmm so you live in large we call it like that mouths pleasure so much you're willing to sacrifice a little bit I am yeah I you know I you know I can I have to concede that's the case well there's I mean I don't have to tell you but there's a large body of data that connects poor diet to a host of diseases that seems like a crazy decision for a guy in your line of work there you go sometimes the sometimes the it's not all brain it's it's something else but I mean if you ate healthy food I mean the thing is your body starts craving healthy food you start feeling ya know no question no question about it do you take vitamins I don't take quite it's real yeah Wow I don't think they're neither cuz most limits in the American up hold up hold up you don't think they're needed where you're eating junk food well I'm not only eating junk food you know there's a large body of clinical research on the efficacy of vitamins especially vitamins D vitamin I have taken vitamin D for periods the recommendation of my internist in what about essential fatty acids which are great for your brain fish oil all these different things that are fantastic I'm not gonna I'm not gonna argue with you got it you got it over me listen the but it would you would have a much better argument that you're making my wife stay here you're taking care of yourself a hundred percent but you still need but you still need your vaccines I'm sure you do but vaccines aren't gonna prevent cancer no that's true right there's a lot of diseases or diabetes or cardiovascular disease a lot of these diseases are connected directly to diet yeah come on and the other lifestyle change yeah sedentary life I try to go on the treadmill for 30 minutes from work I do it actually I'm pretty good about that yeah thirty minutes every morning I'll just go for a natural walk it's more interesting I did that too sorry I don't I don't know but I deal with thirty minutes on the treadmill in the morning and then I might take a long walk with my wife in the evening oh that's good but we know that the thing that knocks the crap out used to travel yes I find that very frustrating because you know exercise rate and then you eat you don't eat well well and you don't control the diet as well so that's well I have a solution to that and eat well and exercise those are those the solutions to that just do it you know I treated like I'm brushing my teeth I brush my teeth every day yeah I exercise every day too yeah so when I travel I don't have an option when I land I go to the gym this is how it goes I'll and I get my hotel room I put my short-term yeah yeah I did that too I do that too it's the only way yeah if you have to do it if you say this is just what gets done right this is how you do it yeah I try to be really compulsive about that so yeah I have a written now I know what I'm gonna do especially if it's great if the hotel is a good gym the whole kill you know if they have weights and a bunch of therefore I'll run outside if we don't you run yeah do you not very well but know what you do okay yeah we gotta get you a healthy buddy yeah can't be pushing only chemicals and injectable forms to facilitate health fair enough yeah not chemicals or vaccines I'm sorry what's in them what I mean it's some sort of chemical no no other antigens right there are there a fluid macromolecules what's the liquids typically it would be saline or you know salt water and that now what is missing from today's vaccine protocol if anything in terms of diseases we should be vaccinating for both laughing yeah there certainly are you know one of them is a big big problem among young infants especially premature infants called RSV respiratory syncytial virus infection what does that come from it's you know it's a respiratory virus that Peaks are on the same time that flu does so it's a very severe respiratory illness so this is again one of those vaccines that's not a big moneymaker so the bill Melinda Gates Foundation is trying to provide grants for supporting that one that that's a good one and then there are all the diseases that affect poor people both in developing countries and even among the poor in the United States this book that's that's the next one called marble health the next one so this is not released yet oh this is out this actually this actually preceded the okay now this book is all about poor people and infectious diseases and that the rise of these infectious diseases even in the United States that's right so you know when we think about so all right all right you know let let this big campaign to raise awareness of something called neglected tropical diseases or entities these are the most common afflictions of people living in poverty I call them the most important disease you've never heard of their diseases like schistosomiasis and Jacques disease and leishmaniasis and have been devoting my life to seeing if we could develop vaccines for those diseases in the nonprofit sector you know because the big pharmaceutical companies just don't see just aren't going to take these on so we're trying to do it in a non profit sector but this book the blue marble health book came out of some number crunching that I did using data from the World Health Organization or something called the Institute for Health metrics and evaluation which is based in Seattle Washington that found something very surprising and that is most of the world's poverty related diseases are not necessarily in the poorest most devastated countries of Africa meaning like Democratic Republic of Congo or Central African Republic they're there but on the numbers basis most of these poverty related diseases are actually in the g20 economies the 20 wealthiest economies together with Nigeria which is not a g20 country but it has an economy bigger than the bottom three or four so that was pretty amazing for me to find that out because you know at first I would I didn't believe the numbers because I said well how could it be if their poverty related diseases why are they in the 20 wealthiest economies and then I realized that it's among the poor living in wealthy countries so the poorest of the rich today now account for most of the world's poverty related diseases and what what's the cause of this so why the link with poverty so that's a great core so one of the things I do in the book is I ask that well what is it about poverty that's making you susceptible I don't think we really know I mean clearly in some cases if you live in poor dilapidated housing without window screens things like mosquitoes and kissing bugs and sand flies can get inside the house or if you look in in poor neighborhoods so I can turn around Houston you see a lot of environmental degradation or or on the neighborhood mmm you see discarded tires that breed is gyp time mosquito or standing water but I think what what what did tires do so yeah so one of the best habitats for the mosquito that transmits dengue and Zika and chikungunya and yellow fever are discarded tires that's what they love so this you know if you go into poor neighborhoods you'll see a lot of tired dumping for instance and and that's those are habitats for that eighty is a chip time mosquito including here in Southern California when the water gets in the top that's right a little bit of water that's exactly it yeah I you know I moved into a house once in Encino down the street from here in fact and no one had lived in the house for about a year and a half two years and the pool had not been taken care of and I went out into the pool and it was green and there were schools of mosquitoes sceeto heaven Macedo house yeah so strange so you so yeah absolutely you go into poor neighborhoods abandoned swimming pools things like that that's that's where we're getting a number of these diseases we don't have very many mosquitoes in Southern California I mean it's really kind of amazing in that regard like well it depends so you know some counties where they do aggressive spring and things like that you won't but in many counties you're probably probably some of the poorer counties poor districts you still do well I mean in terms of the way it is on the East Coast like I grew up in Boston and in the summertime you just have fucking mosquitoes everywhere they just can't get away from them and then I've been to Alaska which is the craziest place I've ever been to in my life in terms of mosquitoes right have you been I haven't been to Alaska it's hilarious you get out of your car and they attack you like a horde of birds that's because you only get one month of the CEO exactly yeah so they're super aggressive and they're also very large the big problems along the Gulf Coast of the US we have that ADEs chip type mosquito and that's why I got so worried about Zika virus in the Gulf coast of the US yeah mosquitoes and other countries obviously contain malaria I mean we've been very fortunate that that's never made it over to here well no we we used to have malaria used to be widespread in the United States both the one that was was a real killer disease called falciparum malaria on the gulf coast and even up into Illinois in the Ohio River Valley we had a lot of malaria when was this my five acts in the 1800s in fact there's a whole there's a book written by Dickens when he visited the United States called Martin Chuzzlewit know when he describes all these sickly people in Illinois and Cairo Illinois and the confluence of the Mississippi and the Ohio River he's clearly describing malaria why I did not know so what stopped it so that's a great question we so there's actually a very nice book written by a medical historian that Duke University named Margaret Humphreys called malaria race and poverty and she has a hypothesis but I think she's on to something that it the decrease the malaria dropped in associated with aggressive economic development so that the FDR's New Deal included something called the Agricultural Adjustment Act that got people off of off of with agrarian pursuits and put them into factories quality housing went up and that's probably what caused a lot of the reduction in these tropical diseases remember they're really diseases of poverty in fact I spent a lot of time working in China and I'm seeing that play out right now in China in China is had this very very aggressive program of economic development mostly in the eastern part of the country but in the southwest part of the country going to Yunnan Sichuan provinces you go back in time 75 years and you still see those diseases so spread do you think that the best cure or the best way to stop malaria would be just to increase the economy of these areas in Africa where they're experiencing it clearly economic development is a very potent driver now what it is about economic development we still don't have our arms around that yet but economic development is very important just like for the neglected tropical diseases we studied but you know unfortunately for many countries economic development is still decades away so that's why that's the rationale for developing these vaccines is it because economic development moves people into more urban environments where there's less tropical diseases I think that's part of it although now we're seeing some tropical diseases thrive in urbanized environments like you know yellow fever and Zika and dengue as well so it's not only urbanization you has to be urbanization with good planning that's not done uncheck that outstrips the infrastructure in terms of water and sanitation so this brings me to the thing that I wanted to talk to you about in the first place because this is what you brought up to me when we were doing this sci-fi show and you said something to me that has been haunting me ever since that the vast majority of people that live in tropical climates have parasites mm-hmm vast a jar yep that's right that that's right there's things like Toxoplasma gondii and so let's look at the let's look at the hit parade right the top one is one called ascariasis intestinal roundworm the estimates are on 800 million people have asked around worms in their bellies Wow so so more than 1 in 10 people on the planet mostly people who live in extreme poverty 400 million have hookworm infection 400 million have whip worse a lot of these are wormy diseases 200 million people with scabies which is an ecto parasite on the skin that causes terrible itching and secondary bacterial infections schistosomiasis is another one the point is every almost every single person who is in extreme poverty has one of these what I call neglected tropical diseases and one of the interesting features about them is they're very debilitating they not so that not only occur in the setting of poverty but I think they reinforce poverty because they make people too sick to go to work they make they actually shape we can show they shave IQ points off of kids when they have them well this is the hookworm connection today the idea of the slack-jawed dumb southerner right right United States of America right and now one of the things that we have found so rehalia mejia on my faculty working with environmental activists named Katherine Coleman flowers and Alabama found that hookworm is still present in Alabama people so they understand what we're talking about because for the longest time there was this stereotype about people that lived in the south that they were dull minded right and that this could be directly connected to hookworm infection which had run rampant right there was even the term given called they called the germ of laziness then the hookworm infection because it causes severe anemia so if you're walking around with terrible anemia of course you're - you're not feeling up to working a full day and all that sort of stuff right hookworm was wildly president and the president in the southeastern United States the turn of the 20th century and then as malaria went down with economic development so did hookworm infection as well but we still have pockets in this country and this wasn't understood at the time right they didn't know that these people were infected with hookworm Freight for for forever no up until very recently so the cause of hookworm wasn't discovered till 1900 what is that cause it's called Nicator americanus the American killer is and that's the name of the worm and this I'm walking barefoot or that goes in through the hands or you know enters all parts of the body so that's very common to get it from walking barefoot that's right which was more common in the south right right one so that's one of the diseases we've made a vaccine for the snow in clinical trials hmm yeah when I found that one out I was like oh my god well that's it that totally makes sense because for the longest time was there was that stereotype and then when you find out that it's directly connected to a massive infection of this disease worm so these are the diseases that are holding back people who live in poverty originally I thought only in places like the poorest countries in sub-saharan Africa or Southeast Asia but now I realize it's these pockets of poverty across the entire planet that people are affected by these disease and these diseases can be vaccinated that's where we're trying to prove that we can make a vaccine again and there is a hookworm vaccine right right now in clinical trials just in clinical that's right now wasn't there a Lyme disease vaccine but the problem was it was actually causing people to get Lyme disease so that's a talk about controversial topics that so there was a Lyme disease vaccine that was developed actually from a colleague of mine at Yale University and then it was and they licensed it I think it was to GlaxoSmithKline and they developed it as they called it Lyme Rex it was the Lyme disease vaccine and actually most of the study suggests that actually worked pretty well the problem was there were a number of people who felt that the vaccine made them worse or they said they had chronic Lyme disease that wasn't effective so it was really a market perception problem more than anything else and ultimately it hurt the bottom line of the company and they they withdrew it good friend of Mines dad got the vaccine and then got Lyme disease they think he got Lyme disease from the vaccine probably not probably is a weird word well that's a nice no he didn't get Lyme disease no way impossibly impossible because Lyme disease is caused by the Lyme bacteria at the spirochete called Borrelia burgdorferi and the vaccine is not a live vaccine it's a recombinant protein based vaccine so it's not though so there's nothing in that vaccine that could have caused this adverse reaction that they directly attribute to that vaccine probably not again your same problem I don't know the patient won't even examine the injury so I hate they swear I mean that's the narrative of that household well again you know what's reinforced by a lot of negative information out there on the Internet yeah but it's also reinforced by the fact they pulled the vaccine yeah well they pulled the vaccine not because it wasn't working but because of market perception and in all that sort of and that was a time before the number of cases of Lyme disease have really taken off so that seems strange to me because they didn't pull the measles mumps rubella vaccine because of perception why would they pull the Lyme disease vaccine because of perception I think the reason was is because the the cost-benefit equation works a little differently um with measles measles is a killer disease Lyme disease was not a killer disease and Wrekin people now in some cases it seems to be connected to a host of other ailments - correct like Lyme disease exacerbates a bunch of different maybe possibly even existing health issues well you have to be careful you know the the and this gets into another controversial rabbit hole I'm not sure we want to get into or not today but you know the infectious disease Society of America for instance has come out with a strong statement saying that there's really no such thing as chronic Lyme disease and the scientific evidence does not support something called chronic Lyme disease yet there are lots of people suffering with chronic debilitating illness who claim that it's caused by Lyme disease yes so this is something that is out there right now why is there a debate like what is the what are they saying that it there is no such thing as chronic Lyme disease what's their evidence the evidence is that there's no evidence that they can detect spirochetes in the body in many cases people who have had Lyme disease don't have persistent evidence of having antibodies any longer - through the Lyme spirochete so it's a whole different area right but they do have this chronic inflammation and pain in their joy they have somebody starts breaking down they have something but it doesn't seem to the infectious disease Society of America which is one of the leading infectious disease bodies in our country and I'm not an expert on Lyme disease so I'm not too comfortable going there with you are they're saying that there's no evidence that that that's actually associated with active infection with Lyme disease what are they how are they describing it and what how are they so another what so what's causing all the decent unknown unknown hmm but isn't it bizarre the same people got Lyme disease first and then how about these host of issues afterwards well the I guess part of the problem is in some cases they had Lyme disease first in some cases they really didn't have Lyme disease unfortunately there are a number of unscrupulous health care providers and even physicians out there that are making the misdiagnosis either they're making a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease or in some cases they're actually taking everyone who comes through the door and diagnosing them with Lyme disease mmm I'm sure you're aware the Lone Star tick rain the allergy to red meat yeah right that's really fascinating yeah yeah well actually all tick borne diseases are on the rise now yeah possibly because of climate change which is another factor in our country that's doing that so we're seeing you know if you look now at what are the big drivers of infectious diseases right now in the and not only in the US but globally there are really some interesting forces and a lot of them are social determinants so a big one is poverty that's that's a huge one the other big one is political instability in war because it interrupts public health control measures so for instance Venezuela which was leading Public Health Control in Latin America for dead Cades you know with the collapse of the economy in the Shabbos era now into the Medora area Medora area we've got a terrible situation where we've had measles return in a big way so huge numbers of cases of measles we've had all the neglected tropical diseases come back as well as malaria Chagas disease leishmaniasis so it's really interesting how that is destabilizing the whole region because now Venezuela has one of the largest diasporas of people as big as the Diaspora coming out of Syria and Iraq so now the diseases are moving into adjacent areas of Brazil and Colombia and Ecuador and so it's really and that's another big drivers political instability the third one we think is climate change may be very important so you know why did we see this big surge of chikungunya virus infection in the Western Hemisphere or Zika we don't really understand the forces of that and what's going on in southern Europe right now is quite concerning we've had malaria returned to Greece after it's been gone for 70 years malaria is returned to Italy we're seeing schistosomiasis and neglected tropical disease on the island of Corsica we've got dengue chikungunya West Nile virus across Italy Spain Portugal so we're trying to understand why that is and there's some thought that climate change may be a big driver of that now what other infectious diseases or parasites rather do they have vaccines for do they have a vaccine for talks oh there's no vaccine for toxoplasmosis there's a prototype malaria vaccine that's yeah well that's it's an X there's a malaria vaccine it's called mas Couric's that's the trade name that was developed supported but with a lot of funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and working in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline and that malaria vaccine now has been approved for use in children by the european medicine agency and it's being introduced now in three countries in africa Malawi Ghana and I forget the third one I think it's tense is there an adverse reaction that people have that's tough because I know the traditional malaria medication I had friends that took it and had horrible nightmares oh yeah malaria ms terrible yeah gives you very little or no and so there when you say children how old are the children that they're at vaccinating with this well the problem that you get into with malaria is that before six months of age you have maternal antibodies unborn you're one of the rich are born with antibodies from your mother and they'll start Delaine by six months of age so the ones who get hospitalized with measles what's called cerebral malaria which is a devastating condition or severe malaria anemia which is also a killer are those children between six months of age and five years of age so those are the ones that we want to protect now and it's one of the leading killers of children globally right right and and we don't end the vaccine sickle-cell is connected to it correct right sickle-cell is it has something to do with people developing an immunity to malaria yeah that's it I'm surprised you knew that it's not from Tiffany Haddish who's Tiffany habit how dare you she's a very funny comedian okay I'm sure she is but she's well she's like wow it's it's not really immunity but it's a natural protection so individuals who have the sickle cell trait or seem to be partially resistant to malaria hmm and that's the thinking why the gene for sickle cell has been preserved in Africa for so long is because it does confer some protection against malaria so it's a reason for keeping the gene in the gene pool yeah we were actually discussing it because a friend that I grew up with died from it so it seems to only exist in African Americans or Africans is that correct predominant no there's some other places as well but predominantly places in Africa and among African Americans or people whose ancestors came from these tropical climates where yes that's fair that's really quite an amazing story so there's no no no vaccine for toxoplasmosis is there anything on the horizon is there anything being worked on because that's a big one right it's a real big problem among people with hiv/aids for instance that's a because it reactivates your toxoplasmosis and we even see it in even seen in kids sometimes but the thing is activates it how so well what happens is it's in some countries up to 30% of people are actually infected with Toxoplasma and the parasite has the ability to undergo a dormancy state in the body until your immune system gets compromised either because of AIDS or because if you get some kind of medicine that suppresses your immune system and then it can reactivate it and cause what's called cerebral toxoplasmosis which is quite serious so most people handle their toxoplasmosis very well you know you die with it and don't even know you have it but in some cases it gets reactivated right now there doesn't seem to be a lot of incentive for developing a toxoplasmosis fax you know though I'd be very interested to work on something like well how would there be no incentive it's such a large-scale disease it's hundreds of millions people worldwide right that's right and part of the problems we have almost no information on the actual number of people who have it and how extensive it is so we call that disease burden we don't have good disease burden estimates of toxoplasmosis I'm sorry you're tested I've had a bunch of cats I've had feral cats yeah you preach and I'm crazy well it's a good chance your your are infected but your immune systems intact then you're okay now there is a related disease that from cats called toxic or Isis and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among the poor and that's a warrant so what happens is if you go into poor neighborhoods you know and you see a lot of feral cats and dogs and poor neighborhoods almost a hundred percent of them have this worm in their intestines and they're seating the environment with eggs and their feces and the feces are spread all over the poor neighborhoods kids come into contact with them and the worm has the ability to migrate through the brain across cerebral toxic arises and I think it's an important cause of developmental delays it's one of those neglected diseases in the US and about in the book and there's no vaccine for that there's no vaccine for and we need a very little awareness about it Wow yeah I've never even heard of it until just now right so this is not rare I mean in some cases you know up to 10% of certain populations like Africa African Americans living in poverty are infected with it and it's primarily pets or is it rodents as well mostly stray dogs and snot even pets it's mostly stray dogs and cats and and I get right and this is an example of a neglected tropical disease here's here's a disease of up to 10% of African Americans living in poverty in the United States and almost nobody is studying it Wow right and it can affect the way your mind functions right it's been and it's been linked now to developmental delays so you know everybody wants to know why you know kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's because they live in deprived environments and that sort of thing but I think toxic crisis is an important underlying reason for it and this is an example of a neglected disease you know we I mean everybody's heard of Ebola right and everyone's worried about Ebola and and the truth is Ebola is never gonna come to the United States why is it never gonna because it's too difficult to transmit unless you have a complete collapse in the health system we're never gonna have Ebola epidemics in the United States but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in poverty and no one's heard of it and there's no incentive to study it so that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty related diseases and that'sthat's correctly I understand why people don't talk about that one yeah that one seems insane right yeah absolutely it's a no-brainer right and so but you know it's very hard to get people to care about diseases of poverty and this is one of the striking things about when I wrote the book was you know I've had a lot of success getting people to care about neglected tropical diseases in Africa and worked with the US Agency for International Development to support a package of medicines that's now being administered to over a billion people annually and now you know as one of my proudest accomplishments is is helping to raise awareness about neglected tropical disease like we've been talking about it look Worman schistosomiasis in Africa Asia Latin America but the minute I talk about poverty related diseases in the US the lights go up why is that I don't know I can't what am i I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong I've had so much success getting people to care about NTDs neglected tropical diseases and in poor developing countries but you know there's been no response to this book I mean it is and and the estimates that I come up on the Booker we have twelve million Americans live in poverty with a neglected tropical disease toxic or Isis is one of them another one is Jacques disease and and the list goes on it's been very hard to get people to care about the poor in this country that's very strange to me and I've always said that about the way we treat other countries we want to send them aid and rebuild these countries but we don't do anything about these terrible communities that have been terrible in this country for a decade upon decade right and so I try to make the point the world has changed you know this this old norm of global health developed versus developing it still exists but it's going away we're what we're seeing is our general rise in all all economies in some African countries of eight or nine percent economic growth but that's all leaving behind a bottom segment of society and so I don't care where you show me poverty whether it's in Texas or Alabama or Nigeria or Bangladesh I will show you these poverty related diseases and you know I I know what's your name AOC the congresswoman from New York has talked a little bit about hookworm in Alabama so last time I was in Washington I dropped off a copy of the book in her office but no response yet well she's probably pretty busy too yeah she's doing a lot of others if you had a magic wand and someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this what would you do so I I did meet with a couple of people on the hill and and they asked me that question what's the magic wand and there's a couple of things one we need to actually look for these diseases because the problem is they're the the disease that caused a very subtle like developmental delays so that if you're you know a kid who lives in poverty with developmental delays the pediatrician doesn't even think to do a test for toxic arises so that so we need to raise awareness we need to go into poor communities across the country and actually take a blood test and actually measure for the presence of that disease or that parasite once you find that disease what would you do that well it depends on the disease in some cases we have treatments for him like the treatment for toxic rias's is a five day course of a simple pill of albendazole and it cures it and it cures it so really yeah so that we have you know we have interventions so one you know doing what I call active surveillance looking for these diseases the other one is really trying to understand how these diseases are transmitted what is it about poor neighborhoods that is facilitating transmission I think the third problem is the diagnostic test themselves because they're very complicated tests sometimes you know they're done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention our lab or our National School of Tropical Medicine does a few of them but it's not like you know when you go for a you go for blood work and your doctor and you get a little lab slip from quest Diagnostics with the you know the blood chemistry's the blood counts there's no box there for toxic Rises and Jacques to see so we need more improved test point of care diagnostic tests not just improved tests but just let me make it more accessible yeah and so they don't have to send it off to the CDC or to you know our National School of Tropical Medicine is their treatment for talk so there is a treatment for toxoplasmosis what is it it's parama that means sulfa drug but it requires a long treatment course how long I'd have to look up the number of days I haven't treated a patient with toxoplasmosis in a while but and it kills it effectively he can yeah really yeah oh I thought it was something you kept for life well if you don't get treated right okay so and then if your immune compromised and it comes back then that that's a problem as well so most people that have it really don't even know they have that's right yeah and actually and most people who have neglected tropical diseases don't know they have it either so that in the end Texas for instance we have transmission of a parasitic disease called Jacques disease it's a cause of heart disease we you know are members of our faculty were actually able to track down individuals who had donated blood and the Gulf Coast Regional blood authority actually found somebody people positive for Jacques disease they were told to go see their primary health care provider and then unfortunately the primary health care provider is not educated about these diseases and they just assume must be a false positive so you know our faculty had tracked them down and were able to get them into treatment and what is the treatment for Chagas it's a it's a an anti-parasitic agent called Benson it is all and that kills it that can kill if you catch it early enough but sometimes you don't catch it early so if it becomes systemic then you have then that's why we're trying to develop a therapeutic vaccine for this disease oh but again it's a therapeutic vaccine for a poverty-related disease so it's it's very tough ma'am so the point is these diseases are widespread among the poor and we just don't pay attention to them yeah that's great and so I think you know again I'd love to hear your thoughts I mean what is it that we just turn our backs on the poor in this country it's it's disturbing it's very dismissive value and and and they disproportionately affect people of color as well right yeah because you know because it's so linked to poverty well also right slavery yeah I mean the history of slavery in this country in the history of systemic racism in places where they just literally would not sell homes to people who are african-american all these things are connected to the the contribution of maintaining these impoverished communities and there's been almost no effort whatsoever other than the people living in the community trying to do better and raise everybody up right there's been no effort whatsoever by the federal government to step in and try to rehabilitate like a large scale approach to rehabilitating places like the ghettos of Houston or Baltimore or you know I thought I knew what poverty living at I was before I moved to Texas in 2011 I was chair of microbiology at George Washington University and I thought I thought I knew what poverty looked like I moved down to the Gulf Coast it's a different animal I mean the the depth and breadth of poverty in the Gulf Coast in the southern part of the United States is just extraordinary and it's been very hard to get people to want to really take it on and really address these these poverty related diseases do you think what do you think the cause of it is I mean if you've you've studied this for quite a while well the cause of did neglect yes yeah I don't know I don't know you know is it something about American exceptionalism or something like we just don't want to admit we have poor people I don't know you know I wasn't the first to come up you know to raise this issue about poverty when I was in high school or junior high school I was forced to read a book and at the time I didn't care about it was called the other America it was written by fantastic social activist named Michael Harrington who was I think someone come he's a very devout Catholic actually so and he wrote this book called the other America talks about the hidden poverty off the road and the actual number of people who live in extreme poverty hasn't changed since that book was written in the early 60s that book was helped was what helped Lyndon first Kennedy than Lyndon Johnson launched the war on poverty in 1964 I dusted off that book and it still it still works today and that's how I started out talking about my book blue marble health about that book the other America by Michael Harrington yeah that is a very strange thing our acceptance of these communities and I mean I've always said that if you want to make America a better place the best thing to do is not invade other countries or intervene the best thing to do is try to rebuild these impoverished communities yeah well Gandhi Gandhi people way out Gandhi once said a civilization is judged by the treatment of its minorities and yes we're not you know by that criteria we're not doing so well you know the we our country was visited by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on poverty into 2017 and his numbers came up with we have 19 point four million Americans who live in what's called extreme poverty that is at half the u.s. poverty line and roughly around five million Americans living on less than $2 a day the same benchmark you'd use for global poverty everywhere million yeah and and guess what those probably all have neglected tropical diseases five just just like just like those living in extreme poverty in Africa and if I'd only people living on $14 a week to two dollars a day yeah that's insane yeah the University of Michigan center on poverty is also shown that we have I forget the number 2.7 million families living in less than $2 a day which is probably about the same as the five million number Jesus Christ yeah and again this is not a topic that is very popular I mean when when you see presidential debates this is not something common Oh buddy talks about it and again even for disease I mean who what are the diseases we hear about Ebola and and lot of diseases like that and sometimes on my frustration I say you know where these are imaginary diseases and yet here we've got widespread diseases of the poor in the US and the lights go out you remember when that woman came back from Africa and she was a nurse and she had been some in some connection contacted with Ebola she didn't have it and they wanted a quarantine here oh yeah and they they stuck around in some cabin and the airport or something crazy terrible you know what did you think about that I just thought it was so cruel is it just ignorant of how handsome it is right how its transmitted well actually Ebola you know it turns out is the opposite of measles measles one of those contagious disease is known it has a reproductive number of 12 to 18 what that means if a single individual gets measles 12 to 18 others get it because the virus hangs around in the environment and it's so easily transmissible hangs around like if you touch this tables right that's right or even in the Aven and the atmosphere so and that's why you get these really large measles outbreaks like you're seeing in Washington State and and usually those are infants under the age of 12 months not yet old enough Dave the ones waiting to hospitalized and then sick the Ebola is just the opposite Ebola is a reproductive number of two or three so unless you're taking care of a dead or dying Ebola patient or someone who's recently died because it's only towards the end stage of the disease that you really get large numbers of virus particles in the body you're not going to get Ebola so the reason is being so hard right now to contain a Democratic Republic of Congo it's not because it's so highly contagious it's just that the place is decimated by the collapse and infrastructure associated with civil war so even though we have now an Ebola vaccine it's hard to vaccinate everybody and how is it transmitted Ebola by contact with fluids of somebody with with Ebola so it has to get into your tissue so right now oh what else should we worry about you're freaking me out the point is a lot of these diseases are solvable if if we just put our mind to it so are these or even aware of it one of the things I say in the book is if because these diseases are so widespread among the poor in the g20 countries if we could get the elected or the leaders of those g20 countries together to g20 summit and say we're really going to do something about the neglected diseases in our own borders and I will include the United States we could get rid of two-thirds of the world's party related neglected diseases right off the bat Wow so a lot of it is political will ignorant or lack of awareness and political will well it seems like in this country ignorant is a big part of it because this is something I've thought about many times but I didn't know about cha God and know about a lot of these a disease you're describing yeah no I mean so we need to raise awareness about these that's why I'm so thrilled so thrilled to come here because I've just amplified the number of people who have heard of this concept of blue marble health yeah the name that I've given a different name from global health to two separate separated from the two so you know coming on here is so powerful in terms of amplifying that mess so again back to the magic wand but what could be done I mean is it a funding issue or is it at first before that an education issue well I think there's multiple issues so I mean if again with the the drivers we've been talking today about promoting these diseases really tough to do anything about extreme poverty war and conflict climate change climate change clearly there are certain things we can do aggressive unchecked urbanization but the other things that you can do is build better tools by vitami better Diagnostics better drugs better vaccines and unfortunately for these poverty related diseases there's no market incentive for it so it falls to academics to professors to people trying to do this in the nonprofit sector and we're doing the best we can but it's not nearly as good as having access to getting the pharmaceutical companies involved as well it also seems like the it would this would cost an insane amount of money to just go through all these poor communities test everyone and start distributing these these drugs and what would pay for all that stuff well you know some people have asked me to low what would the Affordable Care Act take care of this and I said well we're two steps away from the Affordable we're two to two standard deviation to standard deviation two degrees of separation away from the Affordable Care Act because we're not even Harry recognizing these diseases yeah you got to know about it first I mean most what percentage of the population even knows about right all these parasite created diseases or know that vaccines don't cause autism yeah well that one is it that that's the biggest one yeah I mean that's a tough one and again I don't understand it I mean I'm just saying it I'm saying vaccines don't cause autism because you're saying it right you know and then I think this is the part of the boat is a lot of peope are the problem we're in this boat a bunch of people who are scientifically illiterate like myself we're discussing these issues who don't really know what they're talking about someone talked about tetanus because some boy had tetanus hmm and he was in the hospital for a long time and his his bill was hospital bills like a million dollars good yeah yeah well because it's an ICU admission right right and they were saying hey you know why didn't this kid get a tetanus shot and it get it goes back to the same thing right that people don't want these vaccines yeah any prevented and again I don't blame the parents I think the parents in some ways are victims themselves our victim of this very aggressive misinformation right I mean that's out there tetanus is a big one though isn't it yeah tetanus and we have a vaccine for it that's part of the what's called the DPT that's what are the first vaccines you get as an infant there's no excuse for having a tetanus case in the United States right and this kid was unvaccinated right yeah that's my understanding yeah I mean is there a cure for tetanus outside of vaccines well I mean there are supportive measures that you can do but you know they require hospitalization ventilation putting on a respirator means it's a band you could still die so it's a it's an awful awful disease I've seen tetanus working in Central America and elsewhere you see a case of tetanus you never forget it what is tightness technically well the other name is lockjaw where your muscles go into spasm and and you can including the muscles involved in breathing so you can't even breathe as a result of an impairment it freezes the muscles what what is doing it what's doing is it's parris it's actually a caused by a bacteria the bacteria releases a toxin called tetanus toxin oh that's sounds like a horrible way to go it's a terribly sorrowful diseases and I think one of the things that the NT vaccine group or Lobby as I call it does is they try to be very dismissive of these diseases they try to deliberately downplay the effects I mean you'll see this stuff on the web measles build your immune system yeah you said it yourself so I didn't read it yeah I just saw it yeah it's crap right yeah and what are they saying what is what is the first thing it's just a rash it builds your immune system it makes you stronger it's it's it's something out of a different planet I don't know where their Co we do though I think the reason for that becoming popular is because you we do kind of helicopter parent our kids a little bit too much they should come in contact with a bunch of different things because it does build their immune system correct well that's an interesting hypothesis called the hygiene hypothesis that says you know a few kids are living in too sterile environment then this can also result in autoimmune diseases and things like that but it's allergies allergies and I have mixed feelings about the hypothesis to me it's not not airtight by any means yeah you're tight but it's there's there's some sort of a correlation particularly between peanut allergies and keeping peanuts away from children and that there was a study showing those Jonathan hates work in one of his books talked about how there was a study done in communities where they didn't protect kids from peanut allergies and this much smaller percentage of people developing peanut allergies versus kids that they did yeah well this is also one of the things that the into vaccine lobbies doing now that they're you know and when I write a book like this vaccines don't cause autism now what you're seeing remember I told you about that whack-a-mole business where they went from MMR tooth is all to spacing vaccines too close together to aluminum now there's some groups that are moving away from autism altogether and now they're saying well vaccines cause autoimmune disease or vaccines cause other neurologic deficits but it's all it's all flim-flam it's all from what is but there are there are vaccine courts though right in vaccine there are vaccine courts and they have handed out payments to people who were injured by vaccines right what what is that so you know it was for instance if you look over a 10-year period I think it is between and haven't looked at the numbers in a while I think it's between 2008 and 2014 2015 over that period of time there were 2.5 billion doses of vaccine given 2.5 billion of which the vaccine courts identified around 200 that were a list of serious injuries that could be that they have a Abell love that they could attribute to vaccines so there were 2,000 payouts on of those 2,000 80% they didn't really think we're attributed to vaccines but they paid it out anyway because that's how the courts work and then 200 where they could really say yeah it looks like this could be related to vaccine so you divide 200 by 2.5 billion that's one in 10 million or even 2,000 by 2.5 billions it's one in a million and these cases what was happening to these people other than the shoulder injury that you were talking about yeah there's a there's a list and I talked about it in the book there's actually a table you can download on the web of each vaccine a list of potential injuries that they allow and these potential injuries is it as we were talking about earlier is this just biological variability that some people just react differently to different things I think in some cases we don't know in other cases you know with the live virus vaccines if you have a severe genetic immune deficiency and maybe it wasn't picked up then then there is that risk but you know what's what's the one-in-a-million what's the one in a 10 million risk as I said we have to keep that in perspective because the gods are getting hit by lightning is one in a 700 thousand and you believe that number or you know what's the risk every time you take your child out in a car and drive around the neighborhood I'm sure the risk is far higher than one in a million and the real danger is these actual infectious disease is spreading and the damage they could do damage things like that they're coming back yeah yeah yeah meet me Szell's is it as an awful disease causes measles encephalitis measles pneumonia I find that a lot of people that are that are steadfast in their resistance to vaccines they they also believe in a lot of other questionable things it seems like these things get lumped into these groups of things that they don't trust the government about right right yeah I think that's part I think that's probably true yeah that's which was she government which was which was in turmoil you know it was interesting so you know I said we know we need to hear from the Centers for Disease Control more in the Surgeon General now the starting to speak out but you know people counter that's a well part of the problems people don't trust their government I say that's true of some but I think most people if you know if we had a you know more visible public health force out there people would listen to it well I think that what you're talking about in terms of these poor neighborhoods in these parasites getting into people's system and infecting cognitive development and but it was the other one besides chaga it was the Toxocara assist the process cognitive develop and the fact that there is actual cures for these things to I mean that I estimated in a paper there are 2.8 million African Americans living in poverty with toxic horizons Wow this is not a rare disease Joe this is this is a common disease but it's so unknown but it's occurring among the poor and ironic and debilitating infection it's not dramatic it's not not Ebola it's not healing people is this mostly and this is requirements as well it's probably it's more in common in the south than in the north is it because they have long longer time to do this yeah as the eggs are of the eggs are and the environment and the worm develops with it within the egg is there any other diseases that are going wrong that we don't know about yeah yeah sure there's other there's a brain parasitic infection called cysticercosis that one is from eggs often from individuals who have a tapeworm so that's we're seeing cases of that there's some of the viruses transmitted by mosquitoes one of the ones we don't talk about a lot which is a very serious infection is West Nile virus infection hmm that's got very high rates of not only encephalitis but also are one of our faculty members Christy Murray is showing very high rates of depression and other neurologic debilitation for and that's another one we could probably use a vaccine for but there isn't the market incentive to do it West Nile virus does come up though that least that's discussed in the news and people aware of it right right said it right but there's no vaccine there's no vaccine but there could be what is it there could be I was holding it back what's holding it back is lack of market forces lack of financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to take it on so there's an extremely large investment to develop something along those lines that's right yeah I mean vaccines are for an investor's perspective tough sell because you know there's a possibility you know first of all you need many years of clinical trials it can sometimes take two decades from the original conception of a vaccine to actually going through a clinical trial so the hookworm vaccine I've been working on we've been doing it since the 1990s so we're talking decades long time horizons when you talk to an investor about something with decades long time horizons you know I figure it out right the light the lights go out I mean very very quickly so where it gets gross right because this is all we're relying on these private businesses to invest money to cure a public health issue that's right that's right that seems kind of crazy well so in response to that what happened was after the Ebola Fiasco in 2014 where we didn't have an Ebola vaccine in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone a group of individuals came together at Davos the World Economic Forum and including the Gates Foundation and they put around they've developed this concept or which an organization called sepi the Coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation to incentivize biotechs and pharmaceutical companies to embark on diseases for which of pandemic potential like ebola like Lassa fever like mares corona virus infection and that was great but the problem was they didn't address these poverty related diseases so those of us who were working on poverty related diseases are still kind of on the outside looking in it just seems like having everything managed by private companies that need to they need to have some sort of a financial incentive to attack these diseases that seems like a crazy way to deal with health crisis that's right that's right and so what I've recommended as I said this set that organization sepi is great for what it's doing but we need another mechanism what I've proposed is that since these diseases are so common among the poor in the jeat any countries these are the 20 largest economies to put together public sector funds for that purpose public sector funds for investing in developing vaccines and treatments for poverty related diseases these chronic debilitating diseases and in fact you know we can show that the using working with health economists we actually work with a terrific health economist his name is Bruce Lee evolved of all names huh he's that professor at Johns Hopkins Yeah right he loves it and he said he's been able to show that our vaccines are not only cost effective they're cost savings meaning that they're economically dominant that they'll actually save money the problem is you still doesn't help you with the fact that you still need some but the return is on public health you still need somebody to come along and provide that investment yes you know so what's happened is our our technical ability to develop vaccines has outstripped our our our financial instruments that we have to do it so I get a stream of young people in my office wanting to go into global health I mean the commitment for this next generation I know they get a lot of bad press but my impression is this next generation their commitment to public service is at an all-time high and they say you know dr. Hotez I'm all-in I'm gonna go into global health and they're a little bit disappointed when I tell them get an MBA or get a law degree because where we need the innovation now is in the is in the finance sector there's a there must be a business model out there that would work that would figure out how to how to do this I just don't have the background to do it it seems like once the momentum is in the corner of this being handled by the private sector and that the private sector has to develop these vaccines and these treatments and they have to do it with some sort of financial incentive if they don't have a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow they're not going to take a ride that's right that's right so look that's crazy it's great but that's the reality and so what the exciting thing about what I do is you know developing these vaccines for poverty related diseases there's no road map right now there were in clinical trials I don't know what the road map is to get to licensure and getting these vaccines out to the public the terrifying thing the thing keeps me up at night is there's no room there's how much does it cost to get a vaccine I mean in general from developmental period to actual application well the pharmaceutical companies have traditionally said billions but I don't think that's the case I think one of the reasons you they're doing that is because they're also recovering their R&D costs you know they're putting money into our right that they that they that they charge in order to you know either make a profit or at least a Eve and so for instance the cervical cancer vaccine the HPV vaccine that you know when I last look was $420 for the three doses it doesn't take cost $420 to make that vaccine it's just that they're recovering their R&D costs which is which is fair enough so one of the things that we're proposing to do for our neglected disease vaccines is we'll delink the rnd cost another was if we've gotten grants whether it's from the Gates Foundation in the past or or the NIH or the European Union or the Dutch government or the Carlos Slim foundation we're not gonna pass those costs on we'll just you know that was used for R&D and we would just cost for the cost of good so at least we can get it down to just a couple of dollars a dose a few dollars of those now for anybody that's listed in this conversation and they have additional questions where's the best place that you should guide them it would it be your books probably the books because I wrote the books for lay audiences my lay audiences sort of I mean and somebody with a call University education but I mean they're not you know it's they're they're published by Johns Hopkins University Press so and they are kind of they're uneven in terms of how weighty they get into the science but certainly the vaccines not cause Rachel's autism I wrote it with the idea of parents vaccine hesitancy and also the pediatricians because the other problem with pediatricians is you know they're there in their office parents are reading this stuff on internet and they come and loaded loaded for bear into the pediatricians office with all these factoids and the pediatrician was like well gee I never heard that before and and then the pediatrician is made to feel stupid like he's not keeping up with the science he is or she is but it's just they're not keeping up with the misinformation so I provide talking points in the epilogue of the book and Blue Marble health is the best resource for people to understand the about disease of the poor in wealthy countries then I have a third book that I wrote a few years ago called forgotten people forgotten diseases that describes with neglected tropical diseases well I really hope that what comes out of this is someone gets motivated to create some sort of a documentary really on both subjects I mean I think that we greatly benefit from some clarity for people that do have concern about autism that's in a digestible form for good or for bad people like to watch documentaries right and I hope you don't get too beat up over this because I know the anti-vaccine groups are very passionate and well I mean they don't have a position they don't know they would beat me up well that's well they beat me up a lot well I'm sure they'd go after you and they already call me a shill they call me a shill for a lot of things though you know being leaving the round earth jamie has a t-shirt that he sells at young Jamie comets round earth shell great literally I've been called a round earth shell and the earth is flat there's a lot of those ya know if you know I didn't know that there's a lot so you get beat up no matter what if you're talking but so but I really think it would get be it would do a good service if somebody did put together a documentary because I don't think most people are aware I think most people are just relying on this fear like that vaccines do cause autism there's also this connection between people that are older correct when when they're older and they have children there seems to be a more likely there seems to be and that may be related to as you get older your sperm or your egg have some genetic instability and more likely to produce mutation yes that's probably the Mac and that would go hand-in-hand yeah the genetic basis of autism and then the blue marble health book I mean what you've been saying today about these diseases and how many of them exist and how many of them are almost unknown untreated right undiagnosed and just how many people are unaware I really hope that someone does something about that too but in the meantime people can buy your books are they available in audio as well definitely the vaccines do not cause Rachel's autism is audiobooks and I'm not sure about Blue Marble health okay but you can get it on Amazon thanks for being here I appreciate it it's good to see you again well thank you for raising awareness of all this stuff I really appreciate leisure my pleasure and I appreciate you coming down here and explaining a lot of this stuff for us it's been a great time I really enjoyed the opportunity if people want to get a hold you on Twitter what is your Twitter just an app Peter Hotez okay thanks our appreciate you [Music]
