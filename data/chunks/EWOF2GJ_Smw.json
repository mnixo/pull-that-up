the girag an experienced Schneider so I might not recognize it that's just I don't even know why I speculated be a fucking waste all your time let it be your hump they're going oh yeah Joe Rogan says it's don't leave it because you find it it's over you keep on questioning everything you can't start yes usually I show the question one thing about I'm questioning things with the one with the with chemtrails yeah that one I don't know either way I'm not fucking out there but there is a difference from the ones that that do dissipate correct you know right away and the ones that stick around when well again like I say but I am absolutely not a scientist nor anything that I will say on any weather it's about fucking air travel or space exploration anything that I'll say on anything the the caveat that must be stated is I don't know what the fuck on top yeah I have no educational subjects and I'm merely reiterating things that I've heard people say that's why if you were to say that everyone would think so though yeah that's the problem it's a problem it's off well is especially from wrong and I'm super confident that's all called get started yeah the yeah people are confident people want to listen to them but I'm super honest about what I know what I don't know I dumb fucking as honest as is humanly possible even if it makes you look like an asshole but in in that situation I do know for a fact that when when contrails are more likely there's a map on a NASA website you can go to the NASA's website and they'll show you where contrails will linger in the sky and where they won't in fact in 1942 the government was doing a research project on what they call persistent condensation trails and what they discovered is during various atmospheric conditions whether there's a lot of moisture in the atmosphere or less moisture depending on what what the conditions are it will change the length of the contrails that appear behind jets and when you burn jet fuel it creates moisture and when you create moisture out of that burning jet fuel and it changes the temperature of the air as it passes through like that you literally create a cloud and so when people are looking at that and I think and all the government spraying us with fake clouds it's very easy to think that it's very easy and this does not mean that they haven't done a test Sandri unethical things with spraying aerosols from planes we know they have we know that pesticides are sprayed from planes okay so we're familiar we have that archetype in our head of spraying poison we've seen it the footage from Vietnam where they sprayed Agent Orange to defoliate vast parts and jungles we've seen all that shit so we're wary of things that are sprayed from planes and you should be but you should also know that there is a huge difference between that and what you're seeing in the sky on a regular basis and when you start saying that what you're seeing this guy on a regular basis is the government spraying chemicals you really throw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of them actually spraying chemicals because first of all the the argument is they're spraying of aluminum and Baron again I'm not a scientist I'm half-retarded again took a lot of shots of the head as a youngster but the reality is if they did spray aluminum and barium in the sky it wouldn't linger like a cloud it's lingering like a cloud because it's a cloud and I know a lot of people have invested a long amount of their life wanting to think that what they're seeing is chemicals and so it fucks with you because it's hard to admit that you're wrong it's hard to change gears we all know that correct but in this situation we have to look at it there might be times when someone's spraying something from the sky but the majority of what you're seeing is just a byproduct of a jet engine going through condensation and then there's the reality people say well are they geoengineering no but yes so here's the reality the reality is even though it's just an accidental byproduct of jet travel it does change the environment and it is geoengineering but it's not on purpose on purpose it's just a part of flying if we're gonna have there's ninety-three thousand fucking flights a day worldwide a day so they're burning jet fuel in the sky above your head they're taking toxic fuel in fucking hundred gallon wings full of this shit your wings are filled up with fucking fuel and they're burning that shit up in the sky and creating clouds fuck yeah changes the environment but it's just like pollution changes the environment in LA when you drive it on the highway it's not the government spraying pollution okay it's fucking pollution it's just byproduct of human civilization and a byproduct of air travel is a their burning jet fuel in the sky and B it creates persistent condensation trails under certain atmospheric conditions this is the best that I could discern after research and talking to real experts but this doesn't this is where people go UFO conducive formation urgent Joe Rogan's working for the government you've gotta stop and look at this shit rationally if you're wrong about the majority of what you see in the sky you discredit the possibility the very real possibility that things have been done like there's a study about st. Louis I think of st. Louis hold on let me pull this up st. Louis there was a something that was in the news really recently that they discovered radiation I think chemtrails are just an excuse for pansies I just I'd like to look at clouds and what's unlike like a reasonable man some I'm just curious on what why why some stick around and white and why some don't okay so they're here well this is because of atmospheric conditions there's a difference between sometimes it rains and sometimes it doesn't sometimes there's clouds sometimes there's nothing in the sky that the conditions apparently when it's right before a crowd like it's kind of hazy those are the conditions that are best for creating these persistent condensation trails and people have to understand these are fucking Southwest Airlines flights you're looking at some time you boug these are you know unmarked government planes man do you really know that what kind of fucking area what kind of telescope do you have how much research have you actually done or you like me to just reiterate you that you learn online well doing this show and doing the show on chemtrails more people got fucking mad at me because of chemtrails than anything and I take part of the blame for that one of the reasons why is because I think they did a shitty job of editing it and there's no disrespect but the way the people edit that show they have eight hours of footage they have to slam down to 44 minutes it's hidden to them it wasn't important to totally completely explain what what causes the chemtrail I didn't have a hundred percent say or a contrail rather I didn't have a hundred percent say as to how the show got edited I had say after the fact I would voice my opinion he would get overruled or they would listen to me it was it varied and in this I lost and in this I think we created a bad product I don't think it represented fully the the correct full explanation of what contrails are I think because it's such a complex you I think we owed a very complex and scientific explanation but the problem is people think that sheds boring like what I just said right now the majority of people listening that would watch American Idol we go what the fucking yeah they just stop podcast it's not for everybody you know and this conversation is not for everybody but if you want to make a TV show it kind of has to be for everybody for the network to accept it until it becomes really successful or finds its niche and then people you know like South Park they can do whatever the fuck they want you know cuz it's a proven product if you had another show we tried to make a cartoon where a gay guy stuffing Paris Hilton up his ass and winning a slut off they would go that's the fuck are you talking about no you can't do that but South Park is so successful and it is so proven in the market that they do that well when you shows not proven you really can't it's hard to like have your say as to how things get done it's a complex dance and I don't think we pulled it off but it's part of the thing of creating something with me try to create a show I feel personally responsible for it though because a lot of people got angry and I think a lot of that anger could have been avoided when I first started looking at chemtrails online I too believed that it was a possibility like is it possible to just pull this off right in front of our face they just spraying the sky but they're not the more you look into ego no this photos from 1980 that show these contrails like long ones that lingered in the sky people say when we were younger they didn't linger actually they did you just don't remember attention how much the fuck do you pay attention to clouds are created by jets when you're eight you know do you really tell me exactly what the fuck you saw I barely remember shit I did last week I'm being honest I barely remember important shit I did like shows that I did that we're great I got a standing ovation I barely remember them you tell me you remember this fucking these these these contrails from when you were eight years old you remember the fuck remember that shit do to learn I learned some stuff from Duane bang comm today man the way what would you forget it either man but these these people that I'm talking to there's a problem with doing this show and this is why I don't know if I want to continue doing I mean first of all sci-fi hasn't asked me to do it again but even if they do I have to really think about how it's I don't think I'm doing what I want to do I don't think it's coming out the way I want it to come out it's there's part of it that is like there was an episode we did on transhumanism it's all like complicated the science of extending human life okay I love that because I got to talk to all these super intelligent people and pick their brain and ask really important to me questions I love that but talking to people there tell them they're seeing bulletproof wolves and ghost shit that pops out of there's a wormhole and out came a bulletproof wolf oh that sure happened I'm sure you didn't have a camera and why would you well you're out there hunting for bulletproof wolves I just I got tired of it I got tired of talking to people that are just crazy people or silly people or people that need a fucking hug there's a lot of that oh yeah that's true hundred percent and there's also a lot of people that really believe what they are saying and it's not because they're assholes it's because they lack critical thinking skills whether no-one's taught it to them whether they've ignored them whether it's the way they were raised whether it's the environment that grew up in whether it was the ideas they were exposed to as a young person I don't know what has caused the situation that we're talking about but there's a lot of people out there that are thinking in a very piss-poor way and I've been one of them in the past man I've been I've believed in a lot of stupid shit in the past you know that I I was convinced probably betrayal is a thing I was talk about this a thing called rods these is this fucking they look like jellyfish that fly through the air faster than you could say this whole video on the Roswell bronze then I watch the show called Monster quest what they showed what they really are it's just a video artifact like when you have a camera and it's going on slow motion and something flies past in front of it stretches the image out and make it's a blur it's fucking blur so I was convinced these things were flying through the air all around us because I had seen this video and I was like looking for him dude the guy who made this video does not want to admit that they don't they don't exist not only that he actually showed up at the UFC Expo when I was doing a QA and he asked he got in line and and said he needed to talk to me about Roswell Rodney's come on my podcast because they are real and though those people on Monster quest fucked him and they said I don't know how they could have fucked him because they basically showed the same scene there was a campfire or a light and a bunch of bugs were flying in front of light and they set two cameras in front of it one of them was an HD super fast camera to the use for like super slow-mo and the other one was like a regular video camera well the regular video camera showed these rods they're fly-in a crop because it's an artifact and if you look at how its flying across the video it's not flying that fast like I can see it so how can I not see it with my eyes but I can see it on camera and then the other one just showed it's just bugs what did you see the underwater ones and the space my choice to reveal there is without a doubt um information to government has been hiding dude what you're doing right now is called you're making a plea to ridicule rods are just tiny chemtrails um yeah he thinks they might as well be you know I thought they were real man I really did you know I I saw a video once it showed that they were fucking buildings on the moon like this fish this fucking guy had he like had these images even worse than that how about the face of Mars how about that motherfucker you ever see the face on Mars yeah but this is images that people swear to you the government is basically doctored the second more high-resolution images there was some photos they took like a long time ago of Mars and as they flew over Mars it shows what looks like a five sided pyramid I think and a face a face on Mars absolutely moving even my own friend who I loved dearly Graham Hancock wrote a dumbass book about all this shit I love this friend dearly dumb ass dumb ass but he admits it was a mistake he admits it but shit that shit's important man it's as you clearly it's a face if you look at the shape but does not appear in nature this is either two eyes bitch you don't know what the fuck you're looking at okay you're looking at a spot that you decided it's like looking at the clouds and thinking that you see in Dragons you know you also could be seeing a fucked up cloud because clouds aren't perfect symmetrical squares you shithead alright you're looking at something that you barely tell what the fuck you're looking at clearly for faith on Mars and there's a dude who has these videos where he measures like these arbitrary distances like a few measure from the nose to the left front center of that pyramid it is the exact same distance as the Sphinx to the Pyramid of Giza yeah you know like how the fuck did you come to that conclusion if you look at it from the White House in a 44 inch television in the corner where Clinton used to get his blow jobs that from that room clearly the pyramid has a face on it it looks like numbers on Mars I rest my case and then and people fucking buy the DVD and call each other on the phone and do this shit you got to see this a man is dropping some truth some mad truth about the pyramid and the next thing you know you're getting fucking email blasts have you seen this about the pyramid like you motherfuckers yeah not a fucking face on the Mars there might be but that's not it I mean there might be some other shit it doesn't mean there's not samosa a matter of fact the pyramid shapes on Mars are way more interesting than the the face is the face when they show the high-resolution image of the face these are been doctored clearly doctored these are not high-resolution photographs in fact they are what less than half of the gigabytes and it would be it was a true 85 Gila big old fucking picture but there are some like symmetrical objects that exist that do look like five sorry pyramids like you pull up that kind of images I can see that yeah it's interesting but it's also possible that those things exist naturally there's a lot of weird shapes that exist naturally like there's there's this um I forget what it's called giant something Giant's Causeway I think in Ireland let me think if that's it let me see if that's it but it's this crazy rock formation that's totally natural Ireland IR when I think that's what it is I need to get the images here yeah that's it put go there go go to Giant's Causeway in Ireland now tell me this shit doesn't look like some other fuckers we're building a building but it's not it's not at all it's just some weird crazy natural formation if you saw this on an image of Mars if someone sent you this clearly these are cobblestones on a Martian Street they have cars like arms they're probably shaped like us go to that if you found it look at these images look at the shit look at that where is this this is in Ireland tell me if you saw that on Mars you wouldn't start shitting your pants yeah clearly were a sophisticated civilization that's just natural shit perhaps aliens came down and ruin them took their women look at that I mean that shit looks so Wow that looks so unnatural I represent it looks like someone made a cool ass cobblestone street yeah but it's just a natural formation when these I got on what the fuck causes the stones to be shaped in these weird patterns but look at that if you looked at that you would swear that has to be made by somebody but it's not it's totally natural and you know and there's varying stages of it they can actually see like how its develop someone who understands rocks you're a fucking human being
