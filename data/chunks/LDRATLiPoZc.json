hello freak bitches where I know if you heard of these guys astrophysicist John Matisse and Daniel Whitmore from the University of Louisiana came up with a theory that said that something smaller than a Jovian mass would not be strong enough to perform this task they believe that there's something up to 25% of them okay it's four times as big as Jupiter could be responsible for sending these objects in our direction geez this is just a random theory that these guys put together it wasn't completely accepted what they did what net no no no there's no there's no known such object what you what people are doing and I don't fault them for it it's creative it would make awesome science fiction storytelling is there's something you need to explain here on earth somebody went extinct there is some wave of comets there's some observation that was never repeated there's some thing you got to come up with and so you say well we know the Oort cloud exists we know you can perturb those orbits and and send them careening down towards the inner solar system and those that Jupiter doesn't bat away like batting practice those that get through Jupiter's gravitational shield could wreak havoc on earth yeah yeah but that's it's it's it's it's inventing a lot to explain something you don't know right so it's inventing more of what you don't know that could be true to explain what you don't right that which you don't have any other evidence to support so it's fun speculation fun speculation but beyond that to say oh it's real it must be happening no no it's just let someone write a good sci-fi story on it here's what's fun about it and this is why I bring it up most people I've talked to this about the subject to many many people and I myself personally I'm not immune to this I find it very fascinating however how much have I looked into the actual planets that we absolutely know a real not that much but I'm worried about this fucking fake planet that may or may not exist do they might have found another planet it's this idea of something hidden and mysterious which is so compelling and attractive that's a fascinating psychological observation it's a weird thing we want to believe there's something miss Styria isn't it we don't understand and could be there but we don't know anything about yet where there's plenty of things we do know something about but we want to know more why don't you help yes all right and by the way the universe is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine and so so to say I need your creativity and you know to keep your life interesting no we got black holes that are slaying stars layer by layer we've got do you realize that if you fall into a black hole you will see the entire future of the universe unfold in front of you in a matter of moments and you will emerge into another space-time created by the singularity of the black hole you just fell into you just broke the air after you grow up the Holga and everything so so let's talk about that all right yeah you know why are we wasting time talking about whether the Saturn 5 rocket I mean because we're fascinated by shit that's unproven look mysterious shit look I got a broken brain ok there's a reason for me
