papa no finally we took three boom and we're live Henry motherfucking sudo world champion sir introduce yourself to everybody and Captain America that's right captain the era kalibata seen henry's coach you what do you do with them specifically well I've been with him since 2004 and recently became his coach right before the first Demetrius Johnson fighting and I'm his head coach for MMA and you're in disguise in case some of my other athletes try to swipe you and it's happy Halloween everybody happy Halloween folks so first of all man congratulations on your victory it was it feel like I'm an its size it feels good try to keep this fist away from your face yeah it feels good because it's uh carrots I think as a competitor you you live for these moments you live you live for these fulfillments you know yeah I think somebody like and then I tell people since beginning it wasn't so much you know the UFC bell but it was because it was I made it about dimitra's and it was about to meet race wells I mean he is widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter ever and you're the first guy not only to beat him but the first guy who not just to beat him but beat him in like 11 years but the first guy to win an Olympic gold medal in wrestling and a UFC championship I mean those are two gigantic accomplishments you know for sure it's almost like God it's it's I beat the greatest of to me the greatest of all time and then on top of that I'd be you know I I can I can make the run for you know who's the greatest combat athlete of all time you know like it's a I'm a two-sport world champ I'm just like yeah I mean you're absolutely in the running now I mean if he's not the greatest of all time I think he is but the argument is that he didn't face people as good as Jon Jones faced and then fade or is the other fade or and Anderson silver are the other people that are in consideration for the grace of all time I mean it's it's just a subjective argument I mean who knows who's right but obviously you beat without a doubt one of the best yeah yeah and like I would I would tell people there's there's a bit of a VAD narration that I had for dimitra's Johnson like I was uh it was it was like you know you're fighting to do that's that's that almost seems untouchable that you a guy that makes you question yourself like whoa this is this is this this guy is that good well what's crazy is you beat him after he had stopped you just how long was it two years yeah but close to about two and a half years ago now yeah about it was like I think two years in like four months that's that's an amazing turnaround between getting stopped in the first round and then coming back and and beating him and then beating him in the championship round so it's really what you pulled it off yeah yeah you know and absolutely I had studied Demetrius Johnson like I seen as I lost him the first time what I pretty much did is I got I got rid of a lot of people including my my MMA head coach I just my whole philosophy was if I can't be the best and there's something wrong you know emotionally physically everything I was just invested and when I lost I'm just like man I I I need a I'm looking for a better leader you know and and that's kind of what I did I ended up you know letting go a lot of my cornermen you know sorry traveling the world went out to Singapore went out to to Thailand went out to to the Netherlands spend months and months at a time I out in Brazil like I I was on a quest it was like the kind of remembers a little like Ash Ketchum from Pokemon like I was just an adventurer do not know I do Vision Quest yeah and that's and a big like I said it became an accession I knew that if anybody could do it it'd be it'd be Henderson like I really did it even after the first time Joe when he beat me I still when they asked me is like Henry you know like I would I was like guys I don't know but I still know that I could beat him even be knocked out like two minutes and 36 seconds like I still knew in my heart and you see when I said at their press conferences I know I'm still the wannabe don't what was it about him that made you think that you could beat him what was it about you specifically in relation to him and his skillset it was I I asked me what the difference yeah well what was it that made you think even after he stopped you in the first round oh god I think it was more so just believing in my and my ability I think me just believing more okay Henry you need time like I was only doing MMA for three years when I fought him the first time yeah a lot of people don't know that yeah this years you see you fighting for the title not once but twice you probably been doing MMA for a long last time but when you fought them for the first time it's a very that's a very short amount of time to be fighting in MMA it's especially getting to calibre added like dimitra's what year did you win the Olympics and oh wait yeah see that is I mean when you're doing that you're 100% dedicated to wrestling you have to be right so were you doing any striking training at all back then um I did I did what happened was once I won the Olympics almost kind of I fell out of love with the sport I fell I fell out of love with Russ and I remember being at the Olympics and being like man I just I don't know if I have it in me no more just cuz you're burnt out I was yeah actually my whole childhood was gone because of the sport you know that crazy mascot anyway I was waiting for you to say that so you fell out of love with it I fell out of love with business which is it just because your whole life had been dedicated to wrestling yeah you finally achieved the greatest of great goals yeah Olympic gold medalist is the top of the mountain no but check this out Joe and it was like in the year 2007 man I went through the worst year ever like I was ready to become a world champion and I went out to the world champions in 2007 and I didn't even score a point like in the first round like I got put out by by Iran and for some buddies in that whole year man I was just going through frickin struggles like left and right you're talking about just that versatile don't want to turn him in to save my life what was it I don't know I don't know I I truly truly don't know I think I was I think I probably began kind of falling out of love with it and I remember there's to me there was only two tournaments that everyone wanted to win that was that was the Olympic Trials and eventually the Olympic Games and and somehow like because I'm correlating this with what the fight with Demetrius Johnson and I remember you know just just almost being in in tears like I just don't know if this is for me and but I just stuck with it I stuck with it I ended up winning the Olympic Trials I ended up going to the you know the Olympic Games and ended up pretty much falling behind in every single match that I was wrestling in so these are kind of the adversities that I was going through likely not to become an Olympic champion you know it's interesting when you were fighting Demetrius for the second time Daniel Cormier said something very interesting he said most guys he goes I would never give a chance you you get stopped by DJ and then a couple years later you're fighting him again like he's gonna have your number he's gonna be better in the rematch and he goes but Henry cejudo is a different kind of athlete and he talked about you competing and then coming back a year later and and being he goes he was many times better he goes the the amount of improvement that he got in just one year was just unbelievable he and I think you know I guess you could know that to genetics no I think you could talk a lot about desire to just having that this is X only so far yeah but at the Olympics has great genetics for sure but it's almost it almost becomes a mentality I'm because of philosophies like you almost start doing things almost like to not feel that to not him to not feel the the pain of losing hmm like that's a motivator to not feel the pain of losing right and I remember when dimitra's Johnson hit me hit me in the hit me in the leg and I'd literally I hunt any pony how severe was like I literally sprained like a severe low ankle spring those first 30 seconds in the second fight yeah so I fought dimitra's Johnson like that but it was it was to me the motivator was like man I don't want to feel that pain of losing no more mm-hmm I hated him and I hate feeling second place I hate feeling kind of kind of somebody's looking over me someone's almost like a manhood challenge and I hate that was it a low leg kick that uh that the major your ankle go like what was it yeah it was there's a nerve that you had behind like the bone it's upper I think it's the real perfect for the owner of P er yeah and I got hit there so I put my foot to sleep just like when Michael Chandler happened to him in Bellator same thing exactly stepping on and it's just not working in the product and and and the reason reason why everybody kind of got scared I'm because I was I was hurt but I remember before the fight I remember I remember I saw my corner man like kind of before I fought the meat remember I saw him all I saw him on nervous and never see I remember grabbing my quarterman and putting him right in front of me I'm ever telling Jose hey guys I've been here before like I was ranked 31st in the world i bi I know I came a world champion in wrestling like guys like yeah I want you guys to have a little faith in the Indian but I'm gonna ask you guys one thing and I'm gonna ask you guys I'm gonna ask you guys to be composed I said the key to winning this fight this for me to be composed and then pretty much there's six hours later they right before you know walk on they start playing my song I look back at my corner and I said uh and I said guys I said the key to this fight remember gonna be composure so when Demetrius Johnson kicked me like I I believed in my own philosophy I went back to alright my composure because I was heard so like he could have stopped me that first round I was forces with southpaw which I never fight in southpaw you know so now I'm kind of mean give me a Johnson are playing poker my whole philosophy and the key to this victory was a composure part and when he hit me I really did I was like oh my god it not again not again I'm not gonna last two minutes in 36 seconds not again but again the motivator was not to feel the pain to lose again grind like it wasn't desire to win I was like I just want to feel that pain anymore as a competitor as somebody that that that's on a mission do that sacrifice his life explain to someone who's never experienced that before what is that pain like but you train for how many weeks and then you fight Mighty Mouse with the title get stopped in the first round what is that pain oh man it's I think every fighter has a spirit like what is the spirit the spirit is your the spirit is your dream this bird is that you know you've watched somebody become a world champion you want to be a I want to be just like that guy your confidence your self-esteem that's the that's your spirit and that's you well so we also have a spirit of award that's like the the manhood side of it and what happens when I got stopped with Demetrius Johnson's - I almost felt like and I've never gone through this not even in wrestling my life like I was like my spirit was shot and I had to kind of pick up my pieces kind of start healing myself like mentally and I feel like if he sin if you look at a job somebody like Roy Jones jr. he got knocked out one time and it became a domino effect you know because he never he never picked up those pieces he never started healing that spirit well he got knocked down again real bad right afterwards by Glen Johnson - remember there's two - knockouts in a row however yeah Tarver K Odom and then right and but the thing is there's a lot of factors involved in that loss because I think Roy was also coming off of the John Ruiz fight where he gained a lot of weight to get up to heavy weight and then he had to lose that weight to get down the light heavyweight again so he was lean at heavy weight and then all sudden he's dropping down to 175 pounds again and he just looked like shit he looks smooth it looked like his body was all sucked in and I just think it was a bad bad way cut and you know I think whatever he took to get himself up to 200 pounds - was probably out of his system and now his body was you know his hormones are probably all fucked up it just wasn't the same I mean this let's be real right that we important you don't just grow to 200 pounds without some Mexican supplements it'll take a long fucking time for 168 pounds to get up to 200 pounds it takes a long time if you want to really get up to 200 pounds like an actual 200-pound body not just like fill yourself up with water and fat no did to actually be 200 pounds the way he was yeah your body's got a your body's got to say hey man we need to fucking grow we got resources that need to be allocated towards muscle we got a we got to gained all this weight because we're we're lifting weights all the time we're doing things you have to do something to get your body that heavy so then all something to shut that shit off and say all right now we're getting down to 175 and you got to do in a few months I think his body was just wrecked yeah yeah boxers don't always cut weight the right way either neither do the main fighters oppa Tara back in the day theirs which is really interesting about the approach that you guys took to this camp that you wanted to talk about which is a very very scientific approach towards your recovery towards your training methods so it's everything I mean you you really had it dialed in as opposed to just trying to wing it which for many many years was how almost every fighter did it yeah and and I think it's how we got a video look at this like that that is so crazy just one shin to the look you know I'm still flapping I'm still flopping yeah so I'm going back to that philosophy composure look I'm still flopping but it doesn't seem like he understands what's happened to you yet yeah you know you you played poker so well really interesting yeah look I'm still Oh as soon as that happened I did remember the Michael Chandler fight and I remember he went on a show and said exactly what happened so I told our other corner Santino DeFranco when we get in put ice on his knee not his ankle because it was the knee where it happened cuz I watched that show and I remember watching it for that reason to wonder why what happened to him it's crazy when you watch it because it's just the foot hit the back of your knee yeah you know you can see it again I mean it wasn't even the hardest kick in the world he kind of caught you at the very end with his foot and immediately that nerve just went bony on an annoying right here swap work right there right barely right you know who had also happened to was a Scott Jorgensen did it what fight was that man you know what I can't remember but he didn't win the fight I can tell you that yeah anyways it was a terrible feeling terrible terrible feeling Wow you poker face your way through it but again Joe like it goes back to philosophy like you gotta believe in your you got you got to be up here there has to be a philosophy up here you against a guy like they meet you like there's the it's it's beyond the physical and the technical stuff yeah like you got to be you got to be just kind of hypnotized up here you have to have everything right you have to have the physical skills but you also have to have this and unstoppable mindset yeah now what do you what kind of mind training do you do do you do do any visualization training or do you work with a sports psychologist or um you know what I uh I like I like reading up on a lot of people's stories I think people's stories are the ones that are that intrigue me you know how you know how Michael Jordan rose to the top or at least like that I think I think that's the stuff that I like a human-interest that's kind of my motivation like reading biographies reading biographies are watching watching stuff on YouTube like oh you know watching like even watching even watching other sports like I watch Michael Johnson's at times you know watching the Wonder 96 Olympics mm-hmm like things like that and watching people's celebrations and and and trying to embrace the feeling of what they're feeling you know cuz it becomes like an addiction I could draw like going through these feelings of like did I accomplish what I what I set out to do right so you like seeing them accomplish these fantastic goals and visualizing yourself experiencing that exact same thing yeah yeah as corny as that sounds yeah doesn't sound corny about not coming from the champ you know once you the champ all that corny shits out the window works people start believing it all of a sudden I became a 10 fuck now they're talking about you possibly fighting TJ Dillashaw for the bantamweight title uh yeah yeah - Tong this talk you know are you just hesitating that let's not just talk he wants it we want it yeah no I'm sure where's that out right now because there's gonna be a card in January out here and has just announced oh well wouldn't what date was that it's the same night as the phaidor Ryan Bader fight which pisses me off because I wanted to go see that fight yeah January 26 yeah that fight is gonna be at the Forum and the UFC fight I think is at the stable Center or maybe Anaheim Anaheim Anaheim Anaheim in the pond okay both here both here in California well just 20 million motherfuckers in California plenty of people go around yeah audience yeah though we've we've I think there's been talks but it's been you know you know we I don't think I'll Lee my manager has really truly like actually sat down and talked with the UFC I think I think everybody wants to do it though well it's one of two things is gonna happen there right it's either I mean now the DJ has gone to one Demetrius Johnson just left the UFC and went over to one Fc in a one Fc for people who have no idea what we're talking about is a gigantic organization in Asia they are literally the equivalent to the UFC in Asia and although many people in America are not aware of them they don't know who they are they're a huge organization overseas absolutely gigantic and they do a fantastic job they have real high-level fighters Ben Askren was their champion he was undefeated over there and he had I think at least one fight maybe two fights left in his contract I forget how many and they made a deal and the deal was they take Mighty Mouse and we get Ben Askren and so that's where it's at right now I love the deal I love it I love the idea of it I mean I feel like Mighty Mouse you know he he loves the idea of starting new and a new organization and you know they're gonna hae that motherfucker nice how this fly we need to get paid exactly and he also likes the mentality that that organization is operated with which is respect for the martial arts they're not into this you know what we saw with the Conor McGregor khabib nurmagomedov fight all the trash talking and all the other stuff that you're seeing that was becoming more and more prevalent in the UFC you you don't see that at all at one Fc and that's something that Mighty Mouse is very happy yeah I think first I think congratulations to the Ben Askren I think he's everybody's in trouble yeah you're like why can't I get up yeah but Nash was one of those guys that he's very uh he's a very confident he's a very dangerous human being because he knows that he's gonna be very confident about yeah and um I've always told people it says hey dude maybe the best in the world is on the UFC man there's there's some dude but Ben Askren that would take people think of Biebs or control was good up top you wait till you get a you know four time and see finalist to time and see chap on top you better think that I was an eighth Olympian his teammate yeah and and Olympian I mean the dude is he's a bad matchup for anybody Joe anybody know Ben Askren I mean there's a reason why he's undefeated and he hasn't been hit in several fights who was detailing moment the last time he got hit you know I had him on the podcast because I wanted to let people know about him I mean I've been a big fan of fan of ban aspirins from back when he was a Bellator champion and if you watch his fights in Bellator against chorus cough and yeah and Lima Lima is a beast man and he just dominated them just controlled me the Lima fucks people up man Lima is a dangerous dangerous cat and Ben Askren just whoop oh you're on your back again look at that yeah I can't get up and you taking punches you know and he's uh it's just a different caliber of wrestling and I've said it many many times and I but I'm sure you believe it as well it's the most important skill for MMA is wrestling it's it dictates where the fight takes place if you want to stand up you give the guy can take you down Chuck Liddell style and if you want to go to the ground you're the one who gets to dictate where the fight takes place that's if you're the superior wrestler I mean it's the the best base for MMA I really believe that and especially a guy like Banks I think Ben knows that his his strikings not that good right so he just relies on this is ah this is what I know I do it better than anybody and I'm gonna control you this is and you're gonna know how I'm gonna do it you know so that's what that's what makes Ben Askren dangerous he's so dangerous I mean a real bad fight for him would be someone that can figure out how to keep it standing like Jay here on gave him a real tough fight in Bellator because Jay here on is good wrestler and kept the fight standing free bomb high school I forget what it would his take on that fight was we talked about it on the podcast but I don't think he was too happy with his training for that fight but you know someone like tyron woodley who's also a very good wrestler who's a very dangerous striker would be a tough matchup for him but they're really close friends and training partners yeah well this is another thing too on the flip side is like Terrans been wrestling him since four years I think mm-hmm so he knows what the Ben Askren experience is you know scary yeah I mean people would be lucky to you know kind of take him down if you really want to give it an old take does he wouldn't he just wouldn't let people take him down yeah Pettis was talking about it you know he's saying listen who's back when Pettis was a champ he said if I was forced to fight Ben Askren he goes it would be a fucking terrible fight for me then was to win a belt the 2008 Olympic team would have five belts Henry gets two DC has two and and Ben Askren we'd have one that's five UFC belt if if he came into the UFC and won a belt his teammates well they are gonna open up eventually that 165 pound division which is what Ben is shooting for Ben would like that division you know and if he said that if you know he had 165 and tire and kept a Walter Wade title that would be great for him I just don't see the UFC doing a 5 pound weight difference when all the weight differences are so huge I feel like the smart move would be 10 pounds every spot 35 45 55 65 75 like move 70 to 75 like when the UFC had a light heavyweight division initially that the division was a 200 pound division when Tito Ortiz first wanted I believe it was 200 pound division and then they raised it up to 205 and I think just and they needed a 195 to I've really believed and probably a 225 you know I think that would that would round it all out which probably will all happen eventually yeah yeah it's it's interesting to see how that how that unfolds but as of now it's man Askren she's actually gonna be fighting for the belt pretty soon well he's calling out Darren till he wants to fight Darren does a classic Stryker versus grappler matchup especially after Tyron just smashed him I mean Tyron end the hype train prepare until we learned a lot about Darren Darren is a sensational striker very very dangerous striker but keeps his hands low keeps his chin up high and you know Tyron has proved himself to be really dangerous even against elite strikers you know you look at the wonderboy fights I've said this time and time again you look at those two fights wonderboy is known as being one of the best strikers to ever compete in the UFC he's got a crate I think it was 57 and Oh as a kick box or something fucking spectacular like that amazing striking skills but yet Tyron hurt him in both fights both fights Tyron was the one who landed big shots and had wonderboy badly hurt and then you look at the the same thing with Darren till Darren tills known as being this unbelievable striker Tyron Clips him drops him and then strangles him so you know it all changes with MMA these guys could be these guys can be the best even the best wrestlers like sometimes it isn't translate to the sport like it takes a special somebody to adapt to the sport of MMA not just a wrestler yeah and I think Terran has has adapted to his time to his right hand you know man if you're able to take out two strikers like that I you're the real deal he's only questionably the real deal I'm fascinating to see whether or not nurmagomedov and Ben Askren go at it I had a fight that I really what he's had enough stop with all that nonsense I guess what we were talking about it's not gonna happen he has the same agent listen but but khabib is much more of a grappler than he is then he is a striker I mean Connor is a striker that sort of made sense if you want to talk about levels I think Ben's I think been subpar be the better the better grappler who the fuck knows that's what I want to see no I was like even though like they don't get black belts and Rossi and there's there's there's levels - yeah there's a lot and I think Ben ashlynn was one of the greatest folk star riders of all time like that's how they is yeah he was putting the best the best kids in the world and pretzels and submissions they just wouldn't get out of his yeah he's like a boa constrictor well he's he's stunning in his ability to control guys like you like what the fuck man like chorus cough I mean and Lima are two great examples cuz you look at those guys in Bellator and they just smash people but the chorus cough has one of the craziest spinning back-kick knockouts I've ever seen in my life he sent this dude flying through the air did you see that like a couple of fights ago and the Grand Prix yeah fuckin nasty he hits his dude with a spinning back kick and literally like launches him into space and then smashes him when he goes down to the ground I mean you look at what Lima has been able to do to people when the Rory MacDonald fight was a very close fight look at this watch this look at this that dude Boise I don't know where that was but so chorus cough you know if you watch the chorus cough fight with with Ben Askren and it's a mauling it's it's it's just a guy I'm just getting fucked up that's what that fight is Ben Askren just dominated him like absolutely dominate him see the dude tried to jump back and landed it landed right as he was in the air ouchy Wow yeah and knowing better it was and this guy never got a punch off of banana it was it was a total domination same as the Lima fight Lima crushes people man Lima is one of the scariest strikers I mean he knocked out course cough I mean Lima smashes people but we see Lima against Ben Askren I mean obviously was a younger Lima I mean he's got more experience now but the difference was so stunning what do you what is this no it's not no no is it two Chinese guys this is not a screen you lose your patience man there it is there it is man I mean just the way he manhandled them like his wrestling is just you see guys that are used to defending takedowns then they find themselves on their back and you say holy shit man I think he did get up kicked here and his nose got broke oh yeah he got cracked I mean he leave us a fucking monster man he's a super dangerous striker and he's huge for the weight class you stand next to Lima you like Jesus how do you make 170 he struck he doesn't and jacuzzi at the hotel seen him yeah no he's struggling to make that weight he's a big guy but anyway point being Ben Askren at 170 super super interesting fight I would like that the personally the fight that I would like to see I like to see him and him and Kobe Kobe Covington Ben and Kobe yeah that would be really interesting yeah I think but isn't Colby next in line for the title I mean I think he's got the interim belt if he has the interim barrel support I'm surprised so how house White House doesn't anymore it's in the white house but I mean did they didn't strip him did they cuz there was some talk of stripping him because he was supposed to be not that I know of I don't think there was ever a strip so I think they're I think they're trying to market yes I think as soon as you get the champ Wikipedia here says he was the interim from June 9th to September 8th oh so they did strip him also they did so the stripping was because they wanted him to fight on the Dare until card when Darren till fought Tyron they wanted him to fight tyrant and apparently he had gone through you know hard training camp he was all busted up he needed time to recover so I guess they stripped him yeah that hold man interim titles interim titles are like attached with Velcro they just disappear they're not really they're not really like especially that you see 2:29 I mean they all had about stuff tonio Ferguson had about Connor had about you know obviously could be had his bells we had three people walking around the Tony Ferguson one to me is a shame it's a shame that a God gets injured and then they strip him like that that doesn't make any sense to me I didn't like that one that one bothered me I feel like Tony should still have the interim title I really do yeah but that was like the third time that if I'd have I know it sucks but the other one wasn't his fault the other one was khabib could be bright could be was supposed to make the weight and two-to-one could be pull out and how many times - Tony pull out so he pulled out once for sure because he was injured the last one when the his knee blew apart and then khabib definitely got yanked off the card let's code the wait line the wait cut remember yeah way cut was so bad that his kidneys were failing mmhmm yeah either way we've been there yeah dad that's the fight now do you do you like fighting at 35 because I know you fought at 35 for a while when you were struggling to make flyweight you have you had some issues early on in your career where you really didn't make the weight very well yeah I was uh god I was I was getting older I think in my career I think the reason why I started having weight problem was because of I was just getting older and I was doing some crazy stuff like I used to cut like just Mike like I used to I used to I used to to cut about 16 pounds like in two two-hour sessions yeah as a flyweight or supposed to be flyaway why are you doing that because I felt like because I'm a wrestler I think my whole philosophy at first when i when i got into MMA was kind of like i in russia we would never get the same recovery I know it's stupid as stupid as heck but we wouldn't we would we would never get the recovery that a fighter gets so to me was like dude I can I can stretch this as as long as I can and and I can suffer the day of wins but I'm recovered within twenty four twenty twenty eight hours sometimes you know so to me I I was looking at it a very just at an odd way so this finally started catching up to me so you just had confidence and your body's ability to bounce back even though you're putting it through an extraordinary amount of stress in losing massive amounts of weight really quickly yeah just felt like your body could handle it you tough you're used to it yeah it was it was the whole cuz you know in wrestling we would make weight like every uh every every week sometimes it would Russell so much that we're worried used to kind of like that whole that whole struggle side of things and then okay be Russell game would do it again what kind of weight cut we're talking about when you're wrestling how much were you covering um and that was a lot more discipline then but I was probably doing about 12 pounds but I had no fat like that at that time I was eating just as healthy and as clean as possible because I would make weight every every every you know every three weeks out of turn you know I had George Lockhart on and he was explaining to me that a lot of people think that when you cut weight that you know like you're cutting out fat he's like you're not cutting out fat you're cutting out water and it actually helps to have more muscle because muscles mostly water so you're just draining out your muscles then replenishing them you know when he was explaining that to me I was like I've never really thought about that way like a guy like a Yoel Romero who's very muscular can actually cut more away yeah yeah now you're a pretty muscular guy for a flyweight so you were walking around how many pounds over man I was I was probably cutting for like maybe it's one 25 Wow so you're walking around like 150 yeah I'm getting down to 25 yeah holy shit I just I just had lost I just you know a lot of it to you because you fight three times a year like you're not always you're not always honest with your diet either you know come from coming from Mexican descent we like to we love to eat my mom's house and it's gonna be lay down but when you're in camp how do you organize your nutrition oh this I'm disciplined I have I have a meal prep company they deliver my food like every three like every three days and as your meal prep based on your suggestions to them or your recommendations and directions to them ya know a lot of us based on kind of well my diets just according to kind of like my training schedule so Mike my training is very very organized like now Joe I'm like a pretty much I'm on I'm on I'm a professional now I guess you could say like I I do things you know the right way I used the whole scientific route the nutrition routes just uh almost like how burn our hot beans kind of as he got older man he kind of changed his whole philosophy started using science more I think everything now in my life when I get ready for fights is all based on us all based on science how did Barnard change his training do you know um he just started recovering more I think he started using a lot of those neural stems hyperbaric chambers think things of that man things of that matter and just more scientific base like just his whole training I like all around and did you incorporate any of those methods I did I did actually I ended up you know connecting with this connecting with this company called neural force one you know science space company and I actually wanted to bring them in to kind of to kind of talk about it Joe because this right here might just changed my my whole philosophy we're talking about the whole week how the whole way way cuz how I struggled to to how my whole chain has changed because of because of because of science hmm and a science that's very uh that a science that's very I guess complex you could say you gotta have like the right people man like dictating your schedule so when you set up a training camp like this how far in advance do you sit down and work out all the details it's almost like the the morning that we wake up is what we know we're gonna do but but how like say if you know you have a fight in July when would you start preparing for that and when do you sit down and map everything out well we try to map things out maybe about three months in advance kind of like a preparation and to leading to the camp and that's kind of like the phase that we're on now like now we're all not you know if I fight if it is an F fight in January it's almost like our schedule it's like there's there's there's a pretest to the big test so tomorrow's November 1st so if you were getting ready for a fight in January you would start ramping up somewhere around now yeah but it would it would it would be more of yeah we would I think the first the first month leading up to the next eight weeks would be a lot of it would be a technical and tactical just working on those particular areas that were booked that we believe we're gonna be in so you're not doing anything crazy strength and conditioning wise you're not trying to break your body down no no it could because it's all it's all a learning phase at that point you know working the body preparing the body with a lot of body motion movements and things of that matter kind of just bringing more circulation to certain parts of my body then rather than you know somebody picking up a kettlebell and throwing it and and crazy things like that like it like it it's all it's all sports like specific Brian right range of motion so how do you organize this I kind of what who what is the team of people that you use and like who's responsible for what yeah well like I said I think cuz that whole crew in the back the man in America is with you but you get the rest of the Avengers are all waiting in the waiting room yeah I was gonna say we first found him when he hurt his hand and he had to rehab it I'll see his going in layers going so he had hurt his hand before his first fight with Sergio Pettis and I was trying to find any way for him to still compete and we found somebody using this machine which led us to actually neuro Force One and Kareem and all these guys and we tried to force it for him to get back in time and I have video of him just screaming in pain trying to get there and we thought we stayed off it for a couple weeks and then the day of the faceoff he went to cut weight and he said his wrists kept slipping out and we had a poem from the five you want to see the doctor doctor said it no way shouldn't fight so what was the injury I think it was a it ended up being something with sprained ligament yeah I think it was I had sprain like one of my ligaments in my hand so there's just there's nothing I could do like I would I would I would open the cap bottle for the you know it's kind of to brush my teeth and like it when I hurt - that poor I'm just like man I can't do anything so the night that you know I ended up far they ended up Eric here and that have connected me with with neural force and found out that they had like these certain machines that help you heal faster and what did the machines do accelerated recovery so it was like neuro stem and they have about a thousand programs on it and they just forced him to to recover a lot faster the the best example was UFC fighter Pantoja he was on Ultimate Fighter 24 with us our number one seed that we picked Alexander Pantoja I saw him blow three ligaments out of his elbow and he started crying because he had a fight in eight weeks and iearnt know Scotland and um I said no no don't go home tomorrow he's supposed to be going back on to Brazil and I said no no no let's try this you gotta try it and they did it twice two sessions a day for ten days and he went back and he and he fought he fought that guy in beat him he were naked choking that guy Neil Cirie and put that guy in retirement so after that I was like but if we need these guys Henry whatever these guys did to Pantoja whatever that we need to do it for you so what's how it started when a guy gets injured like that and you you're still going through camp how do you work around that injury just say okay there's nothing squeezing nothing were you putting any strain in those tendons nothing where you're doing anything with that hand that's gonna reinjure it I think you just have to hope for somebody to wrap it very well but they're screwed you know having like a hand injury like the probably the worst injury you could have I mean we we eat with these hands you know right this is our that's how we survive you know and when you have an injury like that there's you gonna be fighting with the other do you remember when you ride faber fought Mike Brown mm-hmm and broke both hands yeah just start throwing elbows and slapping up it just didn't give in for a second yeah that's how tough that motherfucker is two broken hands trying to find a way to win yeah it's miserable that's a yeah it was a title fight too yep yep you do mainly things for title fight yeah no but III wanted to bring in Joe if you allow me I'm good because I'm honored man and I think I think III brought them enjoy because I want them kind of share you know kind of like the New Age stuff like something that's just taken over the top mm-hmm okay Kevin area if you can hear me come down can there's a bit long delay there's like a 30-second delay you can go grab them okay I'll grab ya go grab him captain he's gonna come back with a new layer he's gonna come back naked we don't have another microphone unfortunately so he's gonna have to take your spot is not another microphone nikka Captain America man when we use a fourth microphone we actually have to set it up and snot up right now and so what do you think of Captain America he's hilarious you know how you are with uh with Eddie that's kind of how how he you know no it's that certain relationship yeah hey man that helps how are you sir well good how you doing Joe tell everybody who you are I mean I'm Kevin Longoria I am the chief science officer for neuro Force one you go and then I'm a neurophysiologist as well so keep this about like a fist from your face okay so um tell us what your role was in camp and what you did to help him get ready go yes so uh neuro Force one is a neuroscience based training company and a medical grade diagnostic testing company as well where you guys we're at Scottsdale Arizona so what we really focus on which a lot of companies aren't talking about is the role of the gut in the mind in conjunction with your physical training so essentially what we do is we start off with a really comprehensive baseline assessment we want to run them through everything so the traditional functional threshold powers autonomic nervous system DC brain potentials really what you want to do is you want to put somebody on a on a normal curve what is a DC brain potential DC brain potentials daniel cormier yes a little bit but basically it's an objective measurement of your central nervous system so you can actually your central nervous system is basically the data aggregator if you will so it has to take information from your metabolic systems your autonomic s-- kind of coordinate things like neuromuscular and metabolic efficiency that's kind of the data center if you will so this is a measurement of potential basically how much energy you have in the central nervous system to go coordinate narrow muscular and metabolic efficiencies which is really what we focus on so so is this on like a chart are you getting it like is there a number reading that you're getting like what is it that correct specifically for DCs it's going to be in millivolts and then you just compare that to normative ranges but most importantly what it is is trending data over time this is an assessment that we would do on Henry every single morning it's a home test kit we really believe in just collecting as much data as possible and trending data that way when you see a change essentially get predictability in terms of now today is a no-go day because central nervous system is diminished we're just going to be going through the motions we're not going to make physiological adaptations and your inflammation is really high no-go because we're not going to go risk injury when we can't make adaptations so this is a measurement we would do every single morning where we can look at anomic nervous system which is basically things like recovery sympathetic parasympathetic balance DC brain potentials and metabolic systems what is what is measuring all these things is their device yeah yeah this is a pretty amazing device we actually got it from the UFC Performance Institute you know shoutout to those guys Clint bow and Roman over there set us up with this technology it's a basically a chest strap that does heart rate variability so time and frequency domain analysis and then it does DC brain potential so a little sticker right here on your forehead basically four minutes you just kind of relax and we collect pretty amazing data and it breaks it down into four different categories what's called windows of trainability so it says today we should focus on strength and power or skill acquisition based on metabolic readiness autonomic readiness and DC brain potentials so what is our body primed to go do today because if you're not primed your nervous system doesn't have the energy it's going to be going through the motions so you're sort of there to dictate when it's gonna be a hard day when it's gonna be an easy day correct yeah and that's something as you I'm sure you guys know in wrestling it's it's always hard always let's go so this was a little bit of an issue in the camp at the very beginning if you could imagine henry wakes up it's a sparring day where maybe even supposed to do two a days he wakes up feeling really good and nervous system is out of whack it's like sorry man I know you feel good but you're not you know yeah so we would go a no-go that day and you know as you could see it all worked out in the long run it worked out fantastic but was that weird for you to feel good and then to be told you got to chill out yeah yeah there was it almost takes a while to kind of adapt but I started as I started recognizing like my body change and how I felt in sparring or how they were and how kind of I just felt recovered I was like God this is this is crazy like I didn't run at all this whole camp so do you get a baseline off of this - Erik you gotta stop moving around you're freaking me out he's doing hand signals back to me so what do you do a baseline on this before you get started and then you as before camp get started and then when camp starts ramping up then you start measuring all the various details correct yeah so we do a comprehensive baseline assessment including the Omega wave as well as you know six or eight hours of other testing everything that you could think of Under the Sun and we put together basically columns of this is what your suboptimal at this is what your average at this is what your really damn good at so basically what we want to do is explore your functional strengths it's what you're good at but then we also want to focus on your functional deficiencies in a sport like MMA we also sometimes have the advantage of looking at your opponent and making certain assumptions in terms of their weaknesses their strengths going against somebody like DJ you don't you don't really have that advantage so we really needed to focus on is what Henry is really good at his ground game you look you know we're doing nervous system assessments while he's on the ground his sparring partners or stress systems are going like crazy he's calming down because this guy likes to be on the floor rolling around so we pinpoint these little strategic to strengths and deficiencies and then we target all of this nutrition supplementation a big thing that we focus on is nutrient timing something that's not really talked about as well but when you're talking about gut health and you know recovery managing that the hormones associated with exercise you got to be getting in the right nutrients in your your energy and a Baalak and growth phases so for nutrient timing you're talking about like when you're actually eating and what you're eating so you're planning that out as well a hundred percent yeah so we put together a nutrition program and because training varies every morning we're deciding what we're going to do for the day it's completely dynamic so we're kind of reinventing the game of periodization and programming because you can't give somebody an eight-week plan you have to check every single day this is how you stay very dynamic and you avoid plateaus and just the issues you know it's always going to lead to suboptimal performance if you're programming out so every day we adjust you know we're doing this intensity of training we did a vo2 max assessment so we know exactly how much glycogen you're burning at various levels of intensity we do heart rate tracking during your training all right this is exactly what you have to replace following so I'm standing on the sidelines you know after every practice mixing up custom supplements for him as well so this is something what kind of stuff um you know we have our own supplement line right now frankly not because the world needed another supplement line it's not really what our goal was in in sports like this you have to be so careful what you're putting these guys body so we just went the route of going GMP certified wada you saw it approved on everything we do eventually we want to you know try and work with the baddest company because we're not we don't want to be in the supplement game for us it was just quality control so being a nervous system based company obviously we're doing things like omega-3 DHA s BCAAs you don't have to maintain put on a little bit of muscle we do a lot a big one I believe in the generation you can the super starch very good without a big glycemic and a big insulin response but very good at replenishing your glycogen stores following to minimize cortisol and inflammatory responses and things like that so every day it's a little bit different but yeah we ended up going with our own line and one of the biggest things that we we never really talked about in the fight as well is the role that gut health plays so that's something Henry does year-round regardless of when we're fighting is take our line which is called freedom cleanse restore this is world renowned you know utilized by university researchers all around the world right now and basically it's all just about restoring good gut bacteria prebiotics probiotics like some lymphatic cleansing and this is gonna be something I'm that really played a big role in his weight cut as well it's kind of a missing link that athletes aren't talking about but good gut health is gonna help with serotonin productions a recovery relaxation mood you know production of brain-derived neurotropic factors so our nervous system can make these adaptations and learn new skills and things along these lines so this is something you know in my opinion a big reason why you know he had the issue with DJ the first time around Henry Henry will tell the story like he had got inflammation so bad that people would say good luck before the fight tap his gut and and that hurt him you know that's not normal and that all goes back to the issues associated with weight cutting as we were talking about a little bit but getting that gut health right no inflammation and that goes a long way no how long have you guys been in business for we've only been in business for about eight months we're still very new I've been working with Henry a little bit longer than that um but yeah this company's just getting off the ground we kind of rebranded a few months ago just opened our first facility as well out in Scottsdale what is your background in I'm an I'm a physiologist I would open the first mobile medical grade diagnostic testing company in Arizona so basically I would have these Diagnostics and largely it was trying to try to fix the healthcare system a little bit you know we want individualized solutions we want data-driven outcomes right you want quantifiable progress so people want to feel good about what they're doing but maybe a doctor can't afford this big-ass metabolic cart or they don't know how to use it so what I did is I purchased this equipment hired technicians and we would bring it mobile now technology is getting smaller more mobile so this was my idea of how I would go make my little dent in the healthcare system you know there were issues with scalability in terms of finding good technicians but the goal is just to go out there and provide data driven solutions right we live in a world of subjectivity guesswork a very punishment oriented fitness system where it sucks to start working out you you typically gain weight if you're doing the right stuff because you're getting hydrated you go get injured you know the goal is to redefine how we assess people so that we can find these little little tweaks for positive reinforcement and that's that goes a long way with healthcare as well as fitness so you guys mostly working with civilians are you working with pro athletes or right now we're in the research and development phase so we're really only working with guys like Henry Victoria Anthony a very badass wrestler we're working with right now as well just some amazing people largely for research and development we we trade them the training for the data you know you how'd you guys get together we've been working with Henry about a year he he knew our CEO Kareem Amin a great guy we've kind of all circle around a Kareem he brought us all together but uh you know he came in probably about eight months ago for a little bit before the first camp and we met talked and you know Henry was straight up he's like man you know your stuff but you don't know MMA so I took that you know personally we you know spent a lot of time together I had to learn the sport I'm a physiologist not an MMA physiologist who really took the time to get to know each other you know hang out a lot now I got to go to his house and wake him up every day for eight weeks so that was got to know each other pretty well and I do his meals reps and so much yeah that's a fantastic combination know a guy like you who knows so much about the body and recovery and a real super high-level Olympic gold-medalist athlete I mean when you get that combination I mean that is that's really a dream for a guy like you and for a guy like you like for both of you guys to come together like this yeah I understand why you wanted to bring him on as well yeah I mean you know you understand I mean I do feel honored and blessed to be able to work with somebody like Henry he's the hardest-working guy out there and and of course the hard work goes a long ways but man this guy's a genetic freak as well I I've had the ability to test Olympic athletes many other sports as well this guy makes adaptations faster than anybody he came off a you know 12 weeks eight sixteen weeks maybe of not training vo twos already in the high 60s functional threshold powers that would go compete with the you know world-class iron men that I'm training and things as well and then I mean we did some amazing stuff if you looked at the body composition changes that we did in seven weeks it wasn't even a full eight week camp he put on four point two pounds of skeletal muscle mass like good mass which as a physiologist I would call bullshit on if I didn't see with my own two eyes that's pretty much yeah incredible in in you know Henry will tell you he may be picked up weights like three or four times we don't really do traditional strength training because you know a lot of people just it's called vector-based training so a lot of people do things like squats and deadlifts this is an axial plane like we don't live in this up and down plane so we break it down by vector what angles that does he need to exert and absorb force and very effectively and very really does that come down to actually utilizing weights we do things like positional isometrics and eccentric training and things along these lines number one they integrate with the nervous system very effectively isometrics yeah positional isometrics what kind of like planks I mean that's that's kind of a low level of it yeah largely what you would want to do is like a biomechanical assessment look at overactive and underactive muscles and you put them in very specific positions and you leverage what's called reciprocal inhibition so basically and then the most basic turn like when I'm flexing my bicep my tricep is relaxing so you'd hold certain positions that you want to turn on certain muscles and kind of turn off other ones and it's kind of a high level of PNF stretching proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation so this is what would be done in like a PT office so what in like for wrestling like what kind of exercises would you do that wouldn't incorporate those methods I mean wrestling is you know largely a torsional sport so when it comes to wrestling we do things like like Kaiser like pneumatic compressions and things like that so instead of using weights we use air pressure basically it's very smooth very low risk of injury and they live in this um this torsional plane so you do a lot of transverse plane and we do a lot of velocity based training as well actually really interesting a study that was published recently they had a lot of guys working out it for a full year some only did velocity never actually picked up a weight the other ones did traditional strength training the people who did velocity based training not no actual weight training got stronger with less muscular hypertrophy I mean they didn't get as big but they were stronger at the end of the day so when you look at something like wrestling and MMA where you got to make a low weight but you want to be strong as possible you know velocity based training is kind of the way of the future so this is kind of our general gym concept that we're building right now is is you know the gym of the future may not need weights you know you we're gonna be next door to these CrossFit gyms where they're throwing all these weights over their head getting injured or next door empty gym and people are getting stronger that's that's kind of the gym of the future the way we see it how would you Vonn velocity based training so basically what you want to do is it's kind of like the new one rep max we all know wonder if Max's aren't the safest thing to perform right so you would there's different assessments actually what I'm wearing here on my wrist right now this is the wearable tech of the future this is something we're testing right now this does velocity so I could stand in any position I could do a push press or I could do a punch this is going to measure my velocity your max velocity at no weight would be your one rep max velocity basically and then you're going and you're doing your training so max velocity every single rep when you hit 20 percent dampening so say I was at 10 meters per second as soon as I hit 8 meter 8 meters per second I stop so this is kind of what they call fatigue so you stop that so instead of doing you know you're gonna do 8 reps you do as many reps as you can until you reach a certain dampening of velocity and what are you doing them with um largely things like the Kaiser the functional trainer if you're familiar with blasting band work yeah things like that I mean very really will throw like you know Indian clubs and things like that in there as well so it all depends on the sport and what we're focusing on that day you know metabolic readiness things along those lines but it's all just about training in the right vectors and being able to not only put out for us but absorb force as well which nobody really talks about if you look at largely other professional sports all these injuries are happening in the deceleration phase so when people are trying to slow down this is absorbing force this is kind of similar through some of the pieces that just aren't trained in MMA as well it's got to be able to absorb force just like you put it out now when you met this risk thing that you're wearing it measures velocity so how is it doing that so basically I have one here and then I have one on my shoe as well so it can do it by using two sensors it can measure relative velocity so it's reading one relative to the other this is also doing everything that a badass traditional wearable would do as well so it's doing my heart rate heart rate variability which is actually clinical grade everything we do has got to be clinical grade because what's the point of collecting data if it's shit right and then it does pulse oximetry so I'm looking at my oxygen saturation the next version is going to be able to do hydration all kinds of badass stuff what's really cool about it as well as it can measure form any exercise that you're doing we can compare you essentially to an ideal form and because we have to you don't even have to tell it you're doing a power clean it can read your motions things like that and it gives you like a consistency number as well so we one thing we really talked about is not building muscle on top of dysfunction we have to get your biomechanical patterns right first and then we start putting muscle on if you just put muscle on top of dysfunction you're facilitating further dysfunction would you have to wear one of those on each hand I mean I'd say the the ideally for someone like a fighter you obviously are throwing with both hands I think it would be ideal it's it's really difficult to time sink multiple devices to be on the same timeline so that's something we're working with this company an amazing company actually out of here at LA to develop this thing right now so that I would say that would be the goal it's not something that's gonna be applicable to the average guy though as well.this we're trying to bring this type of training to everybody would it be possible instead of time syncing it you have a left in the right computer like two different computers that are reading data both on one off the left one off the right so you don't have to coordinate them you just look at the the various data yeah I mean at the end of the day you still would have to sync them you know so the thing there you'd be collecting it in two different sets of hardware you'd want an API connectivity put it up in the cloud and then you'd still at the end of the day have to find the same time axis so it sounds simpler than it really would be that's why this is the only wearable in the world right now that has even one in the foot and so this also allows you to track your gait while you're running and things as well but the more devices the more complex in in yellow that's something I think would be great but maybe not applicable to everybody is it going to be able to track martial arts moves like will it be able to track a double leg takedown or a roundhouse kick right now you can program it to do anything you put it into a kind of like a learning mode on your app you do a few motions you name it and then it can can basically compare you to yourself in that mode so you can try and do perfect form and measure your form relative to yourself but if you have shitty form you're comparing yourself to shit before exactly so doesn't know any better exactly so what we're doing right now on which which will be a little bit of a lengthy process is defining a library of perfect form for everything that you could think of and then this you know this is going to lock telehealth and tell the training when you have something like that we can do remote programming and and have be you know be monitoring people's neuromuscular function their biomechanics completely remotely so that's that's really what we're going towards wow this is fascinating stuff man you know there's always been several aspects to a fighter ready for camp there's always been their skill set what what they're good at specific training for that one individual opponent that they're gonna face and then all the strength and conditioning and you know it's usually thought of as you know weights and sprints and plows and on all these different things but I feel like this is probably the next step the next step measuring all of your all these variables that you're talking about and and seeing how your body is at any given time so that you're not just guessing whether you're peaking your scientifically peaking exactly I mean there's there's just no room for guesswork and subjectivity you know at this level and technology doesn't there's no need for it anymore so we're just trying to let people know shit like this is available right so we're developing it and then the end goal is just to make it extremely user friendly right so you're doing your your troop velocity based training and it says stop and then you rest and we're using your heart rate variability to tell you when to go again so like you know is easy to stop and go for your periodization and things like that so that the technologies here now making it you know actionable recommendations for the individual that can understand is kind of what we're moving towards this is awesome stuff man thank you yeah we're really passionate that you've only been around for such a short amount of time - and yet you already have a world champion oh I know man I mean I feel you know there's times where you feel like you didn't deserve the opportunity because I'm new to the field you know we obviously work our asses off and everything but the for Henry to put the faith into us you know this was a world champion camp we're a company also we're not even open yet where this is you know probably one of the best acceleration for a company that's never seen the light of day ever you know we also heard on a few other sports as well but yet for him to give us this opportunity and you know we felt like we we owed him something so we we worked extra hard to essentially put our entire company on hold for eight weeks that you go help him out and you know it's paying dividends obviously if we're here right now so now are you guys gonna be open to the general public say the the average girl or guy who does say jiu-jitsu tournaments and wants to get in the best shape of their life is you're gonna have products for them and and a service where they can sign up for something like that certainly right now we are already open in terms of diagnostic testing so you can come in based on your sport your goal whatever it may be we do have customized diagnostic pack just because some assessments just aren't applicable to some people so we customize your assessment we basically tell you what you're good at what you're bad at then if you want to you know develop a program that's a little bit of an upcharge that the real goal there is to be able to do completely remote training completely in-house training and then any level of hybrid training as well so right now you know what the world needs is that diagnostic testing the data we're already ready to do that what we're building now is the processes of being able to use data put it into recommendations and then scale that it's hard to teach somebody you know everything that I do so we're building the you know the software's to essentially replicate ourselves like my buddy in the other room Andre Hicks one of the best strength and conditioning coaches in the world these guys will attest to it you can't teach people what he knows so we have to like code this into a software a lot of if-then type stuff and then this is able to be scalable to everybody we want to provide this training to people now the average Joe trying to lose weight you know the weekend warrior the the jujitsu everything and we want to be able to provide this to every but everybody deserves this type of training that's minimal risk of injury high-yield return efficient that's what everyone's looking for and that's that's why you know the people are getting fatter there's there's no good positive reinforcement out there and there's no clear roadmap of how to get to where you want to be you know we put together like you know comparing it to Google Maps everybody knows their end point they know where they want to be but it can't tell you where you're at unless you know exactly what you're starting from you have to do this baseline assessment you know sometimes it sucks to really understand how fat your you know your body fat percentage and your metabolics and your risk oh you know your insulin resistance and things like that but you have to figure out where you're starting from where you want to be and that's how we develop a roadmap so getting people you know and and we believe this is this is the way of kind of making our way into the healthcare system as well that's our end goal as a company it's people to provide you know integrative Fitness is what we're calling it taking little pieces from all the different methodologies of a fitness like you know we we bring meditation and yoga into our practice as well so little pieces of just about everything and be able to you know provide this to everybody that that's what we're doing so in the future when you guys are open you're not totally open to the general public yet right correct yeah about six to eight months would someone have to come to you for the first initial assessments and then possibly be able to do the consulting either online or you know through through the application I mean there's totally different degrees we have 100% remote kits right now there's badass stuff you can do on your iPad like biomechanical assessments that can find your joints and things like that we can send this to you there's a lot of things that we want to be able to do a hundred percent remote for the most complex assessment you got to come in you got to do a vo2 max assessment we can't send you a metabolic cart and shit obviously so the goal is to get people to just come into the facility and then do remote programming from there and this is a you know our concept is to put these diagnostic centers and possibly the attached training centers as well and just start providing these everywhere because frankly if we just went you know the the diagnostic gym of the future route it could be five six hundred square feet low you know low overhead facilities that are just really efficient you know just putting people out collecting data left and right that's amazing man yeah well what has it been like for you to make this gigantic change and basically be like Ivan Drago yeah pretty much that's that's pretty much how its kind of how its kind of been like we took in that the Ivan Drago approach probably more than the rocky approach you know yeah which I think I think rush is kind of tend to use science a little bit more in their training so to me at first it was almost like man I'm going all-in on this especially this cap against Demetrius oh my god I'm I'm going all-in man like I'm gonna have faith in the sides like a hundred percent I'm gonna do everything according to even you know even if even if I don't want to and that's and I think it's just as I started seeing my body changed I started seeing like the coaches kind of DAP with like okay math science is in the center of this whole cat and I saw the change oh and I've never felt so recovered the night that I fought dimitra's John's like I've never felt so good and I'm 31 years old and I've been cutting weight since I've since I've been a kid so you felt a big difference through the entire camp doing this kind of man through the entire campaign people would trip powder be like people were like man you're committed you're that's suicide okay we're not doing this how come you're not doing that and you would have to we're saying how come you're not doing like what specifically oh no just just more work more more pad work more more sparring rounds like things of that matter like the kind of like the gladiator stuff mmm like no no it's it's it's gonna go according to my heart rate it's gonna it's gonna go according to what well my windows what my train of my windows of opportunity of training are you know it's people walk on a mumbo-jumbo buddy knows like the day that I wake up the day that I trains like nobody knows what's going on until until until the data's gone in the hands of Kevin and you know force one and then they okay they they determined this is how many rounds this is how how we're gonna kind of peak you for your fight if you could imagine standing on the sidelines when he's like sparring in rounds and stuff and more slow down period like coaches like you can't do that this is fighting you can't try and control your heart rate while training no this is training for fighting right you know so we're telling constantly telling him to train less slow himself down you know there was a little bit of clashing there at the beginning and then they started to see the body composition come around and started to feel his power and everyone kind of bought into the process but it takes a while where now we're redefining it and we understand that just give me some pushback this is such a universal concept when it comes to strength and conditioning coaches it's being discussed over and over again nowadays is that people are doing too much yeah doing too much and your body's just doesn't have a chance to recover and even though you're getting in better shape ultimately you're not getting in as good a shape as you could have gotten if you did less which is so counterintuitive for most people yeah and that's kind of how it that's that's that's kind of how I used to Train so hard but I used to get hurt I mean I used to have back spasms kicking like that's how hard I would train like out my back would literally go I'll just kick you know I throw one kick and I had to pull me off the gym in a stretcher you know and I had those problems because I had just I really I didn't you almost train according to how how you know what this how the schedule is rather than okay this is this is this is the approach today because this is sorry this is how your stress levels are yeah like relax dude and then and then at times you're gonna go hard and it's it'll spike you at times it's crazy well that's the the crazy contrast right is between this championship mentality that just wants to do more than anybody push harder train while everybody else is asleep put your body through more than anybody else is willing to do because that's what makes a champion and then someone like you comes along goes no that's way more that's what he fucks you up you slow down you do last less rounds move slower yeah exactly I mean that was one of the biggest things I told him if you're not sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night when you're putting your body through some like you're doing your body and injustice and you're not gonna make adaptations when we're out there training or breaking our body down it needs this repair we need you know activate our glymphatic system our brains waste removal system as well so we can go learn some new things the next day as well so if you're not sleeping you're suboptimal just like you're not properly hydrated and things as well as so this is all comes down to the cellular level you know nervous system based approach now are you taking melatonin or anything to ensure that you go to sleep at a specific time do you time your sleep sky schedule like how are you organizing that yeah I think I think and that's another thing even at times according to when I would go to sleep because at times you know how you train late and sometimes you come back and it just takes your water go to sleep yeah so even then it would it would be like all right when when Henry's ready to wake up when he obviously if I don't hit my alarm and I snooze it I'm more lucky they can allow me to sleep an extra two hours mmm we're so important yeah so it's like the fight it's kind of like what Floyd does boy we'll be like hey wake everybody up at 3:00 in the morning but there's no scientific to what Floyd's doing like to us it's like hey dude let's we have to peak today so I've always wondered if there is science behind it and he just doesn't talk about yeah think so yeah like when he drinks a Pepsi after a workout I was like I wonder there's no science I told him to do that to replenish his body with a ton of sugar high glycemic carbs right after that's the only time it's really good that 45 window of insulin sensitivity so I do believe that one technology we while we're on the sleep thing one that we were utilizing for Henry just a little light microcurrent here to your temporal lobes and it's proven to increase serotonin and melatonin and decrease cortisol so we're like manipulating bio chemicals and it's a very natural way of making you feel drowsy would totally do that we would do that immediate following every rigorous training session to kind of like negate inflammatory responses and things like that you know get you back into that anabolic phase as quickly as possible and then ideally right before bed every single night did you feel like a science project while all this shit was going on I did I did actually did a presentation on me in Russia with Roman with with the scientists that they have at the US EPA like they tracked everything according to the Omega wear the device that we were using and he was able to kind of show it was like hey look my system might you know this system does work you know it's just like people were kind of just tripping out so I was I went out there did the whole presentation with in Moscow and everybody was just kind of just like there everybody was kind of like wow I mean someone works kind of scratching their head is a little like damn that's that's cool you're able to kind of see how I peaked for this fight and how I was able to kind of survive five rounds the Russians have really been pioneering this type of training for quite a while specifically the the type of training like that Pavel Tatooine uses like where you're using way less energy you're working out way less but you're getting better results from it like there's there's a lot of thought processes that have been leaning in this direction from a like a lot of really high level top coaches for quite a while now yeah I know and it's cool to see it because I come from a traditional sport where you put your head down and you go that's wrestling wrestling and what I think they're very uh very alike in that sense like they're very traditional like the harder you go the more you push through injury the you know the better you will become yeah I also think that there's something to be said for that though in terms of mental strength because one of the things that wrestlers have that is it's not just that they have a great skill and being able to manipulate bodies but they also have mental toughness that's at a level that I don't think you get from any other sport I mean I think there's a lot of pro athletes even tennis players that are just mentally tough they're just tough so people just know how to win they know how to push themselves but I feel like wrestlers are on another level because they're always tired they're always over trained they're always dehydrated and they're always working out with a bunch of fucking savages all the same way and everybody takes pleasure in being miserable oh yeah there's something to that they like you see it man I've seen thousands of fights you see there's something about wrestlers they have just like an extra gear like a high-level wrestler in particular has an extra gear that a lot of other fighters just never developed yeah it's almost like I tell people wrestling's not it's almost like not a sport man it's like a culture yes it's like that you're just you're in the culture of wrestling and once you have that it's almost uh there's an honor to it there's a warrior to it and I get it so yeah it's it's it I was just at the World Championship show and I can tell you man the best athletes in the world I was just a Budapest Hungary and I saw how Snider and all these guys compete and I'm just like man these are the more these are the best athletes and well this is the hardest shit a human being could ever do yeah if you're to see the finesse and the strength and the power and what's involved and becoming a world champion and watching these guys go through this freakin tux just a tough the toughest tournament in the world and it's uh I think I think what we do in mmm is fun compared to compared to wrestling I really do like that stuff is like my stuff is hard what these guys go through the win a tournament like it's the weight cuts the you know they don't get paid a lot of money right like these dudes are wrong for the globe yeah oh yeah each and every one it's all glory there's no financial reward at all that's what's fascinating about it but it's it's just interesting to me that I think you kind of need both in some weird way your mind needs to develop this this layer of toughness that wrestlers have and then I think once you've developed that then maybe I think your approach Kevin is is like applicable but I think that until an athlete has that indomitable spirit until they have that sort of that iron will that a wrestler possesses it's theirs to make a champion I think you need many many things but I don't think you can ever discount that ability to work through discomfort the way wrestlers have I just don't think it's wise as a professional athlete of the championship level to compete compromised Oh agreed yeah you know there there's the intangibles the stuff that you just can't teach you can't quantify you know so we do our best to quantify as much as we can but yeah I mean I completely agree there's you got to put in the time in the work to learn the skill at some point and then once you know it's autonomic the skills master that's when you can kind of put take it back into our method I'm gonna I'm gonna agree with you Joe I think I'm gonna agree with you and I think the reason why this works for pretty much every MMA fighters because we've all been through hell yeah I can order for you to see and believe in Sciences you have to go through how to understand like hey man the hard way probably is it the best way but when you were talking about your your the feeling that you had and not wanting to ever feel the pain of losing again that feeling that you had when your ankle was going out and that you like fuck this no no I'm not doing this I'm gonna find a way out of this like you almost have to experience lows in order to have that and I feel like that one of the things about wrestling that makes it a sport that creates so many fucking savages is because you go through so much shit so much hardship so so much difficulty that you know if you had science-based wrestling programs the way you're doing his science-based camp and you went in and you know said everybody you gotta slow down slow down you know like you're going too hard slow down you can't run up hills today you know your your your DC brain waves or a wrestling coach should be like shut the fuck up and sit - who is this asshole yeah like Dan Gable brought you in a camp and you guys are running around doing all this stuff he'd be like what like what are you saying like this is how we make champions yeah yeah yeah but it like I said I think you hit the nail on the head I think it's for to me the way I would see there's like you have to kind of go through how or no understanding because you had to go through that Callister that burn yeah but I feel like especially in MMA a lot of athletes or even athletes just in general they everybody buses are BOTS almost if you're an elite athlete like you you'll always train maybe not the smartest way yeah you know I get some yeah I guess you could add more to to your training or take away less if there's a me but there's a fine line to it yeah the fine line is what's fascinating to me yeah like one of the things that I love about MMA is that it's so broad there are so many skills that the approach to success is different with every individual and you have to find what that approach is like the approach to you for your for you for you to achieve success is going to be different than they approach for a different athlete it does doesn't have the same skills that you have but like Anderson Silva perfect example he's not a wrestler he's gonna have a different different approach there's going to be different things that they work on in training there's gonna be a different mindset it's gonna be a different way of preparing right right and it's all according to everybody according like not it's I think a lot of things are cookie cutter like looking at it the way now it's like a lot of things have have stayed even in wrestling like just over tradition you know like bridging like the pie every time I see people bridge and the way that you stretched and it's so bad for you and they'll be doing like these like Springs on their head I'm just like Kevin how bad is that how about is bridging for you I mean I wouldn't recommend it I mean it but Mike Tyson always looked badass and he's doing it I was gonna say it looks pretty badass I mean teacher have you ever fucked around with the iron neck with the iron videos that's definitely one of the missing links but a lot of these wrestlers get hurt there you know neck instability the you know postural issues that come associated with it as well as guys need to strengthen their necks it's a halo you put it on you pump it up like a Reebok Pump remember the Rio yeah you pump this sucker up so it tightens up on your head you put a chin strap on it's got a bungee cable on that's set to 50 pounds you back up and then there's resistance on the halo so it spins the resist that halo has like you could tighten up or clamp down or loosen up the resistance and you do these exercises like you go sideways you do like like like loops back and forth it's fuckin badass that's that's crazy I'm excited man yeah because that why I sign that waivers [Laughter] [Laughter] yeah the sensory immersion that those flow tanks are pretty badass we study those quite a bit for the nervous system based stuff where we're building kind of our own sensory immersion like mindful in this room of the future as well all the walls LED screens so you could put yourself fully immersed in any environment and you know it's gonna be pretty badass mindfulness is so overlooked in these sports how important I know you're you're a meditation guy as well as you know getting your mind right is you know invaluable yeah and you were saying the meditation yoga is also a part of the preparation that you guys employ a hundred percent yeah I mean it all comes down to you know when we're doing our warm-up training and recovery it's all mind and body so his warm-up is going to include like somatosensory reaction testing so imagine like a wall and it has different lights on it you react as quickly as you can as soon as they light up and I say alright if the light comes up red use your right hand and blue use your left hand so we're invoking cognitive decision-making processes then you have you saying on one of these shake plates a proprioceptive plate now your vision your neuromuscular your proprioceptive everything is warmed up everything every part of your brain that's going to equate to you know force output absorption and so on then we go do a more traditional warmup whatever that may be we do a cognitive training we do physical training more from a functional aspect and then soon as you're done we get you into a mind based recovery as well so we get you into yoga meditation that you know technology we're playing with right now that manipulates your biochemicals you know just just about everything and it's good mind and body every step along the way and when you're doing yoga you doing yoga to increase mobility are you doing it for the mental training for both like um definitely a little bit of both we believe I'm Andre more leads that the yoga what we're doing over there so he'd be better to ask specifically but we believe it largely for nervous system and for breathing one thing we really talked about is the diaphragmatic breathing and yoga is really a common to be able to focus on your breathing what does that mean diaphragmatic diaphragmatic breathing yeah breathing from your diaphragm this is how we're all born breathing from our diaphragm and just you know eventually we end up breathing from our chest which is very ineffective for metabolic efficiency just like when you see like you know the wim HOF guy he's right was breathing from his gut here and that's like engaging your core as opposed to just like your chest so you're actually getting deeper breaths you're encouraging like core stability and things as well it's better for metabolic efficiency so when you're actually exercising it's better for delaying anaerobic threshold buffering lactate things like that as well as keeping the nervous system calm as well do you think there's any benefit to breathing through your nose and out through your mouth or is that um III yeah it's it's an on an individualized basis I think if the best thing is to not think about your breathing when you start thinking about it it can kind of get fucked up so if we encourage diaphragmatic breathing without this this technology we utilize is actually even though when you're utilizing the technology you're just breathing in in and and out through your mouth it actually encourages in through the nose out through the mouth when you're training so I mean I'm not an expert specifically on that but it sounds yeah I think there's definitely some performance advantage to it I want to talk about me now Joe thank you Kevin I appreciate him in this amazing course I tell people where they could find out about your company and what your website is our company is in Scottsdale Arizona the website is neuro Force one oh and accomm check us out all right thank you thanks Jeff that was very informative intention reasons Henri's now become the standard because like he said that Romo for the performance sensitive data did that PowerPoint presentation for UFC Moscow he told us he's the first athlete that ever did eight weeks that they have eight weeks collection of data so Henry's now become the standard of this system that Roman had neuro Force one and all the data put together it's the first time ever that an athlete actually stuck to the program for eight weeks that's fantastic so for you now you got the title and there is talk about you fighting for the bantamweight title against champion TJ Dillashaw what are your thoughts like where are you at right now what are your goals it's a beautiful time to be to be the chance there's there's tons of tons of options Joe where's your contract at right now well I have I still have about seven fights left you know but I'm gonna we're gonna renegotiate I think more likely that TG fight might might happen it's gotta happen that TJ fight might happen if you know that if it's gonna be a dumb way with with the flyweight division mm-hmm you know I think they cats out the bag and you know Dana had mentioned that to me he said hey so you know we we want to take you up on that offer of you are challenging to go up against TJ but this is what this is where the company's been thinking about for a while mm-hmm and TJ's down for it too I don't think so I think TJ wants to come down to 25 I think I think that's kind of like the like that does yeah now would you rather fight him at 35 so you can get an additional title or would you rather fight him at 35 because you don't have to cut weight or I don't I like both ideas I actually kind of left it off to him I said I don't know but I want to fight you man I said I want to fight TJ I wanna I want to go out to the next best thing and that's I think that's him you know you don't mind fighting him at 25 or 35 I don't that makes it easier yeah that's definitely I'm just like hey let's see that 25 listed at 35 let's uh let's fight man that's what your your mind is right now that's your number one goal yeah yeah and I believe TJ wants to fight me too I think I think you know beating Demetrius I think that kind of is gonna help his name you know you know sure I guess for both you can see how so but now that Demetrius has left the division and gone off to one Fc to get where where do you think the division is right now I mean is that one reason like if you won at 35 and won the title of 35 would you consider dropping the 25 pound title and competing at 35 or would you rather stay at 25 oh I would I wouldn't mind I wouldn't mind dabbling in both I mean I know that's that's kind of has kind of broad but you know at one point you do get tired of cutting weight mm-hmm and I'm kind of anyway right now I'm probably about PI about 50 50 yeah one I mean losing 15 pounds is way better than losing 25 yeah I'm a little I'm a little bigger now because of because of that reason I might I might have to fight at a bad time so I'm kind of I think more like him it might happen that bad him way what people don't know is that actually Henry almost fought TJ when he was the champ when Hannibal didn't make weight his first fight in the UFC he didn't make weight but two hours later Hendon Burrell didn't make weight and they were looking for somebody to go up and fight Tito sotto fought him when Joe Soto fought on how many was the number one option but Henry had already declined he said he wasn't fighting Jorgensen and but now here we are three years later back now he's got the tenth he's got the belt TJ came back and won the belt let's do it these guys been beefing for for a long time so that's ever since the first day he came into the UFC him and TJ have been at it and then on the Ultimate Fighter Ultimate Fighter 24 they had a Dwayne bang was the coach there was like a little beef with Henry and Benavidez his team Ben Evita as his coach so it kind of goes way back there's a bit of animosity too on top of everything now you're a very goal-oriented guy do you do you have your career mapped out in terms of like when you would like to get out of the game I do I do and I think about it a lot cuz man I'll be honest with you Joe I've I've accomplished everything I've ever wanted to you know and in my career like I've always I had I had three goals and I was just you know my number one goal was just to be a good person a good father send a good husband and then after that was to be an Olympic champ and then and then and then eventually UFC champ so everything's kind of I I've done everything in that I've ever kind of set my mind to you know those are the two biggest thing the two man was being able and I don't see myself fighting for more than four more than maybe three to four years the only other thing which you really are in this rare space where you have the possibility of being considered one of the greatest combat sport athletes of all time you're already in the mix right Olympic gold medalist UFC champion I mean you you have this very rare opportunity for incredible greatness yeah I think for the most part of me I like to eventually I mean I I do a lot of motivational speaking I've been doing that for a while John I've spoken in front of like the biggest the biggest companies in the world I mean the coca-cola like the TD Ameritrade Procter and Gamble and dollar come I just got signed by Kroger and they kind of you know they use me for that reason and I really enjoyed doing that in a pot and plus you get pain yeah you have to get leg could hit that nerve and do the drunken munkey yeah got to do all that and it's just cool it just quo to kind of share the the you know the whole underdog story I love that people do do that that companies have the the the mindset of bringing in champions and people that are extraordinary or whatever they do and speaking to these you know these people that work for them and explaining like what I mean that motivation is gigantic motivation is such a huge source of fuel for people in all walks of life mm-hmm you know they have a guy like you come in and talk to a company could have a really big impact on their creativity on on how they pursue goals on all kinds of different things yeah so that's so anyways that's kind of where I kind of I can see my life kind of heading to know I you know eventually I don't think I can I don't think I think I'll always be a fan of the sport but I don't think I'll be involved and in either rustling or fight it as much as I think I would not as a coach not as no no it's too hard Joe like look at all these cookies coaches it's to relationship yeah you know being a coaches year you're in a relationship with with your athletes sometimes you go through these breakups and sometimes that athletes don't give you what they want to give you and then it's just it's a headache at times yeah and I see that with I see that with a lot of you know I see that with him and I'm just like man I don't know if I want stress for a guy like you you could get across a guy like Henry you hit the gold mine but you could get across a guy who is a really talented guy that's a flake and those two to meet personally there's plenty of those but to me as an analyst as someone who watches fights they're the most frustrating because there's some guys that I see and I go god damn that motherfucker's good he's got the potential like they can do things inside the Octagon they do things like I'll see guys in the gym like I'll go to a gym and watch guys train and see the guy and I go if this motherfucker could put it together like this in the cage the way you see when he's sparring like some people are just artists but the anxiety of competition and and all the factors that come involved the discipline the consistency all the things that make someone a great fighter sometimes there's so much so many different things that make someone a great fighter that wind up fucking them up when when they actually go to compete though the recklessness impulsiveness that actually makes them good also can wind up tanking them if they don't sort of Forge it with quit with some sort of like severe discipline yeah there has to be a training of the mind to and I think that's where people are skipping and you know I think that's that's where you had to understand like the philosophy up here like you have to you have to be right up top you don't write you have to be you have to be literally you have to understand and know who you are as a fighter as a person and you know to kind of to be stable enough to perform when it really matters yeah you know and if you don't have that you can be as talented and and as gifted as you want you know you'll never make it you know and then we see those all the time like I see guys in practice man I would tear me up they came to competition there was just roll roll over like fish it's weird right that's crazy I'm like huh yeah it's weird as you're coming up and you see those guys and you realize like man there's there's something missing and then you you you you're terrified you're gonna see that in yourself and I think it's the embracement of embracing pressure mmm it's something that you don't neglect or sometimes you don't shy away from something that you don't allow damn it to damage you but it's an embracement it's a it's a sigh hey bring it man bring because that's what it is Joe it's the pressure that people feel the reason why they can't perform it's what makes champions I remember when TJ Dillashaw first fought Henning Burrell when he got into that octagon dude he looked like he was sparring he was loose as a goose yeah and I saw my Mike damn look how lose TJ is like this is a world title fight and he's switching stances and giving him looks and he looks fantastic he just looked loose and then boom he hit someone that big overhand right and next thing you know henan Burrell's getting fucked up yeah I mean and that was what TJ thrives on that kind of pressure he lives for that kind of pressure just like you do yeah let's do it I want his head on I want his head I want his head on a spike I want I want to make I want to make some snake shoes out of snakeskin snakeskin shoes maybe suit look he might be big enough for me what a fight that would be for fans to me those champion versus champion encounters are always so fantastic no and the reason why it's cool too is because we're both in our prime to my teachers probably a couple years older than me but even like the matrix like did I'd be Demetrius in his prime like yeah it was a close fight but man I can say did I beat him in his problem in this prime and it's almost like there's no doubt but it was it was because of the game planning then you ended the greatest winning streak in the history of the sport right yeah I mean a greatest championship defense streak in the history of the sport and then on top I mean Norma Gomez off has the greatest winning streak in the sport because he's still undefeated but as far as defending the title DJ was number one and again you did it to him in his prime if you look at the way he destroyed Wilson Hayes if you look at like I mean fucking everybody everybody just he's a monster a Borg the greatest admission in that was shit of all time we fucking suplexes him and it catches an armbar on the way down get the fuck out of here he told me he does that in training all the time yeah Matt Hume is a wizard a wizard one of the things that I did that was kind of under conventional unconventional for this camp I had them video at it we obviously we scouted Demetrius Johnson but then I went back and got every one minute clip of Matt Humes interval between rounds so 25 fights I have the one minute what he tells him how he adapts his and changes and one of the things I noticed is that he always went to wrestling and when he always went to wrestling he sounded like it was automatic alright so this run we're gonna take him down and we're gonna work it was always automatic and when he went into the fifth round it wasn't automatic you can hear him say you could try to take him down if you want it was kind of like that the way he said it you know when I went back and watched and I was like we got him and going into that fifth round one of the things that we talked about subliminally and mentally training was when we went Henry was just put in the Hall of Fame you know he which has never been done at such a young age as a wrestler has a wrestle yeah and when I was at the reston Hall of Fame Nate car who's also one of the greatest wrestlers ever he told me he said you know what Eric when I wrestled Kenny Monday and I lost him in the big tents I knew that when I went out two weeks later to fight for him in the NCAA finals that it might come up that that that man this guy just beat me and he goes so I had a book actually I think he said his wife made his book and he put all the positive things that that uh Nate Carr had done and all the articles and she made quotes from that and put it in this book so he gave me that idea and then I did that so Henry was put in the Hall of Fame that night they had a video highlights I had Terry brands his coach they had Sergey Bella glasses off Kenny Kevin Jackson some of the greatest all his coaches saying stuff about him and I took that and I put it in this book and they kind of like and I read it to him every day and they kind of like happened in the fight one of his her own quotes was said I've got to go in there and kill and be ready to die and and you know when he got that leg injury you know he was ready to die he was ready keep going forward yes we adapted and went southpaw but some of that stuff from the book came exactly true start fast and finish even stronger compete with passion and purpose and this is what I said to him right here and the fifth because this is what I told him going into the fifth round when we was forward let's do the two that's here let me see I said let's throw Henry burn the ships take the fucking castle let's take him down hurt him on the ground if he gets back up knock his ass out and that's what I told him going into the fifth round the shaking that shirt yeah they could only had one or two but we should say the messenger so uh you know it's just something that I was ingrained into him every uh every sparring session I had something set for him but this time going into the fifth round against DJ I wasn't sure if it was to to to or if he needed a knockout how did you feel I thought it was two to two I thought it was to the two and I think I think I think DJ from the interviews that I've heard I think he felt like it was two to going to the fifth yeah we thought it was two to when we were watching the fibrotic damages as closest against yeah and again Joe I wouldn't I wouldn't like I said I could I because it was such a close fight you know I'd I'd clapper they meet just you through the gate in the the fight like yeah I know it was close you know what did you weigh I was actually I was actually a pound lighter than uh than the meets um you know that yeah you look bigger yeah you really did but that's again that's kind of one that's kind of where they the way they placed like my muscle like it was uh that's why I look bigger but no I was a pound lighter than Demetrius Johnson what did you wear night that 141 Wow because when you saw you guys standing together in the Octagon you really did look bigger than him you're really interesting yeah yes I'm not I was I was lighting in to meet his people FYI and he kept on saying he said it twice he's so big he's so strong he said it twice in his post interview but that's wrestling strength right wrestling straights is just for kind of strength with it sometimes it's not even strength its leverage learning how to use how to how to tippy toe things and how to use your way to to pressure pony or to take them down for sure yeah but there's also strength yes creating strength that wrestlers have yeah anybody's ever roll with a wrestler

speed huh yeah I was it was a craziest thing that's probably ever happened to me I've done some crazy things yeah they've documented it in the UFC pre-show like they showed like all the damage to the area where you were living it's fucking terrifying yeah it was crazy I uh anyways I mean I guess I guess I guess this is where people kind of share their stories right sure what it saw yes so this was about a year ago now so this was yeah about a year ago now and I got invited to this event with you know raising raising money for kids in cancer and everybody in their every big celebrity gets invited like charity rise like Barry Bonds like the like the the big a-list celebrities and everybody was there and we had a fundraiser that night and you know wine country in Santa Rosa California you know and everybody know everybody had to drink so whatnot you know I had I had a couple glasses maybe had a few glass of wine but I don't drink wine but I had a few glasses and I remember I told her but hey I'm gonna sleep guys and it was close to about midnight I was like I ain't trying to stay up with these people and I'm trying I'm trying to sleep because I was I never drink wine so I go to my room and and then I shower get into bed and and I remember right before I went to bed every bar I I saw like the flickering of lights and I just like I thought it was weird this is roughly about time I got to my hotel I showered I saw the flickering of lights and think anything of it and I pass out 230 hits 2:30 in the morning hits and I'm just uh I'm just you know I I wake up because I hear the alarm you know kind of pop off at the at the hotel so now I'm hearing these alarms starting to go off and I've you know I checked out I checked out on front I checked out through the window and I checked out a lobby nobody was moving so I was like it's a false alarm so I got the pillow put over my head and everything slapped the alarm and then that happened about 2:30 now 4:30 comes about on this time I don't wake I don't wake up because of the alarm I wake up because of the smoke I'm like coffee now I'm like coffee Don the smoking I first I thought I was dreaming so I wake up and at that time I had I had you know I slept him I tell that's how tired I was and I got up and I'm going to turn on the lights in the light ain't turning on and then I go through the wind and I checked the window and then she know and I see the car right in front of me on fire 3/4 of the hotel's like I was probably about five rooms away from like getting hit hard like I'm talking about like like fire coming out the window like that and I'm waking up to this like thinking I'm dreaming you know in a towel and a little I'd say everything was dark but I could see everything like it like the room started getting hot and I couldn't I couldn't hold my breath no more I started looking for my my shoes I couldn't find my shoes and I I bump it to my slacks that I let them on the ironing board that the night before and I put them on and I grab I grab the I grab my phone and I jumped out the window I joined thought the one has I jumped out the window my right foot catches on fire I right foot catches on fire fast and I'm looking at kind of I'm kind of you know trying to put it out and it's crazy how I can see how people could catch on fire real quick because my right leg was like Foom okay with it was crazy Wow so I jump out and I start walking I says I'm walking I'm seeing like this that the hotel in front of us was all and sticks T like the whole thing was just in sticks like the for the fire I just ate that thing up there's a building in front of me on fire like I'm just walking through the streets going up the hill I'm just thinking like God give me a horrible way to die horrible way to die and I got a I got a bird's-eye view when I was on top of the when I was on top of the hill and then I saw there's a cop down there there's a cop down in the middle of the Freeman just so you know that that's where I got to go so now I'm running fast and I've seen that this brush fire kind of come along and just I'm seeing like California like just catch on fire like completely I threw my eyes I jump over the first fence to get to the freeway you know no problem I jump or the second fence and then the third fence it was was a very like a flimsy kind of fence and I remember as I jumped out and were it snag like part of my snacks to keep in mind I was I had I don't think I had on with slacks I got was commando slacks no shirt no shoes like out in the cold in California and that's how that flimsy fence as I jump out that last fence it like cut your like a part of the fence I grabbed my butt and it just it get cutting me open hard and at or like half the leg so now I'm full of smoke my right foots burn and I'm pretty much half naked so I see the cop car and I go up to the cop car and as I'm going up to it I'm sorry the freakin cop car leaves like fucking just scrambles I'm just like oh my god and as soon as that cop car left I remember seen like this big as diesel like coming towards me I never get into the middle of the freeway and kind of you know waving my hands like you know take me and die like this like hit me dude and as it got closer so I was a fire truck and and I get rescued I get rescued by the fireman it put me in the fire truck and then just kind of like looking at me like down he just you just survived death you just survived it because I was black you guys already smell like a marshmallow did anybody die in the hotel fifty fifty people died in you know I'm sorry the whole time and I know I'm not sure if anybody died at the hotel I hope not but I could see how 50 people died in the 50 I was it was a worse no you have 50 people died 50 families like it was it was it was so just happened quick those fires come so quick people don't realize it's before it's too late and then there's no escape route and and I think the reason walks I think people had time to get out and I think the reason why 50 people died is because they didn't take the that the alarm like me serious and actually noted it's too late because that that smoke will blind you so you think you're going to into the right direction and actually know you're walking into the biggest fire in history Jesus Christ so so that had happened like two months before I've fought Sergio Pettis and and I and I still fought him like I trained with two socks it might just with with the with the wrestling shoe and I just stuck it out because I pulled out the first fight with him I said I gotta make it up to you and I told him I says hey yeah I said I owe you one and then you kind of called me out on the other god dude I'm gonna fight you regardless now man with
