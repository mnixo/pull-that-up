the girag an experience I had my wisdom teeth pulled same kind of thing excellent doctor right he prescribed me like 60 vicodens the next day I was eating burritos it was like wow this is I was expecting this worst pain of my life everybody told me was gonna be the worst thing ever the wisdom teeth getting pulled was I was I was prepared for hell and I woke up the next day it was like this is great and I literally had those pills in my in my cabinet forever until I figured out and this was like 20 something years ago that a half a vicodin and a glass of whiskey is a good time for a while you know what I mean and so I came very close to becoming like kind of strung out there on pills until I caught myself literally like wait a minute this is getting out of hand I'm and I was able to just you know I was i'm likely have that kind of personality I've never been a really super addictive personality so I've been able to recognize a few times when I got close to like this could get out of hand yeah luckily man I saw people i smoked crack once what was that like it was it was bananas it was like the craziest greatest rush for like 35 40 seconds yeah and then it was gone and it was like I wanted more and a guy used to live with was like crack I won't even call fizzies dealer a seller he just kind of sold it he wasn't even dealing cuz he wasn't even doing very well with crack and that's a you know I don't even understand but so like one night I was just kind of chipped off a piece and that's I smoked some crack man i was curious man but i recognized right away bo I cuz I know why people lose their lives behind this shit news fall back yeah what was that like I I didn't like it I thought it was just it smelled weird the smell is off put in haste is not good but like the rush I got from I was like whoa for like a few and literally 30 seconds and then it was kind of like gone but you wanted it to happen again and I was just like no I aint fuckin going there again it was a brother I remember thinking I would rather do cocaine because I'd like took we took our cocaine and made crack I forget how to do it like baking soda we just usually with your spine rebate that's freebasing yeah I mean crack is just like automatic like pre-made freebase that's what crack is a freebase we're so concerned with what kind of clothes we were people who are like really into style they're always annoying haha they're almost always annoying when they start talking about this is uh this is Gucci this is family this is a this is a Ralph Lauren this your artist friend told me that all these older artists now they'll get a little successful and they have like sleeves but they're like no I only with these type of shoes just another being into clothes there's nothing wrong with enjoying I think art closer artwork well don't get me wrong but these people that are like really like obsessively in the style and like kind of snobbish about it that's like a weird thing to give a fuck about you give a fuck that this guy has paint on his pants like if you and I are hanging out and you have pain in your pants I could give zero fucks is that like a better thing whatever you want no I'm just saying if you what you choose to wear type of shoe where you choose to wear like I make fun of calories all world you can wear anything you want you should be able to wear anything you want everywhere but someone who's like into a rigid style like oh that's out of style that's our style says fucking who says fucking who you tell me what the hell board decides what's in style and not installed wear whatever the fuck you want if you want to wear some sweat pants wear some fucking sweatpants and anyone who cares is an idiot you fool you care what that guy's walking around sweatpants why do you give a fuck why would anybody care even slightly that someone's walking around wearing sweatpants in the office in the in the boardroom what do you give a fuck well you have to wear that weird stupid outfit that you wear with these stiff corners these sharp edges and a tie around your neck enough and cuff links that are so fucking stupid you have to stick some metal extraneous pieces in there and tighten up better with oh come on Winx cuz your scholar folds over get the fuck out of here that's ridiculous will you shiny stupid hard-soled shoes why do you have wood in your shoes the bottom i issue is would really cuz wooden your shoe what is it fucking 1812 are you living in Denmark you have clogs on you fucking ridiculous why would you have leather shiny leather on the bottom of your toes you know slippery and stupid that is just got them at all what's with the tassels you fuck a half-wit I put some white castles in the funnier shoes what is that extra fancy fucking allowed a leather tassel so stylish and silly and ancient retarded and dum dee-dum dee-dum who cares how you dress remember how we started Joe you know it wasn't everyone goes out there are no rules one man enter six men leave you know whatever we were saying but you know we couldn't figure out how to put the different fighting sports together right so whose rules to use right I mean it's so really the basis of the UFC was always you know no rules became you know this huge thing but it was also whose rules do you use mm-hmm I mean how you're gonna get a boxer against the jujitsu guy right what what are you gonna use you can't there's no rules you can use did anybody try to gouge eyes was that who's that legal in the early one well first you know what I mean I always would hear about these Wing Chun masters they've had 50 ways to pop your eye out with their thumb and I kept calling them going bring your thumbs and do it man don't talk about it coming pop it but he's I out I what would you have done if a guy lost and I though would you have done it would we'd pick it up yeah I mean it was fun till it wasn't um and you I mean you know the story we were we had backed off that marketing and work you know the Unified Rules you know we're coming into place and you know it was a very dif well for a lot of folks who don't know what we're talking about when the UFC first came out there were no weight classes and there were no rules and you could not you know the fighter could tap they could but the no one could throw in the towel and the referee couldn't stop the fun that was on one that changed by two that was insane by the way yeah that wasn't okay so but it's this sort of highlights it so that's the first episode the first UFC and then from there slowly but surely rules start becoming implemented strategies change rounds weight classes gloves things got really interesting really fast and I think a lot of people were unaware of it if you think about the difference between 93 and 97 i came in in 97 when v2 are made his debut gloves were still not mandatory they were optional some fighters fought without gloves but it was wasn't that the case yeah I was against gloves after i saw tank knockout what's his name Mantua mm-hmm tank was smart he figured out he goes gloves are a weapon I'm bringing him yeah you get getting your nutrition from your diet well that would be ideal but the reality is we have you know the national institute of medicine that we're conducting these surveys every five years they call them the nutrition and examination health surveys and hanes it's very notorious you know the nutrition field there you know we consider an Hayden surveys to be pretty accurate in determining what people are getting from their diet and you know these surveys are telling us know people are not getting what they need from their diet the majority of Americans are not getting what they need in terms of you know micronutrients yeah it's really hard to do so and to do so on a daily basis requires you to really eat clean and healthy mean you can get what you need from your diet but boy you have to really mind what you're eating you have to really work at it and know it's yeah it's a lot of effort um you know it's and there's also the difference between the idea of you just surviving and not getting a disease and you being at optimal health absolutely absolutely that's something that our lab works on you know but where we've got this sort of theory that it's hard to do aging studies and people and particularly looking at different you know vitamins and minerals and what effects they have long-term but that's that's one of the theories in our lab that there's we've shown some evidence of it is that you know a lot of vitamins and minerals there cofactors for many different biochemical pathways in your body like if you would just go by a biochemical pathways I think you'll see this like massive image come up and it's just like holy crab like and vitamins and minerals are cofactors for enzymes meaning they need to be you know therefore the enzyme to work optimally in enzymes in proteins in your body are doing everything I mean that's what's right what's doing everything our body is doing and so if you don't have you they're certain proteins that are important to survive right now like your sodium potassium a TPA is you know you want to make sure your heart's getting the right signals you want I mean if that shuts down and you're dead you know so I mean some of these some of these functions are what is that yeah so that's the biochemical pathways I'm talking about oh please and that's just a snapshot that's just a snapshot so I mean all these different pathways they require vitamins and minerals essential fatty acids I mean these things it's complicated and so so cheeseburgers don't don't give that everything it needs no they don't
