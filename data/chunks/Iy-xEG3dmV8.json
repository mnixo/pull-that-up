the Joe Rogan experience Michael Jackson was not an ecstatic onstage Michael Jackson was an incredible astonishing performer who had studied his craft from the age of nine and so he worked out every single move in advance John you never knew from one night to the next what Prince or John Mellencamp were gonna do in performance they didn't know how well did you know Michael Jackson I thought very very well and he was the most remarkable person I've ever met in my life and when I tell people how were Merkle they don't believe me he was you know you and I and Jamie are on a certain level and we don't know we're on a certain level because we figured these are the range this is the range of humanity if we go out and meet anybody on the street or even anybody famous I work with Buzz Aldrin these days what we're gonna encounter is another person pretty much like us sorry in Michael Jackson's case he did not fit on this normal plane at all he was on a plane somewhere where you've never seen a human being before so the first time I met him we were at his brother Marlins have pool house it's a little house with just enough room for one big room on the first floor and another big room on the second floor with a little tiny staircase between them and there's a billiard table in the middle of the room and there are arcade games which at that point in particular 1983 we're unattainable no human could afford arcade games unless you were Steve Wynn and you were actually equipping in arcade so we're in the middle that we're in this room and Michael and I are standing next to each other so his elbow is that his left elbow is it my right elbow his left knee is at my right knee and we have a meeting with the art director from CBS I'm condensing the story there's lots more but we're having a meeting with the art director and she walks in with five of the most gorgeous portfolios you've ever seen in your life hand-carved cherry wood hand-carved leather and these are from guys I know because I was I started in pop culture in the art business these were my legendary competitors and and Michael opens the first page of the first portfolio and he gets a square inch into it a postage stamp size piece into it and he goes oh and his knees begin to buckle and he gets another two square inches into it just lifts the page a little bit further oh he lifts it an even further oh Michael is seeing the infinite in the things that even the artist didn't see it with such infinity as Michael is seeing it and by the time he gets to the full page he's having a full scale aesthetic orgasm I have never seen anything like this in my life and remember the first two rules of science are the truth a tiny price including the price of your life and look at things run under right under your nose as if you've never seen them before and then proceed from there Michael is seeing the infinite in the tiniest of things and you've never seen a human with this degree of awe Wonder and surprise anywhere in your life and I will never see another human like that again in my lifetime Michael was beyond belief utterly beyond belief and his commitment to his audience to his the people he called his kids oh god I forgot to turn this off but we have very different perspectives and I said I booked this show it's in six months I need 40 minutes it's gotta be Sai and he's he has told some of my stories in vice before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers and different different stories and so he's how much do you weigh about 156 and you got drunk with sumo wrestle is scary oh it was really it was joyous like it was you've never seen anything yeah you should see it so be Amba do you know who Bianca is he's like okay so if you ever see a sumo on TV that's beyond that so he's the guy like in the Geico commercial skating do I being a figure skater Tiger Woods of sumo wrestling and he is a genius he's a world champion but he's also an entertainer so he lives in Hollywood and he's very very do lives here yeah yeah he is sumo Russell's arias yeah is from Mongolia but he spends a great deal of time here working as a television personality in an actor and whatever but he still just look fat no guy looks jacked like go to that one where he's doing that muscle pose don't worry there yeah yeah see that's like the shoulder muscles through all that fat that guy looks like a tank well people don't realize but underneath there is like you or underneath there is like TJ Dillashaw you know what I mean there is a muscular person underneath all those additional layers of fat and flesh and skin there's a there's a powerful athlete is there a real benefit and being that fat yeah force power generation like momentum the ability I mean if the other guy is that big and our goal is just to smash into each other until one of us has taken from the platform you're not that big it's going to be very difficult right so it's like an arms race of size over generations where they just got bigger and bigger out of necessity because if you're bigger I I mean what am I going to do right go back to the same thing and and tell me what has been the reaction like when you take it like how you feel smaller just like a cup of coffee you really do feel like you do you do feel more energy do you think it's because of the ginseng or is it possible I see but I think they just live within the ginseng and that makes the story sexier for the website that sells see I think just eating the ants themselves give you energy I would imagine that you'd have to catch a lot of ants to get we'd get out of like all the powdered extract that they write they sell you rabbit I mean eating the powdered extract then just that somehow another what's the mechanism for giving you energy there's some chemical that's that's in the ants all right I don't know the mechanism of action again I like I I really don't claim to be an expert in it extract but yet I'm bottle and I'm try haven't I have a bottle of it was using in with all my other supplements and and I was packing up this morning and thought it would be an an interesting one it is just to show to you just a giant bottle that says ant on it what is the what's the standard way that people take it do they I think outer or as a tincture yeah I would imagine you could probably put it in a smoothie you know with your with your bee pollen your other insect derivatives Wow yeah yeah yeah what a weird one huh and this guy when I was young was beating me up in the bus all the time it was ridiculous ridiculous me I had like I did that Spence that you can tie it like this it was like take enough so I was like an underwear and find everybody in front the girl he was beating me up all the time and he was stronger than me was like three four years older than me and he was tall and strong guys are a key player back in the day and yeah we couldn't beat him even when Marshall right he was always stronger than me he hurt me a lot like back in the day so my dad one time I was got beat up in the bus I told him because I came back with a black eye one time in my life I told my dad what happened I never said anything about my dad I say he's a guy in a bus he beat me up I said I tell him the name of the guy so my dad what he did he found out where I'm from countryside so everybody knows who everybody lives he goes to the house you know I can tell the talked the daddy say listen stop can you tell your son to stop hitting my son in the bus because he need to be focused on the school and that dad when my dad came back he said hey I want to talk to his dad he's gonna stop so he said it is that it was like drinking and stuff and it was beating the shit out of his son so the way this guy learned to communicate to his dad was beating up he was drunk and beating him up that's the way a committee was community communicating with me he was beating me up because he learned that the same way from his dad to communicate so I was just happened to be at the right right the wrong time at the right time in his life at the perfect you know I was the guy that was getting beat so he's a good and bad he was not a bad person to my version of life - for my perspective he was a terrible person back then he was terrible I wanted to kill him yet like many made my a my school time miserable man I was a milli ated all the time I was getting beat up a lad I was very proud person so I used to to go fight him all the time because I was proud and one point I found him so many times salad this guy is complaining saying I stop buttering him because that was what's never giving up even though I was beating it getting beat up all the time but to my eye oh my he was a bad person but true is eyes it was a different story and to his father was a different story today everybody it was a different story yeah just to say that when I met him that way we talked about it feels so good just to meet him in the street and make kind of a peace and give him money like yeah you beat me up you didn't but you know what even though you did that I give you the money and I make me feel like I'm kind of a revenge better than a revenge you make me feel like yeah man you see without me you wouldn't have nothing maybe to sleep or eat tonight so I give it to you I still give it to you if you do that to me that make me feel much better than if I would like read them up yeah so you you you end up revaluing those kind of things and that was so that was a really important takeaway for me the other was having an experience of ego dissolution that which can be scary can also be very blissful if it's then followed by emerging with nature or other people and I do think that is the therapeutic agent in these in the people who are healed that our ego does keep us from perceiving certain things and it enforces really destructive stories we tell ourselves like I can't get through this day without a drink yeah I'm unworthy of love you know the voice of self-criticism oh and we get trapped in these loops and especially as we get older and that's one of the reasons I think psychedelics are actually more valuable the older you get because we are creatures of habit and by now we have these mental algorithms that organize our response to everything and sure that's very efficient but it blinds you to experience it blinds you to the everyday wonders and psychedelics you know softens those habits and and helps you get out of those grooves and for me that was really useful and it's only I think it's the experience of ego dissolution that allows you to because your ego enforces those habits and you get a little break there's a bee a metaphor one of the scientists I interviewed in the book a Dutchman working in in Imperial College in London he said thinking your mind is a hill covered in snow and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill and after a while after a lot of thoughts have gone that hill they'll be these grooves and then getting to get deeper and deeper in a certain point you can't go down the hill without slipping into those grooves that's who we are as we're like you know at this age and what psychedelics do he said is is flatten the snow lots of fresh powder and you can then take the sled any way you want to go that's a great way of [Applause]
